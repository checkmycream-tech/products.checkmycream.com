    <li> This is an amazing cream for dry skin prone to wrinkle and chap. LOVE it and use it daily now.</li>
    <li> I COMPLETLY HATE HAVING BOUGHT THIS CREAM&lt;br /&gt;IT CAME OPEN NO PLASTIC WRAP&lt;br /&gt;NO ORIGINAL BOX&lt;br /&gt;AND THE CREAM WHICH I HAVE BEEN UDING FOR YEARS&lt;br /&gt;LOOKS LIKE WATER&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISSAPOINTED</li>
    <li> This is not pure Hydoxatone. I am not going to pay for a chemist to do an analysis, but this product has definitely been watered down. I agree with the other one star reviewer who said &amp;#34;..like water...&amp;#34;  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DISTRIBUTOR if you want the real thing. It came un-boxed and unsealed. My mistake. Never again. RUN!!</li>
    <li> wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using Hydroxatone for years.  I&#x27;m 68 years old and my skin looks like a 30 year olds.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting, does not feel heavy or greasy on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased other name brands thinking I would save money but did not like the feel of the creams on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for buy Hydroxatone!</li>
    <li> I used two jars and saw no improvement  I would not order it again my advice  is try something else</li>
    <li> Love the product! The price and delivery can not be beat!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I feel it is the best.  But recently the cream has changed, which makes it harder to apply.  I personally like the other.</li>
    <li> I purchased the AM/PM Hydroxatone it was OK, it did come sealed and boxed. It was a thick cream and if anything a good sun screen.</li>
    <li> To greasy and that&#x27;s about it. I won&#x27;t buy it again!!! Very disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> wife likes this stuff</li>
    <li> very quick delivery.  great product.  I have tried ALL kinds of deep wrinkle \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  some well known, expensive brands some not...and this product Hydroxatone AM/PM cream is by far the most effective deep wrinkle reducer I have ever used.  my sister even commented that \\&quot;your frown lines(the two parallel vertical lines between eyes, from squinting)  are almost gone!!...what are you doing?\\&quot;  she can keep all of her Name brand products...im sticking with Hydroxatone!!</li>
    <li> It works great very quickly</li>
    <li> This cream makes a big difference. Really helps fine lines. I&#x27;ve used it for over a year. Great item.</li>
    <li> It appears to cause stinging in my eyes, even though I use it  just on my face.  I will try it again,  however at this time I am not sure I would use it on a regular basis</li>
    <li> It seemed to take the dryness out of my skin, but did not really take away the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Skin feels wonderfully soft and clean after use. Not sticky or greasy. And I keep getting compliments left and right about my skin!</li>
    <li> This is NOT HYDROXATONE! This is an faux product containing nothing but sunscreen. The actual packaging, box &amp; jar are close facsimiles but are not the real thing. The product pictured is not what you receive! IF THE PRICE SEEMS TOO GOOD REMEMBER YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</li>
    <li> This is not the same formula as the original Hydroxatone.  The color and texture are different, as well. I am very disappointed .</li>
