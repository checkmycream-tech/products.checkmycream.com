      <li>This item is great, I use it before I straighten my hair and sometimes a little after!  </li>

      <li>then you should really buy this product.</li>
      <li>What this product does is gives your hair more shine withough weighing down your hair.</li>
      <li>but I have a feeling that I may need to spray extra on to help with the static or possibly use an additional product during those months.</li>
      <li>Works great with my flat iron due to having frizzy kinky coarse hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>the way i use it, i section off my hair, spray this product, straighten it, then do that over and over for each section till i am completely done.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a lightweight shine serum that does the job without weighing your hair down, I recommend Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum.</li>
      <li>1 can lasts me a long time because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair silky smooth when you need that little extra finishing touch</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products and practically everything leaves my hair weighed down, greasy, and heavy.</li>

    <li> I am very picky about hair products. It is rare i get to leave a rave review and this is one of those times. This product does not weigh hair down, its savory smell is fantastic, it leaves a beautiful shine and its affordable. 5 stars. Also it has lasted a very long time and i use it often.</li>
    <li> This shine spray is the best for straight or wavy hair. It smells devine. Not sure why they discontinued this in many salons, so happy to have found this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product adds shine to my hair without waying my hair down and making it to oily. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have silver hair and it gives my hair such a beautiful shine, and I love the smell.  I had to go to amazon to get it as I could not find it in any beauty shops.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and I love the shine it gives yor hair with no extra weight or residue. Leaves your hair soft and smelling great!

    <li> Love love love this spray. I couldn&#x27;t find it on the stores, so Amazon to the rescue. Leaves your hair silky smooth when you need that little extra finishing touch</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOOOOOOVE this product. originally, i got it from my hairstylist, though she told me it was a &amp;#34;heat protectant&amp;#34; even though it really isnt. What this product does is gives your hair more shine withough weighing down your hair. If you are like me and have that &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; hair that really isnt curly or wavy, just frizzy, and you straighten it EVERYDAY....then you should really buy this product. the way i use it, i section off my hair, spray this product, straighten it, then do that over and over for each section till i am completely done. Yes it helps make my hair straighten a lot more easily, but it also makes my hair a little greasy feeling doing it this way. so the way you use it is up to you, but thats how i use it and i love it (:</li>
    <li> The best shine spray! Great for curly hair</li>
    <li> I feel the product did not live up to the advertisements.</li>
    <li> Great for adding shine and controlling friz without weighing down hair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair spray shine product, its light and smells terrific but best of all it works great too.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for fine hair. I have tried so many products and practically everything leaves my hair weighed down, greasy, and heavy. This one truly is lightweight and leaves my fine hair light, full, and bouncy. I am very picky and find that most products just don&#x27;t work how I want them to... but this one does! I hardly ever give a product 5 stars but this one deserves it. It smells GREAT, too! My stylist told me to use this AFTER I flat iron my hair. So I start with Redken Extreme Iron Repair (discontinued - try eBay for best price) in my towel-dried hair, and then I blow dry. I then flat iron my hair as is, with no additional product. I used to use Matrix Sleek.look Flat Iron Spray but I found that it was too heavy and left my hair greasy. I spray Your Highness Weightless Shine Spray all over once I&#x27;m done. The last time I did my hair I sprayed each section after I flat ironed it. I haven&#x27;t used this in winter yet but I have a feeling that I may need to spray extra on to help with the static or possibly use an additional product during those months.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SPRAY !  IT MAKES MY HAIR SHINE AND IS EXCELLENT FOR FRIZZ CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;IT ALSO HAS A WONDERFUL, CLEAN  FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome on my curly/frizzy hair. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing.  Smooth&#x27;s down the fly always without weighing down your hair with a greasy film.  Its very hard to find this at my salon anymore so I was extremely happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a can of this to try and I fell in love with it. 1 can lasts me a long time because you don&#x27;t need much. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived just as described.</li>
    <li> I liked the camera ready better.  I think this is similar but in an aerosol which I do not like because I don&#x27;t like inhaling the aerosol.  Also I think you get less product than with the Camera Ready.  Too bad they took it off the market, they never said why.  I guess they weren&#x27;t making enough money from it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s light weight and so shiny. This spray is now part of my daily hair styling routine (perfect finishing touch) and it doesn&#x27;t take much to work fantastic. This will not create the grease head look either. Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> Very light with wonderful sexy fragrance and beautiful shine</li>
    <li> I totally love this product.</li>
    <li> Works great with my flat iron due to having frizzy kinky coarse hair.  Smells awesome like cotton candy.</li>
    <li> I loooove this shine spray..works great and smells great as well with no greasy feel or look!!! Catwalk is the best of the best.</li>
    <li> This product weighed my hair down and did not make it shiny at all.  It does smell great however.  One piece of advice... Do not touch your hair after application because it will make it look greasy.  If you are looking for a lightweight shine serum that does the job without weighing your hair down, I recommend Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile and it keeps my curly hair neat under control with a nice shine.</li>
