### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not for every type of hair, but excellent for mine!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Husband loves it, price is great at Amazon and the convenience of not having to go to a hair salon that sells Redken is priceless</li>
      <li>This is a great hair tool.</li>
      <li>i am a senior with a great spikey hairdo&lt;</li>
      <li>Good price for 3.Have used for 4 years.</li>
      <li>Set w/your favorite spray &amp; go!</li>
      <li>great product - very fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I have not seen many hairproducts like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyone can have stylish, textured hair now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.</li>
      <li>This stuff is like magic.</li>
      <li>i love the way it holds my hair in place without being a &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It works wonderful for the short sassy look I was trying to achieve.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The best for short spikey hair</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a couple years and love it.</li>
      <li>She loves it and has not found anything that works better for her mild hold needs.</li>
      <li>important - it washes off in one go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and  was excited by the price, but each of the containers I&#x27;ve opened had some hardened paste at the tip that it took me a couple days to work through (including needing to manually push the product out from the bottom).  </li>
      <li>Wife religiously uses this for a nice hold and no nasty tacky fingers or residues afterwards.</li>
      <li>so YAY thanks :)</li>
      <li>And what&#x27;s more, is that is smells great, and in a subtle way - not an overpowering way.</li>
      <li>Never fails me.</li>
      <li>It makes my short hair look fuller, more stylish and holds all day long.</li>
      <li>but I like the grey better.</li>
      <li>I love the grey one</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is the only paste that i have found that is light weight, non sticky and &amp;#34;does the job&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It smells good - at least in my opinion&lt;</li>
      <li>- but I think it&#x27;s all worth it because you only need a dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And, even now that I&#x27;ve made it through the hardened bits, the scent is a bit off suggesting to me that it&#x27;s just old.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several years now and it holds my straight hair in any way I want to scrunch it.</li>
      <li>As a last resort, I turned it upside down and realized the tube could be pushed upward so the paste came out easily.</li>
      <li>I ordered the 3pack, the material inside the bottle is old and smells strange!!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it. It came in a different packaging, but still seems to be the same high-quality product. I put it all through my hair while it&#x27;s wet out of the shower, then dry and style it.</li>
    <li> This product is reliable and one tube of paste lasts a long time because just a little is sufficient.</li>
    <li> It works wonderful for the short sassy look I was trying to achieve.  This product holds it all in place and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Not for every type of hair, but excellent for mine! I&#x27;ve used nothing but this product for years and am hooked.</li>
    <li> i am a senior with a great spikey hairdo&lt;br /&gt;this is the only paste that i have found that is light weight, non sticky and &amp;#34;does the job&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and  was excited by the price, but each of the containers I&#x27;ve opened had some hardened paste at the tip that it took me a couple days to work through (including needing to manually push the product out from the bottom).  And, even now that I&#x27;ve made it through the hardened bits, the scent is a bit off suggesting to me that it&#x27;s just old.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive in the store and is the ONLY stuff that works for me so YAY thanks :)</li>
    <li> I would be lost without this product. i love the way it holds my hair in place without being a &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it, price is great at Amazon and the convenience of not having to go to a hair salon that sells Redken is priceless</li>
    <li> I ordered the grey bottle and got black. It might be my imagination but I like the grey better. I love the grey one so it is probably a distributor mess-up</li>
    <li> arrived intact and wrapped well. Good price for 3.Have used for 4 years. makes a short haircut look sassy.</li>
    <li> The best for short spikey hair</li>
    <li> Ever since I have been introduced to this product by my hairdresser, I have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It molds your hair but doesn&#x27;t make it hard&lt;br /&gt;It smells good - at least in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy - I have used at on of hair products, some say they&#x27;re not greasy but when you touch your hair, it leaves a sticky residue. This does not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s matte - if you like the &amp;#34;guido&amp;#34; look you may not want this&lt;br /&gt;Most important - it washes off in one go. I have not seen many hairproducts like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price - but I think it&#x27;s all worth it because you only need a dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS My hair is very thick and a dime sized amount is enough.</li>
    <li> great product - very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Wife religiously uses this for a nice hold and no nasty tacky fingers or residues afterwards. She loves it and has not found anything that works better for her mild hold needs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic. Put a pump or 2 in your palm &amp; fingertips. Rub until you feel some resistance, &amp; apply to your hair, working from roots out. Put it where you need volume &amp; texture. Keep working it until you get the desired affect. Set w/your favorite spray &amp; go! Anyone can have stylish, textured hair now.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple years and love it. I have tried other products but none compare to this one. It makes my short hair look fuller, more stylish and holds all day long. Great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3pack, the material inside the bottle is old and smells strange!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Keeps hair texturizing all day.</li>
    <li> I panicked (read ticked off) when I couldn&#x27;t get the past to come out of the dispenser. As a last resort, I turned it upside down and realized the tube could be pushed upward so the paste came out easily. This is a great hair tool. I&#x27;ve used it for several years now and it holds my straight hair in any way I want to scrunch it.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Never fails me. And what&#x27;s more, is that is smells great, and in a subtle way - not an overpowering way.</li>
