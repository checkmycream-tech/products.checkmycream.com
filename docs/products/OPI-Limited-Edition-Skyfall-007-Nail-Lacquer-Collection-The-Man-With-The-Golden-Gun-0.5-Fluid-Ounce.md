      <li>The color is great and can be worn on it&#x27;s own or as an overlay.</li>
      <li>It arrived to my place really quickly and the package was perfect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still super happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>You can put a darker color on under this top coat and the gold flecks add that perfect effect that make people say, \\&quot;I love your nails.\\</li>
      <li>UNLESS YOU LIKE GRAB BAGS FOR TOP DOLLAR!</li>
      <li>I loved this top coat.</li>
      <li>More like specks of gold than good coverage.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>have to put too many coats on it to make it show up</li>
      <li>Most of O.P.I. nail polish bottles represent the product (color) inside, this was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
      <li>I love the speckled effect it has because it doesn&#x27;t overdo the gold on your nails.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I had to use 3 coats as a top coat and still could have used more specks on my nails.</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments over it.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for this for quite some time; so glad to have found it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>, I just want to say that this is a beautiful product and people was only looking at the packaging and say oh instead of investigating</li>
      <li>Still, for what it is, the effect is pretty cool, and how often will you be able to say that you have 18K gold fingernails?!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m VERY happy with my little indulgence.</li>
      <li>I of course wanted it to come faster because I was so excited to use it</li>
      <li>I was excited about this product when I heard it was being introduced.  </li>
      <li>If you need a small splurge this polish is a great one !</li>
      <li>know most polishes aren&#x27;t really the color of the packaging but a bit off</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this 18 caret gold top coat and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>: People noticed my nails more often than normal.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty but overpriced.</li>
      <li>Looks great over dark polishes !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
      <li>The product is as stated - a clear top coat - it just has 18k gold leaf flakes in it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;NOT WORTH $50 at all&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
      <li>Pretty cool.</li>
      <li>You can get a much better look with many other &amp;#34;non 18K gold&amp;#34; polishes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;O.P.I. has really misrepresented its product with unclear labeling and super misleading bottle wrapping.</li>
      <li>this product doesn&#x27;t really even look as good as other gold glittered polishes</li>
      <li>She must have put at least 5 coats in a minute because it looked great.  </li>
      <li>Really?!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
      <li>in a different way from most glittery polishes.</li>
      <li>I bought my bottle for $39.99 (shipped) from a different source as I was intrigued by this 18k Gold top coat.</li>
      <li>The Gold is richer and more obvious looking.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Is it really $44 on here?</li>
      <li>In fairness, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have purchased this polish, because gold splatter paint really doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>It is a pretty top coat but its not worth $55!</li>
      <li>I applied OPI Nail Strengthener, 2 coats of OPI black and then 2 coats of this Gold Flake top coat.</li>
      <li>only thing is that you have to apply several layers to get more gold chips, but as the polish is clear, it doesn&#x27;t matter much.</li>
      <li>But if that&#x27;s the effect you&#x27;re going for, you will love this 18K gold leaf topcoat, which has flecks of real gold mixed into it, making it the most luxurious and ridiculous item I have ever owned (disposable gold nail polish!).</li>
      <li>this product kind of sucks....</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s because the Gold Flakes are so crisp looking especially against the Black Polish that it just stands out more than the Glitter or the Crackle would.</li>
      <li>I understand the limited edition philosophy, but no person in their right mind would pay that price!</li>
      <li>and you would see how it look a bit off to determine if you like it or not, clearly most didn&#x27;t do that and got too excited and just purchased and complain, if you do the right thing</li>
      <li>description of the product should be: Clear top coat with few speckles of gold leaf flakes in the mix.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although I own it and it&#x27;s pretty, I bought it last year, less than half the cost.</li>
      <li>39 bucks does seem extreme for a little bottle of polish but it is worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>The effect is sort of a splatter paint/crackle look, and you need to apply multiple coats in order to get decent gold coverage.</li>
      <li>Firstly this is NOT straight gold polish like it looks on the bottle.</li>
      <li>course the product is not returnable once opened, and since this was a limited production the price was exorbitant for what it really turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
      <li>a little bit pricey but well worth it.</li>
      <li>First of all who pays $49 for nail polish, I mean really?  </li>
      <li>I put it over black and they look pretty awesomeeee.</li>
      <li>, if you want to overpay for just a clear top coat with random tiny pieces of gold (can&#x27;t even tell that it is gold, might as well be sparkles), then this is the nail polish for you, if you thought this was a solid gold metallic nail polish of gold, then this is NOT the product you&#x27;ll get!</li>

<li> INSANE!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this as a gift for my wife. I was getting her the other opi James Bond polishes . I was very happy with the presentation and the quality . a little bit pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this when it came out. It&#x27;s so pretty. You have to do the \\&quot;dab and push\\&quot; method of application which means you load up your brush and dab the polish on and then move it around to place the flakies on the nail. The bottle color makes it hard to see how much product is left but I understand the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a solid gold polish it is real gold flakes in a clear base.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, looks good and its gold!</li>
    <li> You would actually have to put maybe 5 or 6 coats of this stuff to be visable.  I asked my hairstylest about this when I was there last.  She left for about 5 minutes and came back and showed me what it would look like on her nail. She must have put at least 5 coats in a minute because it looked great.  I went home and did my nails.  After putting on nail polish, I put 1 coat of the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; on.  What a joke!!!!!  1-3 teeny tiny flecks per nail!!!!  Not only would I not recomend this crap but now my hairstylist will have to explain herself!!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this for quite some time; so glad to have found it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that you have to apply several layers to get more gold chips, but as the polish is clear, it doesn&#x27;t matter much. It looks great!</li>
    <li> Really?! $75?! Stop sniffing the polish! Although I own it and it&#x27;s pretty, I bought it last year, less than half the cost. I understand the limited edition philosophy, but no person in their right mind would pay that price! INSANE!</li>
    <li> I wish this review would show up but I would have to pay but it&#x27;s way too overpriced, I just want to say that this is a beautiful product and people was only looking at the packaging and say oh instead of investigating know most polishes aren&#x27;t really the color of the packaging but a bit off and you would see how it look a bit off to determine if you like it or not, clearly most didn&#x27;t do that and got too excited and just purchased and complain, if you do the right thing then you would have known that it was just the flakes</li>
    <li> I loved this top coat. i&#x27;ve been wearing it since I got it and it looks gorgeous! It arrived to my place really quickly and the package was perfect. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> this product kind of sucks.... you have to take extra glitter off the wand in order to have a lot of glitter.</li>
    <li> I work at cosmoprof bought this for 12 dollars! It is a pretty top coat but its not worth $55!</li>
    <li> The product is not worth it&#x27;s price!&lt;br /&gt;True description of the product should be: Clear top coat with few speckles of gold leaf flakes in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;O.P.I. has really misrepresented its product with unclear labeling and super misleading bottle wrapping. Most of O.P.I. nail polish bottles represent the product (color) inside, this was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;Of course the product is not returnable once opened, and since this was a limited production the price was exorbitant for what it really turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to overpay for just a clear top coat with random tiny pieces of gold (can&#x27;t even tell that it is gold, might as well be sparkles), then this is the nail polish for you, if you thought this was a solid gold metallic nail polish of gold, then this is NOT the product you&#x27;ll get!</li>

Still, for what it is, the effect is pretty cool, and how often will you be able to say that you have 18K gold fingernails?! Pretty cool.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product when I heard it was being introduced.  However, it is totally over-rated and over-priced.  Save your money.  It is not worth it.  You can get a much better look with many other &amp;#34;non 18K gold&amp;#34; polishes.  I was very disappointed with this OPI product and generally I am a big OPI fan.</li>
    <li> Great Great color. This is a perfect must-have pairing to go with the Skyfall collection. The color is great and can be worn on it&#x27;s own or as an overlay. Great product.</li>
    <li> Firstly this is NOT straight gold polish like it looks on the bottle. The product is as stated - a clear top coat - it just has 18k gold leaf flakes in it. Its like painting Goldshlagger on your nails! Very pretty. I put it over black and they look pretty awesomeeee. Of course you&#x27;ll need to do a few coats to build up. I couldnt pass it up! Go to Ulta for this for $10 off.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this polish but I&#x27;m glad I did. Great packaging and it livens up  any color you may already have in your collection. If you need a small splurge this polish is a great one !Looks great over dark polishes !</li>
    <li> Is it really $44 on here? I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and it&#x27;s $15 at CosmoProf. Given that&#x27;s not a store that&#x27;s open to the public and it&#x27;s entitled to a markup when sold in the salon but this is just crazy! 5 stars for the polish though, it looks awesome!</li>
    <li> i loved it! It was exactly what I wanted. I of course wanted it to come faster because I was so excited to use it but besides that it was great!</li>
    <li> I had to order this polish as I was intrigued by the 18K flakes. I had to use 3 coats as a top coat and still could have used more specks on my nails. This is smilar to other reviews, so I was not surprised. It is very pretty but overpriced. Wholesale cost is $15 and retail is $30...but it is very difficult to find, hence this supplier can charge more than retail.</li>
    <li> More like specks of gold than good coverage.</li>
    <li> I purchased A whopping $49 bottle of OPI polish from them, but it was not gold only gold sparkles.  It was nothing like it appeared online, so while remaining unopened and still in the package I requested a return.  After waiting forever for a return response this was what they did:  they closed the request stating they were not responsible if I didn&#x27;t like it, that they can&#x27;t take back hair products, that they were not a company that lets people &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; things out, and that they were only filling orders not directly responsible...  First of all who pays $49 for nail polish, I mean really?  Then they send the wrong thing and say it&#x27;s not their fault you don&#x27;t like it.  Had it been what I&#x27;ve been searching for and know it&#x27;s out there somewhere, I&#x27;d have paid more, but to have been treated so rudely was crazy.  DON&#x27;T SHOP WITH THESE PEOPLE UNLESS YOU LIKE GRAB BAGS FOR TOP DOLLAR!</li>
    <li> 39 bucks does seem extreme for a little bottle of polish but it is worth every penny!!! I have gotten so many compliments over it. It is the perfect finish to any color!!! Love it</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this 18 caret gold top coat and was not disappointed. I love the speckled effect it has because it doesn&#x27;t overdo the gold on your nails. You can put a darker color on under this top coat and the gold flecks add that perfect effect that make people say, \\&quot;I love your nails.\\&quot; I got a lot of compliments on this product. It&#x27;s well worth the money you spend.&lt;br /&gt;-Gina</li>
    <li> IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL TOP COAT IS MARVELOUS I AM SO HAPPY TO RESPECT. MY BEAUTICIAN IS VERY GOOD FOR THAT TOP COAT.</li>
    <li> Turns out to be so nice! But the gold flakes are a bit sparse so need to apply several times</li>
    <li> I bought my bottle for $39.99 (shipped) from a different source as I was intrigued by this 18k Gold top coat. I applied OPI Nail Strengthener, 2 coats of OPI black and then 2 coats of this Gold Flake top coat. I&#x27;m very impressed by the look, it&#x27;s catchy and it&#x27;s flashy but in a different way from most glittery polishes. The Gold is richer and more obvious looking. I&#x27;ve been buying OPI for awhile now and I&#x27;m VERY happy with my little indulgence. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/19/13 Update: People noticed my nails more often than normal. I think it&#x27;s because the Gold Flakes are so crisp looking especially against the Black Polish that it just stands out more than the Glitter or the Crackle would. I&#x27;m still super happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t really even look as good as other gold glittered polishes&lt;br /&gt;that have been shiny and bright&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH $50 at all&lt;br /&gt;you have to put too many coats on it to make it show up</li>
