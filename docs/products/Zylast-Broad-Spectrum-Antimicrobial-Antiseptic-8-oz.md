### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best hand sanitizer on the market!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product!!!</li>
      <li>I bought 2 bottles for each bathroom on the boat, and it was nice to have!</li>
      <li>This is handy stuff to have!  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for a year and its good stuff.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>s.very nice product&lt;</li>
      <li>I like how it is effective for up to 6 hours.</li>
      <li>it is OK, nothing to write home about.</li>
      <li>I used it on a houseboat trip, and it was fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I do a lot of cruising and can always use more protection.</li>
      <li>Feels nicer than purell and supposedly kills norovirus, which most sanitizers do not.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but I love it for how it feels.</li>
      <li>Why can&#x27;t I find more of the hand sanitizer?</li>
      <li>It also protects your hands for up to 6 hours - this is the main reason we started using Zylast, and I am very very pleased with it!</li>
      <li>Hands down the best hand sanitizer out there - it protects against norovirus, which most hand sanitizers do not.</li>
      <li>It was shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>Great product - kills viruses and bacteria (most alcohol sanitizers only kill bacteria), so helps against the flu, colds, stomach flu, and others.  </li>
      <li>I would trust it before Purell, etc, for killing norovirus because it has more alcohol in it, but I have found I much prefer the Clorox hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>quick service</li>
      <li>Also love the Antiseptic Lotion, which is similar but not alcohol-based.</li>
      <li>Feels a bit slimy at first, but air dries rapidly.</li>
      <li>but I do believe, after research, that it is better than glycerine containing hand sanitizers that are found in local stores.</li>
      <li>I am aware of.</li>
      <li>Kept my kids stomach bug free for an entire year so far....knock on wood</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Zylast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra cash people....</li>
      <li>Also...has been proven effective in at least one petri dish test</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>Lasts much longer than the same size bottle of Purell, I&#x27;ve been using this one for months.  </li>
      <li>It is more gel-like than normal hand sanitizers, plus a little goes further, so a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It really has cut down on all the germs.</li>

    <li> I always have this on hand after getting the Norivirus a couple years ago. Aweful but short illness. Not sure if this product will always protect us but I do believe, after research, that it is better than glycerine containing hand sanitizers that are found in local stores.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! ! Kept my kids stomach bug free for an entire year so far....knock on wood</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!! Why can&#x27;t I find more of the hand sanitizer? Is Zylast going out of business? That would be a shame!</li>
    <li> Love it! Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> We take it with us on every cruise… We never get sick!</li>
    <li> quick service and hopefully will protect as described.  I do a lot of cruising and can always use more protection.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It was shipped very quickly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Zylast dries your skin as all government holy waters do.have not had any other issues. it is OK, nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I buy it because it kills norovirus.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Feels nicer than purell and supposedly kills norovirus, which most sanitizers do not.  I will buy it again.  I keep the smaller travel bottle and refill it with this larger one.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. I got it because it was listed as a sanitizer that kills norovirus. It might, but I also read that gels tend to harbor said virus - and this is a gel. Soo, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product. I would trust it before Purell, etc, for killing norovirus because it has more alcohol in it, but I have found I much prefer the Clorox hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> I contacted over a week ago that one leaked. No response at all.</li>
    <li> I buy it for its residual properties but I love it for how it feels. It is more gel-like than normal hand sanitizers, plus a little goes further, so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I buy this brand because it kills 100 percent of germs on contact. I bought it for friends as well.</li>
    <li> Using for traveling.  We cruise and need sanatizing product s.very nice product&lt;br /&gt;  Will order again.  Thank you for providing this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best hand sanitizer out there - it protects against norovirus, which most hand sanitizers do not. It also protects your hands for up to 6 hours - this is the main reason we started using Zylast, and I am very very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Zylast. I have been using it for a year and its good stuff. I like how it is effective for up to 6 hours. I give the kids a squirt before school then another as soon as they get home. It really has cut down on all the germs.</li>
    <li> This is handy stuff to have!  I used it on a houseboat trip, and it was fantastic!  I bought 2 bottles for each bathroom on the boat, and it was nice to have!</li>

Lasts much longer than the same size bottle of Purell, I&#x27;ve been using this one for months.  Also love the Antiseptic Lotion, which is similar but not alcohol-based.</li>
    <li> Supposedly kills norovirus germs. Also...has been proven effective in at least one petri dish test I am aware of. Feels a bit slimy at first, but air dries rapidly. Here&#x27;s a photo from a site that tested various hand sanitizers.    https://cd27463c-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/stopthestomachflu/Home/what-do-hand-washing-and-hand-sanitizers-really-do/IMG_2793.jpg.1379012038590.jpg?attachauth&#x3D;ANoY7cpCuAZlnmCsxYPnsMc9OZ4vC9MQdKWDLRZ71HPn2EvPn5qbhiE_2PAC_mYZFwJ9TMj2J2RJdZL4SSCYzNLnBZiydy8WDx9SsfP8DGleXPobuV3JknNf00cOoMT3zqLNWPesc5YrXNaCj_yD5HK8o_1vI1VvMW6TP1YfP98sEGlfxbJo8L4YNo80veYHYGC3398MHsBMJJ3kw5zM6rUlb_YTKkmMOWP29N5zRGb3iMHj8mXfhndYtksdyWDeXpSes1r4CDVsVPJABQ3GPkCrRBnynUfZKZ2ebq4HVFYWZRPV8_rMx-rdSe93IySvOmOn02PwpwNq&amp;attredirects&#x3D;0    And here&#x27;s a link to the tests:    http://www.stopthestomachflu.com/Home/what-do-hand-washing-and-hand-sanitizers-really-do</li>
    <li> Best hand sanitizer on the market! Kills norovirus (stomach bug) and is supposed to keep working for 6 HOURS after application!!!! Plus it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out!!!! It&#x27;s worth the extra cash people.... TRY IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just started using this stuff for my family - especially my son in preschool. Used it before and after school, but even with that  I&#x27;m sitting with my poor little guy who has been getting sick for the last three hours.</li>
