<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used Oral B power toothbrushes for many years and highly recommend them. The cost of replacement brushheads is absurdly high but Amazon offers the best deal</li>
    <li> I use the brushes every day (one at a time).  Very good cleaning!  Just like they say clean as the dentist does.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for years.  Seems like the smaller round brushes work the best.  There&#x27;s all kinds of fancy alien looking types of brush heads out there and I tried many, and now will remain purchasing these, they definitely work the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great price, product is as described, the real deal.  Do the subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t have to remember when to change them.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not quite the quality of the full price replacements I bough at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
    <li> this product is good but way over the top on the price. you can get the gerneric ones for 3 times less the price an just as good of a product if not better. i suggest you shop around.</li>
    <li> Have used the store brands of replacement heads but they just can&#x27;t compare to the brand name,  will continue to just use Oral B brand.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I have only used one of these brushes for a few weeks. It seems to be doing an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Love these brush heads.  My daughter and I are very happy with how well these function.  I&#x27;ll continue buying these even after my braces come off.</li>
    <li> It works well and I have no complaints. It works well with my electric toothbrush and my teeth feel clean when I finish.</li>
    <li> I have been using these since I bought them.  I am very happy with these snap on brushes.  They work perfectly with my Oral-B electric precision system.  I hope to find them again when I finish using up these brushes.</li>
    <li> It had been a while since I had replace the brush heads on my Oral-B. These have a little extra bristle on the sides that do a great job at cleaning the algae that sometimes collects between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Genuine Braun brushes - but at way less than you&#x27;d pay in the stores. It&#x27;s a no brainer really...save yourself some cash</li>
    <li> These are perfect. They seem to be genuine and if not, they are as good as genuine. Cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a good one to choose for a child as a child is only supposed to use a pea size amount of toothpaste and that is all that fits on the bristles, so this issue is mistake-proofed.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are the perfect complement for the Oral-B Professional 3000 toothbrush.  Since my husband and I both use the toothbrush, we need extra brush heads for home and for travel.  These are GREAT!</li>
    <li> These are just as advertised at a fair price. The packaging is not fancy, but who wants to pay for that anyway.  They are individual packages tossed in brown cardboard box, which actually makes them easier to open and you only need to open the package when you are ready to get a new brush.  Unlike the multi-packs where you open the package and have to be careful not to damage the package to the point that the other brush heads are falling out.</li>
    <li> I find the replacement brushes okay but they just don&#x27;t clean as well as I thought they would, they are okay for the price.</li>
    <li> Have a very old toothbrush that is getting difficult to find replacement heads for at a decent price. This does it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Oral-B toothbrush heads and these are my second favorite. The Precision Clean heads give your teeth a deep cleaning, but those with sensitive teeth might find them a little uncomfortable. Compared to the Floss Action heads, these have a distinctly firmer feel but are more durable. For my preferences, the Precision Clean trumps the Floss Action. Those that want a bigger and more traditional toothbrush shape should opt for the Dual Clean heads. They don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;dentist tool\\&quot; feel, but instead are shaped like a traditional toothbrush heads. As for the Pro White heads, I didn&#x27;t like the feel at all and don&#x27;t believe the rubber nob helps with whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course your personal preferences mean everything. As for mine I would rank the various heads like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Dual Clean -- Traditional shape, allows for more toothpaste, two types of cleaning action&lt;br /&gt;2) Precision Clean -- Firm feel, durable heads&lt;br /&gt;3) Floss Action -- More sensitive feel, but also less durable&lt;br /&gt;4) Pro White -- Harshest feel of the four, polishing effect is dubious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what characteristics you&#x27;re looking for, the Precision Clean heads could be what you&#x27;re looking for. They&#x27;re very good, offering a strong combination of cleaning ability and durability, but with a slightly firmer feel than the Floss Action heads.</li>
    <li> I like these replacement brush heads.  They do a good job, and fit perfectly [[ASIN:B008PEMR0O Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a type of the brush head that you use to brush each tooth separately.  The small size allows for easy reach to teeth in the back of the mouth.  However, my preferred Oral B brush head is [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]].</li>
    <li> These replacement heads were shipped on time and I must say they are one of the best value for money replacement heads for the Oral B Professional Care electric toothbrush which I bought from Amazon. Using these brushes leave your mouth with that clean fresh feeling as though you just stepped out of the dentist&#x27;s office in comparison to the other replacement heads out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are gentler on your gums and also get in between those hard to reach places of your mouth when compared to other brush heads which are too big to deliver the effectiveness as this. It is definitely a recommended buy and will probably be the only replacement head I will be buying from now.</li>
    <li> I really like the shape of this brush. I have a smaller mouth and the small, round brush can get to the back of my mouth better than a traditional brush.</li>
    <li> The four pack is a good way to buy Oral-B brush heads. It&#x27;s more economical and, if you have them on auto-ship, you&#x27;ll always have a new brush head ready to go.</li>
    <li> Even though this model is getting harder and harder to find I will only buy the Oral-B replacement heads from now on.  For a while I was getting the generic store brand versions and they just never fit properly.  They would fall off in mid-brush! These actually stay on they way they are supposed to.  They cost a lot more, but they work.</li>
    <li> I use my electric toothbrush every day and change my brush heads every couple months and find it less expensive to order them from Amazon.  The ordering transaction is easy and within a few days I receive them.  They are a good quality product for the money and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used these daily for several years.  I credit them for the good checkups from my Dentist for the last two years.</li>
    <li> better than the standard replacements you get from the store.  These last longer and definitely worth the extra few dollars!</li>
    <li> Oral B works great!  It is the only thing I like to use.  You get a better deal buying them here.</li>
    <li> What can I say except my hygienist tells me my teeth look like they don&#x27;t need cleaning every time .  I love my brushes.</li>
    <li> My gums are sensitive and I was concerned about using an electronic toothbrush but my dentist advised that this would be find as long as I didn&#x27;t put pressure on my teeth.  You don&#x27;t need to apply pressure to achieve clean teeth.  Follow the instructions and brush for two minutes total (30 seconds for each quadrant) and you&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads!</li>
    <li> The whole concept of the Oral B is fantastic we haven using it more than a decade and our dentist keeps complimenting us on our clean teeth!</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Triumph electric toothbrush is great beyond excellent.  The &amp;#34;Precision Clean&amp;#34; brush head is what I use for daily use.  It has a good balance between &amp;#34;just right stiff&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft.&amp;#34;  I can get close, and over the gums without irritation.</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this type brush for me but I prefer the larger, longer brush. Probably a personal preference, however just wanted to mention it.</li>
    <li> These work great on our Oral B electric toothbrush! Just what we needed. Will be ordering them again when we need replacements.</li>
    <li> I use these brush heads on a Oral-B electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;They did fit and do  a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...perfect</li>
    <li> These brushes work very well with my Oral-B.  I have purchased off brands for less before but they do not last as long and fit as well as these do.</li>
    <li> We didn&#x27;t want to buy whole new toothbrushes, but weren&#x27;t sure these would work with our brushes. However, they were a perfect fit and we are happy with them.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are very easy to use and very nice, but the price is too expensive compare to other brands.</li>
    <li> A rating? It&#x27;s a replacement part. I had to have it at a decent price so I bought it, they shipped it, it fits.</li>
    <li> I have used these replacement brushes for several years now.  Great for maintenance of my oral hygiene and cleaning of implants, caps and gum health.</li>
    <li> Needed more headed, good price, heads are NOT knockoffs!  Good quality, it&#x27;s your teeth, get the best for them and smile...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years with great results.  It was  good to be able to find a four pack at such a good price.</li>
    <li> Fits nicely under a cabinet.  Good sound and the remote is very handy.  I would buy it again and recomended it.</li>
    <li> Good value for this product.  Tried to buy in a discount department store, but they only sold them in packages of 12.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money at one time for these.</li>
    <li> Excellent Brush for my Oral-B.  Fits. Does the job.  And it&#x27;s ridiculous that Amazon.com makes me continue writing this review.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t to replace the brush heads yet but can&#x27;t imagine any problems with them only continued good clean feeling cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> I buy toothbrush heads for family members as stocking stuffers every year. Obviously oral hygiene is a Christmas gift in our house.</li>
    <li> My dad taught me to use an electric toothbrush because it&#x27;s what dentists use. I started trying it, and true enough - I feel my teeth are less rough each time I use Oral-B Precision Clean electric toothbrush. Each time I visit my dentist, they always tell me there&#x27;s not much plaque to remove, I give this electric toothbrush the credit. It gives pulses after about a number of minutes to let you know that you have reached amount of time needed to brush your teeth. This is good so you won&#x27;t brush your teeth too fast or too long. I only charge it once a week, so it&#x27;s not expensive on electricity.</li>
    <li> Good value, great performance</li>
    <li> Works like it should what can I say more.</li>
    <li> Love Love Oral-B, have been using it for a very long time - the brush heads are generally very expensive but the Amazon price was very reasonable AND as always, saved me that dreaded trip to buy them when they could be shipped to my door. They stick right on top of my Oral B base and I generally use them a month or so before discarding - sometimes less. I think the brush holds itself well for a reasonable time. This particular head is my favorite. I have tried others and haven&#x27;t liked the feel in my mouth. Will definitely repurchase a next batch when I am out. Awesome work Oral-B!</li>
    <li> I think anyone who have branched out and tried the big box store brands know that the original Oral-B replacement heads last a fair bit longer but it is like 20% more expensive at list price. This is mostly because the bristles are somewhat higher quality. However, once we factor the manufacturer&#x27;s coupon into the equation, it&#x27;s not clear that the store brand is really any cheaper. As of this writing, Amazon&#x27;s price is similar to the list price at the local store. In this regard, I think the optimal strategy is pretty clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the packaging Amazon used to send these four replacement heads to me is pretty frustrating. The whole thing come in a padded envelop, and inside is a small box that contains the four heads in their individual packaging. That means it actually uses more packaging than if I get it at a local store (which will use a piece of cardboard and some plastic to contain the four replacement heads). Frankly, they may as well just send the four individually packaged heads in a lightly-padded envelop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still giving this product five stars since these are of the highest quality you can get. What holds me back from buying it from Amazon is the way you get it and the fact that the current price is not competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I get this through the generous Amazon Vine program.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are perfect, the same as the original. They brush the teeth and gums very well, much better than a manual brush. I tried generic replacement brushes but those are not the same. They wobble, shake, and sometimes fly off while in use.  I will now stick with the genuine brushes!</li>
    <li> My family has been using various models of the Oral-B electric brush for many years. It has never disappointed us with its reliable and effective cleaning of the teeth and gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These set of replacement brush heads fits our existing Oral-B tooth brushes very well. The price from amazon is also quite reasonable as compared to the similar products found in local stores. Keep in mind that these brush heads are also quite durable and would last up to 3 months of use. The indicatora bristles also work well to remind when the brush heads would need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These work fine on my Oral B Professional model toothbrush.  I had used floss action brushes, but these seem to clean my teeth just as well and feel more comfortable. There are no intricate parts, just a high quality brush. This brush also seems to clean a slightly larger surface area.  I am very glad I decided to try these. It is probably good to alternate between brush heads every so often.</li>
    <li> While these brush heads are not my favorites to use with my [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]], they still do a great job. (For the record, my favorite brush heads are the [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]. I usually rotate the brush heads I use just to change things up a bit. I don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference, but I feel like using different heads from time to time is a good idea. In any case, these brush heads are great.</li>
    <li> These brush heads provides precision cleaning exactly as their name suggest. I have been using them since last 3 years and can&#x27;t move on to anything else. Being a small brush head it has a very good reach inside the mouth and on the inner side of teeth, especially the lower end corners which tend to accumulate most food particles. They fit [[ASIN:B003UKKH6O Oral-B Vitality Pro White Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] and have a very good life. These are better than [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] since Dual Clean can&#x27;t reach to the inner side of teeth due to their weird shape and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Tried these heads instead of the self flossing ones.  They work just as great.  Would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
    <li> I have been putting off buying power tooth brush that my dentist recommended for me. After weeks of reading reviews and made this one a #1 pick.</li>
    <li> These replace the original brush heads. they are a match for the original and work quite well. I will probably buy more soon.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of the Oral B toothbrush, and my dentist is always impressed with the lack of plaque on my teeth.  I use the Floss Action head, and although I have no complaints, I am unsure if this is really the best choice. \\&quot;The FlossAction brush head has MicroPulse Bristles that penetrate deep between teeth to sweep away plaque.\\&quot;  However, the precision Clean brush heads have \\&quot;long interdental tips on the edges clean deep between teeth and below the gum line\\&quot; and are supposed to \\&quot;provide up to 5x better cleaning at the gumline.\\&quot;  Which will clean my teeth better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment:&lt;br /&gt;I bought a package of Precision Clean so that I could compare the cleaning effects of these 2 brush types on my teeth.  For comparison I am using a new Floss Action brush on the left side of my mouth for 60 seconds and a new Precision Clean on the right for 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I immediately noticed that the Precision clean is much gentler on my teeth and gums, but I have now been using both brushes for about one week and I don&#x27;t see any difference in the cleaning ability.  I will continue to compare the brushes over the next several months.  If I see any difference I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/22/12&lt;br /&gt;I am still continuing with the experiment.  I can not detect any visible differences between teeth brushed with the two brushes.  However, the teeth brushed with the FlossAction seem to feel very slightly cleaner at the gum line.</li>
    <li> Basic brush head, medium-soft, simple and gets the job done. Be sure to use Subscribe &amp; Save for the best value.</li>
    <li> These are good, basic replacement brush heads that work well at getting teeth very clean.  I use them on a Braun toothbrush--but mine is an older model, and I can&#x27;t attest to how well they would fit on other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned that replacement brushes should not be so expensive, and they are higher-priced than a standard drugstore manual toothbrush.  But in terms of value per brushing and the value of healthy teeth and gums, they are pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> great product worth every penny. Does a great job of cleaning your teeth&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to a friend or anyone.</li>
    <li> I recommend paying a little extra for the real deal on the brushes.  I had been using store brand, but they were difficult to put on the handle. These brushes work great.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought any of these in years because I had a big stash of them. I finally had to re-up last week, and these ones are so much better! I don&#x27;t know if they changed the design slightly or what, but these ones clean so well! If you haven&#x27;t gotten an electric brush yet, do it now. Your teeth, and your elbow will be much better off.</li>
    <li> I had bought some Walmart brand replacement brushes that would not stay on the handle. These work as they should.</li>
    <li> There is a difference between the name brand &amp; the generic brand heads. I always purchase the name brand for quality.</li>
    <li> Of course it is good - very good. Oral B is the best toothbrush that I ever heard. Thr replacement is original and fits perfect in my brush.</li>
    <li> Got here so fast, that it made my head spin!!! And they work too!!! Just what more can I say?</li>
    <li> This product is completely overpriced.  I have since gone to a generic which costs 90% less and lasts twice as long!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B from Braun for years and the brushes need replacing on a regular basis for optimal oral care. The brushes come with color-coded rings at the base of each replacement brush for homes where there are more than one user of the rechargeable base. The brush performs as it should. Personally, I favor using the Braun Oral-B instead on manual brushing and I think it does a much better job for me. My dental hygienist always compliments me on my good oral health.[[ASIN:B008YD68NI Oral-B Professional Model Eb20-4 Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head, 4 Count]]</li>
    <li> The oral B and its brush heads work very well for me--far better than any manual brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  The brush heads last about three months.</li>
    <li> the quality is very good. I use it sometimes when using deep cleaning. But for everyday use also sensitive  brush heads. Recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> This purchase was convenient because Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond no longer sells them. I avoided buying a new toothbrush...which is expensive. As for the actual product, it fit my toothbrush and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> What can I say, they are exact replacements for the original product made by Oral-B.  We tried a generic once and they weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> Just as it is described.  Good price for four.  I would recommend to anyone looking for replacements.  It is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price. The brush heads seem even better than the ones that originally came with the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience in order things like this thru your company.  It sure eliminates the trip to the store....saves gas and stress...</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting all the bristles to be blue but it was a good price and Amazon saved me some bucks that I might have wasted elsewhere.  Did I say the bristles were blue? Regardless, they are OE Oral B replacements for my Braun rechargeable.  Buy them!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the 4 pack of brush heads, and paid for 4..  however I only received two!!!  I don&#x27;t see a place where I can make a complaint without filling out the return form, but I don&#x27;t wish to return them, I want what I ordered.  Keep a close watch on what you receive.  I hope to be contacted by Amazon about this soon.</li>
    <li> they work fine, good buy for the cost. fit my oral b head just fine.&lt;br /&gt;why do i have to summit so many words?</li>
    <li> Like other reviews suggest, buying these brushes is like a trip back in time to some Eastern Bloc country with absolute garbage for consumer products. I got a couple batches and didn&#x27;t get a single good brush.</li>
    <li> This unit replaces one I have had for 15 years and the power is amazing. The reminder to move to a different part of the mouth is a great idea.</li>
    <li> The picture shows different colored bands on the bottom of these, but the package I got had all the same color. We have 2 family members with these toothbrushes and the different colored bands help with figuring which one belongs to which person. Otherwise, it was what I needed without having to run out to the store.</li>
    <li> My fiancé bought an Oral-B cordless tooth brush and needed extra brushes. Bought these for him as replacement. Good price. Nice to be able to buy in a pack of 4. Arrived on time. Good packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush head for weeks, because one came with my Oral-B 3000 Professional Care electric toothbrush. When I received the toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t totally happy to see a smaller, round toothbrush head instead of the oval shape I&#x27;ve used all my life in both manual and electric toothbrushes. Now I like the round head more. It does take longer to brush my teeth, but because this is an electric toothbrush, not much longer. I need to brush more mindfully, checking the mirror as well as I can to make sure I hit all of each tooth with this little brush head. Unless I am careful to keep the brush on my teeth and away from all my soft tissues, I bleed a little. (My gums are fine, I don&#x27;t bleed when I floss.) I don&#x27;t know whether this is because of the head, or the toothbrush&#x27;s strong motor. All this took practice, but I&#x27;ve managed it. Now the small head seems even more effective, because I can more easily clean my molars, especially on the inside. My mouth feels even cleaner than it did after I used my old electric toothbrush with an oval head.</li>
    <li> I have been using several models of an Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush for four years and have replaced the heads many times. Out of the many different heads available, the Precision Clean is definitely my favorite -- it has the most bristles and is slightly on the soft side. The bristle color changes clearly indicate when it is time to replace the brush and the manufacturer recommends replacing it at least every three months. Obviously, we all have different brushing styles and you may have to replace yours more often. I tend to push the edge a little because of the one major problems with any replaceable head is the price. I have not seen the bristles fall apart or the brushes become defective in any other way, however. They always fit any of the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes I have had over the years, so I have not had to worry about the brushes being incompatible with newer models. In any case, my mouth always feels refreshed after using these heads and I have no hesitation in recommending them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rarely do the heads go on sale and my best advice is to buy the larger quantity packaging (and/or Subscribe and Save) for additional savings -- which you can usually find at a local warehouse club as well...</li>
    <li> I have tried the generic brands but these are more sturdy &amp; I like the firm brush which feels more effective &amp; lasts a bit longer!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fair value. Worth the purchase. The price is good but is probably not the lowest out there.</li>
    <li> I bought an Oral B electric toothbrush about 2 years ago and it was such a great investment! The dentist say my dental health is great. A must have.</li>
    <li> This brush works fine with my old Oral-B toothbrush.  I am pleased with this purchase and have no complaints thus far.</li>
    <li> After reading not so great reviews of the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; heads I opted to pay more for the Oral-B heads.  They of course are made by oral-B and do what they are supposed to.  I get quick, clean gums and teeth with these.</li>
    <li> arrived just as ordered...the real mcCoy. the packaging seems a bit suspect like they could have been part of a different original package (sam&#x27;s club?) and resold. meh, i got a good price and they are the real deal.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes - only the true Oral-B replacements work just right (I have always been disappointed in the generic substitutes).  And these are the best of the Oral-B ones.  I won&#x27;t buy any others.</li>
    <li> If you are new to the world of Oral B brush heads, these specific ones are designed to help with gum line issues.  In terms of the bristle, I would definitely put them in the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; category.  They are not as harsh as the Floss Action heads, but not as soft as the Sensitive heads.  I would consider these to be a good starter head (though I also recommend the Floss Action if you are too lazy to floss yourself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a blue indicator on the head- when it goes down to about halfway, you are supposed to change out the head.  Oral B recommends this every 3 months but I can make it every 4 months on mine (with twice a day brushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to brush with Sonic Care but multiple dentists have told me that the Oral B brushes are better.  They definitely work as my dentist didn&#x27;t yell at me (for once) at my last cleaning.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both have a Oral-B, the replacement brushes seem a bit pricey.  I bought a pack of generic brushes that were really cheap compared to these.  After using I found they did not last nearly as long and the bristles were just not up to snuff compared to the genuine brushes.  Have used the Oral-B with the small cup in the center of the bristles thinking that would retain the toothpaste on the brush a bit longer, I like those also.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am back to these and think they just can&#x27;t be beat.  I would recommend these over any other replacement brushes, and considering how much longer they last probably the best buy. Sometimes the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; ends up actually costing more. These are a quality product as is the whole Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have the Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush. I&#x27;ve tried some of the other heads and find some of them are too large or the bristles too hard for me. (pro white and dual action heads) When I&#x27;ve used these in the past my gums get sore over time. With the precision clean heads I don&#x27;t have any problem with my gums getting sore. The bristles are firm enough to clean well but soft enough not to cause soreness. They are the right size for my mouth. The larger heads make it more difficult to brush the back molars. These reach all my teeth without any problem. I will continue to use these exclusively.</li>
    <li> Not a lot to criticize here. We&#x27;ve been Oral-B users for a long time. These brush heads clean well and work as well as our previous. It&#x27;s not clear to us that the extra little cleaning features make a huge difference to us vs. the legacy plain-Jane brush heads we&#x27;ve had, but they do work at least as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like these and would buy them opportunistically based on price.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are a 5 but I give Amazon a 1 for a late delivery, which I paid extra for. Normally, your deliveries are outstanding and usually early.</li>
    <li> You feel like you just got out of the dentist after brushing your tooth with product. Very easy to use. Very nice features with diferrent modes for brushing.</li>
    <li> I received the replacement brushes which  were meant for the Professional precision Clean model. I love this tooth brush. I had an Oral B for about 20 years which finally died. Just as well, as the newer models are much better. My dental hygienist was very pleased at my last visit!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase these based on some of the reviews but so far we have had no problems with these brush heads for our Oral-B toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I have been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for over ten years.  It was recommended by my dentist.  Both he and I are happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the problems that I have encountered over the years is that of finding replacement heads.  It can cost as much for the replacements over the course of one year as the original price of the toothbrush.  This is the ink jet printer business model.  They make their profit on the supplies and not the original purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not so easy to find quality brush head refills for the electric toothbrush. I have been using the precision clean brushes.  I cannot tell which are the high-quality products even looking at them in the local stores. Price is not necessarily a good indication.  I have bought expensive refills which have performed badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the solution to the problem lies in the collective experience of Amazon reviewers. Of course, you can order the replacements and then judge the quality of the product. However, once I realized it, all that I had to do was look for the product having a large number of recent five-star reviews. Then it would be safe to place an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewers found the replacements at this site to be of high quality.  I did also. They work well and are of good quality.  This is a good example of crowdsourcing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral B toothbrush for, goodness, eight years now, and I love it. These brush heads are my favorite. While some of the other brush heads available have fancy features like gum massaging or \\&quot;floss action\\&quot;, I have found that I don&#x27;t want a gum massage and I can floss just fine on my own. I want a straightforward and effective toothbrush head, and I&#x27;ve settled on these as they are functional and effective without having too many bells and whistles to where it ruins the experience. I brush twice a day for the two minutes signaled by the toothbrush, and my heads last about two months before they look ready to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Short summary - these work very well for cleaning teeth, but I recommend the Sensitive Clean heads that work as well and have a lower risk of gum damage.  If you have no issues with gum loss and prefer a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; bristle, then these are an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for several years.  I&#x27;ve used the Pro White (one pack), Floss Action (one pack), Precision Clean (these), and Sensitive Clean (for years) brush heads.  Because of earlier gum loss, I&#x27;ve been using the Sensitive Clean heads for the vast majority of the time.  The Pro White and Floss Action were uncomfortable for me to use, as they felt too abrasive on my gums.  The Sensitive Clean are by far the most gentle and don&#x27;t cause any discomfort, and these Precision Clean heads are pretty comfortable with only an occasional amount of small discomfort on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that these are equivalent to a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; bristle in a manual brush, while the Sensitive Clean heads are a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; to \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot; bristle.  Studies indicate, and (I just saw while writing this) Oral-B&#x27;s own website states this, that firmer bristles do not clean teeth any better than soft bristles but that they can cause more cervical abrasion on the gums.  It&#x27;s not the type of bristle, but rather the type of brushing, that makes a brush effective.  The beauty of the electric toothbrush is that it makes brushing properly far easier, so soft bristles can be very effective.  Since I started using an Oral-B electric toothbrush with the Sensitive Clean heads, my dental hygienist spends most of the time just talking to me as there&#x27;s not much for her to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give these four stars because they are a high-quality product like the other Oral-B brush heads, and because they are overall pretty comfortable to use.  I do \\&quot;like\\&quot; them, but I don&#x27;t \\&quot;love\\&quot; them because they aren&#x27;t as comfortable to me as the Sensitive Clean heads.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Teeth definitely felt cleaner after using. Felt like you&#x27;ve just left the dentist office after using or close to it cause you get that clean feeling. I Would use these brushes before a regular one or times when you just want to get your teeth/gums extra clean. That&#x27;s how well they work and they also fit on another model base that I had. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, at a reasonable price, fast ship, great seller</li>
    <li> Bought for the replacement of brushes for Professional Care by Braun toothbrush. Works well with no problems. Stays in place &amp; teeth feel clean. Will buy again in future.</li>
    <li> Gets your teeth squeaky clean, your gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I tried these after trying the Floss Action Oral-B heads (which I did not like so much!), and I liked these a lot better. They&#x27;re soft but not too soft, and my mouth feels clean. What more can you ask for in a toothbrush?</li>
    <li> Compared to the brush heads I was using - the ones that do \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; (can&#x27;t remember what they&#x27;re called)--these are much more comfortable. The \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; type has brushes sticking out to do the flossing, and they feel rather rough on the gums. These new brush heads are round, with nothing sticking out. I tend to brush longer with these, I think, since there is no irritation. A definite improvement. If you are already flossing daily (as I do), I&#x27;d recommend these brush heads over the other type.</li>
    <li> Even though the price was right, the brushes do not last that long and they start falling apart in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush for about six years now, and when I bought my toothbrush this was the standard brush head that came in the package.  Since then I have used several different toothbrush heads with it. I found that this does a very good job of cleaning my teeth, but not quite as good a job as the Floss Action brush.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to do quite as good a job as getting into all of the corners and cleaning all of the stain and plaque.  While not my favorite it does come in as a close second.</li>
    <li> These are not even close to real oral B brush heads. Disappointing. It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s so difficult to find the real thing.</li>
    <li> This was another thing my dentist suggested.  As we shoppers know - suppliers are always changing things so we have to buy new stuff.  My dentist said its good to get replacement heads  so I have them just incase company changes style of brush.  Although they are kind of high price.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Precision Clean brush heads are a good, basic, \\&quot;default\\&quot; option to choose. They&#x27;re not too soft, not too hard, but just right. They clean my teeth and gums effectively and last quite well for a nice length of time. This four pack includes different colors (blue, light blue, pink, and yellow), so they can be coded for a family to use. The brush heads feature light blue bristles that will fade away until about the halfway point (about three months), which helps let you know when to change it out for another. These fit a variety of models, the one that I use is the [[ASIN:B008PEMBNC Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], but double check to make sure these are the right ones for your specific toothbrush. Perhaps a bit pricy but considering the quality of the brush heads compared to generics, they&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years.  We discovered that we preferred it over the other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These replacement brush heads are very nice!  They&#x27;re soft enough that they don&#x27;t cause irritation to your gums, yet they&#x27;re tough enough to get your teeth clean, especially right at the gum line.  Oral-B makes quality products, no ifs, ands or buts about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to recommend these!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brush heads to replace the Floss Action head that came on my [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]. The Precision Clean is working very well. It fits on the brush perfectly and functions just like the original. It certainly feels like it&#x27;s doing an excellent job of getting my teeth clean. As far as I tell from descriptions, this is designed as the \\&quot;all-around\\&quot; replacement head - not flossing, sensitive, whitening, etc. The bristles look and feel like ones on a regular manual brush. I like the indicator bristles that lose color over time and remind me to replace the brush head (every three months or so.) Truthfully, I don&#x27;t have a preference between this style of brush head and the flossing action; both do a great job as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> Whaat is there to say about the power head of an electric toothbrush&amp;#62;  Some are good, some are not worth the price.  These are original  in packages and to me well worth the price. I tried the &#x27;knock-offs&#x27; and they don&#x27;t hold up for me.!  With 4 on hand I have about 7 or 8 months of brushing.  They arrived on time in a decent box and at a fair  price. That&#x27;s what I .can say about a toothbrush head!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes as a replacement to the ones that we currently have in our electric toothbrushes.  The head on these are smaller than the ones we had gotten in the past but seem to be good brushes.  I received them quickly - within two days and in original packaging.  I would recommend this seller and this product.</li>
    <li> They are exactly the same as I have bought at the store. It pays to shop for the best prices.</li>
    <li> These brushes were so hard they hurt my gums.  Pain didn&#x27;t go away doe several days!  I don&#x27;t remember having this problem before.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush heads.  I ordered some on eBay once and they sucked (smaller and different color bristles that were stiffer, though marked Oral-B), but these are exactly the same as the ones that come with the Oral-B toothbrushes.  They do a much better job cleaning than the knock-off ones.</li>
