      <li>a good 1-2 years outta</li>

      <li>more words more words more wo</li>
      <li>But all in all I love being cordless.</li>

      <li>If anyone else has found a solution for getting more life out of the battery when used infrequently, I&#x27;d love to hear how.</li>
      <li>I love Andis</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the nature of rechargeable batteries and the frequency that we use and charge it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s supposed to be okay to do so, but not sure if that&#x27;s the best route.</li>
      <li>Thanks for arriving so quickly!!</li>
      <li>always good to have an extra battery.</li>
      <li>Battery deteriorated quickly.  </li>
      <li>Battery doesnt hold a charge gets very hot when attached to clippers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>Note to BGRv users: Appears to default on higher settings.</li>
      <li>When I checked on the manufacturers website their product (same item) was $20 more.  </li>
      <li>I love how long my battery holds it charge.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;d stay far away from any pro clipper that uses this battery pack...</li>
      <li>Was a lethargic as the original battery within a few months of use.  </li>
      <li>I suspect that if you use this battery every day as a professional it may last longer.</li>
      <li>Andis website says:  &amp;#34;To maximize the life of your battery, about every two months, run the clipper completely down, and fully recharge overnight.&amp;#34; Tried that, too, but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>

    <li> Pefection!! Fast shipping too</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my barber who has been cutting my hair for years now. She hates cords and this was made for her clippers. She used it everyday all day for about two weeks before it failed to keep a charge like the previous one. Now it just sits on the charger taking up space...paper weight I guess and not even a good one at that (rolls around a lot). Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> I was so happy when this arrived. I love my Andis Clippers and I use them for hours in a day. Thanks for arriving so quickly!!</li>
    <li> Good price arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Battery deteriorated quickly.  Was a lethargic as the original battery within a few months of use.  Still works a couple of year later, but not much power.</li>

    <li> Great battery. Could stay charged a little longer. But all in all I love being cordless.</li>
    <li> Battery is GARBAGE!!!!  I purchased a BGR+ and the battery died after 1 year... I contacted Andis and they would not replace it.  Just a garbage piece of junk.  I would never purchase another Andis clipper... just junk.</li>
    <li> I average 200 cuts a month.  I love how long my battery holds it charge.  But I seem to go through one battery a year.  I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth</li>
    <li> I suspect that if you use this battery every day as a professional it may last longer. But we as consumers essentially use the clipper once a month, put it back on the charger, and hit the recondition button. We want to keep it on the charger so it&#x27;s ready when we need it, and it&#x27;s supposed to be okay to do so, but not sure if that&#x27;s the best route. We get about 18 months of use, but it&#x27;s a gradual decline and once it goes, it&#x27;s useless. We purchased the AC adapter for the clipper for the moment when the battery just won&#x27;t drive the clipper any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis website says:  &amp;#34;To maximize the life of your battery, about every two months, run the clipper completely down, and fully recharge overnight.&amp;#34; Tried that, too, but it didn&#x27;t help much. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the nature of rechargeable batteries and the frequency that we use and charge it. If anyone else has found a solution for getting more life out of the battery when used infrequently, I&#x27;d love to hear how.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found myself having to recharge mid-shave yet. Hope it lasts. Having a truly high quality cordless clipper is a dream. Note to BGRv users: Appears to default on higher settings.</li>
    <li> always good to have an extra battery. dont keep it on the charger all the time. if it dies, it dies you just need to replace it</li>
    <li> Not efficient for or as consistent as I would like for Professional shop use.</li>
    <li> Battery doesnt hold a charge gets very hot when attached to clippers. Stops working in the middel of a haircut. prox 5 mins</li>
    <li> No matter how careful you are to take care of the battery, it diminishes very quickly. I&#x27;d stay far away from any pro clipper that uses this battery pack... These batteries need to be made out of lithium ion, not NiCd or NiMh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who is a barber..He loves his BGR Clipper and this is the battery power pack for the job!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a battery, what should I expect? This is a waste of time for something as inane as a battery. more words more words more wo</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for My Last Battery Pack. This definately brought back life to my BGR+, hopefully I can get a good 1-2 years outta this battery pack before I have to Replace it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Update 14APR13-&lt;br /&gt;Went to use my Andis BGR+ this weekend, which have been working perfectly find mind you since I purchased this Replacment Battery. Now the Battery has \\&quot;Zero\\&quot; charge and the Charging dock will not Illuminate when battery in placed in the Dock with/Without clipper Attached!!! I love Andis, I do I have pretty much all of there product but they need to improve these Batteries maybe use Lithum Ion/ Ni-Cad!! Contacted Customer Service, waiting for there Reply.. I&#x27;m changing my rating from 5stars to 2stars since it did work for 2-3 weeks before giving out!!!</li>
