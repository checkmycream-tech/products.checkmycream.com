      <li>If you want to straighten your natural hair, this is an EXCELLENT straightener and heat protector.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I love this product for myself</li>
      <li>I should have do it one more time</li>
      <li>but I would have to use them too often, which meant I would have too buy more and spend more money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I thought it would make my hair conditioned instead of feeling crisps, but maybe it&#x27;s because of my environment that am in.....</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have picked this one because of its uncomplicated formula.  </li>
      <li>My hair is softer, shinier, more resistant to humidity/cold, and easier to style.</li>
      <li>and I saw this by my favorite Cantu conditioner</li>
      <li>it did a better job on my feet than my hair.  </li>
      <li>The fact that this stuff is so cheap is amazing to me.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE IT,</li>
      <li>the wetter your hair, the better.</li>
      <li>Since they didn&#x27;t, unless they include more detail in their descriptions I won&#x27;t be buying from them</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nowaday, I love the stuff.</li>
      <li>More then the product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care if it is mostly petroleum jelly</li>
      <li>many, I followed the no petroleum hype, however my hair needs its to remain unruly.</li>
      <li>but i sure didn&#x27;t blame it on the ethnic hair product.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I understand that it is mostly petrolatum</li>
      <li>my curls are much more defined.</li>
      <li>and boy am I glad that I did.</li>
      <li>Beautiful natural hair for a woman of color.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is that it smells good.  </li>
      <li>Blue Magic Coconut Oil Hair Conditioner is nothing more than a jar of petroleum jelly that smells good.  </li>
      <li>HUGE MISTAKE.</li>
      <li>I use light oils for the rest of my mane.</li>
      <li>This product had great reviews on Pinterest, and maybe it works for some hair types, but definitely not for mine.</li>
      <li>I wash with sulfate free shampoos</li>
      <li>Ladies if you want a hair conditioner get DOOGRO the purple label ... it will condition and strengthen your hair NOT Greasy just Light</li>
      <li>I just would&#x27;ve preferred Organic Coconut oil primary ingredient and no fragrance.</li>
      <li>This product ruined my long, previously beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>If your pores have already been clogged by it, you will need to use really warm water (almost hot) to open them up, then wash out the oil with a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and is really good for twists and a general hair dress.  </li>
      <li>I have a new love and appreciation for this product!</li>
      <li>if you have applied so much, I recommend buying clarify shampoo, the very cheap one is fine</li>
      <li>Great smell and long lastin jar</li>
      <li>Excitedly slathered this on my head when I got home and after shampooing 3x there was still some residue.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky and shiny without weighing it down and it smells incredible.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I have not used this product, but I work in a store where it is sold, and it is simply coconut-scented Vaseline, nothing more.</li>
      <li>For everyone else the same technique applies but more coats may be needed according to your own hair.</li>
      <li>I put almost half jar in my hair and scalp over night thinking that I would have better hair formy vacation and feeling so proud of myself for finding such a good way.</li>
      <li>I was right!</li>
      <li>the only good thing about this is the smell.</li>
      <li>It is good for the scalp, especially when you are getting your hair braided.</li>
      <li>I have also used this on my face and body and my skins is so much softer and more</li>
      <li>I like this product for many purposes and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smell nice, cuts down on tangling (I have waist length curly hair that tangles when anyone looks at it and that I describe as attack hair for it&#x27;s propensity to snatch at stray children, branches, fences and once decided that it liked a blouse and snatched the hanger off the rack at a store as I was walking by)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>so I went out with super greasy and wet-looking hair.</li>
      <li>had a mishap with this once where my hair felt super oily afterwards</li>
      <li>I know most the reviews for this product are negative, but for me it was great.</li>
      <li>Truth is, it is not a terrible product as it works very well for many many people and it is CERTAINLY not misleading.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but it makes my hair feel very soft and more manageable.</li>
      <li>blue magic it was!</li>
      <li>That would only happen if u use toooooooo much and dont spread it through ur hair good.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about Blue Magic Coconut Oil Hair Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>they are far better.</li>
      <li>and it actually keeps your curls really nice and without all the frizz and this product</li>
      <li>And perhaps other places petrolatum is good for like cuticles, etc.</li>
      <li>I used it the day i got it and wash it out right after i applied it, using it as a conditioner,</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>I woke up specially early that morning because I was so excited to see a head of healthy looking hair with brand new color.</li>
      <li>Sure its not for everyone but 3 days after washing, conditioning them sealing with this my hair is not dry at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about hair, but I bought this as a wonderful smelling alternative to plain petroleum jelly to keep my hands moisturized all day through multiple washings.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I GOT THIS OIL FOR MYSELF AND I LOVE IT, GREAT FOR OILING THE SCALP AND LEAVES HAIR SILKY SMOOTH. SMELLS WONDERFUL, I WOULD ADVISE ALL 2 BUY THIS PRODUCT........</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it,so much grease</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE!! My hair is matted and sticky!! it wont come out at all!! i&#x27;m beyond mad, this product is horrible! ive washed my hair about 5 times today, my hair is extremely dry and has sections that still has the oil in it. my hair is matted together and tangled. i hate this product. i do not recommend using. the only good thing about this is the smell. thats it!!</li>
    <li> Blue Magic Coconut Oil Hair Conditioner is nothing more than a jar of petroleum jelly that smells good.  It weights down your hair and oils your hair and scalp like a pound of lard would, only it is much harder to wash out!</li>
    <li> Dosen&#x27;t seem to be the same as my last one. Not as thick, will use up sooner.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a coconut oil-like treatment for your hair, don&#x27;t buy this! It has petroleum jelly in it and is basically impossible to wash out! I&#x27;m on my sixth wash right now with very little improvement. I have tried everything - three different types of shampoos and conditioners, dishwashing (not machine but hand) detergent, etc. I&#x27;m getting ready to try cornstarch tomorrow to see if there&#x27;s any improvement. This product ruined my long, previously beautiful hair. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in my hair for years, and it works well.  I spray my hair each night with oil sheen, then I put a very small amount of the coconut oil in the palm of my hand and spread it evenly throughout my hair only 2 x&#x27;s a week, then I wrap my hair each night, and put on a scarf.  It helps keep my hair moisterized, shiny, and straight.  If you use too much, it can make your hair stiff and greasy.  It must be used in moderation.  Also it depends on the texture of your hair.</li>
    <li> concentrate on the ends with just a little maybe in the morning(or when you have a few hours to burn) and rinse it out later in the day and it won&#x27;t be all greasy and your hair will have a nice shine :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I guess it&#x27;s like using it like a deep conditioner. Letting it sit than rinse out and the good thing is you just need a little so one jar can last a long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for my scalp I use actual coconut oil because the blue magic is really thick for my scalp)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African American btw :)</li>
    <li> i use it when I go swimming under my cap. It is a good sealant and moisturizer for combating chlorine  dryness. I also use is on my face as a great moisturizer during the cold dry weather.</li>
    <li> Been using Blue Magic for years, it works great for my hair, keeps it moisturized, and it help grow my hair before I learned about being natural and ingredients they say are bad for hair, I say eveey product isnt going to work the samw on differenr hair..</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about Blue Magic Coconut Oil Hair Conditioner.  It is like having your own stylist (in a jar).  At times my hair can be very brittle but using BMCOHC you could hardly tell that it is.  You cannot use too much of it and the results are perfect ever time.  It has a non-greasy formula and the aroma is great for those who want to get close to your hair.  I would recommend BMCOHC to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never cared if a hair product weighs my hair down because that also keeps the friz down (I have permed African hair). It smells GREATTT! I have to give it that. But if you are going to use this product, be very careful not to put too much on your scalp because that will cause your pores to be clogged. If your pores have already been clogged by it, you will need to use really warm water (almost hot) to open them up, then wash out the oil with a good shampoo. It did keep my hair really soft and glossy, even though it was pretty greasy (but that&#x27;s exactly what oils do).</li>
    <li> Great buy. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I use this oil everyday twice a day. My hair is softer, shinier, more resistant to humidity/cold, and easier to style. I am an African American and I usually wear my hair straightened (flat iron not chemically). I have also noticed less split ends. The fact that this stuff is so cheap is amazing to me. I only use a small amount in each application, a pea size application each time, but it really does wonders. Is it essentially petroleum with a bit of coconut, probably. Does it work for me, definitely. Don;t use too much though, the potential greasey factor is high if you do!  In small doses it does the job! :)</li>
    <li> Was glad to find the product since it is not offered in our local stores any longer. Just felt the postage was too high. More then the product.</li>
    <li> The main ingredient in this product is petroleum therefore if you don&#x27;t want your hair to be greasy and weighed down do not be heavy-handed with it. I would say it&#x27;s primariy used in the ethnic communities because our hair tends to handle heavy products easier. If your hair is naturally bone straight,thin, or blows easily in the wind, I would recommend only using a dime-sized amount melted between the hands applying it from ends first up to the scalp. For everyone else the same technique applies but more coats may be needed according to your own hair. Another thing to keep in mind about petroleum is that it is a sealant which means it does not allow moisture in, however, the plus side to that is if you wash and condition your hair then add your moisturizer and apply this on top, it should help keep that moisture in for a few days. For this reason I would not recommend this product to people who prefer to wash their hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-African American female with natural 4B hair.</li>
    <li> I have fairly long hair, and being the length that it is, the ends get dry and split all the time. I was looking for a different product, but came across this one and thought I would give it a shot. HUGE MISTAKE. I have washed my hair with every different kind of shampoo I could find in my house, and after 4 or 5 washes my hair was still disgustingly greasy. My hands, neck, back, face, and pretty much anything else that has come in contact with my hair has been left waxy and sticky as well. I got desperate and tried washing my hair with Dawn dish soap, you know, the kind that wildlife rescuers use to wash crude oil off of penguins? It didn&#x27;t work. My hair is still unpleasantly oily and totally gross. Do not buy this. This is hands down the worst thing that has ever happened to my hair.</li>
    <li> I put just a little bit on my roots to help my hair grow. Two days and 7 showers later, my hair is still ridiculously matted and greasy. This is definitely not coconut oil. Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome it works wonders on my 9 year olds hair. Been using for about 6 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;Its not like glue nor does it stick to ur hands. That would only happen if u use toooooooo much and dont spread it through ur hair good.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and relatively curly since I&#x27;m Indian. I bleached my hair a year ago and it killed my hair and left it very dry. I needed something that would bring back the moisture in my hair. What I found with this was that when I used a little bit of it on the ends of my hair and combed through it, it really helped my hair. I used to use it on my scalp but found that my scalp didn&#x27;t need that much moisture. Once I started only using it on the ends of my hair, I could see the difference. My hair had a perfect balance of moisture since I use coconut oil on my scalp the night before I wash my hair and coconut hair conditioner the day after I was my hair. To me it is finding the right balance between where you hair is dry and where it is already moisturized.</li>
    <li> I use this product on very dry skin and heels.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> I seem to be misreading certain items for my hair. This is another one I purchased&lt;br /&gt;thinking it was in creme form. However, I figured a way to utilize it so it will&lt;br /&gt;work for my hair. Came quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34;. Nope lol. It&#x27;s pretty much petrolatum with coconut fragrance ://</li>
    <li> Five stars for the one star reveiws from the dumb white girls that used this on their hair. I was once that same dumb white girl but i sure didn&#x27;t blame it on the ethnic hair product. This really is a great product when used correctly. I hate to see all the bad reviews from people that simply used this incorrectly or didn&#x27;t understand the purpose of this product. I use it everyday to take my eye makeup off and not on my hair because, well, I don&#x27;t have the kind of hair that requires this type of product. Good job, one star ladies, for blaming a known ethnic hair product for your ignorance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying shampoo.  About ten times. You&#x27;ll have your hair back to normal.</li>
    <li> When I was growing up, my mom used to slather my head with coconut oil, she said it would make my hair grow. In the hot sun of Puerto Rico, all I really noticed was that my head was hot as hell, but what did I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowaday, I love the stuff. It makes my hair smell nice, cuts down on tangling (I have waist length curly hair that tangles when anyone looks at it and that I describe as attack hair for it&#x27;s propensity to snatch at stray children, branches, fences and once decided that it liked a blouse and snatched the hanger off the rack at a store as I was walking by)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, admittedly I was in a rush and too busy *cough*lazy*cough* to go to a store to try to find coconut oil, so I bought it off this website. The product description is very brief and just describes it as \\&quot;hair conditioner\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I buy it, the thing arrived swiftly, within a couple of days, but it&#x27;s not just coconut oil. It&#x27;s petroleum jelly WITH coconut oil, not what I was looking for at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wear petroleum jelly in my hair, so this was passed on to someone who can. I wish the seller had included that in the description. Since they didn&#x27;t, unless they include more detail in their descriptions I won&#x27;t be buying from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak to the product&#x27;s value, since I never used, but the description was certainly \\&quot;fail\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is the best overnight conditioner I have ever had.  Just brush a little through your hair at night before you go to bed and wash in the morning.  Your hair will feel fuller and more robust is the only word I can think of to describe it.  It is not something you wear in your hair during the day!  If you use too much it will feel sticky. Use just enough to brush through to the ends.  The right amount dries slightly and will not grease up the pillows!  I use it once a week, and the smell is really nice!</li>
    <li> I know most the reviews for this product are negative, but for me it was great. My hair is normally really dry and frizzy looking at the ends after bleaching to whitey blonde. No matter how much I cut off it still looked frizzy. I put this straight on in the shower, a really small amount is all you need, also, don&#x27;t leave it on over night else it never comes out. I only left it on for about 5 minutes. When I washed it off, and dried it, it did look greasy, so I slept on it like that. Then the next day I really rubbed shampoo into it and conditioned normally.&lt;br /&gt;It came out so nice and hydrated and the ends look healthy, the tub is also huge so it will last ages with the tiny amount you need.</li>
    <li> This 4a, armpit length naturalista SWEARS by this stuff. *SideNote*....I use it only for my ends. I use light oils for the rest of my mane. My ends stayed dry and brittle before I started using this. With the exception of all other areas of my hair, castor, jajoba, and olive oils just weren&#x27;t giving my ends what they needed. I even tried the organic raw coconut oil everyone raves about, it made my ends even drier and shed hair worse. One day out of the blue I got a hunch to go OLD SKOOL and back to my roots....blue magic it was! By surprise, I wasn&#x27;t met with the green or blue &amp;#34;Blue Magic&amp;#34; of times past, (Walmart), it was this coconut version. Its been a match made in heaven ever since and my ends are ALWAYS moist, never dry, and VERY MINIMAL SHEDDING.  I give this product 10 stars &amp;#60;3!!!!</li>
    <li> I am trying to grow my hair, and I have heard that coconut oil is a major oil that helps with hair growth by reducing the split ends. I have used this product a few times, and I can see that my split ends look fuller, and my dry hair is now moisturized. Every time I apply this oil to my scalp, and massage it in, my scalp feels cooled down. I like the smell of this product, yet it is not too heavy. I used this after cleaning my hair with shampoo and conditioner, and I can see that it has reduced my frizz. I like this product for many purposes and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE beauty product! I don&#x27;t use it for my hair though (I am white with fine hair and I saw this by my favorite Cantu conditioner so I decided to check it out). This stuff is basically Vaseline with coconut oil. I have very dry and sensitive skin.  I put this on my hands and legs, it luxuriously melts into my skin and soothes it.  I put this on my lips in the morning and at night. And I put this on my feet and put socks over it at night. It keeps my skin soft and supple and it has the added bonus of smelling like coconut! It lasts a long time since a little goes a long way, and its affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like it in the summer as it keeps my skin from getting irritated and dry when I swim in chlorinated water every day. This stuff is a miracle in a jar.</li>
    <li> Highly don&#x27;t recommend this. It ruined my hair. It makes your hair feel nasty and you can&#x27;t get it out. I had to wash my hair with dish soap. And now my hair is matted and that crap is still not out of my hair complelty. -100 stars</li>
    <li> I used this in my hair (I&#x27;m natural so my hair needs lots of moisture) and I thought it was great in the beginning. However, after 2 days of using it I noticed that it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair for long. I would apply it to my scalp and ends in the morning and my hair would feel dry/itchy scalp by the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that mean that I had to use more, but it didn&#x27;t. When I went to wash my hair, vaseline/petroleum jelly rinsed out. IT WAS DISGUSTING!! This is not for hair. The only good thing about it is that it smells good.  I had to throw it away. AND IT&#x27;S OVER PRICED!</li>
    <li> Take 2 kinds of cancer treatments and my lips are raw all the time. Someone said they bought for their hair, but it does have petrolatum and didn&#x27;t use it for that, but instead on their lips, feet and hands.  Makes skin soft and the only thing that has made my lips feel better and its just the first day.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 4 starts is because that is the first ingredient, followed by cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil and fragrance.  I just would&#x27;ve preferred Organic Coconut oil primary ingredient and no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used blue magic ever since I was a child. I decided to purchase it even though its been years. I figured if it worked then it should work now. I was right!</li>
    <li> This product is a FALSE ADVERTISEMENT It is NOT a hair conditioner it&#x27;s petroleum Vaseline scented with coconut oil. I used it once &amp; I have honestly washed my hair 6 times and still had it on. It&#x27;s a waste of 6$ lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried DOOGRO &amp; that was Exactly what I was looking for. Ladies if you want a hair conditioner get DOOGRO the purple label ... it will condition and strengthen your hair NOT Greasy just Light</li>
    <li> It is cheaper at walmart I bought mine for less than $3!! It is good for the scalp, especially when you are getting your hair braided.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a nearby store and spent nearly $10 on it.. I used it the day i got it and wash it out right after i applied it, using it as a conditioner, thinking id get silky hair.. It made my hair greasy/wet looking, flat, and stuck to my head. This is just petroleum jelly with a coconut fragrance. Try applying petroleum to your hair and see how you get that out!!!!</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on this item I was a little afraid to use it but decided to use it anyway and boy am I glad that I did. My hair looked dry but noe my hair looks and feels healthier as well as my curls are much more defined. I have also used this on my face and body and my skins is so much softer and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love this product for myself I would not recommend this item for Caucasian (and people with hair alike) to use on their hair. Also if your hair is well moisturized I would use sparingly (could make your hair greezy).</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with the intention of adding moisture to my hair. Its has been 24 since I have applied it and I have been propositioned 2 times to play major league football without a helmet, 3 different species of birds have made a home in my hair, and my forehead is so shiny IM about to break the internet.  My hands? My hands are so greasy Mr. Miyagi has texted me &amp;#34;You wax enough.&amp;#34; Please do not buy this product unless you wish to call upon the preceding problems.</li>
    <li> I started using this about one year ago. My hair is very dry and will not grow... it breaks off. I put this product just on the ends of my hair at night before I go to bed and in the morning before I leave the house. My hair is finally getting longer. I don&#x27;t care if it is mostly petroleum jelly, I like the smell of it. I also use it on the backs of my hands. I wash my hands a lot during the day but I try not to wash the backs of my hands. I never use lotion, I only use this product. it&#x27;s easy to use because I can&#x27;t wait to smell it, it smells so good. I give it a 5 out of 5.</li>
    <li> This product by far, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll use nothing else on my hair ever! I&#x27;m 52 and my hair has gotten quite dry. I simply apply a little of Blue Magic, and I&#x27;m good to go. I also love the coconut smell too!</li>
    <li> Well its pretty much just Vaseline but Vaseline helps grow hair but I think people with natural straight hair should not use this cause it will make your hair stringy but people with curly hair it will work great just put it on your scalp and on your ends so it doesn&#x27;t look greasy and then just put it in a braid or something at night and it actually keeps your curls really nice and without all the frizz and this product actually helps grow your lashes to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it works wonders for my hair. I am African-American and I have natural kinky hair that I usually straighten with a flat iron or with a hot comb (the old school method). My hair has always been very dry and flaky and most products I used would work but I would have to use them too often, which meant I would have too buy more and spend more money. Well this product is great because a little goes a long way. I use it once a week during the colder months and twice a week when its warmer. I use it as a moisturizer for my scalp, my edges, and the tips of my hair then I wrap it up a night with a satin scarf. It leaves my hair silky and shiny without weighing it down and it smells incredible. I didn&#x27;t buy it from here but the place where I buy it from cost under $3 so it&#x27;s very affordable. I highly recommend this to anyone that has dry, thick hair who&#x27;s looking for a product to moisturize their hair without weighing it down. Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I personally do like this product! It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but it makes my hair feel very soft and more manageable. Apply a small amount first and works towards the ends of your hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I was using Dax before and basically I think they do the same thing but I was draw to this product because it said coconut oil and hair conditioner.  I understand that it is mostly petrolatum and I guess that&#x27;s a bit disappointing since that&#x27;s not supposed to be the best thing to put on hair.  But I like someone else&#x27;s post about using it AFTER a moisturizer or hair wash to SEAL IN moisture.  When I use it I usually spray water on my hair first and then rub this product in.  I use it on my son&#x27;s hair as well.  I&#x27;ve been happy with the results because the hair looks shiny and feels softer to me.  I&#x27;m still using it and as someone else posted, I will start using it on my feet too.  And perhaps other places petrolatum is good for like cuticles, etc. etc.  I would recommend this product.  The product washes out of my hair without a problem.  I guess it&#x27;s not meant for certain textures of Caucasian hair.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many, I followed the no petroleum hype, however my hair needs its to remain unruly. I used to seal with gel, but my scalp just flaked like crazy... and then I tried sealing with just plain oil (olive, argan, vitamin E) but for whatever reason the oil would not penetrate, it just sat on top and sometimes made it frizzier.  Anyway, just wanted to share that I have 3b/3c thick hair that is VERY DRY, very prone to frizz and borders on coarse. THIS product made it smooth, soft and manageable. I co-washed and applied this to my hair after wringing it out..the wetter your hair, the better. I used the shingling method to apply...you will have experiment with the amount of product to use (too much will leave it greasy, BUT it will be soft and shiny). I don&#x27;t have to apply every day. I sleep with my hair in a loose bun or twisted pony tail with a satin scarf. In the morning I spritz with with water to liven up my curls and apply a pea sized amount to my edges and ends, that helps eliminate the frizz. And I do the same after co-washing in the middle of the week. I would recommend shingling with this product only once a week to eliminate build up. Hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> How terrible. I look like I out baby oil in my hair. :(&lt;br /&gt;How terrible.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions don&#x27;t even mention if it&#x27;s a leave in, or to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;What an oily mess..and I only used a quarter sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a grease ball and for sure my back is going to break out now.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. Love this product. I just purchased a few bottles for me and my family. So far we all like this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was coconut oil for hair from the hair product section of walmart. I used it as a deep conditioner thinking it was coconut oil. Well it&#x27;s not! This \\&quot;blue magic\\&quot; is actually coconut scented petroleum jelly. It will make your hair disgusting, greasy, and it is impossible to get out. After washing my hair about 4 times with normal shampoo and no luck, I resorted to dawn dish detergent. I remembered the commerical where they used it on the animals in the oil spills and it says it is tough on grease, I had nothing to lose. After washing my hair and really working it in, twice, with dawn I finally got this crap out of my hair and is now back to normal. (After washing with dawn i also washed it with my normal shampoo and conditioner.) Save yourself the trouble and go to the food section of the store and make sure it is a 100% coconut oil or you&#x27;ll regret it, trust me.</li>
    <li> Garbage! Cant get it out of my hair!</li>
    <li> when i received this i got the blue one not the coconut one plus it had melted from the heat.</li>
    <li> I wish I had realized this was basically scented Vaseline. My hair is greasy, sticky, and completely gross. I&#x27;ve washed it eight times today, and the product still hasn&#x27;t completely washed out. I&#x27;m going to try mixing my shampoo with baking soda and hopefully that will do the trick. This product had great reviews on Pinterest, and maybe it works for some hair types, but definitely not for mine.</li>
    <li> I admit, I fell into the all natural-curly girl method-petroleum and mineral oil is bad for your hair hype. I was a new natural and no one taught me anything about caring for my natural hair. All it did was leave my hair dry dry dry. Sure its not for everyone but 3 days after washing, conditioning them sealing with this my hair is not dry at all. So this works for me. All I&#x27;m concerned with is retaining moisture. I wash with sulfate free shampoos but I also clarify to get rid of the product buildup. Petroleum jelly wont damage your hair. Dryness and breakage will. This sealed the deal for me.</li>
    <li> If you have natural hair and find the humidity to be a problem try small amounts of this on your hair before you roll it up at night. I have tried just about everything to control the fizzes, I think this is a winner so far. Beautiful natural hair for a woman of color.</li>
    <li> Vaseline that smells like coconut!  I can&#x27;t get it out of my hair.  I normally used unrefined virgin coconut nut oil and it works wonders.  At least the coconut oil washes out of my hair.  Blue Magic has made my hair greasy.  I&#x27;ve washed my hair three times and it is still won&#x27;t come out.  I thought about throwing the jar away but decided to use it on my feet instead.  Trust me it did a better job on my feet than my hair.  Lather some on your feet put on a pair of socks and go to bed.  The next morning you have soft feet.</li>
    <li> I have 4b/4c afro-textured hair. When I heard about blue magic, I bought this because it was the only available version at the store. I applied it on my hair dry because I had no idea how to use grease. It was AWFUL. Got stuck in my hair and I had to tug it out with a towel. Now I realized your suppose to apply this on wet to damp hair and take a dime size amount to each section of your hair to get the most benefits out of it.   If you want to straighten your natural hair, this is an EXCELLENT straightener and heat protector. I used to use silicone-based protectors like IC Fantasia. But I decided I wanted to stick to natural based products. I applied this in dime-size amounts mixed with actual coconut oil (for shine) on completely wet hair and I blow dried and straightened seamlessly. My hair is not greasy whatsoever. It actually came out dry, shiny, soft, and smooth. I have a new love and appreciation for this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I thought it would make my hair conditioned instead of feeling crisps, but maybe it&#x27;s because of my environment that am in.....Montana is really cold anyways.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about hair, but I bought this as a wonderful smelling alternative to plain petroleum jelly to keep my hands moisturized all day through multiple washings.  It smells great and leaves my hands and feet smooth and crack free!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local store for a few bucks not knowing exactly what it was. I use pomade and putting this on top just makes it shine brilliantly. Not sure why other people gave it a one star, the ingredients it clearly says \\&quot;petrolatum\\&quot; as the first thing in it. Oh well, I guess people are morons.</li>
    <li> I bought this off walmart store... and this sticks to your hair like a glue. I run my fingers in my hair and my fingers and hands are sticky. I applied it to my hair, it smells good but how the hell do I get rid of it. My hair now is gummmy and matted and none of the shampoos[ pantene, head and shoulders and sauve] I tried all of them, including lemon. I cant get rid of it and my hair is matted!!!!! I have been washing my hair twice a day for 3 days now and I cant get rid of the glue. And its definetely not coconut oil!!! they are far better. Its just petroleum and vaseline</li>
    <li> My ethnic mix hair loves this product!  I am so glad to have picked this one because of its uncomplicated formula.  I plan to buy it on a very regular basis!</li>
    <li> This is one of those &amp;#34;I&#x27;d give 0 stars if I could&amp;#34; reviews. Partially my fault for not reading the ingredients before purchasing but the label does say &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34;. Let you in on a secret - it&#x27;s NOT coconut oil. Excitedly slathered this on my head when I got home and after shampooing 3x there was still some residue. Don&#x27;t buy if you have naturally straight hair, unless you want to compete with Hitchcock for &amp;#34;Scariest Shower Scene&amp;#34;. In the trash this goes.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I have not used this product, but I work in a store where it is sold, and it is simply coconut-scented Vaseline, nothing more. It is NOT pure coconut oil. I imagine it would be okay to rub on dry skin, like on your feet, but I&#x27;d never put it in my hair.</li>
    <li> girl, if you are unlucky enough to put this thing on your hair before seeing the review like I did and have been washing your hair non-stop in the past few hours, but still couldn&#x27;t get the crap out of your hair, here&#x27;s what I did without using dawn. I used olive oil. I literally soaked my whole head into the oil. ( I mean you have to massage the oil into the spot where you applied the jelly) it&#x27;s like your makeup remover, the oil can wash off Vaseline. after that, you can shampoo your hair. if you have applied so much, I recommend buying clarify shampoo, the very cheap one is fine ( I found the V05 in Walmart less than a dollar, but be sure to buy the kiwi and lime one cus other scents are not for clarifying) because clarify shampoo can strip the oil out of your hair. I know your hair should have some oil to protect it but would you rather leave the jelly on your scalp and continue damage your hair or have temporary dry hair? I mean it&#x27;s better than using dawn, right? it&#x27;s for your hair after all, it&#x27;s meant to be gentle enough for your hair ( that&#x27;s what I thought) . I did this procedure twice with conditioner each time because I put literally half jar in my hair and scalp and want to make sure nothing left in my hair. I should have do it one more time but I was too tired from the 6 washes before this. by the way if you have bleached hair and would like to keep your ash tone, please use coconut oil instead of olive oil because coconut oil doesn&#x27;t have a yellow color like olive oil does. the yellow-ness will stain and wash off your ash tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this crap when I was going out for a vacation because it is cheap in Walmart. I didn&#x27;t know what the hell is it but it smells like coconut oil and it is so greasy so I assumed it&#x27;s normal. The day before I actually travel, I had bleached my hair not once but twice, so I figured I should do something to treat it. I put almost half jar in my hair and scalp over night thinking that I would have better hair formy vacation and feeling so proud of myself for finding such a good way. I applied it with my hand and when I washed my hand I couldn&#x27;t get it off and it made the sink so greasy. But I was like, whatever, room service&#x27;s gonna have a lot of work to do. and it said it has coconut oil, it&#x27;s good for my skin so I shouldn&#x27;t care to get rid if it, so I went to bed. I woke up specially early that morning because I was so excited to see a head of healthy looking hair with brand new color. ( or maybe it was because the product is too greasy to sleep with) I jumped into the shower and toweled my hair since I normally do my makeup before hair. when I was about to blow dry my hair, I ran my finger through my hair and I noticed that I didn&#x27;t wash off the product. I thought I just didn&#x27;t rinse it well so I went back to the shower with my makeup on hoping to get rid of all of it. but after it I still couldn&#x27;t get the freaking thing off. I jumped back in to the shower and used hand soap 3 times hoping it will be washed off. HOWEVER, it was still there!! not even lost a bit!!! I mean really?! I didn&#x27;t know what to do so I went out with super greasy and wet-looking hair. so disgusting.</li>
    <li> I think this is the worst product that you could ever use on your hair. Unless you are looking for greasy, smelly and dirty-looking hair this product is not for you. It smells nice in the jar but once you apply it, it has a smell of petroleum. It feels like wax, I could probably wax my tires with it... It s just so disgusting and impossible to get it off your hair.... I wish I read the reviews here before buying it. I guess I will be washing my hair with dishwashing detergent. I feel like crying right now. It is definitely not coconut oil. Do not buy it by any means.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair but a dry scalp so I purchased and applied this without any research - bad idea! My hair is now heavy and matted down like the George Cloony character in &amp;#34;Oh Brother...&amp;#34; that used &amp;#34;Dapper Dan&amp;#34;. Now that I&#x27;ve read these reviews, I&#x27;m concerned about how long it will take to wash it out. Until then, I guess I&#x27;ll be sporting the &amp;#34;Pat Riley from the early &#x27;80s Lakers&amp;#34; look! No bueno...</li>
    <li> Great smell and long lastin jar</li>
    <li> Grew up using this product! Love it</li>
    <li> I like this.  It&#x27;s light weight and is really good for twists and a general hair dress.  It&#x27;s very inexpensive and all of the products in this line works the same to me and is worth a try, especially for two strand twists.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the intent of using it as a coconut oil deep conditioner. I put a good deal on my hair and then rinsed and rinsed and rinsed because it wasn&#x27;t coming out. I got out of the shower attempted to brush it and then washed it again, it still didn&#x27;t work. My hair was already a sticky matted mess and I felt like I had washed it with butter (turns out I basically did) but I decided to sleep on it and deal with it in the morning, when I woke up I actually wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair was still wet or not bc it was so greasy and stringy. So after washing again, I called the company. They informed (after a whole string of problems) that their product was actually intended for use on African American women&#x27;s which is fine and I understand except THEY DIDN&#x27;T SAY THAT ON THE BOTTLE OR THE APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS OR ANYWHERE and also that you were supposed to use only a dab which is fine and I understand EXCEPT THEY DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE BOTTLE OR THE APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS OR ANYWHERE and that it&#x27;s meant to be a leave in conditioner not a deep conditioner which is fine and I understand EXCEPT THEY DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE BOTTLE OR THE APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS OR ANYWHERE and that. After three more washes, two of which with Dawn dish soap aka the stuff that is able to remove oil from penguins, I&#x27;m still left with a matted, greasy, unbrushable mess, please excuse me why a cry over my long, poorly-moisturizer, petroleum jelly-ruined mane.</li>
    <li> It literally took me several hair washes to get this all out. It was ridiculous-and I only used a small dollop. It smells pleasant though-but I would say only get this if your hair is wild, and only apply it to the ends to get moisture. Otherwise you will end up with greasy matted hair for days like me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to soften my feet. Massage good amount before bed, pair of socks, BAM soft feet in the AM.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this is not coconut oil, despite what it says on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a mishap with this once where my hair felt super oily afterwards and I thought it was just because I left it in my hair for too long... after an intense bleaching/coloring session and a hair cut from someone who dumbly used a blow dryer and straightening wand on my naturally curly hair--I figured now was the perfect time to use this stuff since my hair was so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my hair feels like a giant oil slick right now. It just looks *wet* and extremely stringy. I&#x27;m probably going to have to use dish detergent just to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for all hair types, but definitely not recommended for thick, curly, white hair.</li>
    <li> Wife love it for African American hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to call anybody dumb, but it is ignorant to buy a product without reading the ingredients or purpose of the product and then talk about how terrible it is. Truth is, it is not a terrible product as it works very well for many many people and it is CERTAINLY not misleading. It says &amp;#34;Coconut Oil HAIR CONDITIONER&amp;#34; on the label. Not coconut oil. Those of you giving it a bad review for not being coconut oil are ignorant because that&#x27;s not what it is and nowhere does this product state that it is coconut oil. Read the freaking ingredients, people. And while you&#x27;re at it, read the instructions on how to use it. Goodness gracious. That being said, I have never used this product and probably never will. Why? You may ask? Because I did this crazy thing called READING THE INGREDIENTS and don&#x27;t want Vaseline all up in my hair. Read up on what you&#x27;re putting in your hair folks, it&#x27;s not always the product&#x27;s fault. I&#x27;ve never felt such a strong need to defend a product I&#x27;ve never used but these comments on here are really irritating.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely horrible! My hair is not made for grease and like everyone else i thought it was real coconut oil. They failed to mention the petroleum in this product. It&#x27;s very hard to get out, so far olive oil or super de-greaser dish soap is slowly working, with hot water. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you want greasy hair.</li>
    <li> It said new on the package but it arrived with the jar popped and looked like someone passed their finger through it</li>
</ol>
