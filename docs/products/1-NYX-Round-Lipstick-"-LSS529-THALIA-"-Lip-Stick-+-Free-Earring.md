      <li>It is just that amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice color</li>
      <li>but it would have been nice if it had stayed intact.</li>

      <li>Perfect lipstick for a neutral and natural look</li>
      <li>i am fair skinned blonde to light brown hair and this color look great on me!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
      <li>They are very similar and are very beautiful colors.</li>
      <li>I gave it three stars though because it has kind of a metallic sheen to it that in my opinion makes it look cheap.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>love this lips</li>
      <li>I just ordered two more tubes because it became my go to lipstick.</li>
      <li>I love this lip color.</li>
      <li>One of my top favorite shades.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t try yet but thank love the color.</li>
      <li>LOVE this color &amp;</li>
      <li>I really love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>But with this color, it is a beautiful natural color that compliment my complexion and lips.</li>
      <li>Perfect nude pink shade.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice with a complimentary lip liner, but I don&#x27;t like it with a matching one.</li>
      <li>It is always sold out, I am so glad that I am able to order and quickly receive this lipstick as it is now</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and makes my lips feel moisturized which is great especially in the winter.</li>
      <li>Perfect for brunettes with a little bronzer and a bit of a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, smooth feel and it lasts.</li>
      <li>Nice color one coat goes on sheer and as you add more it becomes more opaque.</li>
      <li>and I was so excited to try it</li>
      <li>so I ordered it and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, the texture is soft, and it goes on nice!</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite shade of lipstick.</li>
      <li>I am real light skin with big lips</li>
      <li>Nice basic neutral lipstick.</li>
      <li>However, if you apply minimal amounts and then top it off with some lip balm or something it looks more natural and sexy-I think.</li>
      <li>so therefore certain colors do not look right on me.</li>
      <li>i rarely wear brown lip stick and was really dissapointed, i wanted a mauve.</li>
      <li>but this color is so pretty.</li>
      <li>It wears exactly as it looks on Pinterest.</li>
      <li>Very flattering too!</li>
      <li>I am a college student with limited funds with a passion for make-up so this dupe is amazing to look fabulous but still not overspend for a lipstick that is very similar and over marketed and hyped up by make-up gurus.</li>
      <li>Very purplish and off.  </li>
      <li>It shipped to me really fast</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing feel.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color, looks just like my lips, only shinier and healthier.</li>
      <li>To make it look a little better you can use a lip liner.</li>
      <li>but it ended up being a light pink that was almost neon.</li>
      <li>The end is a clear plastic piece with a sample of the lipstick color inside it.</li>
      <li>wow</li>
      <li>It was a little more on the lilac/purple side than I expected.</li>
      <li>Great to wear when your eye make-up is heavy or dramatic.</li>
      <li>not the color shown, its brown not pink, a sort brown mauve.</li>
      <li>the color shown here as Thalia is one of the other colors, which i got and really like.</li>

<li> It is a beige with a touch of pink.</li>
<li> Little earrings were included with the lipstic.</li>
<li> My only complaint is with the case which was poorly made.</li>
<li> I usually wear a lot of eye makeup</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I kept seeing instagram pictures using this, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s nice with a complimentary lip liner, but I don&#x27;t like it with a matching one.</li>
    <li> When buying online you always take a risk with color accuracy. I saw this on Pinterest and loved it so I ordered it and was not disappointed.I would describe the color as mauve. I just ordered two more tubes because it became my go to lipstick. It&#x27;s a great lipstick for the price. My only complaint is with the case which was poorly made. The end is a clear plastic piece with a sample of the lipstick color inside it. That piece broke off. It didn&#x27;t interfere with the functionality at all but it would have been nice if it had stayed intact.</li>
    <li> Perfect nude pink shade.  Great texture on the lips</li>
    <li> Little earrings were included with the lipstic. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice color one coat goes on sheer and as you add more it becomes more opaque.</li>
    <li> One of my fave lipsticks. Lasts all day &amp; its a great color on.</li>
    <li> Found this lipstick on Pinterest and was surprised to see how little it cost. It wears exactly as it looks on Pinterest. Perfect for brunettes with a little bronzer and a bit of a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need the earrings, but thank you anyway.</li>
    <li> It was a little more on the lilac/purple side than I expected.</li>
    <li> It is always sold out, I am so glad that I am able to order and quickly receive this lipstick as it is now my go to!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lipstick. I am a frugal shopper and I found it to be a dupe for MAC Brave. They are very similar and are very beautiful colors. NYX Thalia is $7.70 where Mac Brave is $16.00. I am a college student with limited funds with a passion for make-up so this dupe is amazing to look fabulous but still not overspend for a lipstick that is very similar and over marketed and hyped up by make-up gurus. I wear it to work, school, in the evening, to graduations. It is just that amazing. PURCHASE IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT ! It shipped to me really fast and I was so excited to try it that I wore it around my house with no place to go. To make it look a little better you can use a lip liner. I used NYX Expresso, it is about $3.00 at a beauty supply store or $3.50 on  http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/p-117-slim-lip-pencil.aspx</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t try yet but thank love the color.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying a stick of lipstick. I am usually all about the gloss but this color is so pretty. It is a beige with a touch of pink. It provides the perfect natural tone for lips. Great to wear when your eye make-up is heavy or dramatic.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color, looks just like my lips, only shinier and healthier. Very moisturizing feel. I really love this lipstick.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color &amp; my store is out of it so it&#x27;s a great purchase for me</li>
    <li> One of my top favorite shades. Great for Olive skin tone!</li>
    <li> Really, love this product the color was wonderful and I found it on You-Tube from&lt;br /&gt;an advertisement while looking for something...wow</li>
    <li> I love this lip color. It&#x27;s pretty, the texture is soft, and it goes on nice! My complaint is that the color does not last long enough!! But that&#x27;s it. It came in quickly on time and in perfect condition. Would buy again from the seller.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. I am real light skin with big lips lol so therefore certain colors do not look right on me. But with this color, it is a beautiful natural color that compliment my complexion and lips. My boyfriend always complained about certain colors I would try, but he likes this one and so do I.</li>

    <li> love this lips stick i am fair skinned blonde to light brown hair and this color look great on me!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite shade of lipstick. I usually wear a lot of eye makeup so I prefer softer shades on my lips. It&#x27;s very smooth and makes my lips feel moisturized which is great especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> not the color shown, its brown not pink, a sort brown mauve. i rarely wear brown lip stick and was really dissapointed, i wanted a mauve. the color shown here as Thalia is one of the other colors, which i got and really like.</li>

    <li> Perfect lipstick for a neutral and natural look I loveeeee it!</li>
