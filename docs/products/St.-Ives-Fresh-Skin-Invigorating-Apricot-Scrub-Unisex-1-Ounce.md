      <li>Honestly, I just ordered this product as filler</li>
      <li>Ives Apricot Scrub in all its incarnations is a no frills, inoffensively scented, highly effective scrub.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Cheap and effective--what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>I love this product I will be ordering someone</li>
      <li>The product seems authentic, but is misleading..</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;There are beauty products for everyone, sure, and many are very loyal to brands they&#x27;ve bought for decades, just ask my Grandmother. :-)</li>
      <li>It works ok as a scrub, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $3.14, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $1 if I saw this in a store.</li>
      <li>It gives you a great clean, soft result.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Folate free?</li>
      <li>I attribute it to my skin being so smooth and almost wrinkle free.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s so cheap</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It gets your face smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I thought the price was cheap and bought two.</li>
      <li>And so far she has loved it.</li>
      <li>I saw this product and just assumed it was the full size bottle since that&#x27;s what the full size bottle costs!</li>
      <li>The one I&#x27;ve used for going on twenty years is good St. Ives, which I&#x27;m now buying at Dollar General.  </li>
      <li>It feels clean and touchable.</li>
      <li>Check.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your face, neck, etc feeling super clean?</li>
      <li>&#x27;s a really cool thing:  </li>
      <li>I really like this item!!</li>
      <li>Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub Unisex, 1 Ounce&amp;#34</li>
      <li>bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two cautions:  Most scrubs on the market are dumbed down so we don&#x27;t hurt ourselves, and just aren&#x27;t very effective, but this one is GRITTY!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE moisture and oil and while this is not oily, it does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t eat it ;)</li>
      <li>stuff, even with daily use, never irritates my skin, and my face feels fresh and clean</li>
      <li>thank you very muchI</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot...</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>Its amazing but the thing is its small</li>
      <li>Over the many years I&#x27;ve endured this planet and the wrath from the atmosphere, I&#x27;ve only found one facial scrub that did</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>You could really damage your skin if you go too far.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with the product--it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so good that you need to be careful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This bottle is very tiny (about the size of my middle finger) and is halfway full.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great natural (and not too strong/perfumey) smell too.</li>
      <li>This is the most ridiculous issue I&#x27;ve ever had with amazon in my life.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re allergic to apricots or any other ingredients, you should certainly try this product.</li>
      <li>Previously, I was using another &amp;#34;apricot scrub&amp;#34; manufactured by a &amp;#34;large French cosmetics company&amp;#34;, the kind that comes with a scrubbing pad in the bottle... it was too thin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exfoliating scrub for years as a part of my skincare regimen. It feels good and smells great.</li>
    <li> This bottle is very tiny (about the size of my middle finger) and is halfway full. It works ok as a scrub, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $3.14, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $1 if I saw this in a store.</li>
    <li> Good item. I appreciate this.  Lovely item. works superb. But it needs more publicity. so try and give it the best it requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I thought the price was cheap and bought two. It turned out they are of travel size, which makes the price way too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with (major-brand) facial cleaners/ scrubs before, since my face skin is extremely sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, even with daily use, never irritates my skin, and my face feels fresh and clean afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great natural (and not too strong/perfumey) smell too.</li>
    <li> smells good make your skin South I love this product I will be ordering someone thank you very muchI will be ordering 2 this time</li>
    <li> Its amazing but the thing is its small and i expected it like a regular size however i see the changes on my face after i wash it my face is brighter and also it removes the oilness from your face too.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for only 1oz product. I have never written a review on Amazon before but i was so disappointed when getting this products from the seller. It&#x27;s way too expensive for 1oz travel size i bought in walmart. Scam!</li>
    <li> The product seems authentic, but is misleading..&lt;br /&gt;Instead of labeling your item &amp;#34;St. Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub Unisex, 1 Ounce&amp;#34; it&#x27;s better to say &amp;#34; Travel Size Only&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This is a more correct representation of the product. Because it&#x27;s overpriced as the way it&#x27;s advertised. Drug stores sell 6 oz for $3.99</li>
    <li> Thee are tiny and maybe offer 1-2 uses per bottle. Read carefully, buyer beware, this is misleading to the buyer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I attribute it to my skin being so smooth and almost wrinkle free.  It cleans all the dead skin away and is gentle enough to use every day.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Was tricked into thinking this was the standard sized tube because the price is $7. What showed up was a mini 1-oz tube that only costs a couple bucks at a local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scrub! It gives you a great clean, soft result. Will be using this product for life &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> this is a excellent scrub and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts</li>
    <li> This is the best facial product I have ever used... EVER!!  I have tried a lot of expensive items but they all dry up my skin or cause breakouts.  For some reason, this is perfect for me. I LOVE moisture and oil and while this is not oily, it does not dry out my skin. It feels clean and touchable.</li>
    <li> I really like this item!! :D&lt;br /&gt;It gets your face smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> I saw this product and just assumed it was the full size bottle since that&#x27;s what the full size bottle costs! This is the most ridiculous issue I&#x27;ve ever had with amazon in my life. I will admit I didn&#x27;t look at the ounces, but come on, 1oz for that price!! I can get this size for $1 or $1.50 at the store. I am outraged and will make sure to never use this seller again. Read your product descriptions carefully people!</li>
    <li> Over the many years I&#x27;ve endured this planet and the wrath from the atmosphere, I&#x27;ve only found one facial scrub that did it&#x27;s job - St. Ives Apricot Scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Folate free? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your face, neck, etc feeling super clean? Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are beauty products for everyone, sure, and many are very loyal to brands they&#x27;ve bought for decades, just ask my Grandmother. :-) Unless you&#x27;re allergic to apricots or any other ingredients, you should certainly try this product. Previously, I was using another &amp;#34;apricot scrub&amp;#34; manufactured by a &amp;#34;large French cosmetics company&amp;#34;, the kind that comes with a scrubbing pad in the bottle... it was too thin. You&#x27;d try to lather your face up with the product, and it would just seep down your cheeks, to the bottom of the shower, and down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone knows, some of these products are pricey! And I don&#x27;t like throwing money away down the literal drain. The St. Ives is thick and spreads well. You don&#x27;t need much. Think of it as cream cheese for your face! Just don&#x27;t eat it ;)</li>
    <li> I love this scrub, it keeps my face clear and gives it a beautiful glow. It should really only be 1 dollar since it is so small.</li>
    <li> For the price you pay you can get a regular size. It is very small and is only practical if you are really tight on space for travel.</li>
    <li> It is really a great product for me...It is working for my skin....I use this product 2-3 times a week. I am happy with this product...I am feeling glow on my skin..Thanks a lot...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of scrubs--from drugstore products such as Noxema and Olay to higher end brands ones like Lancome and Clarins to a really icky sugar based one I got somewhere.  The one I&#x27;ve used for going on twenty years is good St. Ives, which I&#x27;m now buying at Dollar General.  (I do have fond memories of an Olay scrub that actually heated up but I can&#x27;t find it any more.  Sigh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Ives Apricot Scrub in all its incarnations is a no frills, inoffensively scented, highly effective scrub.  I prefer the tubes over the jars and I keep one in the shower.  It&#x27;s so cheap, I have a couple of other tubes stashed in the suitcase I usually use and in the guest bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two cautions:  Most scrubs on the market are dumbed down so we don&#x27;t hurt ourselves, and just aren&#x27;t very effective, but this one is GRITTY!  Don&#x27;t overscrub.  You could really damage your skin if you go too far.  The other is to please, please, please, keep those little grits out of your eyes.  There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with the product--it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so good that you need to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a really cool thing:  I had a jar of this stuck in the back of a forgotten drawer for ten years or so.  Do you know, it was still pliable and creamy?  Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and effective--what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Honestly, I just ordered this product as filler so I could qualify for free shipping. But after we received the apricot scrub in the mail my wife thought she might as well try it out. And so far she has loved it. She says it is great at exfoliating without being too harsh/gritty on the skin.This product is great at removing blackheads and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. My wife says this product is a must</li>
