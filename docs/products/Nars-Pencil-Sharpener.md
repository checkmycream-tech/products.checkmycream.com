    <li> Great sharpener, works great. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This sharpener is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe how well this works. I have struggled for years with lip pencils that are chewed up by sharpeners and only sharpen on one side. I finally googled the problem and found many replies saying that it is not the pencil but the sharpener. Well, sure enough, upon the recommendation of many people, I bought this sharpener and lo and behold! It works! Every pencil now sharpens evenly all the way around. I could not be happier to find I no longer have to toss expensive pencils because of chewed up, uneven wood. It is like a miracle.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Nars pencils, I use them a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because I think it&#x27;s silly that I have to buy an entirely new sharpener for this line!</li>
    <li> This works. It&#x27;s a higher quality makeup pencil eyeliner sharpener. Works for pencil eyebrow pencils too.</li>
    <li> Best sharpener around. I have Sephora Jumbo Liners and even the Sephora pencil sharpener doesn&#x27;t do a good job...this Nars pencil sharpens jumbo pencils the best and for even regular sized eyeliners, you get a crisp, sharp cut.</li>

    <li> Love this NARS makeup sharpener. I am huge fan of NAR products. Very durable and sharpens my eyeliners nicely .</li>
    <li> Done ruining my pencils by sharpening them with cheap drugstore quality sharpeners. All they did was break the outer casing and bust the color tips out thus shortening my pencils drastically! I went online looking for the best way to sharpen my pencils and someone mentioned the NARS sharpener. Needless to say, my pencils sharpened effortlessly and they look brand new!!! I tossed out my cheap drugstore sharpeners and will be using this one on all of my eye pencils from now on.</li>
