      <li>This product is amazing</li>
      <li>I can honestly say rapid lash works, period.</li>
      <li>Gladys in Edmond, OK</li>
      <li>Overall, I have been very happy with both the price and results.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of the Rapid Lash product, because I think that product may have worked better.</li>
      <li>My lashes have been geting more sparse since menopause and this is making them thicker and longer.</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Hopefully, you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did:)</li>
      <li>After menopause my lashes and eyebrows just seemd to get sparser and thinner,  After using this product for 6 weeks, my eyebrows still need more growing</li>
      <li>Wish me luck :)</li>
      <li>I just reordered some more, love it, love it, love it</li>
      <li>they almost hit the top of my eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>i LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I always feel safe ordering from Amazon.    </li>
      <li>were any more gaps in my lash line than what i had before beginning to use this product.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the product,arrived in good condition,works well for me,will re - order when necessary!</li>
      <li>I chose to try this despite those reports because they number of reviewers that reported great results far outnumbered those experiencing side effects, so</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with this little indulgence I found :)</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and does work.</li>
      <li>with the full price item, I went for it, figured one more</li>
      <li>However, I purchased it primarily for my eyebrows, which have always been sparse, and then overtweezed.  </li>
      <li>The original tube has lasted for 60 days.</li>
      <li>lol Not completely but growing!</li>
      <li>The full effects took about 6 weeks to achieve.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is definitely the BEST deal around and in the future I will start taking advantage of the 2pk offer.</li>
      <li>Most assumed it was a new mascara.</li>
      <li>Long lashes are great but eye infections not so much.</li>
      <li>i have noticeable lashes for the first time in my life!</li>
      <li>i feel a bit of a tingle on my lids, like an itch sort of, but its worth it to me.</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of lash lengthening products over the years, and although they have all worked, the side effects have not made them worth it.  </li>
      <li>I say it&#x27;s worth a try for the price.</li>
      <li>This product is so worth the money.</li>
      <li>With this price, it&#x27;s worth the continued use.</li>
      <li>Now, it did not create very thick eyebrows, but my eyebrows have filled in QUITE A BIT...and they look positively normal now, so I am very happy.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it for anyone who wants to grow thicker, longer eye lashes and more vibrant eyebrows.    </li>
      <li>This product truly works if used consistently.  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t ever want to be without it because it really works!</li>
      <li>Perhaps I haven&#x27;t given it enough time to work its magic.  </li>
      <li>i am using my second bottle and bought two more for backup.</li>
      <li>I figure those side effects are most likely some sort of sensitivity</li>
      <li>I have to say that after most of the Rapid Lash product in my tube was gone, I combined what was left of it with another brow revitalizer whose brand I believe was called Ardell.  </li>
      <li>[much cheaper!])  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend and I split the set and hers are much longer, too!  </li>
      <li>My eyelashes are much fuller also!</li>
      <li>I did lose lashes during the first couple of weeks of using the product.  </li>
      <li>But after using this for 3- 4 weeks I began noticing a huge difference - they are now long and full.  </li>
      <li>After reading all the positive reviews I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this.  </li>
      <li>i hav experienced the loss of some individual lashes while using this product but the loss hasnt been so extreme that there are/</li>
      <li>My lashes are long, thick and beautiful!</li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>If you happen to forget more then a few days in a row you will see the progress you&#x27;ve made quickly fade.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube and found a huge difference in my eye lashes even after one tube.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 weeks on my upper &amp; lower lashes and it has done a fabulous job.  </li>
      <li>It did take about 8 weeks for me to really notice a difference, but now I can really see that my lashes are way longer than before....</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really help much with the volume of my lashes though.</li>
      <li>This product really does work.</li>
      <li>The Rapid Lash did work very well on my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>I have really noticed my eyelashes are longer and darker.  </li>
      <li>The length was really noticeable on the lower lashes.  </li>
      <li>This product really does work.</li>
      <li>This product REALLY works.  </li>
      <li>I have found, like some of the other reviewers, that it did not create more volume in my lashes, but it has made them longer.  </li>
      <li>My stylist noticed that I have more dark eyebrows and she has fewer gray ones to remove.  </li>
      <li>BUT, it is not worth it to me to have them all fall out many times.</li>
      <li>My mascara gets all over my glasses, so I have to clean them constantly...and the tube lasts a long time--about 5 months....</li>
      <li>After only about a month of using RapidLash, my lashes REALLY became longer!!  </li>
      <li>new brow hairs now rarely come in white, and are filling in.</li>
      <li>Actually, there was a mix-up from the person who send it and Amazon took care of the problem quickly and professionally.  </li>
      <li>Once you shed, new ones are coming in.  </li>
      <li>but when you apply mascara, WOW!</li>
      <li>I am getting ready to start my next 4 weeks with a new supply....</li>
      <li>I have a few light lashes growing where I had none before.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve truly been surprised...</li>
      <li>bought rapidlash and wow.</li>
      <li>so I have to carefully select my purchases, but this is worth it.  </li>
      <li>When compared to other comparable products, the price is right.</li>
      <li>So it comes down to figuring out if it&#x27;s worth it for you.  </li>
      <li>I am now noticing a lot of new lash growth and thickening of my entire the lash line.</li>
      <li>My lashes are getting longer and I have noticed that I am getting new lashes at the inside and outside corners of both eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks to date, but I noticed results in new length in only one week!</li>
      <li>It has made my eyes very itchy and dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There has been insufficient time involved between my receving the product and now for me to express an opinion.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but now after using this product for 4 months I am still amazed....I just purchased another tube for maintenance and one for my daughter to try. It did take about 8 weeks for me to really notice a difference, but now I can really see that my lashes are way longer than before....they almost hit the top of my eyelash curler. It didn&#x27;t really help much with the volume of my lashes though. But I don&#x27;t care...the added length is truly amazing. One note however; it does make my eyes a little red and itchy when I use it but I will suffer through these side affects.</li>
    <li> This product does take about about 8 weeks before you see results, so please be patient.  I have found, like some of the other reviewers, that it did not create more volume in my lashes, but it has made them longer.  However, I purchased it primarily for my eyebrows, which have always been sparse, and then overtweezed.  In fact, I had one area on one eyebrow where hair just did not grow.  The Rapid Lash did work very well on my eyebrows.  Now, it did not create very thick eyebrows, but my eyebrows have filled in QUITE A BIT...and they look positively normal now, so I am very happy.  I keep using the product for maintenance.  I have to say that after most of the Rapid Lash product in my tube was gone, I combined what was left of it with another brow revitalizer whose brand I believe was called Ardell.  I will be buying more of the Rapid Lash product, because I think that product may have worked better.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Rapid Lash and I love it!  We recently spent two weeks in Hawaii and I never wore mascara.  My lashes are long, thick and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to beauty products and most fall short of my expectations. This product is amazing I did not notice a dramatic difference till my family, friends and co workers started complimenting me. Most assumed it was a new mascara. I can honestly say rapid lash works, period. This product is so worth the money.</li>
    <li> After a month of using Rapid Lash I have seen just a little improvement.  I have a few light lashes growing where I had none before.  I do think that if I keep using the product all my lashes will continue to improve in length and thickness. With this price, it&#x27;s worth the continued use.</li>
    <li> I started using RapidLash several months ago. I apply it  every night to my lashes and brows. I have really noticed my eyelashes are longer and darker.  I haven&#x27;t noticed as big of a change to my eyebrows, but they are somewhat darker and starting to feel in. I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Who isn&#x27;t?  Every item promises everything and like you Iwas tired of throwing my money down the drain.  When I saw this one at half price and compared the product, the size, etc. with the full price item, I went for it, figured one more and that&#x27;s it.  This product DOES lenghten eyelahes simply because it prevents you from \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; the ones you currently have.  Therefore no shedding, they grow!  Once you shed, new ones are coming in.  It does not darken them so mascara is still a need but when you apply mascara, WOW!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks to date, but I noticed results in new length in only one week! I am now noticing a lot of new lash growth and thickening of my entire the lash line. Also, my lashes have a natural curve to them now and appear to be darker at the base. I love this stuff; Woot woot!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product,arrived in good condition,works well for me,will re - order when necessary!</li>
    <li> Actually I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been making my eyelashes longer but I can feel making them stronger. I&#x27;ve been using Rapid lash for almost 4weeks.  First day I received, I used both of upper and bottom eyelashes, unfortunately, I found that around my bottom eyelashes were changed red in the next mornign. So I stopped using it for bottom. In addition, I feel my left eyelid is itching. But I won&#x27;t stop using utill I finish 2 off.  [[ASIN:B001S7EXPC RapidLash Eyelash Renewal Serum 0.1oz]]</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube and found a huge difference in my eye lashes even after one tube. My lashes are very long and people have commented on them and asked me what I&#x27;ve used. I also use the serum on my eyebrows.  It works slower on the brows but it seems to help.   I&#x27;ll probably use it forever.  Actually, there was a mix-up from the person who send it and Amazon took care of the problem quickly and professionally.  I always feel safe ordering from Amazon.    Gladys in Edmond, OK</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and I have noticed that my lashes are a bit longer(not thicker). However, it&#x27;s been a pain to remember to apply every night(which you must do carefully because it stings if you get in your eyes!). If you happen to forget more then a few days in a row you will see the progress you&#x27;ve made quickly fade. It has made my eyes very itchy and dry. Frankly, this is the only serum I have tried and maybe they all have the same side effects? I say it&#x27;s worth a try for the price. Hopefully, you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did:)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to try the prescription one, so gave this a try..just for grins! I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, lost my eyebrows in 30&#x27;s and had they tatooed on. Saved me tons of time..but are getting patchy &amp; fading over the years. For whatever I was thinking *that* day...ordered this before have my tats redone...*my eyebrows are growing back! lol Not completely but growing! My eyelashes are much fuller also! I&#x27;ve truly been surprised...would reccomend for sure!</li>
    <li> I was using a product that was 3x the cost, and it turned my eyelids red. my lashes were growing, but worried about the redness. bought rapidlash and wow. my eyelashes top and bottom are at least twice as long. my graying eyebrows were thinning,too. so i put rapidlash on those too. new brow hairs now rarely come in white, and are filling in. really really impressed. and oh yeah, no more red lids either.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rapid Lash for over 4 weeks and I have thicker eyelashes and thicker eyebrows.  Because of my age, 62, my eyebrows had thinned and were lighter in color than I like.  I started using Rapid Lash and my eyebrows are thicker and black again.    I have had no problems with Rapid Lash towards my eyes, eyelids, etc.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to grow thicker, longer eye lashes and more vibrant eyebrows.    I am getting ready to start my next 4 weeks with a new supply....</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I could see a difference in 2 weeks. After 6 weeks, my lashes are so long I have gone to using it every other day. The original tube has lasted for 60 days.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 weeks on my upper &amp; lower lashes and it has done a fabulous job.  For reasons I still don&#x27;t know my eyelashes had become sparse &amp; short. But after using this for 3- 4 weeks I began noticing a huge difference - they are now long and full.  I&#x27;ve now begun using this on my eyebrows as well.      Fortunately I have not experienced any of the side effects that some reviewers have mentioned.  I chose to try this despite those reports because they number of reviewers that reported great results far outnumbered those experiencing side effects, so I figure those side effects are most likely some sort of sensitivity that a small % of the population experiences.    Amazon is definitely the BEST deal around and in the future I will start taking advantage of the 2pk offer.</li>
    <li> This product actually works at a fraction of the cost of other products.  While there wasn&#x27;t any noticeable thickening of my eyelashes, I did have noticeable lengthening.  The full effects took about 6 weeks to achieve.  I did lose lashes during the first couple of weeks of using the product.  Overall, I have been very happy with both the price and results.</li>
    <li> iv had my tube for about 3 months now and its about empty. its lasted me so long becus i havnt used it every nite. it does do what the packaging claims. my lashes are noticeably longer and now regular mascara looks much more dramatic than it did before. the results are so obvious that one night i went to a party and even in the dimly lit room my friend noticed that i had mascara on. i did hav to apply the product to my lash line regularly for about 6 weeks before i saw those results. also rapid lash will cause irritation to any skin that it come in contact with. it burns but once the area is rinsed with cold water the irritation leaves and as far as i kno there is no long term irritation from rapid lash coming into contact with skin. i hav experienced the loss of some individual lashes while using this product but the loss hasnt been so extreme that there are/were any more gaps in my lash line than what i had before beginning to use this product. i will buy another tube of rapid lash to keep the length that it has given me becus the packaging instructions say to do so</li>
    <li> I used to use Latisse, however the $100+ expense ever month and half was not feasible for my budget.  I saw this at Ulta Beauty Store and tried it ($49.99).  After one month I saw a noticeable difference in the color and length.  My lashes were darker, shinier and stronger.  The length was really noticeable on the lower lashes.  I&#x27;m on my 4th tube of Rapid Lash (exclusively through Amazon [much cheaper!])  My lashes are so long, my sunglasses have lash markings from my mascara.  Several friends have noticed my lashes and asked what I&#x27;m doing to them.    My lashes hardly fall out when I&#x27;m removing my mascara (Prestige Long Lashes) and I&#x27;m very happy with this little indulgence I found :)</li>
    <li> Rapid Lash has begun to show its work.  I can see small changes in my eyelashes as they look longer with only a small amount of mascara.  My eyebrows, too, are thickening and darkening.  My stylist noticed that I have more dark eyebrows and she has fewer gray ones to remove.  I am pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 30 days and I see an improvement already!  I can&#x27;t wait till 60 days.  My lashes are getting longer and I have noticed that I am getting new lashes at the inside and outside corners of both eyes.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> After only about a month of using RapidLash, my lashes REALLY became longer!!  My girlfriend and I split the set and hers are much longer, too!  My mascara gets all over my glasses, so I have to clean them constantly...and the tube lasts a long time--about 5 months....I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Rapid Lash for ummmm probably well over a month ( I lost track of the time)  and I am very satisfied.  I used Latise before and it was great also but I cant afford it.My husband would be Furious if he knew that I spent 150.00 on the Latise.....   shhhhhh our secret.  I can just hear him now... who the heck cares what your eye lashes look like!!!    Oh ya the review...     Two tubes of this for well under what the latise cost me.  I am still on my fist tube, it lasts a long time.  I will certainly purchase it again.  I usually dont make comments about things, even if I am dissatisfied but this stuff really works.  I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of lash lengthening products over the years, and although they have all worked, the side effects have not made them worth it.  I bought Rapid Lash hoping that things would be different with this product, but alas, they were not.  The price for the product is reasonable, especially since some other products go for around $100 a tube.  Rapid Lash did make my lashes longer, but not necessarily thicker.  And as cautioned on the insert, the  product did darken the skin around my eyes, and did make my eyes itch somewhat.  So it comes down to figuring out if it&#x27;s worth it for you.  Some women don&#x27;t mind the darkening skin because they use a concealer.  I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup, and only wear it if I have to, so I&#x27;m not sure if the longer lashes are worth the side effects.  Only you can decide.</li>
    <li> Used product for 3 weeks. Did seem to improve my lashes.  However, I had 2 eye infections and some of the skin started peeling off my eyelid.  I had to stop using after these results. Long lashes are great but eye infections not so much. I have to say that my sister is using it but had no problems. So maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> This product really does work. My lashes have been geting more sparse since menopause and this is making them thicker and longer. It&#x27;s also helping my brows fill in too.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. I have used it two different times, and have had the same results both times. Yes, it made my eyelashes longer - for a time. Then they ALL fell out after maybe a month of using Rapid Lash! I stopped using it when they started falling out. They grew back again after about a month (and at the longer length). Several months later I decided to try again. After using it for a few weeks, they ALL fell out again. Grew back after about a month, but grew back at my normal short length. So I have stopped using it, and now after maybe 6 months of using it last, my eyelashes are falling out again!     So, yes this product works in making eyelashes grow longer. BUT, it is not worth it to me to have them all fall out many times.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this.  It&#x27;s been 5-wks and there&#x27;s absolutely no difference in my eyelashes! I did experience some irritation. My eyes feel a little sensitive and it seems like some lashes are falling out. I&#x27;m nervous about continuing to use Rapid lash but I will keep using it til I finish both tubes, unless more lashes fall out! Wish me luck :)</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews on this product I thought it would help my skimpy lashes and brows.  It didn&#x27;t!  The only thing it did was make my lashes a little stiffer and at the price I paid for it I felt I got was ripped off.</li>
    <li> Using the product everyday, it was about three weeks and I could see a difference. Then I went on maintenance and used the product two or three times per week. It&#x27;s still working. It, also, lasts longer than I thought it would. I used it for about three months before having to reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 4 weeks now.  I have noticed maybe just a slight change in my eyelashes. Perhaps I haven&#x27;t given it enough time to work its magic.  When compared to other comparable products, the price is right.</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply and does work. My eyelashes look like they did when I was younger and had them.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this product. i am using my second bottle and bought two more for backup. i don&#x27;t ever want to be without it because it really works! i have noticeable lashes for the first time in my life! :)  i feel a bit of a tingle on my lids, like an itch sort of, but its worth it to me. i have had no other adverse reaction.  i am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Eyes got red all around skin.  Not sure if I am going to start again.</li>
    <li> This product really does work. It took about 8 weeks to start to notice a difference. My lashes are longer and darker. I haven&#x27;t noticed any fullness in then but I am over all happy with results.</li>
    <li> While this product does make your existing lashes very long, it doesn&#x27;t make lashes that are missing grow.  That is why I purchased it, so I&#x27;m disappointed.  If you just want longer lashes, this product does work!  It doesn&#x27;t take long to see results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years.  It&#x27;s made my eyelashes a lot longer, but not as thick as I would like.  It also  helps to grow back eyebrows that have been over plucked.</li>
    <li> I have been using the rapid lash on and off for about 8-12 months.  When I can afford it.  I am disabled so I have to carefully select my purchases, but this is worth it.  I had a lot of silver eyelashes and very thin.  Since using my eyelashes are dark, all of them, and visible, have definitely grown and thickened.  The cost is great and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a lash volumizer and thickener.  [[ASIN:B002QWE5MY RAPID LASH EYE RENEWAL SYSTEM (SET OF 2!)]]</li>
    <li> This product truly works if used consistently.  My friend and I split the pkg.  Good price for a 2 pack.</li>
    <li> RapidLash is great. I have been using it for over 3 months now and what a difference! I haven&#x27;t told anyone I was using it and after about a month friends started asking me what type of mascara I&#x27;m using because they noticed that my lashes were fuller and longer. One package lasts longer than 6-8 weeks and I use it every night.</li>
    <li> Its a good conditioner for your eyelashes and also I saw a little bit of growth but not impressed to consistently use this one. I bought lilash and I&#x27;m hoping that works.</li>
    <li> After menopause my lashes and eyebrows just seemd to get sparser and thinner,  After using this product for 6 weeks, my eyebrows still need more growing but the lashes are definitely longer and fuller. I just reordered some more, love it, love it, love it</li>
