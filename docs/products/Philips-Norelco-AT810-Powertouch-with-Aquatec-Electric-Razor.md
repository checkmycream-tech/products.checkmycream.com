<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dependable, close shave every time. Great price and great performance</li>
    <li> Shaves Very Nicely.  Use it wet or dry.  I especially like it wet, as close as a blade!  Use it against direction of beard growth, and experiment with it.  You will find that this shaver gives an EXCELLENT , QUICK  shave!  I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much Much better that the Braun electric it replaced!  The Braun forces hairs through a small hole.  Braun shaver is not as efficient as the Norelco, which uses a slotted head design.  Closer shave &amp; less irritation.  I have given this much thought, and the Norelco is better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I do not have any affiliation with either company,  I just have strong opinion that the Norelco is best.</li>
    <li> no charging stand..  at this time shave is not close enough..  the skin on my face  in certain  areas got some little bumps.</li>
    <li> had 36 days  and stops working</li>
    <li> For the money it sure was worth it! I have never owned or used an electric razor in my life. But after checking the prices of other deals I really like this!</li>
    <li> Great as a starter shaver for the peach fuss, a better shaver for the established beard.</li>
    <li> Does a good job in general. Has issues on facial corners though.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver .I like it. One of best I&#x27;ve ever owned since 1961. Quick delivery. Good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for years, but this is the best yet.  Using shaving cream, you a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Feels good and works very well but I do not get a complete clean shave as I would want. Nonetheless, it meets my needs.</li>
    <li> The razor is so quiet, but shaves really well, and is especially good at the hard-to-reach spots like under my jaw line. It shaves really well even in difficolt spots, much more thoroughly and in less time. In retrospect, I look forward to usind the &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; option I have never used befote.</li>
    <li> Gift for my hubby which he loves and says works well.</li>
    <li> I use this razor with Edge gel once a week, and then with Lectric Shave the other 6 days.  Using it with shaving cream gives me a better shave than I ever got with a blade, and the Lectric shave &amp;#34;backups&amp;#34; keep me very well shaven the rest of the time.  I recommend this most highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Norelco razors in my life and they have always served me well.  This is an excellent product, very light-weight, quick charge and long lasting battery.  Another winner from Norelco.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch Electric Razor. My last Norelco electric razor lasted me ten years ( it still works but the battery only stays charged for about two to three days nowadays, after a full charge.) This new razor works as well as my old one did, but I still have problems getting those pesky hairs under my chin. This razor shaves my cheeks and under my nose as well as a manual blade, though, but I still haven&#x27;t found the perfect electric razor to shave under my chin as smooth as a blade. All in all, this is a very good razor, and the price was excellent on Amazon. My razor was delivered to my house less than a week after it ordered it (Amazon always has had fast delivery, at least for me).</li>
    <li> Been using it for almost 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I shave every other day (or daily when needed) and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I use both for my face and head.</li>
    <li> I find this razor to be easy to handle, light and practically noiseless.  My Husband can no longer shave himself so I use this razor and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> I expected this to be low grade quality but it be my expectations. It is worth the money. Everytime I shave, I always wash it. Never rust or dull!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m answering for Judith since it was a gift for me. I have used Norelco shavers for some 60 years now (even in Viet Nam) and find this one to be the best one yet. It&#x27;s handy to wash out the whiskers. Even though I replaced the blades in my old shaver yearly, it just didn&#x27;t cut as closely as when new (about 10 years ago)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad my wife bought me this model.&lt;br /&gt;Ivan Cottrell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this Electric Razor, it works wet&amp;dry, it offers a smooth shaving, i really recommend this razor to anyone out there looking for a good shaving solution.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for years and this razor upholds the high quality of Norelco. Even though I have a fast growing beard, the razor always gives me a close shave.</li>
    <li> Purchased for hubby while deployed.He has some tough facial hair, usually having to replace a razor after 1-2 uses. This shaver holds up to his &amp;#34;super hair&amp;#34;, and he has no complaints.</li>
    <li> Gives a clean shave. Got this for my dad, actually, who is 85 and has a lot of wringles on this face and has fairly delicate skin (has had some skin cancer). It works just fine as far as removing wiskers. I think most of the hype about how close a shave a shaver gives is a little difficult to demonstrate objectively (an convincingly). A shave is a shave is a shave. Only people with too much money spend a $100 on a shaver.</li>
    <li> Ordered &amp; it arrived the next day;&lt;br /&gt;  charged for an hour (per instructions);&lt;br /&gt;  operated/shaved smoothly, efficiently, quietly, &amp; throughly on my &amp;#34;medium tough&amp;#34; beard/stubble;&lt;br /&gt;  pop-up trimmer was precise and cut easily;&lt;br /&gt;  stubble debris is directed away from the cutting heads preventing clogging and extra wear  in the blades; and&lt;br /&gt;  cleaned quickly, easily, &amp; completely just running under very warm/somewhat hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order a second one next month to have at work. This is the fourth Norelco razor I have owned in the last 30+ years. They improve their product every time. The folks at Norelco SCORE again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 18 yr old son - The Master of Disaster - for Christmas, and as of early June it remains fully functional. I  gave it an extra star for that alone, as I find it quite remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;Since my son literally used to drag a dry disposable razor over his face and then bang it on the sink (to clean it...) I can safely say this is an improvement. I do not hold this razor responsible for the quarter inch long spots of missed facial hair. Said son is not patient, and carefully shaving the ENTIRE face, even the bits he can&#x27;t see, head on in the mirror, is time consuming and deemed feeble use of that time.&lt;br /&gt;However, when my older, much more patient and thorough son appeared with about an eighth inch growth all over his face, after having used it, I became more skeptical. We later however, discussed the fact that it had almost certainly not been cleaned  out in a few weeks...  Still, ceteris paribus, I would probably recommend moving up to the 1150/x, unless you are buying this as a first razor for a teenager!</li>
    <li> Have used for a month.  Seems to be working well. Was somewhat diappointed it didn&#x27;t come with a stand.  It would look less sloppy on sink.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as Father&#x27;s day gift. He&#x27;s been waiting to have a electric shaver for so long and finally now he have one and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Delivers what it promises. However, it takes too long to finish an entire shave compared to a razor. Not all a product to be used in the morning time when you are trying to shave in 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only buy it, if you can spare atleast 15 min. for your shave every time (the bigger the beard, the longer the shaving time)</li>
    <li> I am 73 and begin to have nicking problems with a razor as skin is getting thin.  O have used this electric razor for 1 month with good results.  The shave is not as close as a blade razor, but is adequate.  I like it</li>
    <li> Very happy, no complaints.  Quick charge feature is slick.  I usually forget to charge my razor.  Charges enough for a single shave in  5 minutes.  This is about my 5th Norelco and my favorite yet.</li>
    <li> Replaces a 15 yr old Norelco - what a pleasure.  And now I can shave wet or dry - though I am not sure of the advantage to wet.</li>
    <li> After experimenting with a non-rotary razor for two years, I decided to return to a rotary, and ordered this one. I am very pleased with it. It does a good job, is easy to handle, holds a charge for two weeks or longer, and is extremely quiet. I could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Norelco razor but replaced it with another name brand and style in 2005.  When that razor recently died, I decided to go back to a Norelco because I had fond memories of it.  I especially like how long this one runs on a limited charge.  Very handy!  However, it does not shave as close as I would like.  While my most recent shaver was a closer shave, I grew tired of the &#x27;special solution&#x27; (read &#x27;expensive&#x27;) required to be used daily to clean it.  The new Norelco is a snap to pop under the water to clean it up.  So overall, the cost of ownership is much lower with this Norelco (vs. Braun), and I am OK with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
    <li> great product ,good price !!</li>
    <li> 1. I can&#x27;t get off the cup with blades (only open it), as I could in my old Philips shaver.&lt;br /&gt;2. It can work with 220 voltage, which is not stated in description&lt;br /&gt;3. I miss socket adapter</li>
    <li> Husband loves this, does everything he wants it to.</li>
    <li> OK, But it is hard to clean and assemble. if the top comes undone all of the parts fall out.</li>
    <li> Not that I&#x27;m sensitive but this shaver matches a blade and is much more comfortable.  It works well with shaving cream, cleans easily, and goes over two weeks for me before the blinking light tells me I need a charge.</li>
    <li> First one I owned and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Got this for my grandson and he loves it.  He especially likes that he can use it in or out of the shower and get the same results.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Works well for my purposes.  I do wet shaves and dry shaves and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, battery lasts long!</li>
    <li> Spending a few extra bucks to be able to shave wet was well worth it. I bought the razor to replace my blades to save money... this thing easily pays for it self in a few months, depending on what blades you&#x27;re giving up. I expect the ability to shave with shaving cream will also help in the summer when your face is sticky from the hot weather, because that makes shaving &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; nearly impossible.</li>
    <li> I prefer blades to electric shavers, but there are times when a quick once-over with an electric just works out better.  This model is a more recent version of a Noelco model I reviewed before. The shape and size are similar, but this one is a bit lighter, has a different color scheme, and is water resistant enough to be used in the shower.  Now, I never shave in the shower, so I didn&#x27;t test that part. The head style is a bit different on this model, but still cuts well. I got shaves as close as the previous model. The lighter weight didn&#x27;t make much difference to me, and the ergonomic shape of both is very comfortable holding it in a variety of ways. Noelco really did their homework on ergonomics with this beastie. It feels good in one&#x27;s hand and is easy to use.  Unfortunately, they still include the pop-up trimmer, which I found poorly designed and virtually useless. Since the last time I tried it I gouged out a chunk of my beard in a dramatically unwanted fashion, I refuse to let it near my face again. It doesn&#x27;t lock in the pop-up mode, and you have to be very careful how you use it. They should have improved it.  Noelco&#x27;s \\&quot;floating head\\&quot; design has always given better shaves than other electric razors, and this one is no exception. I have simply never seen any blade configuration that can beat the three circular heads which pivot independently for moving over the curves and bumps of one&#x27;s face and head. It is the best of electrics.  I have gotten very used to using the other model, and this one has taken its place for now. I still resort to blades whenever I want a really close shave or need to shape my beard, but these models are great for day to day touch ups or that quick \\&quot;need to lose the scruffy look NOW\\&quot; times.  It could be a 4 with a decent pop up trimmer.</li>
    <li> Better than any other razor I&#x27;ve purchased thus far, but leaves behind stubble, no matter how much I attempt to shave it away.  I was expecting this amount of money to leave my face baby butt smooth.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would still recommend it.  Great battery life.  I can shave several days before having to put it on the charger.</li>
    <li> Update: 2013.04.06: Still working beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2013.02.09: Still shaving just fine. The Philips Body Groom BG2020 and Panasonic Close Curves ES2216PC by this time were both barely shaving any hair by now and would even snag and painfully pull hair. Oh btw I&#x27;m using the Remington iLight Pro IPL6000 which has greatly diminished hair growth so I&#x27;m shaving less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012.10.19: I&#x27;ve noticed a just noticeable dulling since I bought it but not nearly as bad as the others I&#x27;ve had. Maybe my finer hair is more difficult to shave too. I&#x27;m still much happier with it than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: I bought this one exclusively for shaving my legs and body hair. I&#x27;ve used various different lady model electric shavers over the years for leg shaving and would ultimately be disappointed at some point with the head design, head&#x27;s too small, quickly gets dull and leaves many hairs and stubble, or my favorite painfully starts pulling hairs. This Norelco is not marketed for women but why not? The head design has 3 contour following blades that make quick work of shaving the hair down smoother than any other model I&#x27;ve used. In fact I can shave my legs to where I don&#x27;t feel any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Norelco rotary shavers take a little getting used to and you may experience some \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; until your skin gets used to it but it&#x27;s worth it once you&#x27;re past that if any Norelcos are a little more temperamental shaving right if they aren&#x27;t kept clean. If too much hair stubble is allowed to collect the 3 cutters will get matting over with it and your shave will be very bad. So it&#x27;s best to rinse it out under hot water before it gets to that point. Also if you use it on oily skin that oil will make it hard to rinse clean and you&#x27;ll have to disassemble the head and brush the 3 cutters and combs clean frequently. Another thing is not to shave over long strands of hair or they may get pulled into the cutter and wrap around and clog things so that it doesn&#x27;t shave very well until you pull the head apart and pick the hair out. You&#x27;ll know if hair gets sucked into it because the sound of the shaver will change noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One WARNING for newbies to Norelcos; DO NOT EVER mix up the head&#x27;s 3 cutters and combs! Seriously don&#x27;t do it! They are precision matched pairs and if you mix them up your shave will not be good! I know because I&#x27;ve done it. Given 2 weeks to a month of use they&#x27;ll wear in and may shave pretty good again but given how pricey replacements are it&#x27;s a mistake you just don&#x27;t want to make! Most of the time to clean the head you rinse it in hot water. Only once every couple of months or more would you pull the cutters and combs out to clean or unclog them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long time senior electronics tech who appreciates a well fabricated device and I&#x27;m very mechanically inclined with precision machinery so I consider myself a good judge of the quality of electronic and mechanical devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I recently found my old silver computerized Norelco 5885XL from the mid 90&#x27;s that has the big LCD that shows remaining shaves and notifies you when cleaning and maintenance is needed. I totally refurbished it, disassembling and cleaning the transmission parts, and soldering in new batteries. It looks and works like new now and shaves as good as my new Norelco.doesn&#x27;t shave very well until you pull the head apart and pick the hair out.

    <li> I have used a safety razor for over 50 years.  I thought it was time to buy a shaver and though I have nothing to compare it to, I think this is a fantastic substitute.  I tried a dry shave and got shaver burn like some of the other comments made and then on the next day I tried using a lather and I got the best shave ever with no side effects.  Who knew that a person could use soap and water on a powered razor.</li>
    <li> Works well and is perfect for the soft hairs of a budding mustache and beard.  Maintains a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this to use on my scalp. I have alopecia so have very thin hair with bald spots. I decided to take control and go bald, making wigs far more comfortable. This shaver is very nice, gentle and does a good job. It takes a few runs around the area that I do have normal hair growth. I tried it in the shower, dry and with a splash of water. Women, use this on your legs! You will not be sorry. I love, love this for my legs. On my scalp it does a very nice job though even with water I have to go over the areas a few times. From what I have read though, and talking to my guy friends, this is normal. Using with water leaves my scalp baby butt smooth. Their is a shadow by the end of the day where I have normal hair growth but on my legs I get a smooth shave that lasts for days. I very much recommend this for women and I am sure men would like it too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay for my husband. He has a heavy beard so I think that&#x27;s why he feels that way.  It does an okay job when he doesn&#x27;t want to use a razor.</li>
    <li> Worked well and then once the cover was opened, everything fell out into a million pieces and we couldn&#x27;t put Humpty together again. :-(</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this razor for several months and is very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to give as good of a shave as my older Norelco model.</li>
    <li> My husband has no complaints.</li>
    <li> A smooth operating razor that is easy to handle and clean.</li>
    <li> very pleased for a electric razor. This razor gets the job done for traveling. It is worth it to use with electric shave to get a closer shave</li>
    <li> Barely works.  I&#x27;m going back to razors</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It works so quiet</li>
    <li> Love it I like how I can shave dry or wet :)</li>
    <li> My husband has a cheap $20 norelco that works the exact same way except for the waterproofing. We were severely disappointed in this purchase and returned it.</li>
    <li> The razors of Philips are always good. The whold body is water proof. I bought one for me and the other one for my father.</li>
    <li> Everything that Norelco said about this razor was true.  The shave was much better and smoother than my old razor. The first charge lasted 5 weeks.  Have not tried it in the shower, but rinsing after every couple of shaves is great.</li>
    <li> It gets it right, it gets it tight! It really does work while using water, and works well with shaving cream. I prefer to dry shave, but when I got time and like to pamper myself I use the cream. Great item for me.</li>
    <li> Junk.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> There was no mention that a stand and/or case was not provided. Only after I went to the company website did I see any mention that tht more expensive models had them.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not ! Its difficult to stor this item and makes it more possible for damage. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good shaver. has a trimmer as well. can be used as wet and dry shaver. recharge also lasts long.  light weight</li>
    <li> I replaced my nearly 30 year old Norelco with the AT810, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The new unit is lightweight, and quieter than my previous razor, but I have been really impressed with the battery life.  I charged it up when I first got it, and after 6 weeks of daily use it finally flashed it&#x27;s yellow light indicating time for a recharge.  My old razor went for 3 weeks when new down to about 1 week when I replaced it&#x27;s batteries (I had to replace it when the switch would sometimes not turn the razor off!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was lamenting the lack of a battery status array of LEDs, but now that I&#x27;ve experienced the super long life, I just won&#x27;t worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Been using Norelco shavers for more than 50 years-- I think this is the eighth one I have had.  Here-to-fore I had always bought the most expensive razor in their line, but after researching a bit, I settled on the Aquatec;  saved about a hundred dollars;  and I am completely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift in August &#x27;13 and the recipient loves it. And that&#x27;s all I have to say about that.</li>
    <li> it is no good it does not give me a close  shave 1 hour after shaving I need another shave. I had  NORELCO 1250 PERFECT SHAVE but the motor quit thought this would replace it no way junk no comparison used this 1250 about 5 years</li>
    <li> Charged up quickly - charger is a little bit tough to get inserted completely into the shaver... but it will fit. Using it to shave, it works quite well - as I would expect a Norelco to do.&lt;br /&gt;I do not anticipate using it wet, however.</li>
    <li> The AT810 from Norelco is a shaver from the company&#x27;s early 2012 lineup.  It comes in at a mid-level price point with good features, performance, and wet/dry flexibility.  First, the charge on every Norelco product I have owned has been terrific.  This AT810 is no exception.  Indeed, it seems to be the best yet.  You cannot use this product while physically plugged in, for safety, since they do not want to give anyone an idea to stupidly use it in the shower, plugged in.  However, the lack of corded operation is NOT an issue because the battery life is phenomenal, potentially several weeks.  Furthermore, in an event you do run out of power, a quick 1-2 minute charge will give you enough time to complete one shave.  Second, the wet features is a terrific option and a feature that draws in customers  Why not have this flexibility?  Use it in the shower, with a foam or gel, or just with the water.  Pick what you like.  I prefer the dry operation, but I like the option!  The shave is of good quality, but be sure to replace the heads at least once a year for optimum results.  Many are knocking this 810 model as the entire head does not pivot.  The next model up, 830, does pivot, but just slightly.  I did not notice the lack of this feature at first, even though my 2.5 year old Norelco model does have the pivot feature.  I have not noticed a difference in results with the loss of the pivot head.  Therefore, I must assume that the slight pivoting head is more advantageous depending on the shape of your face.  Lacking this feature, does not seem to change the results I get with the product.  Your results may vary.  Overall, a solid product.  I would somewhat agree with reviewers who suggest that for the price, Norelco should have included the pivoting head on this model too.  However, wet operation seems to be the draw factor by Norelco at this new, lower price point, and the pivot feature is reserved for the next model up.  If you can get a good price on the 830, go with it, but you might try this 810.  I have not had any issues with it.  Good product.</li>
    <li> The last time I purchased an electric razor was in 2007.  It was a Braun, and I paid roughly the same price as this Norelco AT810 costs.  The Braun was a satisfactory product, but that&#x27;s about it.  It never got as close as a blade, especially on my neck.  It required lots of hard pressing and reshaving.  Worst of all, if my facial hair was anything more than 3 days&#x27; stubble, it hurt like heck to use.  What a difference five years makes!  This Norelco is a dream come true for a man like me who has very thick, coarse facial hair.  PROS:  -usable dry or in the shower  -doesn&#x27;t require the user to press hard, just gentle circular motions melt away the hair  -doesn&#x27;t hurt to use, no matter how long your facial hair  -gets very close all over the face, and does well on the neck.  I feel this will improve as my face/neck adapt to the electric razor.  CONS:  -cannot use while plugged in, presumably to avoid electrocution in the shower  -not 100% great on the neck, could still require cleanup with a blade for the most formal situations  Bottom line:  a solid product, especially for guys like me with thick facial hair.  I will not be going back to my old electric Braun.</li>
    <li> AS GREAT AS IS ASKED ... THANKS</li>
    <li> light weight. easy to clean. long lasting power reserve. shave well. all in all, this is a very good shaver for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> The razor is quick to charge up, easy to handle and quick to clean w/ water.  Holds a charge for over a week with daily use.  It really shaves close without irratation.  Glad I got it for home and travel.</li>
    <li> This shaver has the &amp;#34;Lift and Cut&amp;#34; feature that does not let your whiskers to grow back into your skin, resulting in &amp;#34;Hair Bumps&amp;#34;,that&lt;br /&gt;really itch. You can even get that level of shave using it wet.</li>
    <li> Quit working over the weekend.  Was hoping it would last longer than two years (yeah the two year warranty expired a couple months ago).  I guess sixty bucks doesn&#x27;t buy much of a razor anymore.  Never dropped or abused it in any way.  For the two years it worked, it gave a good shave.  I charged it every weekend whether it needed charging or not.  Never used it in the shower (Norelco says you can) but every few days I washed out any loose hair around the blades with running water.  The part containing the blades opens for cleaning and I always left it open afterwards so the water could dry.</li>
    <li> The Philips-Norelco AT810 is a very similar to the Philips-Norelco 7310XL from a few years ago. The key differences being the way it fits in your hand, and the AT810 has different grates covering the blade. I would assume it is to tackle different types of hair easier. While the blades themselves bend in a bit to contour to your cheeks and/or chin, the AT810 has a fixed head and doesnt fare well around the neck. It does rather well on the face, especially with the use of Lectric Shave. It also comes with a beard trimmer, although as has been the case with the 7310XL, the AT810 beard trimmer leaves much to be desired as far as shaping your beard is concerned. So, you are the kind of guy who likes to have a clean shaven face -- this is the only tool you&#x27;ll need (plus some Lectric Shave or similar product). However, if you maintain a beard or goatee, this will do great in the \\&quot;field\\&quot;, but you&#x27;ll still need a straight razor!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this electric razor almost everyday and he absolutely loves it! He hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it and he has been using it for almost a year now.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to replace his old, worn out electric razor.  He was very pleased with it.  So far it has good battery life and a good close shave.</li>
    <li> This is the sixth Norelco electric razor that I have used and my observations are:  1) This is a very good basic electric razor.  2) The shave is close and much quieter than the electric razors I have had in the past.  At first, I mistakenly felt that since this razor was so quiet that it was not powerful.  I was wrong. I get close shaves with this.  3) The instructions say that you should wash/rinse after each use, but I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s necessary.  I rinse mine out after every few days.  4) Again, this is a basic razor. No LED displays, no battery life indicator or minutes left of usage. Only a weak battery indicator.  5) Doesn&#x27;t come with a stand or case.  Again, just basic.  6) Battery life seems fairly good. I have been using this every weekday for about three weeks and I haven&#x27;t needed to charge this.  7) I like the convenience of simply rinsing under hot water. Simple maintenance.  8) I also like the Aqua-Tec technology where I can use this to shave in the shower, although I don&#x27;t do that often.  Bottom line: Very good electric razor for the price. You get your money&#x27;s worth.  If you want all the bells and whistles, i.e., LED displays, battery life indicators, stands, etc., you&#x27;ll have to pay more for a higher-end model. If you just want a good basic no-frills razor, go with this one.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR! WELL WORTH THE EXTRA TO BUY A NAME-BRAND!</li>
    <li> Does not cut very good or close.</li>
    <li> My husband really tried to love it and used it for almost 2 weeks but he just couldn&#x27;t love it. According to him, it doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for and which Philips says that it can do. Shaving along the jawline also takes great effort and trying to get that close shave left his neck irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s water resistant so it can be used in the shower which he tried and said that even with shaving cream it still didn&#x27;t do a great job of giving a close shave which he likes. The pop-up trimmer is a feature that he did love and it&#x27;s located on the top of the shaver. With the push of a button you can trim and shape your moustache and sideburns easily. Clean up is also pretty easy, just put it under running water or use the cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re still looking for an electric razor that gives that really close shave just like the disposables. If you&#x27;re also looking for that this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> i bought the 8240 and after two weeks i bought at810 and there is no comparison between both. the at810 like a toy to play with not to shave..8240 is better but it&#x27;s not super razor...btw, this is my first review on amazon and i hoped my first review will be 5 stars but i&#x27;m sorry i just can&#x27;t lie..</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco AT810 razor doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bells and whistles but it&#x27;s a solid, compact cordless model that fits well in your hand and provides a smooth shave. The razor held its charge per instructions. The unit also features and trimmer and is easy to clean. All in all a solid shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I have used Braun and Panasonic in the past and I have found Norelco to be the most effective (disclaimer: it has been over 12 years since I&#x27;ve used a competing product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the Norelco shavers, I think this one is the most cost effective. Its replacement heads are on the cheaper side. Although Norelco recommends replacing the head every year or so, I do it every 2 years and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge can last about a month. So I find myself cleaning the shaver more frequently than charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a basic but effective shaver that shaves very well, then look no further.</li>
    <li> Good over all, would only recommend to people who constantly shave.  Its rated for wet and dry but when wet with or without lather it had diffuclt time catching the hair and it would take me longer to shave.  So I end up shaving dry each time I use this one.  Cleaning is a breeze.  Battery lasts long and doesn&#x27;t take much to charge.  I noticed that anyting over a 5&#x27;oclock shadow took me longer since my hair was going every direction, if I shaved everyday or every other day (its takes me two days to develop a shadow) then this is great shaver, but once I go beyond that 3rd and 4th day then I have to go back to traditional shaving.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Philips Norelco AT810 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor&#x27; is a smooth shave through and through.  Norelco has been putting out quality razors for a long, long time, and this is a great entry in the mid-line area of blades for those that love the speed and reliability of electric shavers.  This is a solid entry and you will really like the results it provides!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Gives very fine, quick shave.  Has only 1 hour charging time and shaving time last almost two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Does a good job and is easy to clean.  The charge lasts for weeks.</li>
    <li> It does the job really well, so far I&#x27;ve gotten a really clean shave and no stubs are left over.</li>
    <li> Much better blade and head design compared to previous Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;Came with Neutrogena shave cream. That really made the difference. I had used LectricShave forever and this shave cream used with warm water was gave a closer and more comfortable shave!!</li>
    <li> The best one I had till now...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a very shaver it takes forever to just a half way decent shave. It runs very slow and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;do a very good job misses a lot of whiskers.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver.  Cuts close as any other electric razor I&#x27;ve had.  MUCH quieter than my last Remington foil shaver.  Can barely hear it in the other room.  Shaves much better around my neck.  Doesn&#x27;t cut-up my adam&#x27;s apple like foil razors do.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good, I haven&#x27;t charged it since I bought  it, and it fits pretty well as well. I&#x27;m going to buy another one</li>
    <li> I had another razor, the same model, and I loved it.  I have a beard and shave my head.  this razor allows for trimming the beard and keeps my head from looking stubbly.</li>
    <li> Great razor, the charge last a very long time.  Much easier to shave than with my old razor.  Very happy with Norelco and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought it because its features are similar to my previous razor which I liked very well.  This one is even better.  It gives a very smooth and close shave.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> i like the fact i can wet shave with this razor&lt;br /&gt;not as close as my straight razor but no electrics are there YET</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any other shaver. This product is good quality and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it but he went to be with Jesus so I&#x27;ll find someone to give it away to!</li>
    <li> Great, very pleased. Good price.</li>
    <li> I have tested many electric razors but this is the first electric razor that I have started using regularly.  I have yet to find an electric that can shave \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; but this comes very, very close.  Unlike every other electric I have tried, the Philips/Norelco PowerTouch doesn&#x27;t pull or tug the hairs on my face, even during the month-long adjustment period.  The battery holds a charge well and recharges quickly.  I find it a little difficult to be precise when using the three-head Norelco design but for a full shave it works well.  Your standard trimmer/shaper is on the back of the shaver.  It seems the trimmer blades move a little slower compared to other electrics and I wish it were easier to clean in between the blades where loose hair gets trapped but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested out the claims of using it in the shower but I think it&#x27;s of a waste of time, not to mention water, to be standing in the shower with the shaver while the water is running.  Perhaps you could use the other hand to soap up a few areas or scrub your scalp but you&#x27;re most likely going to be pulling and stretching the different areas of your face or feeling for areas you might have missed -- just like you do when you&#x27;re not shaving in the shower.  I gave it the college try and really focused on getting what I thought was a complete shave.  Of course the result was a laughable patchy mess of missed spots on my face.  Even if I had a mirror in the shower, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see myself due to the shower steam.  If there is any advantage to using a shaver in the shower, I don&#x27;t know what it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging light pulses with a green LED as it is charging and becomes solid once charging is complete.  The razor does seem to rinse out nicely in the sink without affecting future shaves.  A double sided brush is included if you&#x27;d rather brush out the clippings the old fashioned way.  I wish a nice, sturdy base was included to place the razor in when finished.  It feels solid in my hand, not light and flimsy.  Most importantly, it&#x27;s gentle on the face.  Recommended.It feels solid in my hand, not light and flimsy.  Most importantly, it&#x27;s gentle on the face.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have owned many Norelco shavers and have always liked them.  I usually buy the cheapest version, but this time I spent a little more to get a better shaver.  This shaver always leaves some hairs uncut and I have to go back and shave a second time.  I suppose if I shaved every day and used all the recommendations it might be alright.  However,  I wanted a shaver that gave me a good quick shave without problems and therefore am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used several Norelco razors and trimmers through the years.  A couple were purchased as specialty razors and a couple of others were added to my collection as advances in technology offered new features.  All of the razors and trimmers still work.  For the price this is a quality product.  While it does not give me as close of a shave as a manual shave with a blade, it is sufficient for day-to-day shaving for a clean cut look.  It is just a little more work to navigate the contours on my jaw and neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing really does hold a charge well and I have no complaints with the battery life.  It does have a low battery warning although it is not as high tech as some of the other more expensive razors that let you know exactly how much battery life remains.  It has the capability to quick charge to get you by if you have a dead battery and need a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pop up trimmer for cleaning up mustaches, beards or sideburns; however, I use my other Norelco trimmer for those purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a stand or a case; however, it is portable and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to clean after use and the water resistant nature of the product provides additional shaving and cleaning options.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor! Shaves smoothly and cleanly with no razor burn at all. You can wash it out under the tap without any damage. I can shave for a couple weeks on a single charge, and then it seems to fully charge in an hour or so. Terrific!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another Norelco I&#x27;d had for at least 5 years. It was still working fine but needed a new shaving head and the battery seemed to be slowly failing. Consequently, I decided it was time for  a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco gives me a close, comfortable shave. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. Also, it is easy to clean since you simply flip open the head and rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco shavers for over 25 years and this is the best one yet. A great buy at Amazon.</li>
    <li> feels good in your hand and shaves close like all of my prior Norelco shavers but...I wish it had a stand, I wish I could use it with the charger cord attached, I find the on/off button somewhat difficult to locate (it is black like the rest of the body). Would it but it again? a Norelco yes but not this model.,</li>
    <li> My husband had a previous model of the Philips Norelco similar to this one and it needed new heads.  We looked online and found they were about $27 at the least expensive vendor on Amazon.com.  So, we decided to just purchase a new shaver.  We went to a local store and found this exact model for $89 exactly as packaged here!  We came home and ordered it from Amazon.  We ordered on Saturday afternoon and it arrived on Monday!  My husband charged it for a couple hours and it was good to go.  He is very pleased with the new Razor and I am pleased with the economical price.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors since I started shaving 40 years ago. This is the 4th I have owned (yes, they are built to last). This is hands-down the best Norelco I have yet used. It gets through my moderately heavy beard in about 90 seconds with a larger cutting area surface than my previous models and a better cutter design. It is much quieter than my previous Norelcos, and the ergonomics are very good. It charges much more quickly (about an hour) and has enough capacity for several dozen shaves on one charge. A quick charge for a single shave takes 3 minutes. Although I dry shave, it has the ability to wet shave and can be cleaned quickly under running water. This design does not produce a trace of pulling or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to get to higher priced models unless you are looking for a pouch and charging stand. This product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> smooth shaving, no more worries of cutting yourself, washable, not the highest end or most latest, but very close to it</li>
    <li> Got this as a present for father´s day and so far my dad loves it!</li>
    <li> I shave my head, face and chest with it. You have to use something else for the initial shave, but if you keep it up, it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I hate haircuts, and most of my hair is gone on top. Since I started using it, girls look at me and smile. I don&#x27;t look homeless anymore. I do not have razor cuts. It turned my whole life around. I am confident that I am winning the Powerball next time, because if it.</li>
    <li> I use it under the shower with foam and I have and excellent shave. The sound that it makes is very low. It&#x27;s a great shaver!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this razor initially.  It has all the oomph of one of those sweater fuzz-busters.  I tossed it aside and planned on returning it.  But I gave it a few more tries and found that it does the job well.  (Not as well as a straight razor, but no electric razor will ever match that shave.)  It beats out two other electrics I have in terms of rolling more smoothly over my face and requiring fewer passes to get the job done.</li>
    <li> for my 17 year old grandson. loves it,works great. fast and easy.before school he gets his shave and out the door.</li>
    <li> A great purchase. Nice shave.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and runs quietly. Also doesn&#x27;t pull out hair when I shave after having skipped a few days. Doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the old Norelco I bought in the early 2000&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t think it will last 10+ years like that one did, but it&#x27;s easy to clean and it trims hair well.</li>
    <li> My oldest was living away from home and couldn&#x27;t find his razor so I purchased this one as a replacement. It has held up for a year and still works. Not as nice as the previous one but I paid less for it so I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My son received this gift and he really likes it.  He has to be careful the type of razor he can use because of skin problems.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> do your research.  this model works fine for me.  I&#x27;ve had before, lasted years.  just tired of them making me write all these words on the review.</li>
    <li> This thing shaved my face like a beaver chews wood!  Remarkably close shave from an electric.  I thought the blades would not be as good as the older shavers that had three rings on each blade, where this one only has one ring on each blade.  But it honestly cut better than it&#x27;s more expensive predecessors.  On a side note I refuse to attempt to shave damp facial hair.  So I cannot say how well it cuts freshly showered facial hair.</li>
    <li> Best razor for a, rough beard</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a Panasonic foil shaver that was a big disappointment.  The Norelco shaves close, batteries have good life, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  My old Norelco is 17 years old, and still works, expect the same for this.  I regret even thinking about buying the Panasonic, or any other shaver</li>
    <li> quiet, but takes forever and poor shave.must be faster and s closer shave..better shaver is an Eltron, if it&#x27;s still made</li>
    <li> This razor is a winner....I dry shave with it and it is easily cleanable.</li>
    <li> 3-4 years ago, I purchased a Philips Norelco rotary shaver and would never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  This can be used as a wet shaver.  I use shaving gel.  I don&#x27;t baby it cleaning per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;I use it, rinse it, and let it dry.  I don&#x27;t remove the heads to clean.  As I said, my first one is at least 3 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I don&#x27;t like foil shavers.  I prefer rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  So light, it&#x27;s a great travel shaver.  Very fast charge.</li>
    <li> This razor is a very good value. It gives a very close shave and fits the hand very well. It also has a great shaving time on a single charge.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I haven&#x27;t seen too many reviews on shaving foam with this electric shaver.  I ended up trying it with my first day of ownership.  First of all, lots of hype on this shaver.  Not exactly sure why that is because it is just a shaver.  I lathered up my face with foam and followed the instructions.  It said to pre-wet the shaver with warm water before using with foam.  Then use circular motions to cut while regularly rinsing the shaver for a smooth glide.  Everything seems to work as expected; however, expect a lot of mess!  The shaver had a hard time picking up the hairs on my jawline, so I had to go back over it again.  The shave is mediocre at best.  It is what I expected from an electric shaver.  If a person wants a real close shave, the blade and foam is the best.  If you are doing every day shaving, this electric razor is pretty good.  Note:  I have only owned it for a day.  I will try and update everyone after a month of owning it.  Update 11/10/2013:  So I have owned the shaver for a month.  It does really well in the water.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Once again, this is an electric shaver, it will not get nearly as close shave as a straight razor or safety razor.  But for a quick shave, gets the job done.  I also got it down to where it won&#x27;t make much mess in the sink with a wet shave.  I haven&#x27;t owned it for  a year, but people report that is around when it dies.  We will see what happens.  I did notice, the first couple days, it did cut my skin.  But the instructions did say give it 2 weeks.  I did this and hasn&#x27;t cut my skin since.  Very happy with it.  No irritation.  Also, a note to everyone who wants to use the shaver while plugged in:  Common sense should tell you this shaver advertises it can be used when wet.  Would you really like 120V 20AMP going through your body?  People will probably end up trying this.  I think that safety feature is smart of Philips frankly. Probably reduces on lawsuits.  Anyways, if you aren&#x27;t sure about electric shavers, this one is cheap enough to give a try.   UPDATE 06/13/2015:  So after two years of running hot water through it, the back hinge just snapped off because it was plastic.  It did a decent job until that happened.  If you do end up using this for wet shave with soap, be careful on where you run the hot water, don&#x27;t run it at the hinge other wise it will weaken the plastic and eventually break like mine.    Trying the braun wet/dry shaver that is 50 dollars and the way my hair grows it doesn&#x27;t do well.  Will have to purchase this one again because it gets every single hair, but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as how the braun cuts, when it does cut the hair.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this razor. I love it ! I used to use Gillette Razors, but I got tired of having to constantly buy new ones.. now I just use my electric razor, and It works great..</li>
    <li> Bought this Norelco for my father in law. He is really happy with it and looks great. I also have a Norelco, different model. I would recommend this shaver. Take it in the shower, don&#x27;t be afraid, it loves getting wet.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well and I love it. Will travel with it and get a good shave. Electric razors rule</li>
    <li> This razor charges quickly, runs at a faster speed, and cuts cleaner than my last Norelco electric razor. So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a razor my husband loves and I could not find one in a local store and so happy I found it on Amazon.  Thanks</li>
    <li> very high level, very good, my grandfather liked it and buying another , + my aunt wants it and in 2-3 days will buy one more :D  great:)</li>
    <li> No bad reviews from my husband only positives. He uses it daily to keep clean shaven for work and the battery has lasted longer than what is recommended. I like the price and he likes the convince and features of this product.</li>
    <li> I just replaced my old Norelco electric razor after 8 years with the AT810. I am very pleased as it gives a closer shave than any electric razor I have previously owned. It is easy to clean and the pop-up trimmer is handy. Have had no problems with it holding a charge.</li>
    <li> my teen son loves it!</li>
    <li> Great razor! My husband loves it! It gives him a nice close shave and saves him so much time! Very much worth the money!</li>
    <li> For this kind of  price i want a better product. I like a close shave. I have to go back over the spots several times.  I get razor burn as a result. My hair isn&#x27;t even that tough. I don&#x27;t reccomend people with tough hair.</li>
    <li> had to replace it, would not hold charge also cant use it while plugged in.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric shavers for over 30 years. I started with one that only had two cutters rather than three. This is the latest one and it works well as did the others. I have found through the years when I have decided to use a safety razor for shaving (too much work) that a better, closer shave comes from the safety razor, not any electric. That being said... the Norelco AT810 is as good as it gets. Though I will probably seldom use it in the shower, it is possible with this razor and it will likely not be hurt by cleaning under the faucet. I like Norelco and recommend the PowerTouch Cordless Razor.</li>
    <li> One of the biggest pain points with the electric shavers is with the necks.  Foil shavers are somewhat better since you can make a vertical pass on the 2 sides of the neck planes.  But with Rotary shavers - Pivot heads are almost a must and should and this shaver does not have a pivot head.  Spend a few $s more and go for the norelco AT830:  [[ASIN:B006GQYSGE Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Gray/Silver/Black]]  Overall, I still find the shave quality to be good on this shaver - like all Norelco products and currently using it as a additional shaver in my Gym Bag.</li>
    <li> clean shave love it fast and now</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been clean shaving for many years having a beard and then using the trimmer method for the last few years. I was concerned that electric razors would not leave a clean shave, but I was wrong. This has been better than any blade I have ever used, especially when used with shaving cream. I use Nivea for men sensitive skin. It took about 2 weeks to &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; my skin. Bottom line... couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco razor for 30 years. This is the absolute best razor I have ever used. I wake up each morning looking forward to shaving.</li>
    <li> The Introductory material, however, refers consistently to a &amp;#34;stand for the razor&amp;#34;--but there is none!!  maybe I did not spend enough money  ???  it would sure be nice to have!</li>
    <li> This razor worked great for 6 months and then it would not turn on. Norelco did replace with a new razor .</li>
    <li> This electric razor may be expensive, but you can&#x27;t deny that it gets the job done. Being able to use this with shave gel and water makes it one of the best out there. I&#x27;m dar skinned and get really bad razor bumps. Using this electric razor does not irritate my skin, or give me razor bumps! Love this thing !</li>
    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO BE WORKING ON FULL POWER EVEN AFTER SEVERAL FULL CHARGING !  NOT AS GOOD AS A STANDARD RAZOR..</li>
    <li> I have always used Gillette razors, and I decided to try an electric shaver, since I will be doing more travelling and I thought this would be quicker and more convenient. I was hesitant to try an electric shaver, because I didn&#x27;t think they can shave as close as a blade. So here&#x27;s what I found after using the AT810.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the plus column, it does a decent job, it gets rid of the morning shadow, and it is quick and easy. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and the pop-out trimmer works well. So it is good for travelling. But is it as good as a blade? No. Even though the morning shadow is gone, when I feel my face, I can feel that it didn&#x27;t get it all. I tried moving my head, holding it up to tighten the skin, and I held and moved the shaver every which way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line is, this shaver will do an adequate job on an average day of getting you out the door quickly without your morning shadow. But if it&#x27;s date night and you want your face to be 100% baby-smooth, better use a razor.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD  A NUMBER OF NORELCO RAZORS--THIS ONE DID NOT SHAVE AS WELL&lt;br /&gt;AS THE NORELCO I HAVE BEEN USING</li>
    <li> gives a clean shave and is good on for swift usage. also cleaning it is an easy job. but this is a comment after just 2-3 uses.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the money. I like it being water proof for easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> Well So far so good it works as designed and im very happy with my purchase. i recommend it l</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, but i wish it has a charger stand! overall! good! plus it has amazon student discount! great price~</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not noisy at all, its really water resistant but my face burns the day after I use it, i can&#x27;t use it 21 continuous days like it recomends because after 2 days my face still burning.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Powertouch razor as a gift for my husband. He is very happy with this shaver. It is quiet and gives a nice close shave without burning him. it works great for him in the shower and is easy to clean. It also keeps the charge longer than his previous razor. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It does everything its supposed to do at a very fair price.  I bought it for my husband&#x27;s prolonged hospital stay (he always used a razor, but knew that would be inconvenient while he was bedridden). Very happy with my choice. He&#x27;s on his feet now but continues to use it. A convert and no more nicks.</li>
    <li> Smooth, fairly close shave (for an electric), excellent battery life and super easy to clean up. I typically like to use a double edge safety razor with badger hair brush and warm shaving cream but who has time for that very often? This is what I turn to when I&#x27;m in a hurry and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> Had an older model for years and it need new heads but was expensive,so decided to upgrade.Price was right,would recommmend</li>
    <li> It was fun stuff,&lt;br /&gt;Are you well liked even heard the price-quality service in a different series are thinking about buying</li>
    <li> works great - close shave</li>
    <li> Package arrived in time estimated and in good condition.  It works great.  Shave is close and without causing burning sensation.  Cleans up easily.  Brings joy to a  boring task.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric razor for nearly a month now.&lt;br /&gt;It replaced a Norelco Spectra 8894 XL  I&#x27;ve had for like 10 years.  I can&#x27;t remember if I replaced blades 5 years ago or not, don&#x27;t remember.&lt;br /&gt;Blades on my 8894 XL are 8 Series and look exactly like blades on AT810 and like I said I may or may not have ever replaced blades on 8894 XL.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday after nearly 30 days while shaving AT810 stopped and had to be recharged.  No warning like with 8894 XL it just stopped. I used 8894 sitting for a month, still with charge I left it with to finish shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I liked warning noise on 8894 XL and I miss not having a screen to check time remaining.&lt;br /&gt;As for AT810 being Aquatec well I like to get my shaving done as fast as possible so wasting time while watching my hot water go down a drain while shaving is not good.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money if you have an older model buy replacement blades or spend more money and buy one with more features.</li>
    <li> My father tells me , he is very satisfied with the perfomance</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my uncle, he likes it. Good for daily use. One time charge can be used for a while.</li>
    <li> I previously had the [now discontinued] Norelco 8830 which provided a much closer shave but was getting old and wasn&#x27;t holding a charge for very long. So I bought the AT810. The waterproofing works fine but the shave quality (even after a month of use) just isn&#x27;t close to what I had.</li>
    <li> As a long time Norelco user, I find that this razor is actually better than advertised.  The razor is fast, quiet and gives a great close shave.  (Sure beats the Wahl that I bought previously).</li>
    <li> I switched from a blade after years and years of putting up with cutting myself!  The electric razor does not shave as close as the blade but close enough!  I don&#x27;t cut myself and it is far more convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Returned for credit. I shave every day and followed the manufacturer&#x27;s directions when using this razor. I had razor burns on my neck after a wet shave. In some places the razor was pulling hair rather than cutting. Dry shaving was worse. I do not have these problems during dry shaving with my 320 and 1775  Series Braun razors or my Wahl Super Close Series razor.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I had serious reservations about this purchase!!  I have never had any luck with electric shavers.  They never seemed good enough at getting a clean shave.  I do not expect a clean shave like a blade but at least one that does not look like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow 2 hours after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reservations were instantly eased the first time I used it.  This is exactly what an electric shaver should do.  A nice any easy clean shave!!  Great product.  Very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> much better than experted</li>
    <li> Hubby likes it and he has a riugh beard, gives him a close shave.</li>
    <li> Go with cheaper model. This one and more expensive oneshave diffetent heads with precisiob holes vs just slots all the wat around the 3 razor guards. I have both kinds snd the cheaper one out shaves this one every time and it does it much faster. I just need to find a cheaper kind with the trimmer on it. The head that is bad but more exoensive is called dual precision but it actually sucks.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well so far, but not sure if it is because it is new with new blades.  The motor sounds a bit slow and strained.  My husband prefers the [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] over this one.  If you listen to their motors together, you can really tell the difference in the speed of each.</li>
    <li> I generally shave with a regular razor, however, due to a recent surgery I had to go to an electric shaver.  The Norelco does a good job but obviously is never as good as a razor.  I am fully satisfied with the results but not enough to rate it a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Bought this because the replacement blades are much less expensive than blades for older Norelco CoolSkin. It turned out to be a better razor as well. And the battery has been excellent so far.</li>
    <li> My brother asked me to buy him a new razor on Amazon.com (as opposed to picking one up at the mall).  Now I knew nothing about men&#x27;s razors except for the fact that my brother always used a Norelco cordless.  So I want to send a big thank you to all the men who took the time to review this product as well as the people who wrote the product descriptions for all the Norelco razors on Amazon.  With your help I was able to learn enough about the different models and their special features to make an educated purchase.  Brother likes his new razor a lot, his face looks great, &amp; best of all it only charges in an hour (his old razor took hours to charge).</li>
    <li> Close shave and better at neck area than previous Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had.  Battery life is even longer as well.  A little pricey but would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I never used an electric shaver before.&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my face is more tender and using the bladed razor&lt;br /&gt;was leaving me with irritated skin when I had to shave daily.  Now, I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;worry about it.  I shave in the shower and am ready to go when I get out....</li>
    <li> ON-OFF SWITCH QUIT WORKING AFTER 11 MONTHS.  NOT WORTH $50 PLUS FOR SUCH A SHORT LIFE.  WILL NOT BY A REPLACEMENT&lt;br /&gt;Review update: Contacted Norelco. They replaced body at no charge and provided free return label.</li>
    <li> Decent shave, not as close as my older Norelco that I had to give up since it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge (after almost 10 years).</li>
    <li> Not good at all and After i use&#x27;t,  Sensitivity become on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills have become big in my face, and i talk to my lawyer for this task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anyone to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,</li>
    <li> It was worth the money. It was on sale , and as usual Amazon prime I got it before I grew a beard</li>
    <li> It works pretty well, haven&#x27;t had to change the head yet. I&#x27;d say it work better in the shower. word.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco and I love it. You just have to remember to get new blades once a year. Closest thing to a blade that I have found.</li>
    <li> It met all my expectations, this is my 2nd razor like this, wore out my last one. Battery could be better.</li>
    <li> Great PRoduct, I give this to my friends and they just loved it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he says it is the best electric razor he has ever had!  He used to complain every time he had to shave, how he hated to shave.  No more, really, now he loves to shave. Amazing!</li>
    <li> At First I tough the razor was not fully charge for it has kind of a weak sound. But I think that&#x27;s the way this razor behaves. The first time I use it, I was blown away. For it did gave me a clean shave. Now, I can see that the heads will need to be replaced, in my case, in about 4 months or so. (Because after I shave now I can see littler uncut hair in certain areas).&lt;br /&gt; I had developed bumps but I&#x27;m giving my face time to adjust before I can comment on that. I think in overall this product is good but I will not say excellent. I may need to buy the next more expensive  and compare. Maybe the more expensive model has a stronger motor, let&#x27;s see. It does save you on buying disposable razors which are so expensive now days.</li>
    <li> it has been one of the best investment a poor man like me could have own. The best ever shaving product for a man!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, too! It seems to be, at least at this time, the best razor I&#x27;ve used. It gives me a first class shave. I didn&#x27;t get as much from the wet/lather try-out but the dry shaver is great. I get quicker and cleaner shaves than ever before; five previous Norelcos. Philips/Norelco just keeps getting better and better.</li>
    <li> I bought  the razor  for travel use. It is my second  Norelco. I have  been using it for a few days and love the feel of the razor.It shaves  very close and my face is so smooth when I am done.</li>
    <li> Very good model.  It does all that it claims.  The hand grip is quite comfortable, charges quickly, runs quietly, and shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement for an older Norelco that died (not the product&#x27;s fault).  As a long term Norelco user (30 + years), this one meets all that I expected for their products.</li>
    <li> When I first received this razor my first thought was that it looked amazingly like an old Panasonic razor that I had picked up at a garage sale. The similarties ended there. This is a much more streamlined product. The switch to turn it on is so well hidden that I had trouble turning the thing on. This razor is amazing in how close and comfortable the shave is. It is also very quiet. I am so used to the old razor, that the quietness of this one made me think it was not fully charged. It sounded like it was about to die like the old Panasonic did when it lost it&#x27;s charge. These are minor complaints for anyone but me I suppose. I am just old school. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about a week or so, and thus far it has worked great. Shaving with a razor blade irritates my skin, but this allows me to have a close shave without the mess and irritation. Love it.</li>
    <li> The razor works fine after 30 days experience. It actually cuts the whiskers under my chin and on my neck. Fairly quiet. Runs at least a week on the charge. Cleans fairly easily for a rotary blade shaver as the head opens up for rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback I see is that it will not run when plugged in for charging. You just have to charge it every week.</li>
    <li> The directions say to let your face “get used to” the razor. But after 3 months I never got used to it. 3 months of consistent irritation after shaving made me abandon this thing. If you hate someone give them this thing otherwise, RUN! The inventors of this machine should be put to death for creating such an evil torture device or be forced to used their creation for the rest of their lives.</li>
    <li> My husband Kia very pleased with this razor.  It was cheaper on line.  He says he gets a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I like the Norelco razor. The battery lasts about 2 or more weeks on a full charge. The shave is not extremely close. Your skin will feel smooth but you&#x27;ll still see stubs. Cleaning the unit is very easy. I don&#x27;t like the mini razor used to trim the sideburns. The mini razor is very weak and is kind of useless. I have used it with shaving gels, dry, and wet. The unit works best when wet. I used to use shaving cream with it but rinsing the unit under hot water doesn&#x27;t get a deep clean and you&#x27;ll still have gel residue in the crevices, although it probably won&#x27;t effect shaving performance. Overall for the price, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> I have had this now about 5 months.  I used an electric razor 20 years ago and didn&#x27;t like it, so went back to a blade - so this was my second attempt of switching from a blade to electric.  I only use it dry, so I am not sure I needed the version that works wet as well, however it does work very well.  It holds a charge for a long time - I only plug it in about once or twice a week.  I still have the original foils in it, so they seem to last quite well.  Its much faster than a blade obviously.  I think from a cost standpoint it will also be cheaper than purchasing blades and shaving gel, but I never really kept track so that&#x27;s just a guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is not as close as a blade, but still pretty good.  I am pretty happy with this, and would recommend this one to anyone thinking of trying (or in my case re-trying) a electric razor.</li>
    <li> I dropped a star because of a couple skin cuts the first week of use. Seeing blood on the scrotum is rather scary .but on the face too,,,lets say it has taken my skin about 2 weeks to adjust. Great battery life and full speed until it dies. I have used it with a little shaving gel and have never had an electric shave smoother or closer. On the plus side too is replacement heads are reasonable although It will be a while before I need them</li>
    <li> THIS SEEMS MUCH  BETTER THAN THEIR OLDER SHAVERS.  THE HEADS DO NOT CLOG UP AS&lt;br /&gt;READILY AS IN THE ONE ONES.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors on and off for years never really satisfied with the shave and often having to use a disposable razor after to get the spots the electric missed.  This is the first electric razor I have used that REALLY works!  I use it with my shave cream and I get just as close a shave as I would with a razor.  And no nicks!  This is by far one of the best things I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor for years, but wanted to try again.  Like instructions say, must give it 4-5 times before I got the results I was looking for.  Found it works best right after shower and with electric shave lotion works best for me.  It has plenty of charge to give that extra swipe if needed.  Just don&#x27;t give up and get the satisfaction I was hoping for. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My significant other usually uses regular disposable razors because he feels they give the closest shave.  Due to medical issues it is not safe for him to use blades so I purchased this Norelco.  It is waterproof, charges quickly, and he is very pleased with the closeness of the shave. Highly recommend to anyone looking to switch or just find a very good quality electric shaver at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The AT810, as you might have surmised from its name, is the lesser brother of the AT830.  It shares many of the high qualities of the pricier AT830, including solid unibody construction, ability to wet/dry shave and fast charging.  However, it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel case (like the AT830), has just one indicator light for battery charging, and most importantly, its shaving head doesn&#x27;t pivot.  This makes it hard to shave around the neck area; my recommendation is to just pony up the extra $15 and get the AT830, which gives you a better shave around those areas.  I prefer a straight razor to the AT810, and the latter also gave me irritable skin post-shave.</li>
    <li> *written by the husband*  I had gotten another Norelco a while back.  I love that one, and it is hard to part with it.  I did try this one, though.  While it still provides a close shave, I still love the previous one.  So I recommend this one to strictly newbies that need an electric.</li>
    <li> According to the instruction booklet that came with the razor, a charging stand is available for purchase but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I have searched the Philips store to no avail.  They say it charges best in a stand up position but then make it impossible to find a charging stand.  I thought it would come in with the razor but it didn&#x27;t.  Disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> Okay. Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a great close shave.  My husband is so happy with it. He shaves every morning and comments on how close it shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty entrenched in shaving with a double-edge razor, but on mornings when I need to shave quick (or while on the go), I found this is a really great shaver. I had a lower-end Philips Norelco electric prior to this one that worked pretty well, but I ended up needing to replace it, so this is the one that I picked.</li>
    <li> I have not had any problems with razor burn - Battery lasts forever - Great clean cut and a great price!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor- fits hand, very comfortable to use plus does an excellent job shaving without breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy to receive this.  However, he said it does not cut the &amp;#34;neck hair&amp;#34; too good. So it does not cut in all angles.</li>
    <li> Good product. One problem, however, is that it doesn&#x27;t work when connected to an energy outlet.</li>
    <li> My husband really appreciated and liked this gift. He said it works great and that he likes that he can use it dry and wet. He was so excited to use it that he thought he&#x27;d be able to use it right out of the box, but he found out it needed to be charged before he used it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves I.  He has been a fan of the Philips shaver for ages.  His old one died and it was hard to find parts so this razor was perfect.</li>
    <li> everything arrived as expected</li>
    <li> I love this razor for it&#x27;s convenient to charge and charge very fastly. Also you can wash the body directly, it&#x27;s water-proof</li>
    <li> I bought so many Norelco razor (more than 50 in the last ten years). Never to be disappointed. It works great and feels good.</li>
    <li> The most comfortable shave I have had in years.  Use shaving cream and the razor glides easily for a quick and close shave.</li>
    <li> I am writing on behalf of my husband,who I bought the shaver for. This shaver&#x27;s run time seems to be SLOWER than a previous Norelco.shaver. The charge time is faster though. And he doesn&#x27;t like the fact that he CANNOT shave while the shaver is recharging !</li>
    <li> does the job. Is it great? No, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. I shave in the shower and use a gel shaving cream. It saves all the mess at the sink. And it takes only 2 mins to shave. Is it as close as a blade? No. But then again, it&#x27;s absolutely painless. So I&#x27;ll forego the close shave in order to have a painless one.</li>
    <li> It is a quite shaver nice to hold  easy to clean we like the quick charging feature we also like the fact that we can wash under the water.</li>
    <li> After blade shaving for over forty years I decided it was time to take another look at electrics.  Based on the recommendations of my friends I purchased the Norelco AT810 about six months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it exclusively since then and have found it to give me consistently close, comfortable shaves literally approaching a blade shave.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor to anyone tired of blade shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:  Gives a close, clean share.&lt;br /&gt;  Little to no razor burn&lt;br /&gt;  At least three to four shaves (probably more) between battery charges.&lt;br /&gt;  Attractive, comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;  Very easy to clean... just flush with hot tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:  No good storage pouch or box to keep it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After shaving exclusively with my Norelco for nearly eight months I started to notice occasional whisker plucks (ouch!) and I wasn&#x27;t getting the close shave I was becoming acustomed to.  I decided to replace the shaving heads, regardless of Norelco&#x27;s annual replacement recommendation, to see what difference it would make.  The difference was stunning.  I again get a close clean shave without any plucks.  For all practical purposes I have a new razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad and he says he likes it. I will have to ask him specifically about how close it shaves, but he didn&#x27;t complain about it and he likes a close shave so I can assume he approves. He does it dry every time (even though you can do it wet also, which is great) and hasn&#x27;t had skin irritation. So far so good, dad likes it… daughter seal of approval I suppose.</li>
    <li> It gives me such a clean feeling after shaving. I used it while showering, and it didn&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
    <li> It was good and can be used for long time without charging but if you need good result you have to shave for around 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas because his eyesight is getting bad and it is safer than his standard razor with blades.  He is less than thrilled with it and he says it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for him.</li>
    <li> Shaving is still a pain, but the Norelco beats my Braun 8000 series by a mile!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at purchasing an electric, but after using this once my life is changed. No more razor burn and I&#x27;m loving life. Seriously, I love this thing. Great for military too I keep this in my bag and can shave without a mirror or having to fill a metal canteen cup.</li>
    <li> disapointed that a case was not included with the shaver</li>
    <li> it provided a cut that was not close, agitated the skin as well. I would not recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> A couple of my roommates had these types of razors, and I thought I&#x27;d try it out. Might as well upgrade it for shower use as that is when I usually shave, and get a closer one at that. It leaves five o&#x27;clock shadow, which is nice sometimes for some people, but I am not a very big fan. Also, it takes quite awhile with quite a few passes, and you have to move it in odd patterns to capture the hair in the oddly designed razor heads. Everything else is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Save your money and buy better quality, or join Dollar Shave Club. This shaver is waterproof, mechanical garbage. After about a month the blades needed changing, and despite changing the blades it did not change anything. The rotation has slowed quite a bit and I had to throw it out as it was a waste of time to fiddle with.</li>
    <li> Quick and fast, but sometimes have to go over an area multiple times to actually cut. Overall a good electric razor</li>
    <li> Came in right on time, as it was a Christmas present! It was exactly what I expected, and was able to avoid the crowds!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He was shaving less often and had problems with his skin whether he used an electric shaver or a razor. I bought this because it sounded like it would be good for his skin and provide a quick shave. It has done both. So now he looks really good :-)</li>
    <li> It is better than the 140.00 Norelco razor it replaced. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t quite make two years before it quit working.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Maybe I expected too much from a lower priced electric razor, but this thing isn&#x27;t very good. It tears my face up like a straight blade and leaves me with a lot of white heads (haven&#x27;t had this issue since high school). Do yourself a favor and spend more to get quality.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than 1 month now. It is pretty good. As my first Razor, I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement,so no surprises about the product itself. Amazon had the best price I could find. It arrived quickly and in virgin condition and I was able to register the warranty.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived on time, well packed and performs as advertised. The cleaning brush was not in the package. Fortunately I have others.  This razor cleans up nicely under hot running water. Good product.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It helps me to save time in the morning and it leaves my skin really soft. I definetely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This order was strange. I ordered an $78+ shaver for my husband. When it came, it was the $40 model. Then the next day received an order of 10 Bic pens. When I emailed the shipper, it said thanks for the order. Then it took another $16. To return both shaver and pen. Haven&#x27;t ordered anything else since. Money was returned, but still no shaver.</li>
    <li> Hubby used one of these for 9 years and dropped it and it broke. There was no problem for that long of a period, and this one seems to be the same. Well pleased!</li>
    <li> My 84 year old father has used a Norelco as long as I remember. I am 53 and have used a Norelco since I started shaving. My son who is in college now uses a Norelco. They have always been a very good razor and have never had any issues with quality. They have always lasted man y years. I purchased the AT810 a while ago and it suddenly died. Customer support was kind enough to send me a replacement, however it also died. After a week. I just got off the phone with them and since I do not have my original receipt they are not willing to help me. I asked if the unit that they sent me was a refurbished unit or a new one. They said that it was a new one. They are now made in China and after only a couple of years the first one breaks and the replacement breaks after a week. As an engineer this indicates a likely problem with manufacturing quality. To add insult to injury they said that they could offer me a 15% discount from the suggested retail price. Well I thought that I would share my experiences with you, the consumers. The gentleman that I spoke with on the phone was polite and kind, and he checked with a supervisor to see if there was anything that he could do for me. That&#x27;s when he said that they would extend a 15% discount. That left quite a bad taste in my mouth to say the least. I hate to say that I was a life-long loyal customer, but now I am done. I will very likely never buy another product from this company. I hope that this information was helpful to you and I hope that you have better luck than I have.</li>
    <li> Good overall razor. The fact that it can be cleaned easily by running under water is a great time saver. My husband uses this razor on a daily basis and has no complaints. The only downfall is that there is no way to stand the razor while it charges on the bathroom counter. In some homes this may be an issue if were to be knocked off. Ours is kept on a shelf with a hidden electrical outlet.</li>
    <li> The birthday boy was very pleased with the gift.  He uses it daily and is pleased with the results. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I saw a friend of mine camping and using one.  I felt it was better than using the usual saver with foam and lots of water.  Works out well with a smaller space in the camper.</li>
    <li> AT810 is good for me .But when i want to use  I found the power cable is not work</li>
    <li> This has worked consistently for me. I haven&#x27;t changed the blades yet (recommended after a year), but it&#x27;s still shaving perfectly. It holds a charge for a long time and charges quite quickly. A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Smooooooth Criminal is what I feel like after shaving with this thing. I used to be stubbly for days due to my previous one breaking, but then I used this sucker after a a month of no shave and everything was smooooooth.</li>
    <li> Serves only as a trimmer. You will have to pass it 20 times over your face in order to get anything close to a close shave.</li>
    <li> close shave without cutting/roughing my skin. Quick and easy! Great price. I replaced my old norelco and this one is quieter.</li>
    <li> Great razor!! My boyfriend loves it! He can shave wet or dry and it leaves his face very smooth. Battery life is pretty good, too. Fits comfortable in his hands, so the grip is good. His only minor complaint was that the compartment on the back for trimming longer hair is a little loose/wobbly. Otherwise, would totally recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Design makes it tough to replace cutting heads after removal.  Provides a clean shave when used dry.  Wet shave has not been attempted.  Battery life is good</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift and have been told it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very good and it was delivered on time with good service.&lt;br /&gt;Myself I like a safety razor.  Electric ones take to long to use.</li>
    <li> Not stronger as I expected  but nice.</li>
    <li> I already knew I would like this because I&#x27;ve been using an earlier model for years.  I got this one for the convenience of being able to rinse it with water.  Another benefit is that it will completely recharge in 1 hour.  This device gives me a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my guy and he absolutely loves it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and is easy to maintain!</li>
    <li> Pros: hold a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Knocks down the length of the hair prior to real shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used dry and can help to store at the office for oh crap moments.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: will irritate your skin the first dozen times you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave (better with water+foam)</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use but  it is not  strong enough to shave my husband face.  He has to keep going over and over the same place.  It takes longer to us the electric shaver verses a hand shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 2 weeks now. I like the ease of using this product and the close shave it gives, however it causes razor bumps on my neck so far. Hopefully my skin adjusts or my technique improves. I&#x27;m going to try a couple of different products to see if they help. Maybe this will help when it arrives : [[ASIN:B002SO8IMS B002SO8IMS]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if it improves or I end up returning the product.</li>
    <li> From all the reviews, I thought this shaver was going to be the answer, ending having to by replacement blades.  But this shaver did not do a very good job on my beard, which is light, either wet or dry.  I did send it back with no hassles.</li>
    <li> nice razor works great I love that u can use a shaving gel with it,  but there is no carrying case 4 it</li>
    <li> This is the first Norelco Razor I have ever bought.  Previously to this I have had Remington Razors.  The Norelco is both quieter and provides a better shave with less irritation.  I also really love the Waterproof feature of this razor with the ability to shave with shave gel.  Totally worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic buy best razor he has ever had by far. Can be used with lotion wet or dry.</li>
    <li> BEST RAZOR I EVER USED, I LIKE TO RINSE THE WHISKERS OUT OF THIS NEW RAZOR AND ABLE TO TAKE IT WITH ME.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is one of the best investments I have ever done. When you use it on dry skin results are not remarkable, but when you use it with shaving cream it really makes the difference. The first time I used it I felt a little reaction on my skin, but as it is stated on the manual, you should keep using it continously for a month or so and your skin will adapt (it didn&#x27;t take that much in my case, maybe just 2 or 3 days). Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with this as did a good job but today three months short of a yr the top with the heads will not stay closed .........I am not sure what to do about this it was not cheap but think all that plastic it is made of is the culprit this is not a good thing for the price and what it is to be used for....we needed this as my husband has memory troubles and this was a good solution but now very very disappointed....</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace an old (read ancient) one that my husband used.  Every day he was complaining that he had to recharge the old one and it didn&#x27;t shave as close as he needed.  So, this Norelco has stopped his complaining and he has only recharged it two times in 5 weeks.  The mornings are so much quieter now that the complaining has stopped.  I can even grab a few extra seconds of sleep while my husband gets ready. THANK  YOU NORELCO!!!</li>
    <li> Just does not give a close smooth shave.  My older Norelco does a much better job.  Quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Great price! Just a warning, the razor does not work when plugged into the outlet.  That took a little work to figure that out.  It has to be used without cord.</li>
    <li> This razor gives me a nice close shave and feels good against my face. The rapid recharge is a great feature.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying I am already a huge Norelco fan.  The rotaries just work better for me.  I have a Braun as well that I tried some years back, and I almost never use it because it just doesn&#x27;t work well shaving my face.  Tons of spots it seems to not shave no matter how many times I go over them, etc.  The rotary hugs the face better and leaves nothing behind.  It isn&#x27;t the same quality shave as a blade, but it is very very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major complaint about the Norelco&#x27;s has been the batteries.  They just don&#x27;t hold their charge very long.  And I have had two razors die prematurely because the battery stopped taking a reasonable charge at all and the razor wouldn&#x27;t work from the outlet.  ] kind of get the feeling on this razor that the battery is still a problem, but I cannot prove it yet, so I cannot downgrade it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the battery, it works great both wet and dry.  Wet is a bit odd though, because it is difficult to see it is working, but it is.  I am not sure it does a hugely better job, but it is so much easier on the face.  I usually get facial irritation with these, and wet, I get none with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Norelco is still the best rotary razor and rotaries are better than foils.  And this is a great value.  My Braun cost $40 more, and this easily outdoes it.</li>
    <li> I am handicapped and standing to shave at the sink is too painful for me. I decided to try an electric razor. I was quite pleased with my experience! It shaves closely with no pain or pulling as I thought there might be, I will never change from an electric razor again! It runs great. Does  a superb job. And the price was really inexpensive and a great value! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I came from using a crappy Remington to this. It&#x27;s like a night and day difference. It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I like how it&#x27;s very easy to clean, just run it over the tap and your done. It fully charges in one hour which is great! I will definitely use Norelco products in the future and recommend to friends. Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts &#x3D;D Also if you register online you get a additional 6 months on the warranty. So it&#x27;s a 2.5 year warranty, not bad at all.</li>
    <li> i get a relatively close shave but it takes time and requires pressing harder on the face.also it requires more repetition in the same areas,even on  the smooth areas like the cheeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver. You can really shave dry, with pre-shave lotion, and with shaving cream. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Right off the bat the full charge light didn&#x27;t stay lite. I didn&#x27;t use it, but the motor is woefully underpowered. You can tell just by listening to it. It is very poorly made and isn&#x27;t as good as the 12 year old Norelco 7885XL,6885XL I&#x27;m replacing. This is just part of an epidemic in the manufacturing world that has no pride in quality or workmanship and flooding the marketplace with cheap disposable crap. Products should get better as they are manufactured more, not worse. I have no idea what razor to buy anymore because the Remington I was looking at had the same complaint. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has the same issue of being tired of US companies manufacturing everything in China to the detriment of quality and durability. This razor isn&#x27;t any better than a Bic lighter.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be the exact same as my previous Norelco Electric Razor (Which lasted for 15 years!). However, the Pop Up trimmer has been redesigned since the last one I had.  This pop up trimmer does not open up far enough, almost at an acute angle to the razor, which means you have to hold it in place to use the trimmer. Otherwise, any pressure applied to the pop up trimmer will cause it to close back flush with the razor.  The pop up razor is what I used the most on my last Norelco, so this is an unacceptable flaw in the design in my book.  On top of that, the motor used for the blades is very weak, which makes the blades spin at an unacceptable speed.  This means that you will need to go over the same spot several times before anything more than stubble is cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advise for using this product, shave everyday. Otherwise, go get something else.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, it shaves nice and close for that daily dry shave every morning before work.  What I love the most about it though, you can shave using shaving cream if you want for a nice smooth irritation free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day before work and it gives me a nice close shave on those days but I usually don&#x27;t shave all weekend and my facial hair grows fast and it is coarse.  Typically when I shave with an electric razor Monday mornings after going 3 days it pulls and tends to irritate my skin especially around my neck.  But with this razor I just use a little bit of shaving cream and no pulling, no irritated skin and it comes out baby smooth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the expectation that it would be better than using a manual razor.  I find that it just takes more time to shave and it is not effective at shaving certain areas along the neck, so I end up having to use a manual razor anyway.  May just be a problem with electric razors in general or may not be a good fit for me, but I was not very satisfied with itl.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, It has not irritated me, makes the cut quite low and plus all the shaving is done in few time. Definitely the best.</li>
    <li> this razor is very nice and give a very nice shave... I enjoy it and am glad that I purchase it for me as my other Norelco was drop and it quit working..</li>
    <li> My last Norelco lasted for many years and worked great. This new one is amazingly light and quiet and, gives an even better shave. If it last as long as the last one, will be well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I do like Norelco shavers, particularly the wet/dry ones.  I don&#x27;t like to shave dry.  Although regular razors give a much closer shave, it takes a long time to get hot water to the bathroom sink, making shaving with a razor and shaving cream impractical.  With the Norelco wet/dry shavers, I can shave in the shower, and be done very quickly.    I should note that I&#x27;m on my third or forth Norelco now.  They stopped making blade refill kits for one.  The batteries of the others have stopped holding a charge.    The batteries are often soldered on to the circuit board inside the shaver, so they are not really user serviceable, and the cost of new battery pack and a repair is really more than the cost of a new shaver, when you consider that the new shaver comes with fresh blades.    My latest was the AT810, which worked wonderfully for a year or two, up until it didn&#x27;t.  For a few weeks, I&#x27;ve had a hard time turning it on.  I pushed the power button, and it would run for half a second, and then stop.  If I pushed the button a dozen or 15 times, it would eventually turn on, and stay on.  I thought that maybe the switch was getting worn out or something.  It seemed to be accepting a charge, as usual.  Today, I went to use it, and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  The LED was alternating green and orange, as if to indicate that the battery is dead.  I plugged it in, to try and charge it back up, and it&#x27;s still flashing green and orange.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that the battery is gone.  In retrospect, I suppose the problem with turning the shaver on was probably due to the battery not supplying enough power.    I would like Norelco shavers a lot more if I could change out the batteries easier, and they weren&#x27;t so disposable.  I also have a hard time believing that the blade refill packs cost $25-30 to produce, when you can buy an entire low-end Norelco shaver kit for that.    EDIT, 3/20/14:  I replaced the AT810 with an AT410, and last night I started to have the same problem.  Push the button, and it runs for a little while, and then stops.  As far as I can tell, the battery is charging normally, and is fully charged.  I can not get it to run for more than a couple seconds, no matter how many times I press the button.  The Norelco shavers seem to be getting progressively less dependable, and now I don&#x27;t know what to do.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get one of those single-blade safety razors that the Pawn Stars guy is promoting.    EDIT, 9/12/14:  I bought a single-blade safety razor, and the associated wet-shaving kit.  It takes an extra 7 minutes or so to shave, but a 3-piece safety razor is not very likely to die on me again, and $12 worth of blades will last me more than a year.  Oh, and the shave is much much much closer.</li>
    <li> I am going to try to make this review short.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m good with a normal razor, but I thought this would save me time and potentially money. After getting it, I used it for a few weeks to let my skin adjust as it said, but sadly, I still had to return it. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;The shaver actually worked very well on my cheek where the skin is all flat and easy to access. It was also effective in the mustache area and on the chin it worked decently. My problem was the jawline and the neck. It simply did not work for me. (I will note my jawline is well defined and can be hard with a normal razor too.) And when I shaved a decent amount of hair, it left my neck with the worst irritation I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this may be a good product which just didn&#x27;t work for me. Regardless, I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> I  bought this product for me (female) and not my Fiance. This is not used on his face but on my legs, armpits, and bikini area.  When I want a quick shave it will get a fairly smooth shave on my legs with the main blades but of course that hair is not as coarse as male facial hair. I love the little pop up trimmer, it is sharp and the perfect size and does not give me irritation in the sensitive zones that the over priced razors meant for females do- it&#x27;s becoming clear that those are kind of a scam. This is also made a lot sturdier than a lot of them. Ladies, I would recommend this to you over the female razors that claim to be good products. Overall, I think it is a well made product.</li>
    <li> easy for use and clean, nice!</li>
    <li> Loved this shaver so much I bought a second one. Being in the military and having to use a traditional shaver in the field over multiple days was rough. I bought a cheap electric razor with foils and it lasted a short period. This rotating head razor provides an amazingly close shave and no irritation. The fact that it can be used as a wet razor is a major plus. It has gone out to multiple training exercises and I have had no issues. short recharge period is a plus and I can get 8 good shaves off of one charge. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as expected and definitely works very well.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is still getting used to it, I have sensitive skin and it is difficult to get rid easily of the beard in the neck area as some of them tend to get incarnated.&lt;br /&gt;Will not discard yet as it is still in the process of having my skin accustomed to it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my husband and my husband is very happy to have this product it&#x27;s taking less time to shave and very handy and very user friendly.</li>
    <li> Four stars for how efficient it is,makes it easy to shave and to clean. Battery lasts a long time. Use this instead of a razor, you will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;excellent product&lt;br /&gt;meets the description&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone&lt;br /&gt;Battery last long and effective in use</li>
    <li> This Norelco was my husbands favorite Christmas present.  He likes that its a wet/dry shaver and he can take it in the shower and clean it in the sink.  He gets a close shave with it but cautions that all shavers give a close shave when they are new.  We&#x27;ll see if it can stand the test of time.  This is only the third time I ordered through Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been happy all three times.  The products came in less than a week, even close to Christmas.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband really  likes this razor.  He was in need of a new one and this particular brand and style really caught my attention.  I would recommend it to all men who like a very smooth shave.  I like to  feel my husband&#x27;s face after he uses  it.</li>
    <li> Works just the way it should. Good product in a decent price. Has a good battery life as well after a quick charge.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband wanted but he was disappointed that it did not have a stand. Just a simple one would do.</li>
    <li> The Phillips razor is easy to operate and cleans very easy and is also very light.I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This wonderful razor replaced a Panasonic which I had before. I like its grip, its ability to shave wet or dry, and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have some of the bells and whistles of my previous Remington, nor the last couple of shavers I&#x27;ve had-- no meter to show battery life, for example.  BUT Shaves way better and quieter than any electric I&#x27;ve owned.  Has yet to yank on my face, doesn&#x27;t take 32 passes to get it all (though of course if I don&#x27;t shave for 4 days it takes longer).  I got way more for my money this time.  Too soon to tell how long the batteries will survive, or what will happen when I inevitably drop it, but it seems sturdier than the last one I had.  Easy to grip, does a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husbands birthday and he has love it. It does not cause him pain. I Will highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and good efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it because it is easy to wash , and you can use in both dry and wet conditions.</li>
    <li> This razor is the quietest I have ever owned and that includes the Norelco&#x27;s as well.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very close and doesn&#x27;t leave hair that lays close to the skin like most other razors do.&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problem with skin burning even with the close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes ONE hour (60 minutes) to be fully charged. How great is that? Most others have to charge&lt;br /&gt;overnight. Also, all I have to do to clean it is hold it under the bathroom faucet and it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br /&gt;Folks, you can&#x27;t go wrong on this little jewel. I&#x27;m 71 years young and have used nothing but electric razors&lt;br /&gt;most of my life and this is the best one yet!!</li>
    <li> I was susprised how good the razor shaved after I had a shower. While I do have a heavy beard, the shave was even better after a couple of weeks. So far I have shaved for 3 weeks and no recharge yet. I use the same shaving cream (lighter application) that I used  with my Gittette Mach 3. It is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This works perfectly for me!  My old razor had given up the ghost and I needed a newer razor.  I went to Amazon and compared various razors made by Norelco and chose this one.  Mainly because I can use it in the shower if I want to or by the sink and not worry about ruining it at all.  It gives a very close shave (being a woman, I need close so people won&#x27;t know I shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a razor that provides a very close shave without having to be attached to a plug in, this is it!</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with how close the shave is. Another reviewer suggested replacing the blades right after purchase; there are better model. Laces for this unit. I&#x27;ll try that...</li>
    <li> nice color&lt;br /&gt;good operacinalided&lt;br /&gt;fits easy&lt;br /&gt;quick to recharge&lt;br /&gt;good price&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will support a long use&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> Razor shaves very closely, is relatively quiet, and after charging,&lt;br /&gt;holds the charge for a very long time without the need to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this razor, in fact, I bought another for my son for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have this razor &amp;l like the way it performs so I bought this for our grandson for christmas this year.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as well as earlier models.</li>
    <li> I was hesitating to give this product 3 stars, the reason is not giving very close shave.</li>
    <li> I researched this razor, wanting a simple, affordable Electric to supplement my daily dual-blade shaving in the shower. This does the trick, and is simple to use and clean, since its&#x27; waterproof. I use it to clean up anything missed while shaving in the shower with soap and a dual-blade razor. Its so easy to clean!</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my legs. For that, it works fine. I do have to go over the same area over and over again, but the result is a much closer shave than with any of the &#x27;women&#x27; electric razors I tried. A big no go on the bikini area or underarms though... it just tears me up, thought I can&#x27;t figure out why it is any different there than my legs.</li>
    <li> Not a bad Razor. Works great does the job with no problems. Easy to clean, always a sustainable keeps charge.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco razor is much better than I expected. It substitutes blades and offers you excellent shaving in easy way to use.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006GQYSC8 Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;I RECENTLY PURCHASED A NORELCO AT810 ELECTRIC RAZOR WITH AMAZING RESULTS. AFTER USING THIS RAZOR FOR THE FIRST TIME,I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO BLADES.I HAD A 5 DAY GROWTH BEARD WHICH I SHAVED DRY USING NO LUBRICANTS.I SHAVED IN LESS TIME WITH A VERY CLOSE SHAVE.IF THERE&#x27;S A BETTER RAZOR OUT THERE FOR THE MONEY, LET ME KNOW.I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT NORELCO HAD THE BEST TECHNOLOGY AND I FOUND OUT FOR MYSELF.&lt;br /&gt;  THANKS NORELCO</li>
    <li> The AT810 gives a close and smooth shave in a short time. Battery charge is more than adequate for multiple uses and shaver is easy to grip and use,</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new razor, his old one died.  So we replaced it with a new Norelco, he had another brand before this.</li>
    <li> This is a repl;acement for a prior Norel razor.  When the battery of the razor no longer holds &#x27;enough&#x27; charge I find it more convenient to replace the razor, rather than replacing parts..</li>
    <li> It works well in water and dry modes. I havent tried with razor foam, but I dont need to because my beard is not that hairy.&lt;br /&gt;I havent charged even 1 time since first use, and its been 1 week of normal use. Pretty cool battery life.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars at the moment.</li>
    <li> This the ultimate shave.  It is the closest, quietest, smoothest, most luxurious shave ever.  I recommend it to everyone and anyone.</li>
    <li> i originally started with the Panasonic line thinking they were the best until my last one broke. tried this one and is amazed...compared to Panasonic when u open the top to clear out ur hair it has more room to store the hair so ur not constantly opening the top. second is the battery life lasts way longer....third is this one gets a closer shave especially the neck...im sticking with Philips.</li>
    <li> Turned out to be a great birthday gift--the gentleman looks better than ever!  He found it easy to use, with great results.</li>
    <li> My husband has used a Philips in the past and wanted that brand. This was his first circular type razor and he finds it to be weaker, not allowing as close a shave as his old one. I tried it out as well on my legs and no matter what I tried I couldn&#x27;t get it to cut any off at all. It seems you need really stiff stubble to even get to the razor edge. If your beard hair is of the thinner variety, this won&#x27;t even make a dent.</li>
    <li> Consider that, as your skin perspires from the water temperatures, it&#x27;s no longer dry and smooth, creating friction between the surface of your face, and that of the razor.  So, unless your prepared to use a gel with your razor, which the advertising suggests is not necessary and creates a higher degree of maintenance/clean up, you won&#x27;t get a good shave with this razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate a single star on the basis that i sought a shower razor (not a dry razor).</li>
    <li> I had to hunt down the razor because this thing wouldn&#x27;t get it all and believe me i tried for an hour.</li>
    <li> On my forth week not happy yet , I was lookin for speed , thought gel and cost of razors was a pain , thought the tech had improved , looked for faster than shaving but patch, s here and there drivin me crazy as a military man now way this would pass insp.&lt;br /&gt;  Sorry</li>
    <li> I surely have no complaints and find that cleaning my shaver very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I will order another one for my travel bag?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Norelco is the best electric shaver out there in my opinion. Combining wet and electric shaving was the best idea ever!! It&#x27;s easy to shave in humid climates or the shower and it&#x27;s very easy to keep clean!</li>
    <li> Not as good of quality as you could get a few years back</li>
    <li> leaves hair, not so smooth on skin, gets the job done but takes a lot of time..&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have used Norelco for years . . . yes you do have to replacde them after a few thousand shaves...everything has a life limit.  Not as great as the Norelco that comes with the cleaner.  Clean it yourself and save the $$!</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for years and this wet shaver is far above any that I have ever come across..</li>
    <li> Switching from the corded Norelco to this cordless model did not give the performance difference hoped for. Although it is easier to clean (rinse) and using the razor wet is a nice option, the number of repeated strokes over the same area required to get every hair is the same as their cheaper model.</li>
    <li> very difficult to clean, and even more difficult to put back together.  when I finally got it almost back together it suddenly fell apart and I had to start over.  this is a worthless piece of garbage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for the last 20 years. This one is just just ok.  It doesn&#x27;t cut smoothly like it says on the description. I like my older model and it&#x27;s made in Europe. This one is made in China that&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll know right away that it is cheaply made. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best shaver, Norelco or other brand, I ever had.  So so quiet and so smooth a shave.  Do not spend any more for a more expensive shaver.  Great value, great shaver.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for</li>
    <li> Close shave, great trimming tool, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible razor. It leaves whiskers that can&#x27;t be shaved even after going over the area several times. In frustration, I ordered new batteries for my seven year old Norelco and rebuilt it. I use the old one while the new one sits in a drawer just in case I have to use it temporarily some day.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it and  uses it everyday. I guess it worth the price.  ~ I like its appearence.it looks cool</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco from 2005 and it wasn&#x27;t working well so I decided to buy this one, the new technology and efficiency has been drastically improved, best decision in 2014 on &amp;#34;Health Products&amp;#34; for me. This is a high quality item by Phillips. Delivered fast and as described thanks.</li>
    <li> States in product book that a holder is included with the razor.  THERE WAS NONE IN THE PACKAGE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN</li>
    <li> A couple years back i thought it was &amp;#34;time for a change&amp;#34; and after years with this kind of familiar Norelco 3-head design I instead changed to some straight electric razor instead. When I first started with it, it was new and exciting- as exciting as electric razors can get, I guess...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But over time I started thinking how much longer it was taking me to shave than it used to. When the time was coming to replace the heads (or the razor) I went ahead and figured I&#x27;d go back to the Norelco types I had been used to before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a difference. It takes my maybe one third to one quarter the time it was taking me to shave with the old electric I had been using. This design catches so much more hair on the first pass it&#x27;s sad to think of the hours I wasted with the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is there is no &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; unit to keep this standing tall when charging- like every other Norelco I ever owned had. Instead the charging cord going directly into the power port- it&#x27;s not the end of the world but something I didn&#x27;t even think to look for when deciding which model to purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  Battery life is fantastic, and the close shave it gives keeps me out of trouble with my NCOs.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about 2 1/2 months ago because I wanted to try a new razor. I only use  electric razors and it was time for me to try a new one when I read the ratings and was convinced I wanted this one. When I 1st got it, it worked great and I was happy. But that happiness only lasted a month and a half, now it doesnt trim my face very well at all. Ive never had a razor work this terribly in the 15 years I been using a electric razor. Do yourself a favor buyers and dont invest in this one.</li>
    <li> My husband is using it, likes the fact that it can be washed with water.  The razor is giving him a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Give a much closer shave than our last model, we didn&#x27;t even know what we were missing until we got this one.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Sad Dad took a birthday gift. I&#x27;m glad your like it. I think were purchased inexpensively. I want my husband will buy it.</li>
    <li> I had never had an electric shaver before, but as I am retired now I no longer have to shave every morning and after 2 or 3 days my blade shaver (Schick Quatro)was having trouble handling it.  So I tried this electric Norelco and it has exceeded my expectations. It gives me a smooth shave  quickly and smoothly.  I should have tried it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Highly rate this a buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric Razor. Know I can shave my face an feel like one super star from the movies. I will be the most popular guy in the town</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these for my dad, husband and father-in-law. They just loved it. I am happy to find a gift like this.</li>
    <li> It works  as it was designed and intended. I use this one at home as I use another for travel. It keeps a charge a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for some 15 years, and recently retired my old one, replaced by the AT810 Powertouch Aquatec. This one shaves well, is not noisy, and is easy to handle. The aspect I like most is that it can be cleaned by rinsing with water. It cleans well in water, and this makes it easier to use, and requires no cleaning fluids or lubricants. The consequence of all this? The manufacturer recommends replacing the shaver head once a year. Given that there are no maintenance products necessary, this is a good tradeoff. Oh, and the product booklet says the shaver can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> My old Remington died and I wanted something that I could use to quickly shave a couple of times per week. Other times I use a razor. This works vey well for my needs. I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect this to shave as close as a razor, but it works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> In cleaning,it  took too long to reassemble.The part to fix the blades in place was difficult for me to reattach.</li>
    <li> Cut your beard totally, and you can wet with all confidence.. Great Product, life of battery more than 1 hour and recharge fastly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a Christmas gift. As with all items of this type the results are relative. I asked the recipient of this razor whether they had any qualms or comments &amp; was told that it worked fine for them.</li>
    <li> The product will do when using a traditional razor is medically contraindicated (taking oral blood thinners) but doesn&#x27;t come close to the efficiency and speed of conventional methods. Shick and Gillette have nothing to fear.</li>
    <li> All my life and this new one is no exception.  Cuts close; quick charges.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Having a teenager has it&#x27;s challenges.  One challenge that i don&#x27;t have anymore, is getting him to shave!  With the new Powertouch razor, he can quickly and easily go from trash stach, to a clean shaven young man.  I love the product!  He does too!</li>
    <li> Norelco at810 is pretty good four the price It seems like the battery lasts forever i only charge it once a week</li>
    <li> I tried Norelco 20 years ago with the same (actually worse) result. For some reason the rotating heads just don&#x27;t work well for my beard- Braun and Panasonic have been good.</li>
    <li> Good razor for the price</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s the job done, very effective electric razor. Used daily with no problem. Cleaning is hassle. Highly recommended. A bit expensive though.</li>
    <li> I waited  a while to write this review, to see if this product would shave better as my beard &#x27;accustomed&#x27; itself to the shaver.  It never happened.  I have to spend more time going over, and over, and over my face, than I would spend with a blade shaver, water, and shave cream.  Maybe this is the shaver for you, but don&#x27;t blame me if you&#x27;re not satisfied!</li>
    <li> and have a tough beard.  I tend to stay away from conventional razors.  The best thing to do then is shave, or have a barber, shave your face very close and then use this with foam or gel or Lectric Shave.  You will keep your beard close.  Some may have to shave twice a day.  If you have a tough beard and let it go a couple of days, forget it.  You will have to blade shave close again.  Best I can tell you.</li>
    <li> wet or dry shave works great for the husband now that he has a job he has to shave everyday for!!</li>
    <li> Great electric razor. Use it daily!! Awesome for all skin colors and types. Quick, smooth shave every time!! Recommend it for any white people out there.</li>
    <li> It shaved my face fairly well (I have a light beard and sensitive skin), but it really irritated my neck and actually brought blood in a couple of places. I was very disappointed, but turns out my wife loves it as a leg shaver, so she is the happy new owner. (Hence the 3 star rating.)&lt;br /&gt;I immediately ordered a Panasonic ES81035 Wet/Dry Shaver. Thanks to speedy delivery from Amazon, I received the new shaver before my neck had time to clear up. I decided to try to shave it anyway. The Panasonic shaved my neck just fine, even over the irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave on the way to work. Works well on facial hair, but doesn&#x27;t shave well along the contours of the neck.</li>
    <li> This razor performs as advertised. It works well in the shower. It is quiet and fits well in my hand. The shave is close without any irritation. Battery life is long and recharge is a breeze.  The main feature that attracted me is being waterproof.  I now clean the heads by running the razor under a stream of water.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Except that the batteries last a lot longer.  It&#x27;s still my favorite shaver and I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands.</li>
    <li> First things first: my skin sucks when it comes to shaving. While the razor industry seems to think layering on more and more blades is the way to go, my poor face would reply with red bumps and irritation that just looks terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumbled across this shaver. Had decent reviews. I agree with most here - you should use a good shave cream for the closest shave, especially if you have sensitive skin. I personally recommend the CO Bigelow shave creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing charges fast, keeps a charge for a long time, and works great. Nothing to lose here for the price.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor super great product for the money and without a second thought I would purchase this item again, made well and works perfect even under water, Thanks!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this item. Purchased it in April 2013, had to replace the heads by October, then the entire thing quit working altogether at the end of October. Called Norelco to discuss the issue (the motor quit working) and was told this was a known issue. They promised to send me a replacement handle within 3 weeks. As of today, December 9, it&#x27;s still not here. According to Norelco, the item is still back-ordered and they have no idea when it will in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially it seemed to offer a decent shave, but the heads wear out quickly adding to the initial cost. I recommend you invest in something that costs a little more up front, you&#x27;ll save money in the end. Of course, the frustration with replacement and repair doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
    <li> How the hell are you going to charge $59.95 for one of them, but $169.95 for a Pack of 2?</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco. The first one lasted me about 20 years. It was still shaving close w/the original heads, but suddenly died. I prefer a corded shaver as the older batteries were heavy. This unit is very light. The battery lasts a VERY long time. I think I&#x27;ve charged it once in over two months of use. It&#x27;s quiet, shaves close, &amp; does a great job. Cleaning is also much improved. I only shave dry. I haven&#x27;t tried the little sideburn clipper. The new generation Heads do a better job of shaving those larger diameter hairs. I&#x27;ve a thick N course beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the lack of a simple travel pouch. Come on, Norelco. What would a simple vinyl pouch cost you, about 50 cents?? I have to use an old food container whenever I travel. That annoys. The product is so nice to use that I can&#x27;t detract a star from the rating, though. Nice job, Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have a really thick stubborn and somewhat curly beard. You have to shave almost every day to use it to its full potential and even then it always seems to miss some hairs for some reason. The trimmer for longer hair isn&#x27;t very sharp.</li>
    <li> this electric razor gets the job done wet or dry, has a hard time with a bit longer hair but will eventually get there.&lt;br /&gt;used with shave gel or foam it just glides by so smoothly and effortlessly,&lt;br /&gt;the pop up trimmer at the back is great for straightening ends and touching up if you got a goatee or sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean ... wish it came with some type of dock tho</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for more than 50 years.  This is a great razor.  The only two negatives are the design of the head retainer mechanism (i.e., the head falls off when tapping the razor to discard cuttings) and the advertised life of the cutters (i.e., Norelco recommends they be replaced once a year at a cost that is nearly equal to the cost of a new razor).  Other than these issues, the razor is great.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Gillette Fusion stalwart.  I typically shave in the shower and get a close shave.  I have owned a few electric razors in the past but was never quite satisfied with their performance.  I received the Norelco AT810 for Christmas and am very happy with the results and convenience.  What surprised me initially was how quiet it is while doing a thorough job quickly.  I can shave faster with the Norelco.  Everytime I inspect the results I am impressed.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband as a Christmas present and he absolutely loves it!  This is the first time in many years that he has used an electric razor and is enjoying having to shave without having the irritation that he was having from a regular razor.</li>
    <li> Cuts close without multiple passes.  I have had it a few months and use it to shave my head.  I would buy another.  You cant use it when it is dead by plugging it in and using it.  Make sure its charged or have a back up</li>
    <li> I would think twice before purchasing. Had the shaver for about 1 1/2 months. Does a very poor job. I like Phillips products. This one needs a complete renovation in design. Gives a very poor shave.</li>
    <li> For 60 years I&#x27;ve used either a razor (with blades) or a other electric razors with what I call STRAIGHT cutting blades. I have never used a Phillips because I wondered how on earth could a razor with circular (for heavens sakes!) blades, be any good. One day - when I wanted to try something new in shaving - I saw and avidly read, a review on Amazon by a woman who said she had purchased this razor for her husband, and &amp;#34;he loved it.&amp;#34; So I took the plunge and got one myself. I am totally blown away by it. I love it. It is amazing. I love how I can shave &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and not use any cream or &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; and get a top notch, first class shave. As those ads used to say &amp;#34;...as smooth as a baby&#x27;s...&amp;#34; you know what! I save money now by NOT needing to buy shave cream, and do NOT need blades ever again. I wonder why the marketing folks at Phillips do not highlight this sort of VERY positive feedback - they have a longtime winner here, and I wonder why others have not copied this format in superior shaving. Hats off to the Phillips Norelco AT810 - you are in the Winner&#x27;s Circle!(jdcradio@cox.net)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to have an electric razor again and grateful for this product. It was very easy to use and charge. I did the registration too for the extra months of warranty.</li>
    <li> Great shave out of the box. Plastic case difficult to open. No stand, but charges quickly - one less thing on the bathroom counter - cord fits easily in drawer. No carrying case so I kept my old one - it fits fine.My previous Norelco lasted more years than I can remember. Love being able to use lotion and rinse razor after. Why spend money on more expensive models? Save the difference and buy some nice flowers for your wife or girlfriend.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun user for years. My Braun was old and needed new parts so I decided to save money and switch to Norelco. This razor makes my neck area appear burned. Skin is so irritated that people ask me if something is &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34;.  It shaves the face area fine.  But the neck area? Forget it.  I battled this razor for months thinking my skin will adapt (because the instruction booklet says so).  Forget it!  I wasted $70.  Now I bought a $90 Braun and I&#x27;m back to normal.  I have no idea why anyone would use Norelco if they all perform like this.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this razor.  My last Norelco rotary (that cost 3 times as much) had died and I needed something fast.  I usually shaved with blades but used an electric razor for the \\&quot;quickies\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The reason is that since this unit is waterproof, I can shave in the shower using foam as I would with a blade.  It&#x27;s faster, easier, and will be far less expensive in the long run.  I never thought \\&quot;foam\\&quot; and \\&quot;electric razor\\&quot; belonged together in the same sentence, let alone in the same shower, but there is a reason this unit is waterproof!  Try it!  It feels as close as a blade now, which I have never experienced with an electric razor before.  Also, it solves the problem of \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; and irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I was getting tired of buying those expensive packs of Gillette Fusion blades, and they never seemed to last long enough for what they cost, so I always used them longer than I should and half the time was getting a lousy shave anyway.  Now I&#x27;m using this razor exclusively, and smugly smile each time knowing that this razor didn&#x27;t cost much more than a single pack of Gillette Fusion disposables at Costco.  Life is good!</li>
    <li> Handy, fits hand well, quiet operation.  Closeness of shave what you expect from an electric razor. Definitely an improvement over my much earlier model.  Works with wet or dry skin which is a plus for shaving after showering.</li>
    <li> BROKE ?OTHER LASTED 4 YEARS /TOSSED</li>
    <li> Gift for my father and it works just OK, I still not get the use of the third part of it.</li>
    <li> Satisfaction up to date. It shaved me really clean and there is no leftover.&lt;br /&gt;And it is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR FOR ALL USES. EASY TO CLEAN YOU CAN WASH IT. AFFORDABLE PRICE. I RECOMEND IT WITH NO DOUBTS</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had that didn&#x27;t involve a blade.  Long time blade shaver is converted. Been using it for a year now, not going back to blades!</li>
    <li> It gives a close shave with very little effort. I like the option of shaving wet or dry.  And being able to clean it out by opening the head and running the whole unit under water is great.  I&#x27;ve used lots of different electric razors over the years without really being happy.  For the last 14 years I&#x27;ve been using a Mach III blade which I like as long as I shave in the shower.  The Norelco gives me a shave about as close as a blade with no irritation and if I am doing a quick touch up shave it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
    <li> met my expectations!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. He can use it dry or in the shower. He was worried it would give him razor burn but it doesn&#x27;t. He only has to shave every other day now.</li>
    <li> Does not do as good a job as the raisor did.  I must spend more time trying to get a clean shave and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I like it because it is useful and convenient for my daily life. It is good and attractive. You can try if necessary.</li>
    <li> Best razor for the price works very well just as good as the 100 dollar razors that are out there</li>
    <li> I got this as a fathers day gift for my dad because his old Norelco electric razor just happend to be on its last legs. He absolutely loves this razor, the quick charge feature, the long battery life, and the side-edge trimmer for side burns. Now I am finally his favorite son, haha.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new razor. Shipped on time process went well.</li>
    <li> This shaver is cordless only ! You cannot use it with the cord inserted ! It does not state this in the blurb . I last bought a Norelco ten years ago . It has proved to be an excellent machine but it finally needs replacement . If the blurb had stated that it couldn&#x27;t be used plugged in I would have purchased a different model.</li>
    <li> it works good considering that I rather use an electric shaver than a razor...not strong enough if your have a thick beard but works good on me.</li>
    <li> Get a 3D model. They are much better.</li>
    <li> What is there to say, the price is reasonable and it does the job good. If you are just looking for a good one to get the job done properly and look nice, this is it. If you are looking for a luxury one that is amongst the best, you will have to pay much more.</li>
    <li> Though it is not the greatest razor in the world, I think it is a good value. Works for me very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor after shopping around quite a while.  It lives up to its billing.  Maybe you can&#x27;t shave with it while it&#x27;s plugged in, but there&#x27;s really no need to.  Fully charged, the razor will clear my face at least 30 times before needing to be recharged.  The cut is close and painless.  I&#x27;ve used it with a dry face, with a wet face, and with shaving cream.  It works best for me with a dry face, next best with shaving cream.  Pop the top and run the faucet over it to clean the head - it&#x27;s a snap.</li>
    <li> This razor is wonderful! I always get an extremely close shave, both with shaving gel and dry. It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean out the head and it holds a charge for a long time. Overall, I highly recommend this electric razor for everybody.</li>
    <li> I had attempted to get this razor previously from another supplier and it never came.  They offered to send me something in its place but I knew this was the razor I wanted and needed....so I kept searching....and finally got it.  This is a great product.  Can be used wet or dry and has a trimmer too.  This is the second one of these that I have purchased for my family.  I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for ease of use, ease of maintenance, and a great shave.</li>
    <li> Very useful, i&#x27;m a beard man but when i must by beardless i just connect the razor and ouala...I´m 5 years youngest magically.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive razors but this shaves as well or better. Since most of the inflated cost is for things like battery indicators or fancy rechargers, I decided to try this. Got it for mid-$50s and it has worked well. Would like it to shave better around my chin (thus 4, not 5 stars), but all in all I&#x27;ve been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good--according to my husband. It does not cut his face. Cheaper through amaxon than in the store. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco AT810 shaver I have purchased because I was so pleased with the first one. Needed this one for traeling and as a backup.</li>
    <li> gives comfortable and close shave but leave some hair under the chine, so have to use razor in the end.. working well wet or dry, i prefer wet, cleaning is easy too</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I had one of the very first model with a single rotary blade head, back in the 1950&#x27;s. Then a twin head about 5 years later. They were good, up to a point. One could not make clear border lines. This has a blade trimmer. Quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed to have it delivered into Australia without the correct wall contact. Fi! one must use an adapter doubling the size of the unit. Which is lousy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was eventually no cheaper than buying the same thing in Australia. But it is quite hopeless to make complaint through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I best take back a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings, JohnWilson. (Very serious)</li>
    <li> Great razor and at a affordable price. This is the third Philips Norelco we have purchased over the past 30 years.</li>
    <li> i am one of the guys who have problems shaving due to razor bumps and irritated skin. This razor leaves my skin Baby soft, and never makes my face itchy or irritated. Also no more razor bumps. It also cut my time in half, what would take 5-10 mins to shave my face has turned into 2-5 mins. i Love this thing, i cant speak for any long time use, hopefully in 6 months it will still be doing this good of a job, but for right now. WOW</li>
    <li> After a short charge, the razor gives a nice shave. It&#x27;s nice to know that it can be used in the shower, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. It gets hard to reach places. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it. The pop up trimmer for sideburns and smaller places is also a cool feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he says it does not even shave him at all.  All it does is pull his beard hairs.</li>
    <li> No worries so far. Can&#x27;t even hear the difference between just running &amp; actually cutting. Good value for what I spent.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad and he has completely stopped using razors now. He absolutely loves it and recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift every time he uses it he says Great shaver smooth no pain ,I actually enjoy shaving. This is by far the best Christmas present I&#x27;ve ever received.</li>
    <li> This is my first try at an electric razor and  I could not be more disappointed.  I have used it for a couple months and i have to go over this with a conventional razor every time to get  smooth shave.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what technique I use the results are the same, lots of missed hairs.  think something may be defective but I have passed my return date.</li>
    <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave.  It does hold a charge which is okay.  I use it for my head and beard.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. The price was great. Bought a really expensive one two years ago and it stopped working after 15 mos.  I bought him this one at half the price and hubby said it works great.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I need only charge it every 3 or 4 weeks and it is very easy to clean</li>
    <li> Works well as expected and will be put throughout the test every day and without any doubt that it will or should do it&#x27;s task well.</li>
    <li> Good product. Happy to find it works on all voltage levels when traveling unlike toothbrushes. A bit frustrating when cleaning though. (It takes practice to seat the heads when cleaning.)</li>
    <li> I bought it in november, my husband is useing it all the time. It doesnt cut hear so perfectly and it leaves skin a bit red somewhere but its a good product :)</li>
    <li> The razor works as advertised. I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors for years and this is the best on yet.  The wet shave capability is great.</li>
    <li> Came quickly. Good price.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts long - It has been one month. Still working on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotor blades are flexible! If you press them at any angle, there&#x27;s a spring that allow them to dip and therefore change angle. I couldn&#x27;t feel any difference between this and the next version, AT830.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On cons, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t catch all the beard - and skin may take a few days to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to get this for travel, but I&#x27;ve been using it daily and moved away from using razor blades.</li>
    <li> i bought it again for my friends and family. It is very good.I had one myself.it&#x27;s good it&#x27;s good it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I was a blade guy.  I wanted to try an electric.  I read many reviews on here and settled on this model.  I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with an electric shaver over a blade.  I can&#x27;t believe how close this shaves and now I don&#x27;t get red neck burn anymore. Granted, I&#x27;m still learning how to shave with this, but the shave I get is very good.  You are supposed to give your face 21 days to adjust to the electric, but my face didn&#x27;t take that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to shave at any time you want for that &amp;#34;fresh-shaven&amp;#34; feeling.  Practically, you really can&#x27;t do that with a blade.  The battery life on this thing is very long. Also, being able to rinse this off is a plus.  Also, this shaver is extremely quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at shavers to buy, get this one.  So far it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice unit&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;- quick charging ,&lt;br /&gt;- good battery life, (I have been using for over a year now still lasts long - I don&#x27;t have to charge it for weeks)&lt;br /&gt;- waterproof,&lt;br /&gt;- comfortable to hold and gives a smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;- flip trimmer, which really can be used as a proper trimmer for the beard :D. Because you cant really use a shaver if you have a beard (more than a week un shaved).&lt;br /&gt;I have used it many times to trim first - takes some time as its small but works really well.&lt;br /&gt;- Sturdy - I accidentally bumped into the door once with my mine blade panel open - it detached from the unit so I though I broke it - but it still fits back in properly with a click&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;- For a quick Shave will not be 100% effective at all areas - like the the hard to reach areas. For a quick shave I use this and then just use my Mach3 on the areas around the neck to finish.&lt;br /&gt;(I also had a foil top shaver as an addon to a trimmer from philips - and that worked well on these areas - but wasn&#x27;t as smooth on the rest)&lt;br /&gt;- Fine hairs get stuck on the inside rubber (under the blades panel at the bottom) - it is not a major concern but it doesn&#x27;t come off if you just put it under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still nothing to prevent from me giving it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> My husband has always hated electric shavers--until now. He loves this one, especially since he can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> My immediate reaction was that it does not shave as close as my original 25 year old Norelco shaver. I had to start using it again this week when the AT810/41 failed to come on. I thought the rechargeable battery had gone dead. But, after several hours of charging, it still will not run. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model and I will try to return it for repair or replacement inside the two-year warranty. I bought because my original will no longer hold a charge, but it will operate when plugged into the wall.</li>
    <li> Started to turn itself on randomly after a year.  I&#x27;m guessing one of the seals wore out and water got into it.  When it worked, it worked fine but i would not recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> The person using this product finds it easy to use and maintain. He is in a nursing home and is happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This razor does what it says it will.  Needs to be charged a bit more than expected though.  Doesn&#x27;t suck.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a really good gift for boyfriend,both the price and quality are perfect.although it hasn&#x27;t been used yet,i know he likes it.</li>
    <li> Better than other electric razors, totally recommended, good dry - wet shaver for a decent price but...not perfect yet norelco!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my husband and he likes it. It&#x27;s the first time he tried an electric razor so it takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
    <li> Love to shave with water, soap, foam, dry, wet and whatever strikes my fancy at that moment. Great product for reasonable price!  The best one for the price you pay!</li>
    <li> Quiet and works great. I think it should have a stand charger. Price was good but I&#x27;d prefer if it was made in the United States instead of China. Thanks, John Stenberg</li>
    <li> I have owned two Norelcos. The first lasted around 20 or more years with a hiatus. It stopped working. Bought a replacement Norelco made in China which was clumsy, noisy  and did give a close shave,.Replaced with a Remington which was great on face but lousy on neck and required razor blade. Picked up original and by crackies amazingly it fired up and gave a nice close shave for three or more years but alas it lost its cutting edge. More than got my money&#x27;s worth, a great product. This little beauty has started out like a champ, made in China, vastly superior to 2nd Norelco made in China BUT recommend head replacement in only 12 months. So what gives? Marketing ploy? inferior materials? They not only recommend earl replacement  but BUY IT NOW! Without the confidence that it will give a close shave for more than twelve months I have to limit to four stars and hope it does better.</li>
    <li> deliver on time, great product</li>
    <li> Hubby really likes this one, his other one fell apart within 2wks.</li>
    <li> I usually use a Philips Norelco 6945 that is good, but now i tried the AT810 aquatec that is excellent.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is the razor I have been looking for. I had been using the Norelco razors for years. When my old razor expired, (still works, but cannot locate new blades), I had bought other Norelco razors after Phillips bought them. I had been disappointed with the motor of the cheaper models. Then I found this one, and I love the stronger motor on this razor. The shave is great. I would definitely buy this one again. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I replaced my existing Norleco with this one because of the shorter recharge time and I wanted a working backup, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;It uses the same shaving heads as my old one (HQ8),and  as expected, shaving performance is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;There is a model upgrade from 4100 that offers a floating head assembly, or something similar. Might be worth it, but my flexible wrist does a fine job adjusting the angle of the shaving head to match the shape of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband &amp; he loves it.</li>
    <li> works well and seems to keep the charge well also&lt;br /&gt;I like the shave it gives me and I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Takes about a week to get used to, but afterwards works fine. Only problem is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I had gone back regular razors for about 15 years. I got this shaver and like it, so, will not use regular razors again.</li>
    <li> First of all, if you don&#x27;t want a bunch of details, just scroll down to the IN SUMMARY paragraph at the end!&lt;br /&gt;Also- This is a copy of the review I left of the Norelco AT830.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a longtime Norelco user, and the AT830 is a winner for me. Although I have a tough beard with hairs growing every which way, I have dealt with sensitive skin ever since I was a teenager. I learned a couple of decades ago that a rotary shaver that&#x27;s made for use in the shower was my salvation. Thanks to Norelco wet-or-dry razors, I experience far less skin irritation. For me, having a good rotary shaver in the shower is indispensable. I know I&#x27;m not the only guy like this, so this is a detailed review for those of you who are considering an 810 or 830 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to learn of the new Aquatec models, having used the Norelco 6000 and 7000 series Cool Skin razors for many years. For what it&#x27;s worth, I tried the last wet/dry model (the 8060X) with the fully exposed shaving heads attached to a single stalk. After using it for a couple of weeks, I found that I couldn&#x27;t get as close a shave as with my old 7735X model with the weakening battery. Also, the lack of a chamber for the clipped hair was inconvenient, so I returned it and went back to the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon learning of the newer Aquatec models, a friend (who&#x27;s also a Norelco wet/dry fan) and I cooked up a plan. He also needed a new shaver thanks to a dying battery, so we both decided to buy a new model at the same time. He bought the slightly less expensive AT810, while I spent the extra 20 bucks for the 830. The only difference between the two is the &amp;#34;Smart Pivot&amp;#34; system on the 830, and I&#x27;d read mixed reviews as to whether it really mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TEST:&lt;br /&gt;We each used our razors for one week, cleaned them properly with a good blade wash, then traded razors for a second week trial. We did not compare any notes until after going back to our own new shavers. I not only compared the newmodels to each other, but also compared these shaves to those I got with my 7735X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I tried one extra test once we got our original razors back after week two- I took my old 7735 out of retirement for one last shave. Granted, we aren&#x27;t professional testers, but we tried to stay consistent in our testing. We both shaved just as we always did: in the morning before going to work. Both of us shave in the shower. The highly scientific test was for each of us to see how our shaves held up by 10 pm every night. Before anyone gripes, yes I know that Norelco says you need at least 21 days to try out a new razor. Well, here&#x27;s what we found when we compared our observations after two weeks and two days. Your mileage may vary, as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;We both found that the AT830 gave a closer shave. No doubt about that; the pivot system did make a difference, since both models use the same HQ8 shaving heads. To be honest, the difference in closeness was greater for me, but I really do have a tougher beard. But by 10:00 each night, I noticed that I had a scratchier face of stubble using the 810. For me, the extra $20 was worth it. On the other hand, my pal felt that his model was fine for him, and he&#x27;s keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how did my revisit with my old 7735X go after two weeks with the new models? It gave me a longer lasting shave than the 810 did, but not quite as long as the 830. If its battery weren&#x27;t on the way out, I&#x27;d keep that one. However, I really like the fact that, unlike the 7000 series, the new models don&#x27;t require a charging stand. The stand tips over easily and is an extra requirement to haul around when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who didn&#x27;t want to read my lengthy explanation, I totally understand! Anyhow, I found that, with my difficult beard, the AT830 was the way to go. I get a noticeably longer lasting shave than with the 810, and it slightly beats even my trusty old 7735X, which until now,no other razor could do. The 810, however, might be OK for anyone with a beard that&#x27;s not so fussy. Either way, you&#x27;ll get the closest, most comfortable shave in the shower with a good, low-foam shaving gel. I hope this helps someone who really has wanted to know the difference.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my husband and he loves it..as picky as he is about his daily shaving?? i recommend it..</li>
    <li> Top quality electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;Quick charging&lt;br /&gt;May take you time to adjust to especially along neck line&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean with tap water</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my last Norelco. Shocked to find out I purchased my last Norelco from Amazon seven years ago! No wonder the battery is winding down and the blades are not so sharp. This one has better features (wet/dry and better battery) than my last one, and another shocker, cost less than the Norelco I bought from Amazon seven years ago! Just got this, and it seems great. If it lasts three years I will be happy.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Norelco electric razors.  This one may be the best one, yet.  It seems lighter than the predecessor, though the design is similar. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> All aspect of this purchase were excellent.</li>
    <li> I have liked my Norelco and found this brand usually provides good quality. This is no exception. The charge lasts, the shave is close and it&#x27;s easy to use. Easy to clean and is durable.   [April 27th, 2015 -- today, this shaver died. Just stopped. One star off for only lasting 2 1/2 years]</li>
    <li> I am giving it an ok rating because it worked. However, it doesn&#x27;t shave near as good as my razor. I had face rash for 2 weeks and still having issues with patches of hair even after I spend 10 minutes going over and over the same area. I just feel like I wasted my money and time on this item. It was a real let down because I was hoping it would save me some time and still give me a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Very good ,son likes it</li>
    <li> I could not be more pleased.  This razor is fantastic.  Works perfectly after three weeks.  Long battery life and close shave.</li>
    <li> I like the feature of water proof; that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Does not perform  as stated. I would like to return for credit or refund!</li>
    <li> its good, comfert usage. changing lasts for atleast 3 weeks with 3 shaves per week.&lt;br /&gt;i loved this product and love to use similar products going forward.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s first razor, as he is just hitting puberty. He loves it, and it has been easy for him to use.</li>
    <li> The reason I&#x27;am writing this review is because this is a great product and I personally love it.  Wish everyone can have one.</li>
    <li> I find that this razor don&#x27;t give me a close cut like the older razors. I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> Anything would have been an improvement over the archaic model he was using. He seems very happy with it, and looks great.</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  Haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
    <li> I had neck and jaw surgery back in January of 2014, and due to some long term nerve damage and uneven scarring, it has been painful to shave with bladed razor or my Braun electric razor. The Norelco being a rotary razor has less vibration than the Braun, and does not scrape across the face like a bladed razor. Initially I was not sure I would like it because it seem to be much slower in speed than a previous Norelco I had owned, but I put it to my face for the test. VERY PLEASED. My first shave was a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave, no foam or gel (will try that later), and little to no discomfort in the tender areas of my face and neck. Based on that alone - I give this a 5-star rating. I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll lower the rating anytime in the near future, but I may update this posting with comments on my first &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend.  He said it arrived with just enough charge to give it a try &amp; it worked fine.  H had a fair amount of growth to remove &amp; had no problem.</li>
    <li> This product was sent without the charging cord. Why would you do that? I had to order one at my expense. Make sure the cord comes with this item. Why not??? Its useless without the charging cord.</li>
    <li> Product is a good value for the money. Exceeded my  expectations. I would recommend this product for a quick have.</li>
    <li> I have always used electric shavers and this is the best one I have had so far. It cuts very close. It does not take long to shave. I love how it is waterproof and you can clean it each time simply by running it under the faucet.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> This Norelco is great for a smooth shave and easy cleaning. It only requires charging every other week and is very low maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product appears to be meeting the recipient&#x27;s expectations.  So the overall rating for the razor is an A.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> They get lost/stolen.  One I dropped on hard tile.  These are good &amp; worth their bucks.  I&#x27;ve sevareal over the last few decades.</li>
    <li> Not sure that it is truly that much better than the cheapest one.  I had the cheap one and &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to this one when it was on sale.  Fairly disappointed in the difference.</li>
    <li> I has an older model of this razor and when some of the parts started to fail I order an upgrade model and hope that I will last as long of the first one.  I really like how you can clean it by just opening the razor head and running water in to clean it.</li>
    <li> I learned quickly not to let my beard go more than two days.  If I do this razor pulls the hair out or worse does not cut at all.  I have used it wet and dry.  If I shave everyday it gives an ok shave.  No were as good as my manual razor.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and as described. Bought it for my husband for Christmas and he uses it without complaint. When we went on vacation for a week, the charge lasted the whole time with him shaving once a day.</li>
    <li> This works well with either dry or wet shaves. I find that I can get a nice shave while driving in on the freeway, a single charge lasts all week!</li>
    <li> Worst piece of electrical junk I ever bought.  Pitch must have shifted after three uses and the damned thing couldn&#x27;t shave any more.  I urge men NOT to purchase this piece of trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Wilbur</li>
    <li> not that great. its ok for cheap razor but dosn&#x27;t shave that well.takes a long time to shave with.needs shave adjustments.</li>
    <li> i went to a braun series and did not like it as much as i do the norelco shavers so i came to this at810 love it better on my skin less irritation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the AT810 for about eight months now. I had originally planned to buy the Norelco PT730, as I had no interest in the AT810&#x27;s wet shaving capabilities. However, a Black Friday sale made this a better deal, and the one-hour charging time (vs. 8 hours for the 730) made this one worth the slight differences in sale price. And I liked the blue color better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an electric shaver because chronic pain was affecting my manual dexterity, and conventional shaving was becoming difficult. While this shaver isn&#x27;t really any easier in that regard, it does cut the total shaving time in half (about 3 minutes vs. 6 minutes) so it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does an adequate job, but I can&#x27;t say it shaves really close. My face looks OK when finished, but feels (not looks, just feels) like I need to shave again after just a few hours. It works well on my cheeks and neck, especially in that awkward place below the hinge of my jaw. However, it takes quite a few passes from various angles to get the curves of my chin smooth. It also seems to struggle more with grey hairs than with brown ones. I think the grey ones are softer and don&#x27;t poke into the holes as easily. My first instinct to deal with this was to press harder, but I found that lifting the heads away from my skin and barely touching my face enables the shaver to get the grey hairs more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I really have no need for wet shaving capabilities, I did try it in the shower once. It required some soap to lubricate my wet face, and the results were no better than dry shaving. Wet shaving with an electric shaver really seems pointless to me. After all, once you&#x27;ve taken the time to lather up, you really might as well use a manual razor which by that point is faster anyway, and shaves closer, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is handy, and works pretty well to thin my mustache, but the blades are so tiny they don&#x27;t do so well with making a clean lower edge. My Wahl hair trimmer does a better job. Conveniently, however, the pop-up trimmer can deal fairly effectively with most of the longer face hairs that the shaver misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver&#x27;s construction is solid enough, and after eight months still feels durable. Clean-up is easy with a quick rinse, but Norelco recommends using hot water which negates any energy savings otherwise gained by shaving with an electric razor. Sometimes I just use cold water if I forget to run the hot water. After about six months the shaver&#x27;s performance was declining a bit. It just wasn&#x27;t cutting quite as close. I wondered if the rinsing was depositing minerals from our tap water on the blades. I think my theory was correct, because I started spraying the inside of the heads with a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water to dissolve minerals, and after a few days the shaver started shaving closer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I give the shaver 3 stars for overall shaving results (i.e. it&#x27;s adequate), and 5 stars for quality construction and ease of use.</li>
    <li> I have a ten year old Norelco shaver that still does an excellent job shaving, but the battery was loosing efficiency. The AT810 does a good job, but not as efficiently as the old one. It seems to shave better when a shaving gel is used.</li>
    <li> I rarely take time to write a review on any item, but this electric shaver is so good I wanted to share my experience. I formerly shaved with a dry electric several times a week  and a straight razor several times when I wanted to get a closer shave.  I tried several brands of electric shaver with various experiences but none shaved better than my straight razor, until I bought the Phillips Norelco AT810. I was going to buy new heads for my old electric but was attracted to the 45 days free return offer from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the new electric three different ways: 1. dry shave using Mennon&#x27;s pre-shave and the results were as good as my straight razor with a little bit of skin burn;  2. I wet my face and the razor with just water and the shave was great with no burn and as good as my straight razor. 3. I wet my face and applied a small amount of shaving cream and the shave was spectacular and better than my straight razor.  I have now employed the shaving cream and a little water method for the last three weeks and the shaves are great every day! The Norelco AT810 cleans very easily and the 1hr charge lasts the entire week.  This razor actually gets the beard hairs under my nose that my previous electrics could never get and I had trouble cutting with my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;  I suggest you try this razor if you&#x27;re looking for a really close shave with no skin burn. It comes with a 45 day free return guarantee so you can&#x27;t lose if you don&#x27;t like it.  I am near the end of the 45 day period but I doubt if I will send this back.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco AT810 for a friend as a gift. He called me in three months to let me know it stopped working.</li>
    <li> great razor, husband likes it</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new razor!!!</li>
    <li> It worked great and the end result was getting a razor close shave. No nicks, no cuts. Like it. It is a nice product to have.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this shaver in my hand. The battery in my previous one burnt out from overcharging - a regrettable drawback.</li>
    <li> better than expected, can be used in teh shower and takes water to clean it out - gives very goo shaves also.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend said it takes some getting used to.  Not the best first experience. Not sure if it was him or the razor.</li>
    <li> seems to work great for me</li>
    <li> For $60 or so not a bad replacement for my dearly loved 25 year old cordless Norelco. It weighs a lot less and I do like the wet shave option. It&#x27;s held up perfectly for the 4 months I&#x27;ve used it, extremely easy to clean (in the shower) and holds a charge for at least a week (maybe longer but I charge it once a week anyway). I have zero complaints except that I&#x27;ve had to get used to the fact it&#x27;s not going to shave as close as my old Norelco or a blade....pretty near close but, you will definitely need a touch up if going out in the evening. Face it, they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to but, for the $ I spent I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap. It doesn&#x27;t irritate.&lt;br /&gt;In my case to get a closer shave I have to use gel or foam and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to clean, the battery has good performance, but there&#x27;s no way to replace it.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned. Runs forever and close shave ever time. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and battery last a long time before require a recharge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these shavers for 40 years so no surprise here. works great as usual.</li>
    <li> I returned it. It&#x27;s a quality product, charges fast and runs quietly, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I used a Norelco 2-head rotary for a long time decades ago and was fine with it. For the last 10 years, I used a Braun rechargeable foil shaver. The Braun&#x27;s battery is still going strong but it costs nearly as much as a new razor to replace the blades and foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one took more work and did not shave closer than my old Braun, which was disappointing since it took me a while to decide on this best seller. I&#x27;ve been shaving dry for decades, so I followed its dry shaving directions: washed my face, waited 15 minutes and shaved in a circular motion. It would not shave closely unless I really stretched my skin and pressed the shaver in. That burned my skin after a couple passes. I did give it almost 3 weeks, again per directions. I also found the triple head hard to maneuver above the lips and under the chin. I have coarse, thick strands of hair and it could be that most of the gaps in the rotary foils were too narrow to let the hair through for cutting. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t designed for my type of hair. I&#x27;m shopping for a foil shaver.</li>
    <li> The electric razor did not shave evenly or closely. Directions said to use 3 weeks to get use to it. After that time it did not cut close enough.</li>
    <li> After 6 months of usage we found it went from OK to not shaving very well.  Really isn&#x27;t a useful razor.</li>
    <li> wonderful &#x3D; does a great job</li>
    <li> My husband has wiry, coarse and wavy facial hair and because of this frequently has issues with razor burn or ingrown hairs.  We bought him this to give his face a break from a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo which he has owned for years and try to save some on its expensive razor refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Reasonably priced, rechargeable with long battery life, easy to clean, reduces razor burn, long lasting blades, can be used wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Much slower than razor(needs many more passes), not a close shave even after warm shower and shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts: OK for lack of nicks and reducing razor burn. If these are not an issue for you then buy something else.</li>
    <li> second one for me. works well and versatile.</li>
    <li> My teen son uses this razor and loves it. It helps protect his sensitive and acne prone skin from further damage caused by shaving with traditional razor.</li>
    <li> It gives me a good close shave with minimal irritation, and is easy to keep clean. It does the job.</li>
    <li> To put it simply, this doesn&#x27;t work...Wet, dry, with grain, circular motions, slight pressure it just doesn&#x27;t work at all. I can honestly say I&#x27;ve given this product the benefit of the doubt that I could be doing something wrong but after weeks of trying to get it to work I have given up and am going to start the return procces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how this item has such positive reviews because I have literally gotten NO results @any one who rated this product at 5 stars post a video of you using it because I&#x27;m convinced this model is bunk.</li>
    <li> A great replacement for my old Norelco shaver. Good shave, relatively quiet, easy to clean. For me, the battery lasts more than a week on a single charge so I don&#x27;t have to take the charger on business trips. I wish the charger cord was coiled like my last one, but that&#x27;s a minor annoyance.</li>
    <li> I think I damaged one cutter while cleaning the cutters.  I called Norelco. And the wouldn&#x27;t sell me one cutter.  They would only sell me a set of three.  This does not seem right to me.  In a case like this you should be able to get one replacement cutter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had  this shaver now for about six weeks and am quite pleased with it. I don&#x27;t use the wet shave option, but bought the model for the quick recharge. This has worked well. The first charge lasted me almost three weeks, when they advertise about two. The shave has been comfortable and easy. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing 9 months ago, and it&#x27;s still running on its first charge. Granted, I only use it once every week or two, but it&#x27;s still really impressive for a single charge to last this long.</li>
    <li> Works well wet or dry. Not sure about when to change blades, but so far no problems.</li>
    <li> Sure it does the job, ONCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you have to charge it back up again.  I bought this figuring that I could keep it in my office, or my vehicle, and bring it in once in a while to charge.  On the contrary, it has to be charged after EVERY USE.  It was very expensive for a one time good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had it to do over, I would not have purchased a Norelco.  Future reference, the next one most certainly will not be a Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;Ok now that I have used it longer, I found that the battery does last a bit longer than I thought, but it just runs really slow, it sounds like it is going to die at any moment, but it seems to keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gets no where near as close a shave as does a simple disposable blade, but it saves me some time in the mornings so I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, they ask you use it for at least 21 days, which it has been well over that now.  Still a nice razor with very poor capabilities.  It looks nice, but in this case looks really do not count for much.  I guess I could up my answer to two stars, but not more.</li>
    <li> This device is working great</li>
    <li> Nice idea to be able to use in the shower but in reality, it shaves better dry.  I use it to shave my head.  Plus, I believe my old Norelco cut long hairs better.  All and all I like Norelco shavers</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  The motor seems very slow and it takes longer to shave, yet with poorer results.  I&#x27;m planning to return it and request a replacement.  Previous Norelco razors have worked fine.</li>
    <li> It is the best Razor I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Norelco electric razors and this unit works great.&lt;br /&gt;Only one negative - this is the only Norelco razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased that didn&#x27;t include a zippered pouch to hold it. Without a case/pouch to hold the razor, the plastic cover over the cutter heads constantly falls off in my computer bag or suitcase during travel.</li>
    <li> it runs well, and is good for daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning is also convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The power can last several weeks.</li>
    <li> This razor replaced a previous Norelco unit that was simply worn out after 8 or 9 years of usage.  It shaves as well as any electric razor that I have owned, it charges relatively quickly, and it gives me more than two weeks worth of shaves on a charge.  While it does not have the pivoting head assembly of the more expensive Norelco models, my wrist/hand move the razor in a smooth gliding action just fine without the additional cost and complexity of the more expensive models.  As to no travel case, I am using the case from a previous unit.</li>
    <li> It shaves me cleanly in the dry mode.  It exceeds my expectations.  I was referred to this model by a friend who uses it, and I am well satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  It&#x27;s easy to use when on the road.</li>
    <li> Love it. could not be better.</li>
    <li> Every few years I wear one of these out and come right back for another one.  They are hardcore.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! you get a super close shave when used with shaving gel, a close shave in the shower (although hard to shave in the shower), and a nice looking dry shave. Remember to change the blades to continue get great results over time.</li>
    <li> I have had my share of electric razor and I always end up going back to disposable razors.  Reason being, electric razor never shave close, the break out your face, cause more razor bumps and the dreaded aftershave lotion that burns like fire after you shave.  The Philips Norelco Aquatec is so cool.  You can still use your everyday shaving cream which helps gives you a smoother and bump-less shave. You will love this razor.  I use the Aquatec like a disposable razor I run hot water over it to clean as I shave.  And the beauty of it all, the Norelco razors are good for one year.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest electric in the world but for the price and the fact that it is waterproof I would say that it is pretty good!</li>
    <li> The cord does not securely snap into the end of the razor for rechanging.  I leave the razon on it&#x27;s side when recharging so that it does not fall out.  My Dad&#x27;s face was a lot smoother when he used a razor &amp; cream, than with this.</li>
    <li> its not as good as reviews</li>
    <li> Work great and best price.</li>
    <li> So my husband had to tighten a few things before use. And the blades that came with it are not exactly perfect. Once we bought a new set of blades for it it worked great. Love that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> The charge is great, it does not leave razor burn...however, it&#x27;s sole purpose is to cut and does not do that well. I have tried several times with different lengths of growth, but it leaves a significant amount of stubble. My old razor wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, but the cut was good enough that I could go 4 days without having to shave again, with this one I need to shave everyday.</li>
    <li> For years I used more expensive electric razors from Philips, most recently the Cool Skin from several years ago. When the battery died (they can never be replaced for some reason) I thought I&#x27;d go for a lesser model. And frankly, with my heavy beard, this model gives me a better shave DRY than the Cool Skin ever did with all those expensive lotion cartridges (which skyrocketed in price). So for $60 bucks less the $5 coupon I had, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this shaver. The battery life is splendid, and cleaning this baby is just as easy as holding it under the water faucet for a minute or so. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color me tickled.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco Powertouch. Gives me a nice, close, clean shave and no heat rash. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful Father&#x27;s Day gift. It gives a great close shave. It is quite comfortable to use, and easy to keep clean. The trimmer is also useful for quick touchups.</li>
    <li> The razor rips hairs out of my face. The few that it even cuts. It is absolutely horrible. It&#x27;s as if someone bought it and took out the blades to replace blades in the same model they owned and then returned this. I can&#x27;t afford new blades so I am stuck. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I use this razor in the shower for a really smooth and luxurious shave. It cleans up easily with some household cleaner and an artist&#x27;s brush. Seven days without recharging. Glad I got it</li>
    <li> The Aquatec Razor gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Dad is happy with this one.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec is my second Norelco purchase but my forth in use.  It performs well: shave is close but not so much as to encourage in-grown hairs, the run time appears as stated in the literature (50 minutes so I get about two weeks so far), handle is comfortable enough, trimmers work fine and washing the head out is much better than the old days of dry brush.  Hair removal under the jaw line takes some effort but has with foil razors too.  Haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving with it yet.  One bell/whistle I would have liked to have: a small case to protect it in the travel kit in-lieu of the plastic head protector.  But that is minor.  On cleanup: it does take some time for the water to drain out of it...all the more reason to brush and floss before stowing the razor away.  All in all - a great value.</li>
    <li> it is a good razor. it is washable. i also have a old one, but the old one always hurts my face. it is good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for many years, but this one was is a disappointment. Out of the box it shaved about as good as my previous Norelco shaver and it&#x27;s 7 year old shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: water resistant (can clean under running water), a full charge lasts several weeks (of course this will diminish over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Results are not as good as previous two Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> It does not provide a clean shave... leaves hair here and there... not good.</li>
    <li> My husband agrees, it is OK</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, but he loved it</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s a tribute to Norelco that their old shavers are just as good as the new; their rotary heads are &#x27;way above those of other brands.  Shave close, quick.  The bonus with this model is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet; you can flush it out and clean it well.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to some of the other reviews. This razor does not shave very efficiently. I still looked like I had a 5 &#x27;0 clock shadow after 30 minutes of trying to shave with this thing. I can use my regular razor and I get a closer shave in less time with less irritation. I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Works well and easy to clean. PG</li>
    <li> Norelco always puts out a good shaver, but this one doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old razors. Has different heads than normal. I pull out my old razor when I need a cleaner shave. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Super long battery life.</li>
    <li> This razor does not shave any hair at all, it simply pulls it off my face uncomfortably, stay away and save your 60$!</li>
    <li> Charge holds for a very long time and stays effective the entire time.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for 25 years, and I have really liked the 4-5 I have had over that time period, and I never really had to go to the high end Norelcos to get a good shave.  I tried this one, and I don&#x27;t know if the one I received was defective or not, but it was useless.  It felt very underpowered and I would roll over the same spot forever and it would not cut all the whiskers.  I would end up cleaning up the shave with a real razor after using this, which defeats the point.  I ended up returning the product.</li>
    <li> I had used an older version of the Philips Norelco for over ten years and finally decided to update the razor since it wasn&#x27;t holding the charge for as long and two changes of replacement heads will buy you a new razor ( go figure). This is a much improved razor. It&#x27;s lighter (I travel a lot), holds a charge longer and cuts very closely. I haven&#x27;t used the wet shave option.</li>
    <li> Delivery, description and price are all good. Product is not the cream of the crop, but it is a solid razor.</li>
    <li> This does what I expected it to do.  I wasn&#x27;t expected a close shave, but I was just hoping for something that would be convenient and &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; for a few times a week.  It takes me 3-4 days to get the &amp;#34;five-o&#x27;clock&amp;#34; shadow, but this leaves me with just a little stubble.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it&#x27;s still not as good as my old Norelco that finally quit after 13 years. Works best in the shower with soap (ivory). I get a little razor burn when used dry. The price was right though.</li>
    <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> It works very well as a replacement for my years-old Norelco. Seems to hold a charge well. Fits my hand comfortably.</li>
    <li> I went through a ton of reviews just to see what I would really need and this really fit the bill. It&#x27;s simple, waterproof and cuts really close. The battery life on this is amazing and I have only charged it once in my 2 months of usage. The flexible head also saves me tons of time from going back and up just to get that one annoying hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would really recommend this if you are a morning-rush person as I bring this to the shower and have a 5min shave inside.</li>
    <li> this model which is identical to the one I purchased 5 years ago is not as good.the new reduced speed does not shave as good.i realize that my coments will be dismissed.i am one disapoinated customer.this will be my last purchase from Norelco.</li>
    <li> Very close shave.  I&#x27;ve owned a couple of similar Norelco razors in the past.  I&#x27;m glad to have one with Li-ion battery.</li>
    <li> An electric shaver is a very personal article and reviews are of limited help. What works on an others face may not work for you. Therefore, if possible, buy from a store with a liberal returns policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do want to state something about the build quality of these Philips Aquatouch series shavers. The first one I bought died in 3 months and the second, in just over 2 years. I guess they are the electric equivalent of disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Very convenient.  Holds a battery charge for at least a week.  Easy to hold and use.  Seems to do better with water; haven&#x27;t tried with lotion/cream.  Only (minor) complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade so I have to shave daily, rather than every other day.  Hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> This was for my 17 year old son that needed a new razor and this one was just the right one for him, he now look clean shaven.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he went on coumadin and would bleed too long after little nicks from shaving. This gives him a great, very smooth shave. He uses it dry and in the shower (I bought him a non-fogging mirror for the shower), and is so very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my father. He likes it and it looks great. Highly recommended and the price is fair.</li>
    <li> Switched back to a Norelco after trying a couple of other brands.  Glad I made the switch back ... performs exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> I had a Phillips looking pretty much like this one in the olden days. It was better than anything I had had but it never quite got all of my beard and I took to growing a full one.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 11 years and I started shaving again, first with blades, which is not very convenient when you need to shave twice a day to look neat, then with this Norelco which I selected after careful market analysis.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best electric razor I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it for dry shaving, although I tried under the shower occasionally. It does get the skin pretty smooth although never quite as perfect as when shaving with a blade. Anyway this is the kind of short-lived perfection that regularly reminds me why I grew a beard in the first place - the good thing with this razor is that I can take it to the office and shave at my desk when I am alone - Even shaving twice a day it lasts nearly a week on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret this purchase at all. This is a great razor.</li>
    <li> I consider that its a good product I like it, and I would like to recomend this product to other persons</li>
    <li> I tried to find a razor comparable to the Norelco that my husband has. Instead, I chose one that exceeds my expectations! This one is far better than the old one. My husband could not be more pleased!!</li>
    <li> First off this is my first electric razor. I was a bit skeptical at first because of the reviews, but I must say I am very happy with this razor. I have had it for a few months now and it is still working just like I pulled it out of the box. I will say that if you haven&#x27;t used an electric razor before it does take about a month or so for your skin to get used to it. I recommend still using a little bit of shaving cream at least for the first month, while your skin adjusts. Other then that I love this razor. I even use it sometimes in the shower and it works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Love the convenience of being able to shave my head/face in the shower! Great investment! I usually go back over my head/face with a regular razor afterwards but that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m a bit OCD about it lol.</li>
    <li> Until I bought my boyfriend this Electric Razor he had only used a traditional razor. He loves the flexibility this razor offers. Such as you can either shave with or without shaving cream and even in the shower! Charge lasts a very long time and is easy to use!</li>
    <li> Really only worms when your hair is very short... any bit of length and you have to use clippers to shorten end then use these for a closer cut...</li>
    <li> Excellent razor for the price.  Trimmer works great, quiet.  Still working just fine after many months.</li>
    <li> This shaver is fantastic! Shaves very clean. Very efficient and fast too. It&#x27;s a good buy for me.</li>
    <li> Takes 10 minutes to shave face and neck after 3 days growth, and I have a tough thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great ergonomic design.&lt;br /&gt;Charges in an hour and puts out about 3 shaves on one charge.</li>
    <li> My thirty year old shaver shaves much better than this thing. Would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> If you are some one that has to shave everyday, this is not for you.  I tried it and everytime i ended up shaving again with a razor.  Sorry, but it just did not work for me</li>
    <li> Very nice for this price</li>
    <li> Cheap, efficient and skin&#x27;s protection.</li>
    <li> After six months of using this Norelco I still love it.&lt;br /&gt; The easy wash feature is a huge plus from my llast Norelco.</li>
    <li> Charge time is great it stays charged for about a month using it 1-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My huspand Used it for 2 charge cycles (2 months) where the only problem he had was that it only works for stuble and doesn&#x27;t cut very close. The third time he charged it ...it charged fine and shows that its fully charged but it won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;return window is only 30 days so I&#x27;m out of luck on getting a replacement or getting my money back. I didn&#x27;t pay this kind of money to have it die after 3 months. I expected to get several years of use out of this. I&#x27;ll have to think hard about getting a Norelco in the future.</li>
    <li> It does everything its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> One of the heads stopped functioning after about 6 months of use. It just doesn&#x27;t rotate anymore. I always buy the Phillips and maybe this was just a fluke, but I&#x27;ll be buying a different model this time just to be safe.</li>
    <li> Close shave, as a female it works great for facial hair and legs. :)</li>
    <li> It is good, but my husband skin is sensitive. So I recomand to try an electric razor before buying one.</li>
    <li> The rpm seems much  slower than my previous Norelcos.  Fully charged it sounds like it is about to loose power, and it takes longer to shave but it is a close shave.</li>
    <li> is my first electric razor, for mi is OK, the noise is too low so is very good and perfect because y can use it wet in the shower</li>
    <li> It gives a close shave and cleans easily. the trimmer is great for trimming your mustache and side burns. It&#x27;s a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It is exatling what we wanted. We already had an old Phillips and we liked It was a good idea to buy a new one</li>
    <li> It works, as supposed. Not really clean shave, but better than my previous Philips model. Glad that they improve :)</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he really liked it and price was also reasonable what i liked the most that it could be washed fully</li>
    <li> I  have used  Norelco razors for years . I replaced my old one when it died with this one.  It works very well ,very happy with this model. I always get clean smooth shaves.</li>
    <li> Have used other electric shavers in the past, this one is a big improvement, with a close shave and the convenience of cleaning the shave heads with water.</li>
    <li> Great shaver charged once 5 wks ago and still going  easy to clean plenty space to collect wiskers and shave powder</li>
    <li> Great buy, works great, love the little popout at the back for trimming hair.  They want more words.  Okay: Great buy, works great, love the little popout at the back for trimming hair</li>
    <li> This is a good use of the razor, the only regret is that I bought when 39.99 $, after more than a month when the the event minimum 29 $ but that just did not encounter the lowest Bale, it is generally higher45 $.</li>
    <li> normally Norelco does a terrible job, have been using Remington&#x27;s for the longest time.  decided to try this one due to its reviews.  was glad that I did, first time, a norelco beat out remington for me.</li>
    <li> Working good&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use the razor especially in morning hour&lt;br /&gt;So far 1 month has gone with well, will see</li>
    <li> I expected the usual face shredder, burn, all the usual stuff. You can use this razor without any skin preparation, dry, wet or with either jel or foam. It works. It&#x27;s waterproof. An excellent product and a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I like the quality and the design.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good! After charge it can be used for a long time!</li>
    <li> I bought the AT811 (the red Target version of the 810) last year for my son and so far its performance has been great.  Unlike my own older Norelco, however it does NOT come with a travel pouch, which is almost a necessity when you travel or it&#x27;s likely to pop open and get broken or make a mess ( if you haven&#x27;t cleaned it out).  It holds a charge well and does a good job of shaving unless you&#x27;ve got more thisn 2-3 days worth of beard, in which case it will pull out more hair than it cuts.  The sideburn trimmer is much better than the one on my older model, but it doesn&#x27;t have progressive battery indicator lights--just a single light which turns from green to flashing red when you&#x27;ve got a shave or two worth of energy left, which means you get little warning before it dies. A big step backwards in my opinion since you pretty much have to take the charger on trips unless you completely recharge before you leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other Norelcos (and maybe this is true of rotary razors in general) this model doesn&#x27;t give you a really close shave--you have to keep going over the same area again and again if you want to feel just skin and no stubble, and there is no adjustable head feature. My son uses the water-wash feature but it has rusted some of the steel parts inside, so I recommend using the little brush and a compressed air can (for cleaning computers) to blow out the heads, and washing it only occasionally (and then blowing out the water so it doesn&#x27;t rust).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good shaver.  I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it delivers, especially without a travel pouch and progressive battery lights.  But it works well.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco cordless shaver of the triple head design for over 15 years and really liked and enjoyed that razor. However I can&#x27;t express how disappointed I am with this electric razor. If you have more than 1 days stubble this razor is almost useless. The speed at which the blades turn is slow and anemic. It will not operate as a corded razor like the previous Norelco that I loved. This is one product where I feel like I was mislead by the reviews on Amazon. I would not recommend or purchase this razor, try another model or another brand.  I feel like I wasted my money on this product!</li>
    <li> Good product with quality..</li>
    <li> Bought this one to replace my ten year old version of the same razor that served me well.  Lightweight, long battery life and a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> A fine shaver at a good price.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer provides no information about how to replace the heads.  So it&#x27;s not all that great a price, since you&#x27;ll need a new one after a year or so.</li>
    <li> I have the 7000 series of this shaver and just love the shave. I&#x27;ve stepped down to this model to save almost $50.00. Tired of Norelco raising the price of there newer model shavers and expecting the public to keep falling for the hype / adds they run just so you will spend more money.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does every thing the new ones do and more regarding the floating heads, so save 50% or more compared to the newer models&lt;br /&gt;and get a completely new shaver that works just fine. Just make sure to use a lubricating shave gel / foam for the closest shave you will ever get.</li>
    <li> Buy again although the price increase. My father love it~</li>
    <li> Never want to go back to a normal razor.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift to my dad. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Just got it. Used it three times. Shaves pretty close, dry, without irritation. We&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Good value for money .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good things like the price and performance .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low price good performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure would buy one as a gift .</li>
    <li> Works good, my hubby was happy. I would buy this again. Makes a good gift for any guy in the family :)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s make my chin soft . and the amazing thing that you will no&#x27;t find hair fall on the ground . or on your suit . I loved this machine .</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my dad and he loves it. He said it does a very good job. He also told me he would buy it again. The charge also holds a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a rotary razor so its is important to remember it is more suited to longer hair and less for daily use. Having said that it works fine for everyday shaving, although maybe not as well as a foil shaver in the same category would. I have sensitive skin and this product does a great job of not irritating my skin. When using in conjunction with a shaving cream, it works even better, giving a closer, even less irritated cut. The pop up trimmer is actually very nice for detailing like for the back of your neck or sideburns. This is a solid rotary razor.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco Wet/Dry previously and used it until it literally fell apart. I like the ability to use this with my shaving gel and got this as a supplement for my Gillette Fusion Power razor, whose blades tends to get a bit expensive. This charged fairly quickly and shaves fairly close, tho not as close as going against the grain with my Gillette. So far it&#x27;s been a positive purchase.</li>
    <li> The razor did a good job shaving but quit working two weeks after we got it and need a new one or money back</li>
    <li> I just replaced my previous Norelco razor with this one. It&#x27;s pretty much like every other Norelco I&#x27;ve owned and the previous one lasted about three years. I&#x27;ve had some Norelco razors last for 5-6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is one step down from the previous one I had. The only difference was that the older one had an additional swivel action for the head. I can&#x27;t notice a difference. Get this one and save $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always felt that the charging system is more important than the razor itself. This one goes for a couple of weeks without a charge (It is new!) And it takes only about an hour to charge.</li>
    <li> my husband loves the razor, easy of use and nice clean shave with or without water ; on off switch was so easy, he has problems with his fingers</li>
    <li> all came to my entire satisfaction, I can recommend widely to make their purchases hereby, all my products came to my entire satisfaction</li>
    <li> I have used this manufactures products for 50 years.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Good value for this product.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.first got wrong product.Amazon straightened this out.&lt;br /&gt;Good razor.</li>
    <li> I got this because I travel a lot and this razor is great it&#x27;s waterproof and can work with any type of shaving cream or gel. Great if you don&#x27;t feel like shaving and you just want to do a quick shave.</li>
    <li> I miss the old solid quieter razors made in Holland ,although the lithium battery out lasts the NiCad&#x27;s . Made in China.</li>
    <li> Given the price and quality of shaver I got I&#x27;m very pleased with the Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec. So far I&#x27;ve not had any issues. Make sure you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor and not an electric beard trimmer. While this does have a beard trimmer that pops up on the back there are no settings for how long or short it will trim. If you only need to trim the beard down to the skin so you can use the razor the trimmer works great and the razor finishes the job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good purchase so far, I&#x27;ll update time passes and any issues present themselves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and required to shave everyday. this thing is a savior, I haven&#x27;t had issues with breakouts or tugging since I started using this. my hair isn&#x27;t very fast-growing, so I only use it in the morning, and it lasts the day. I can get a fairly close shave with it, if I work at it for a few minutes I can get close enough that you can only feel stubble when rubbing against the grain. definitely recommended for someone who has to shave everyday. i can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s paid for itself in blades, but i has paid itself off in [lack of] pain. it no longer hurts to shave.</li>
    <li> I have never found an electric razor that truly does a good job; they&#x27;re all the same.  Bought this one to replace another and it only does a mediocre job but still leaves you needing a shave with a razor, this is only good for quick shaves where appearance isn&#x27;t a priority.</li>
    <li> I shave about every 4th day. I have found that this shaver works great on both the face and neck. It does take some time to get used to because the feeling of the shaver is new to your skin. But now I find it comfortable to shave. The neck portion even though it doesn&#x27;t get all the jobs, it does the get the job done well. I would recommend this shaver to everyone. Plus to do dry shave.</li>
    <li> I have owned several electric razors over the years but this one is by far the best yet, I love the fact that it can be used with or without shaving cream or gel. After charging it for one hour is was ready to use and I did with shaving cream and I have to say the best electric shave ever, no irritation just a smooth shave. I highly recommend this razor or one like it from Norelco. Good job people.</li>
    <li> I use in the shower to shave areas that I would always nick with a safety razor.  This razor does a great job and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> After a year of use, it won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there may be issues with the power switch - there are reports about it on the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few days, I have been getting odd behavior with the power switch: it would take several presses to turn on. Then, it wouldn&#x27;t turn off unless I plug it in. Then, after I unplug it, it would spontaneously turn on several minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try a different brand. Maybe Philips has issues with their on/off switch on some units.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. Excellent product for a fair price. You get a lot for your money. No need to spend more.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he loves it. He gets a smooth shave (wet and dry), and the razor is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t shave as close as I expected or wanted,</li>
    <li> So far it is working perfectly. I have only had to charge it one time, since the first charge, in the three weeks I have used it. It is easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen daily improvement in comfort and closeness as I have converted from another brand of electric razor.  Hope the improvement continues.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver because my previous one was a Philips Norelco of the same design pretty much and that bad boy lasted me 12 years! before giving out on me. It didn&#x27;t give the closest shave but cut nicely enough and fast which was good for cleaning up before work. My face has had some getting used to this model and it doesn&#x27;t give quite as solid a shave but it has a much better battery life and charges quickly which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in years! However, those who remember when Norelco shavers were made in Holland will be disappointed in the quality of the plastics but the shaving heads still appear to be first quality.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it for dry shaving but I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it re-charges very quickly and it&#x27;s easy to wash out the head after use.&lt;br /&gt;A good product!</li>
    <li> This little sucker is top rated for a reason.  I gave it to my brother for Christmas and he has only had wonderful things to say about it.  Used it myself as well and I can honestly say it was a pleasurable experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. First it arrived late in a cheap box with nothing but a very small plastic brush. It shows on the box that you can use it wet or dry. The first time he used it dry he got small pimples all over his neck and face. The second time he used it wet he got a huge rash on his face. He opened it to clean it out and all the pieces fell out. This is a horrible product and not worth the money I spent. I am so disappointed in this product. I wish I was able to return it and get my money back. I have now learned my lesson on buying these items online. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Very cheap product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and easily used! Price is also good.&lt;br /&gt;It really meets my expectations. It is indeed a good product.</li>
    <li> Handles well and is a sometimes replacement for my regular blade razor. Like the trimmers too. First one i ever purchased.</li>
    <li> My brother loved it. Gives him a closer shave and no more cuts. Best gift he received from me in 40 years.</li>
    <li> I charged this for nearly two days before using.  Upon powering it up the motor and blades barely spin.  I use it to shave my head.  After nearly 20 minutes there was very little hair cut.  I had to use another razor to finish up.  Don&#x27;t know if issue related to a weak motor or dull blades.  Returned and purchased a more expensive model hoping a higher cost will bring a higher performance.</li>
    <li> Shaver works well, and was properly priced.</li>
    <li> If you need to replace the  heads and you can not afford the $200 model this is a great replacement.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my father. He enjoyed it. Will buy for myself. Very smooth shavings.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 18 year old son. this is his first electric razor. He really likes it. He prefers not to use it to dry shave though. I guess you can use it wet or dry shave.  Seems as though it does a nice job. Good price.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it - says its the best shaver he&#x27;s had.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy looking shaver too.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, very happy with it</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor primarily to use in the shower to shave my legs and underarms. If you are a woman, you will want to consider that this razor burns sensitive skin. I have tried to use this under my arms twice, but I ended up with red razor burns that ran along the edge of the razor&#x27;s path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In talking to customer service, I was told that this razor is designed for the face only, and they had no advice about how to use it under the arms. For use on legs, the razor is fine. But bear in mind that if you have soft skin, even with the use of a lubricating shave cream, this will likely burn the skin.</li>
    <li> Its what I was looking for. Arrived quick&lt;br /&gt;Simple yet gets the job done. I&#x27;d purchase again, it was worth it</li>
    <li> Nice razor, I like it.</li>
    <li> Got this razor last Christmas (2012) and used it for all of 2013. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a conventional razor, but I always had to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; a few spots when I wanted a really good shave. The bad news is that it stopped working a couple of weeks ago. It&#x27;s fully charged, but does nothing when I press the power switch. And I had just bought new replacement heads. :(</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. I have been buying the Norelco&#x27;s for perhaps 20 years and this one seems to have a relatively weak motor and doesn&#x27;t cut  fast and doesn&#x27;t cut close.  It works about like my ten year old that Is pretty worn.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for more than 40 years. I have always liked the shave and comfort I have gotten with these shavers. The AT810 is very easy to use and clean. Just run the heads and the top of the shaver under hot water and it comes out clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Norelco Shavers, however the quality has steadily eroded; they must have awakened because it seem as though they are getting better, but not as good as they were years ago.</li>
    <li> Lovely, silent, effective, comfortable.</li>
    <li> 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;If you have a very flat face with very sharp features, and straight facial hair, this razor will probably get the job done. My face has none of those features. I have curly hair, lots of bumps, and in the words of a talent agent I know, &#x27;not the most pronounced jaw line hes ever seen.&#x27; As such, it took a lot of passes to get the a close shave, resulting in a bit of irritation. Unlike Norelco&#x27;s more expensive models, this razor doesnt have the contouring/tilting/pivoting of the head to really stick to your face. As such it takes, not only a lot of passes, requires me to hold the razor at odd angles towards my face to get the trimmer over my face. Its not bad compared to some ov the various razors ive used over the use, but there are better out there for a few bucks more. At half the cost it would be 5+ stars, but knowing I can get a razor that worked much better for me for a few bucks more makes it hard to recommend. Also for whatever reasonm mine seems to get very hot warm on the blade covers if I dont periodically wet it while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it works better than some of the more expensive norelcos of yester year, works wet or dry, (your milage will vary with shaving cream as it seems to clog it up--but i recomend running it under the tap periodically if you have sensative skin) and holds a charge for about a week of daily use. Its dead simple to use and has a robust trimmer that works well for those hard to hit nose spots or as a first pass if its been a while since you shaved.</li>
    <li> I have to press this thing against my face so firm and go over spots several times...I usually end up using a razor to clean up stray hairs.</li>
    <li> I like this electric shaver.  It&#x27;s easy to clean under running water and works great with edge shaving cream.  I was surprised  using them in combo.</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> This machine is very good</li>
    <li> This razor was a very good purchase.  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> When I have the patience, the result is similar to the blade.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift.  The product was exactly what I thought I&#x27;d be getting and he loves it.  He uses it everyday and he hasn&#x27;t even needed to replace the blade yet (almost 6 months later).  He says it might be close, but hasn&#x27;t given in yet.</li>
    <li> This new razor is shaving like it has dull/old blades on the first use. It is not at all what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> it does everything promised.  Great price. Aquatic feature saves a lot of clean up work.  Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Locally found it to be almost twice the cost. Smooth shaves, wet or dry. Really a great unit. Arrived on time and properly packed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day! He LOVES it. Poor guy has been dealing with an old electric razor that kept pulling hairs. The ability to use it in the shower has made his morning routine faster. I got a mirror and shaving cream to go with it. His face is a lot smoother after using it! Look out for when Amazon has coupons for this brand and you will save even more!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. Not exactly sure why but a 69 YO male has had a lot of experience in shaving his chin and if he says he loves it he means it.</li>
    <li> Now have 2 of these - 1 for travel and one for home. No complaints at all. Good razor for the money!</li>
    <li> Good cutting razor. It states wet / dry razor. I need to,at minimum, use water on your face to cut. Works real good with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a Norelco 1150/40 that I purchased in March of 2013. This product charges quickly, provides a close shave and cleans very easily.  I started shaving when I was a teen.Thus, I have used a Norelco product for about 50 years. Buy this one; it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> very good for on the go quick saving or every other day saving, I love it.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Clean, close shove. Such a plus to be able to use it in the shower. The option to use shaving cream is also a big plus.</li>
    <li> Shaves like new, oh it is new.  Excellent razor.</li>
    <li> The razor is great.  Nice weight.</li>
    <li> I have never had an electric shaver that I liked more than this one. Highly recommended! Beats the hell outta my old Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Seems a little slow to shave with, but it works</li>
    <li> does not seem to have much power..over and over the face to shave close...maybe I did not give it enough time...still trying</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t owned an electric razor for some time now but needed to get something for the sideburns.  Also tried, actually, shaving with it and IT.....DIDN&#x27;T.......DO.....A.......THING!  Had to go back to my blade.</li>
    <li> Norelco has been my razor for most of my life. A great product. A great shave, they last a long time - I usually throw them away after two blades because I want to try the latest model.</li>
    <li> Great razor, nice shave, easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> Shaver is good, performs up to expectation and can be cleaned easily under the tap. Only issue is that i need an adaptor for the charger for use in my country.</li>
    <li> works great , months of use without trouble , good battery life</li>
    <li> I went all Tim Howard and this has been the best way to keep the top smooth!</li>
    <li> Excelente rasuradora, es por eso que la adquirí</li>
    <li> Got it for my dad as a present....he absolutely loves it....</li>
    <li> The three head system is very nice.  The trimmer is not just nice, it is great.  It is nice to have a shaver that is both electric and has batteries when you need them.. It has a super cord (if you choose to use the electricity - that stays attached to the shaver and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fall&amp;#34; out every few minutes).  This is probability the best razor I have ever had in my life, and I am retired.  This should tell you why I have give the Philips Norelco AT810/41 Shaver 4100  - 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> NOT A CLOSE SHAVE AS RAUN.</li>
    <li> A quality product and fast delivery.It really shaves close and it is easy to clean.No more nicks and easy to recharge.</li>
    <li> Still breaking in, but don&#x27;t notice the diference.  Cost of &amp;#34;blade replacement&amp;#34; always seems high. Shaving while driving was a blessing before I retired.</li>
    <li> head broke with one fall. cant use it 2 shave. trimmer, yes use</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  The battery lasts a long time.  The trimmer works great and it is all easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well, better than expected.  I love the fact you can rinse it off, and allow to dry in the open air.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> This definitely is an improvement over my old one.  Besides being able to shave wet and then rinse the head off, the battery keeps on going.  It is so long between charges, I forget where the cord is.</li>
    <li> Razor runs for a long time on a charge. A snap on cover for the head is included but there is no case or other protection.</li>
    <li> used for several month, just works great.</li>
    <li> The unbit is well built and seems to work just fine but even following all tips and advice i still get a bit of razor burn even using the lightest practical pressure and skin tensioning. Disposable razors work better but the cost and inconvenience makes the razor butn acceptable for daily needs. Special occasions still call for a wet shave with a razor.</li>
    <li> worst shaver ever. returned it</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco/Philips shavers for many years.  They work really well and last very long.  Prior to getting this AT810 model, I was using a 7110X model.  This AT810 uses the same HQ8 shaving head so the shaving performance is similar to the 7110X which I am very satisfied with.  The battery and motor are updated with new technology.  It runs quieter and charges much quicker.  Overall I am very happy with the AT810 model.  You cannot go wrong with any Norelco shaver or razor.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this unit is how quiet this shaver actually is. I&#x27;d have to say that is what I like the most. I can shave in my office and not bother Gary. And everyone knows you don&#x27;t want to bother Gary. I tried this unit both dry and in the shower. It did a very good job both ways. I have a bunch of electric shavers and this one held its own next to ones much more expensive. I call this shaver an entry level unit due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case, and the recharge indicator is only a light and not a digital display. With more expensive units you get a case and a countdown display showing how many more minutes of shaving time you get before you need to recharge. I recommend this unit based on the quality you get for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;- Entry Level - No case and charge indicator is just a light&lt;br /&gt;- Very Quiet! (won&#x27;t bother Gary)&lt;br /&gt;- Very good smooth shave both wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;- Very good deal for the price</li>
    <li> I have owned several Norelco Electric Razors and this is a Great Razor. Very close comfortable shave, easy to clean with water and is very quiet compaired to my old Norelco razor.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper than buying cartridge razors like the Fusion, especially if you shave twice a day&lt;br /&gt;-less irritating, once your skin gets used to it&lt;br /&gt;-waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-light, long lasting battery pack (I charge it once a week)&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-not as close of a shave as disposable blade razors&lt;br /&gt;-hard to get a close shave on angle of jaw and neck&lt;br /&gt;-big and bulky and traps water in its nooks and crannies, not the best travel shaver&lt;br /&gt;-Planned obsolescence: Battery pack is not user serviceable, once it stops holding a charge, it&#x27;s scrap. Also with the high cost of replacement heads at half of the cost of a new shaver, it&#x27;s almost a foregone conclusion you&#x27;ll be upgrading to a new one in a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: read the instructions, take the 20 days (I&#x27;d say a month) for your skin to acclimate, and clean the shaving heads regularly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product A+++</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY SECOND AQUATEC RAZOR I TRIED OTHER RAZORS THIS IS THE BEST FOR ME. I USE IT WITH SHAVING CREAM VERY CLOSE SHAVE LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This is the first Norelco I have owned that does not give a decent shave.  I&#x27;ve had good luck with previous Norelco products, but this one is a dud.</li>
    <li> i love it, it is the only electric razor that i would use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK - does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I don&#x27;t think it works much better than my 10 year old version that it replaced.  Battery holds a good charge.</li>
    <li> Worked for like a week and then all 3 razors gave out.</li>
    <li> My first electric razor in 20 something years... It says beard needs to adapt to electric from manual and that&#x27;s can take few weeks... From my experience it does not work that well on a 2 day (or more) beard... but works very good on a daily basis..</li>
    <li> It broke within a year. It was a good product until it stopped working completely. I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything, it just broke.</li>
    <li> I tried using it dry, in the shower, and also with my face freshly washed. It provides the closest shave an electric razor has given me so far without any hair pulling or discomfort but it leaves unshaved patches which require me to take out my old one that I was hoping to get rid of.</li>
    <li> works excellent wet or dry better than my old norelco</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s weird,the adaptor cannot use in China,isn&#x27;t it a universal one?</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
    <li> It took the call-center operator 30 MINUTES just to prepare money-back authorization form (and I&#x27;ve been on the line all that time).</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t seem to have the speed for a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;my other Norelco (same style) was better</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Love fact that can use shaving cream with it and clean it rinsing with hot water.  Very reasonably priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face, no electric razor could handle my beard. I use it on my head and it does agood job with no nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> Listen up people, I&#x27;ve got news! Shaving is first and foremost a WET endeavor, and one that is best accomplished in the SHOWER, where your face is well soaked, warm, clean, and soft. If you have yet to discover this secret little pleasure in life you have my heart-felt sympathy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this razor stacks up against other electric shavers in the dry and I don&#x27;t expect to ever find out. If it can&#x27;t go into the shower with me I wouldn&#x27;t consider owning it anyway. Based on that feature alone this razor would be a 4 star product in my opinion. And since the Norelco 810 with Aquatec technology also gives me a plenty close, comfortable shave with no irritation and cleans up by simply placing it under hot running water, this product easily makes 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It gives a nice close shave and I like the fact that you can use it in the shower with shaving gel.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction, no problems, recommend highly, shaver runs on battery only</li>
    <li> Bought this Philips in June. Had lot of expectations on this, but stopped working. I hardly used this in 4 months. Read the reviews and thought this product will be perfect. Philips disappointed me and will never ever use this product again. Poor poor poor.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the lower quality Norelco I got at walmart for a bit less. Works in the shower, with or without cream. Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this useless product. The videos and descriptions are very misleading. It doesnt even trim my beard properly and I had to resort to my reliable Gillette Mach 3 Fusion for a smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> Picked this razor because of search on wed for best razors.  so far it works well.  I needed a razor that is easy on the skin due to medical problems this razor so far has met those expectations</li>
    <li> Great razor, nice close shave. And I like the fact it has lithium ion battery. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun shaver for probably 6 years prior to deciding to get this.  This is my first Rotary razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of force, it hasn&#x27;t caused any extra irritation yet, it cleans very nicely and it&#x27;s also much quieter than my old razor.</li>
    <li> I found it to be convenient and easy to use. love the long battery life. It does cut pretty close, but only if you go over the area several times. I have found that after shaving for what i thought was \\&quot;thorough\\&quot; i keep finding areas i missed.</li>
    <li> I know, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s built for.  But that is what I sometimes use it for.  After all, I&#x27;m a lady and don&#x27;t have a beard, and my husband doesn&#x27;t mind.  It does a good job and cleans up easily, and that&#x27;s all I can ask for.  It&#x27;s not the closest shave in the world, but it&#x27;s quick and painless and I can bring it into the shower.</li>
    <li> I ordered the razor for my husband and he is Very Happy with the item.  Says it shaves close and nice on skin.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, I have tried a few and since I live in Japan the voltage is different. But with a dry face with or with out a little powder. I love it. Gives you a close clean shave.......I also have a hard beard and it door the job with ease. Yes I would order again.........</li>
    <li> Works great. No complaints. Much cheaper replacement blades than the more expensive Senso 3D Norelco with ridiculously expensive replacement blades. I find that this model works just as well as the more expensive Norelco models. Save your money and get this model instead of the more expensive Norelco models.</li>
    <li> First time user of electric shavers, and I am well satisfied with product/quality as well.</li>
    <li> This thing is a fast shave, painless and easy to clean up. Only complaint, I shave my head and it does not get close enough for me.</li>
    <li> good i like it very muchbthat is all my comments,thanksgood i like it very muchbthat is all my comments,thanks good</li>
    <li> I love this electric shaver it works great but Phillips technical support is even better. The device worked great but at one point it died on me, so I called Phillips technical support and I did not have to press many buttons to get the help and then after few minutes of troubleshooting the technical support sent me another Philips electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Great product! I am a very happy long time norelco shaver user and I strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it. Quiet, close shave. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good. I use it just for pubes n under arms.not the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Realized that i should have bought just the body trimmer which is much cheaper and great.&lt;br /&gt;This serves too much than the intended purpose and is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me.</li>
    <li> Works just as I expected, very happy so far.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco AT810/41 Shaver has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is thick and tough and I get a close comfortable shave whether I shave every day or shave with two or three days beard growth. I like the way it feels in my hand and the trimmer is easy to use. Over the years I have used many different shavers both foil and rotary. All were pretty good but none compares to this one. This one is, by far, the best one for me.</li>
    <li> IT IS OK, BUTTHE BATTERTY INDICATER IS NOT SUFFICIENT</li>
    <li> I have liked this razor in the past.  Its inexpensive, gives a close shave and lasts a long time.  But the one I received runds hard and makes a grinding noise.  It is still all of the above and i use it every day [until I can find something comparable] but the quality of the motor in the one I now have is inferior to the ones I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. It was a very good price. This razor is very quite and cuts close. I know it will get better in about two to three weeks after cutter wear in. one hour charge, wet or dry shave</li>
    <li> owned some electric razors before.&lt;br /&gt;this one is a little bulcky, yet, ok to hold and handle.&lt;br /&gt;the head is something else - performs perfectly and the only bad news are that my son decided&lt;br /&gt;to keep it for himself...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Norelco AT810 for about a week at this point.  I had an older Norelco for about 10 or 12 years.  Pretty long lasting, eh?  I love my new 810 model.  It shaves closely and quickly. I haven&#x27;t tested it in the shower yet. It might be a bit louder than the old model but not enough to bother me.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is my cat was spooked by the new razor.  She has jumped up on the bathroom counter to drink from a drizzle of water while I shave every morning for the last 8 years.  She didn&#x27;t like the bright blue case of the 810 model I guess????  It took her a week and a lot of careful sniffing before she trusted the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;A great shaver!!!</li>
    <li> very nice!!!!!quiet and cuts close but its my first time using one of these so i got irritation on my face...booklet says 3 weeks for my face to adjust so if it does will be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works well with lectric shave. Haven&#x27;t tried with cream or other liquid. Comfortable to hold. Would recommend to others. Still need another word to publish. Done.</li>
    <li> My only complaint with this product is that like all electric shavers its impossible to buzz your neck without ripping and tearing</li>
    <li> The shaver is great, really does give you a very smooth and close shave, and like advertised, works great in wet conditions as well. Not to mention that it is really easy to clean by just rinsing it under the tap!&lt;br /&gt;It is light, has a good grip, and not too loud. The trimmer, on the other hand, is kind of weak and not too precise, so it won&#x27;t give you the side-burns that you&#x27;ve always dreamed of, however this is the only down-side I see!</li>
    <li> Works well and gives almost a clean shave.  Would like to have more power than it presents.  In all very nice.</li>
    <li> This razor is not up to the standard of my past Norelco&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s principally made of plastic.  It also doesn&#x27;t shave a close as some of my past versions.  I tried using the Nivea gell and was thoroughly disappointed - like using a blade and shaving cream, just a lot messier than I&#x27;ve gotten used to with electric shavers.  I&#x27;m going to return the Nivea and likely the razor, too.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco razor that I had for many years. It had the gel/lotion that despensed from the razor itself and love it. Unfortunately, it died and I needed a replacement. I purchased this razor on the features of it being a wet/dry shaver, my previous experience with Norelco razors, and the high reviews that it received. From the first day, it didn&#x27;t seem to shave properly and missed alot of facial hair. I read the instruction booklet and went to Philips website to see if I was doing something wrong. It says that you need to allow your facial hair time (21 days) to adjust to the razor. I used the razor for over 30 days and it still missed hair, pulled hair, split the hairs, and cut me once. I tried the razor: dry, in the shower, with lotion/gel. Nothing seemed to make the product worked like it should. I followed the instructions and even making sure the heads were clean and free from debris. A positive I can say is that it does hold a good charge. Maybe I received a lemon, but this is one razor I am not willing to try again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many tri-head razors in the &amp;#60;$50 category.  You cant go wrong with this one.  It is water washable and gives a good shave.  key feature is the side burn trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor as a gift for my husband who wanted to try electric. He is very happy with the results. He gets a close shave and likes that it can be easily rinsed since it&#x27;s waterproof. He likes the fact that being waterproof gives him options to shave dry, with shaving cream, or just with water. Would recommend as a good quality, basic razor.</li>
    <li> Great product, did exactly what I expected. Although I didn&#x27;t think the dry shave was as close as some other electric razors i&#x27;ve tried, but this was sufficient. The wet shave definitely is nice to have though and it&#x27;s very smooth, comfortable, and much closer of a shave than the dry. Pretty satisfied with this product and have no real complaints.</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric razor, especially for the price. I like the fact it can be used with a wet face. It also cuts relatively close. It shaves fast. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that it still misses some hairs. At least it does not pull. I just wish I did not have to go over my face several times in some spots. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> pretty good。and cheap。</li>
    <li> Very good, but also patronize.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband for a gift. Thus razor does not dissppoint.</li>
    <li> Product is decent, takes a few passes for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: decent battery and hair capture in the head&lt;br /&gt;Cons: weak blades and takes a while for a clean shave</li>
    <li> Great product recommended!  would buy again!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like, but it is super easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how cheap this shaver feels for what it cost. But, the only reason I am writing this review is that it does not work while plugged in. You have to pull the cord out of it before you can use it. Then, you have to plug the cord back in to charge it. Every rechargable shaver I have had prior to this one I could leave plugged in.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. Very quiet compared to my old Norelco. Gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> the chargind cord does not mesh with razor and will not saty pluged in need to have some tape to hold cord end to recharge&lt;br /&gt;this realy sucks for $50.00 dollars damn</li>
    <li> AFTER TWO WEEKS OF USE LIKE IT VERY MUCH. NICE CLOSE SHAVE &amp; EASY TO CLEAN. DON&#x27;T KNOW ABT. PERFOMANCE AFTER 3 MOS OR MORE OF USE..</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s so easy to clean - just rinse under the faucet!  I also like that it&#x27;s designed to cut longer wiskers as well as the short ones.  Just don&#x27;t get caught with it running out of battery power because you don&#x27;t have the option of using the razor while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.  It takes about an hour to charge which isn&#x27;t bad, but if you&#x27;re in a rush and it&#x27;s out of juice, you&#x27;re out of luck!</li>
    <li> Once more, I did not read the description as I shud have! NO PROTECTIVE CASE. The last one I bought came with a case, si I thought this one would! WRONG!</li>
    <li> I have owned three Norelco electric shavers over the past 50 years and have always been extremely pleased with the close shave and long life of each shaver.  This latest purchase of the AT810 is truly remarkable!  It shaves better than earlier models and is sleek in design.  I don&#x27;t intend on shaving in the shower so I can&#x27;t recommend for that purpose. I believe I will buy a second identical shaver for a spare when travel out of town.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this fine shaver.</li>
    <li> Been using it since purchase and find that it does a great job. I use with shaving cream and works great and what a close shave. I would recommend this product and what a great price also.</li>
    <li> no stand for device - seems weak compared to my old norelco, betting it does not last as long as my previous one</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric shavers over the years and this is one of the better ones. That said, my beard does not work very well with ANY electric shaver. I would tell anyone getting and electric shaver to avoid the high-priced ones. They&#x27;re just not worth the premium cost. I wouldn&#x27;t spend any more than $60 on a shaver. You just don&#x27;t get a better shave. If you don&#x27;t agree with that then marketing persuasion has worked on you.</li>
    <li> Just received and charged. Used once (dry and without gel/foam/etc) and getting the hang of it, although not able to move smoothly over skin (never had electric shaver like this).  Very close shave. Seems durable and comes with 2 yr warranty (extra 6 months if you register product). You really can pour water on it. Haven&#x27;t tried shaving wet. Sale + $10 coupon on amazon &#x3D; $40. At this price it seems like a good deal.</li>
    <li> Previously, I have used the 2 head dry philips electric shaver. I have also used the foil type dry electric shaver from braun and wet/dry cheapo from emerson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good coverage means faster shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is good.&lt;br /&gt;Whisper quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good close wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not too good on the neck and chin area.&lt;br /&gt;Not too good on the moustache area.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be as close a shave as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons mostly apply to all electric razors. So relatively it is a good device.</li>
    <li> Have not tried using it wet, but the shave I get dry is more than close enough.  Very happy with it</li>
    <li> This product increase all my needs... high quality, durability and battery life is very well. I don&#x27;t need to use my shaver any more</li>
    <li> its not fancy and does have LCD but it does work as expected.&lt;br /&gt;the back trimmer is a bit weak as a slight force can flip it off.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves it. Haven&#x27;t heard any complaint from him so I&#x27;m assuming this electric razor is perfect for him. I&#x27;m glad I picked it out. GREAT PRODUCT!!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean!  Holds charge for a long time and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a good clean shave with NO irritation.</li>
    <li> The razor came very quickly and safely packed. The razor arrived as described. An awesome Christmas present for my son.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my own use and find it meets all my needs. I was a razor blade user but due to recent health issues was told to switch to electric razor. Many years ago I used an electric razor and it was a short term usage, didn&#x27;t like it, did not give close shave. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Norelco is NOT as close a shave as blade shaving but it does a fine job.</li>
    <li> just received the shaver and first used was in a shower, well it provide a really close shave which is quite surprising, given the quality of shave and its price, its a steal, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Husband keeps telling me how happy he is with his new razor. Loves the fact you can rinse it. He just took it on a week-long trip and didn&#x27;t need to recharge it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave wet, I was suprised that it was as good as a straight razor.  I have charged this only once, and have used it every day for two weeks. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This item was on my dad&#x27;s Christmas wish list with an ad from a mayor retailer I don&#x27;t care to support. Your price was lower and I added a coupon for an additional $10.00 off. Delivery was prompt and my dad says it&#x27;s a real pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> It is just I expect, it is cheap than most of others and work very well, has all need function</li>
    <li> i did not order this nor do i have it so i have no review to post.  i do not know how it got onto my account.  good luck</li>
    <li> It works well for the money. The battery lasts forever. You can get quite a few shaves in before needing to recharge again.</li>
    <li> Great shaver . everything I expected . Why look else. Bought the AT 810 instead of the 730 because it has better battery and is waterprofe</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck... My dog broke m y other one and I have used this for 5 days out of the box without charging</li>
    <li> I like it, gives a close shave and ergonomically it feels great in hand. One minus is the trimmer just doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the cheaper shavers I&#x27;ve bought. But, overall I like it.</li>
    <li> This was the second time I tried an electric razor and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a blade.  I have wasted a lot of money on trying the newest and greatest blades and I never was satisfied.  If the blade gave me a good shave, it would only last a few shaves.  I get a very close shave and if the razor continues to preform as promised, I will not have to buy a new razor head for another 10 months ($23).</li>
    <li> met or exceeded my expectations.  good value for $60</li>
    <li> Cuts Great but way to much of a problem to clean. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always bought Norelco razors, They have never let me down. Bought my first one in the 80s and didn&#x27;t have to buy one until the late 90s. It lasted me until I bought this one. It does do exactly as described. I have used it with shaving gel and dry and works great. This item is not a waste of money. Highly recommend it. Also give you face a chance to adjust to the razor for first timers. 6 to 8 weeks should do it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to agree with my skin and hair. I&#x27;d run it in circles over the same spot over and over and it just wouldn&#x27;t trim. Nice that it works wet I guess, except it doesn&#x27;t work when wet or at any other time. Three stars.</li>
    <li> and I have the razor a month and still irritating me in the neck area so much so that I was a big burned in that area</li>
    <li> My husband likes the razor.  Was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in decades and was impressed with the progress.  Two things stand out- 1) the ability to shave wet or dry and 2) how quiet it is.&lt;br /&gt;After four shaves, no irritation and close shaves.  I&#x27;ve been shaving every day and love this electric!</li>
    <li> The problem with this razor is it has to be cleaned after each shave which involves taking it apart, cleaning the tiny parts without deforming them, then putting it back together. Without doing so each subsequent shave is poorer in quality. This totally defeats the reason for buying an electric. After two months I dropped a part on the floor that was never found. The the rest of the parts I threw in a drawer and forgot about it. The best most convenient shave is disposables - 10 for a dollar at dollar stores.</li>
    <li> This product shaves very well. I like the fact that there is a flip out trimmer to help with sideburns and other hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> this was a gift and they loved it!</li>
    <li> It meets all my expectations!  I give it an excellent rating! It is light weight, fits my hand nicely, and gives a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many Norelcos over the last 40 years and this is by far the best.  At the price I&#x27;ts also the cheapest one I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and still on first charge and going strong.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor so I can&#x27;t quite comment on how it compares to other razors. What I like about this razor is how easy it is compared to a razor blade. No gel, no mess. This is perfect for people who wants things done the simplest way possible. I am very impressed by the closeness of the shave. I get a closer and smoother shave with this versus a razor blade. The thing I did not enjoy about a blade is that you risk cutting yourself if you try to shave to close. But with this, you can shave close AND get away without a cut. I was a bit surprised when I found out the rotary spun slower than I expected, and this is probably the reason why sometimes there is 1 strand of hair that hasn&#x27;t been shaved. But that just means you have to go over it a couple times, which is no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this, and the popup trimmer is a plus. Also, it&#x27;s very nice to have the option of shaving under dry or wet conditions.</li>
    <li> I bought the AT810 to replace a 7 year old Norelco 6863XL.  I liked the previous razor, but I like the AT810 even more.  It is quieter, lighter, more comfortable to use, and shaves closer.  I am using it dry and got 26 shaves from the first charge of the battery.  I look forward to using it every morning.</li>
    <li> The most simple, yet the most elegant electric razor for the price. I purchased this electric razor to replace my old Philips Norelco shaver. This is my 3rd consecutive Philips electric shaver, each of which lasted around two years or so before I upgraded to the newest one, so I have been a loyal customer for five or six years. Each one has increased in quality over the years and is still at a great price point when you could spend upwards of $100 to $200 on a high-end electric razor. This one achieves a close shave and has a fantastic battery life, considering I shave every other day, and only have to charge once every couple weeks. I highly recommend this shaver to anyone who shaves often and needs a quality electric razor on a modest budget.</li>
    <li> Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Good shave on most of the face ... some problem under the chin &amp; on neck.&lt;br /&gt;Othewise, almost as good as a blade.</li>
    <li> look no further. I was skeptical at first. I am so happy I settled on this  shaver. It gives as close of a shave the a electric shaver could give. There&#x27;s a reason why I titled this look no further. If you&#x27;re looking for a solid shaver this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> I have very tough whiskers and relied on hot water, shave cream and a razor for years. Very time consuming. This gives me a very close and comfortable shave in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those clueless individuals who have downgraded it for the battery life here&#x27;s how it works: unplug it, shave, clean it out, and plug it in until next time. Problem solved.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an electric razor that my husband got from Marshalls.  His previous one did not have a wet/dry function and that was a hugely important selling point for this model. The shaver gets charged about once a week, which is convenient.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean.  However, the shave is definitely not as close as a traditional disposable razor.  It will also have to be replaced at some point because the replacement heads are so expensive.  For now though, its a great upgrade.</li>
    <li> As an old man whose not as steady as he once was it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a clean close shave and it cleans up easily.  It gives a much better shave on a clean dry face than a wet or lathered beard.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for 3 months with only one complaint. The only complaint is the plug that goes into the razor to recharge it is difficult to insert.  Other than that it was a great purchase especially for the price.. and recently the replacement razors have been on sale for 75% off  because they&#x27;re being discontinued.</li>
    <li> My son was in an accident and needed an electric shaver as he couldn&#x27;t use a blade razor. All he told me was it had to be a 3 head Norelco. After careful consideration I chose this one for him. He loves it. The design is easy for him to use with his injured arm and hand. He said he will continue to use this razor even after he gets better use of his arm. Loved the close shave and how easy it is to use. A definite 5 star purchase</li>
    <li> This razor is my husbands and he says that he would give it a three rating. He is still trying to get used to it and having a hard time getting to shave cleanly under his chin and on his neck. I thought it was very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I recommend to purchas this product, thiswill be the best producxt that you will be glad that you purchased. The use you will get out this will prove to be very beneficial.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my dad&#x27;s old Norelco. He likes not only how it shaves but the ease of using it. It is light weight so much easier to hold onto. He likes that he can clean it with water and shave dry or wet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product and it was on time. I recommend it a lot</li>
    <li> The cord would not stay in to charge it up.  It would be there for awhile and then for no reason not be charging</li>
    <li> Great lightweight product.Easy to use. Like the lighted recharge feature.Also it is easy to clean.I travel frequently so this will be handy.</li>
    <li> LADIES:  buy one of these for daily touchups on your legs.  It does an acceptable job, especially during the winter months when you want to shave but also kind of don&#x27;t care.  It doesn&#x27;t do a smooth enough job for, say, a date night... but the savings on stupid-expensive razors and the ease of use for a quick touchup make this electric razor pretty worth it</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet&lt;br /&gt;-Quick charge&lt;br /&gt;-Simple&lt;br /&gt;-Painless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to go over area, at least a dozen times to get anywhere, and that is NOT an exaggeration. It takes well over 30 minutes to shave. It does give a close shave but I think just about anything would if you keep having to go over it again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt;regular razor - 2 min&lt;br /&gt;other electric razor - 5 min&lt;br /&gt;This electric razor - 30-40 min + anger and frustration</li>
    <li> Dad loves it.  Good price and good product.</li>
    <li> This has been my first experience using an electric razor.  I had a $30 Amazon gift card and I hate buying disposables so I decided to get this one.  As other reviewers and the instructions say, you must give your face/skin time to acclimate.  Try it out for at least 30 days before deciding whether you like it or not.  Don&#x27;t expect a skin close shave the first time you use it, but the more you use it and get used to it, the better shave you can achieve.</li>
    <li> My 18 year old son loves this shaver. Being able to use in the shower or dry shave he thinks is great. Nice clean shave too!</li>
    <li> This razor performs as described. My bf suffers from razor bumps and ingrown hairs badly. He wanted this razor so he got it as an early xmas gift. His new job requires a clean shave so he needs something that will get the job done and Phillips Norelco does it! The first day he used it, his face was smoother and the bumps were less visible. He is very pleased and some am I!</li>
    <li> It is cool, vibrates a bit which is nice especially if you use on your balls.  but it leaves so many patches on your face and it works terribly.  Buy a regular razor its much better</li>
    <li> So far this has worked great for my son. He seems to like the way it&#x27;s designed.</li>
    <li> I do not need more manual razors with this wonderful model is old and I still have a great shaving. Buy it without fear, that if I should wash it thoroughly after each use to prevent deterioration leaflets, they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used mine for 15 days and still have not recharged the battery, buy her a good bag to prevent damage and dry thoroughly before storing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with mine and I hope you may be also once the purchase.</li>
    <li> He LOVED it!!  He couldn&#x27;t wait to try it Christmas day.  Smoother and much closer shave.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to get it right. I cant achieve a clean shave as yet.I hope that it will get better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco savers for years.  I&#x27;ve always purchase the cheaper 700 series model.  I have a tough beard and the blades would only last about a year. With the cost of replacement blades being what they are I would just toss the shaver and get another one.  Seems wasteful but I couldn&#x27;t justify spending for blades when I could get a new shaver for a few dollars more.  Anyway, this time I bought the more expensive model hoping for a closer shave and longer blade life.  However, in reading the manual (yes I do read them) Norelco recommends changing the blades once a year...LOL  So far I can&#x27;t really tell any difference in shave quality between the two models.  Both give me a close shave. This one is suppose to be water proof.  However I use to wash out the 700 series under the faucet with no problems.  Time will tell how this 810 holds up.  But as of now when this one wears out I&#x27;ll probably replace it with the cheaper Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent mid-price electric Norelco razor.  Doesn&#x27;t have the pivoting head of the SensoTouch line but still does a great job.  Just need to maneuver it around a little more with your hands.  I consider it a must that my electric razor be water proof so that I can use it in the shower or with shaving gel/cream.  This one fits the bill and even makes it nice and simple to clean out the blade compartment with a rinse under the sink faucet.  The razor DOES NOT come with a case or charging/storage stand (took off a star for not having those).  If these things are important to you I would consider paying a little more to move up to one of the SensoTouch razors that do come with a nice travel case and charging/storage stand.</li>
    <li> When I charge it, sometimes the green light turns off within one hour. I don&#x27;t know when it will be completely charged, the green light should be always on during charging, and is off when charging is complete.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of electric razors primarily because my face is very sensitive. I would love the closeness of a razor blade and having the refreshing feeling you get from using shaving cream.  But unfortunately shaving with a razor blade was a bloody mess for me (literally, not the British vernacular).  It didn&#x27;t matter if I used the best razor blade system or whatever kind of shaving cream.  I really had no other option than to use an electric razor and this worked fine for me for decades.  That is until my latest Norelco bit the dust and I needed to buy a new one.  After reading the overall good reviews for the Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec, I figured I would give it a try even if I wasn&#x27;t planning on using it with water and shaving cream.  I was very pleased with how it shaved dry and would have been very satisfied if that&#x27;s how I was going to use it.  But one day I tried it with shaving cream....WOW!!!  It worked great and the end result was getting a razor close shave.  No nicks, no cuts, just close!  After use, you just open up the lid and rinse out and let air dry.  I also like the way the AT810 is whisper quiet.  Not that it probably matters much, I used Edge shaving cream. I&#x27;m sure you could use pretty much any kind.  I could not be happier with this electric razor. Now for our friends across the pond, I suppose it&#x27;s fair that I should now use the British vernacular...IT&#x27;S BLOODY AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> At age 76 I was tired of the usual shaving routine. I had used Norelco razors for a while many years ago and like the rotary shavers more than the others. The redesigned shaving heads do an excellent job on both straight and curly hairs. This razor is easy to use and the aquatec feature makes it easy to clean. Combined with electric pre-shave lotion, it works very well.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations.  At first the razor irritated my face.  It took a few days for my face to get use to the razor.  No problems now.</li>
    <li> I Had forgotten how smooth and quick shaving could be. I Would reccommend to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
    <li> I needed a new razor because my Norelco is over five years old and never changed blades. The new replacement curs faster and smoother. Just what a razor should do!!</li>
    <li> want clean? Then don&#x27;t buy it. just used once then return it. But waterproof is not bad, so I give one star</li>
    <li> This is a good-looking, average quality product. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in comfort of shaving&lt;br /&gt;between my old, cheaply made electric razor and this one.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I have to use my regular razor anyway to be fully shaved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electric razors before, some rotary and some foil heads, but I&#x27;ve always returned to the blade and foam because it just seemed I would get a much closer shave. Well, I think Norelco really got it right with this model electric shaver. You do have to give it the time it wants to do the job, but I have come to believe it can match the blade for closeness and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin like some electric shavers do. I have to admit that I was kind of skeptical about Norelco&#x27;s slots and holes in the shaving head. They claim that the holes get closer to cutting off the stubble that the slots leave behind. It sounded like advertising hype to me. Well, Norelco was right. It must be the reason why the Norelco gives you such a close shave. I&#x27;m amazed how good it can shave you. It can match the blade for closeness, so I&#x27;ve retired the blade and don&#x27;t miss it one bit. Good job,Norelco!!</li>
    <li> My husband likes this, exceptional bargain...thank you! As seniors we always need to save money, this was a good find.</li>
    <li> My previous one lasted 13 yrs. Its battery no longer holds a charge but otherwise works. This one was purchased to replace it, and it is giving a closer shave.</li>
    <li> This is the second Philips Norelco I have purchased.  My facial hair is thick and it has no problem doing the job.  I like to switch from manual shaving to electric shaving on a regular basis.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he LOVES it.  This is the first electric shaver he has ever been able to use.  He uses it every morning for a quick shave.  He loves it becuase it does not irritate  his face.</li>
    <li> This shaver runs quietly and gives a close shave in a few minutes.  It can be cleaned by rinsing under a faucet, and can be recharged in an hour.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shaver gets so close to the skin it looks like you used a razor blade but you used this shaver and saved twenty minutes every morning! I love the rechargeable feature and I&#x27;m amazed how long one charge goes, I usually charge my razor just once a week and it will hold charge for seven or more days. The other nice fact is that this razor comes with a 2 year service plan without charge! Now that shows how good this shaver is if the company stands by it for two years! I think you will be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product and works good. But it does not include even a simple bag. It is better to charge a bit more for it. I do not understand why a big company like this can not include a simple nylon bag to this product. They are very cheap and I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> his is the best electric shaver I have owned.  The sale price made it an excellent buy.  Would stroongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good. Shaving with gel provided better results than dry shaving. I wish the opposite was true. I much rather shave dry. I did however receive a bad ingrown hair that turned into a cyst under my chin. Whether it was from this shaver is unknown. I suspect it was.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the nice shave of the Norelco Razors. I use to have a entry level Norelco, but one day the dog ate it. The vet made her throw up the blade she swallowed and I put it back in the razor, ever since it didn&#x27;t shave as well. So I thought I would get a replacement. I was thinking about just getting the blades, but thought for about the same price I could get a new razor. I would think about getting a model up, staying with the Norelco. This has a good shave, but my original Norelco was a bit better, didn&#x27;t have to put much pressure on it to get a close shave. I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream with it, it does the job without. I like the idea that you can use water on it to clean it</li>
    <li> If you shave totally &amp;#34;by eye&amp;#34; and never touch your face to see if you missed any whiskers, this shaver would be wonderful. My first impression was how very quietly it runs, which I do like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using electric shavers 40 years ago, and have not used a blade since. In fact my first shaver was a Norelco Triple Header very much like this one, albeit a lot heavier and with a cord. Since then I switched to Braun cordless which I used a long time, as I liked its self cleaning feature. From there I went to the Panasonic ES 8249 which I used right up to purchasing this Norelco (and still use, unfortunately). It seems I have a very ornery set of whiskers, that would appear to run and hide as the shaver approaches, then jump back out and laugh after it passes by. I bought this Norelco to see if I could improve upon the frustrating process of shaving this ornery beard, perhaps better than the Panasonic. No way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave each and every morning. After spending a nice quiet 10 minutes of going over and over and over my face with this Norelco, I have to pull out my noisy Panasonic and &amp;#34;actually shave&amp;#34;. I really wanted to like this Norelco. But between its serious lack of getting anywhere near as close a shave as the Panasonic, and the fact that its triple head design now feels like trying to shave with something the size of a dinner plate&#x27;s face, I am not impressed. Despite how frustrating it is to actually accomplish a decent shave with ANY shaver, the Norelco foils have to be several times thicker than the ES8249 uses. One of the nifty things about the Panasonic is that I can hear the high pitched &#x27;tick&#x27; as each whisker gets cut. So after having tried with the Norelco and switching to the Panasonic, not only can I feel the closer shave with my fingers as I am getting it, I can hear the Panasonic cutting all the whiskers shorter as it goes over the stubble left behind by the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, my last Norelco Cordless before I bought the Braun did have the Lift and Cut style cutters, and I remember getting a nice smooth and close shave with it. So something has changed, for the much worse, in Norelco&#x27;s current design. The cutters on this new Norelco, well, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t cut it&amp;#34; as the saying goes. I plan to give this thing a full week of effort, but at this rate (after the second day) I am inclined to return it. I know they say allow a few weeks for one to get used to the electric shaver, but since that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve shaved with for 40 years I doubt I need much getting used to it. And when I did buy this Panasonic a couple years back, after the Braun literally fell apart from age,  it instantly shaved as well or even better than it is doing today. No acclimation period was required. So I don&#x27;t think allowing more time is going to matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Amazon reviewers mention on these new Norelcos they feel the motor is underpowered. I have to say that for what it DOES cut, it seems powerful enough. It just can&#x27;t cut close to the skin as the design is supposed to do. Maybe they need to study how thin the foils are on other modern shavers and then redesign the Norelco.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas Gift for my husband.  His old Norelco was more than 20 yrs old.  He LOVES it!  Charges fast, and works great.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> I ended up paying more on amazon than I should have, but that&#x27;s a rare thing. My husband loves this! It saves a ton of money on razor blades, takes half the time, and looks just as good!</li>
    <li> best for the price&lt;br /&gt;did a lot of research b4 buying, this is the best one to get for this price</li>
    <li> you get a smooth shave with no burn after.  good purchase.  would recommend to anyone who needs a new shaver</li>
    <li> My husband likes this razor. He wouldn&#x27;t give 5 stars only 4 but he is picky. I like the color of it and also like the way it was here overnight.</li>
    <li> It would have 5 Stars if you could use it with the power cord while shaving. It won&#x27;t run if the charger power cord is inserted. My previous  Phillips Norelco Shaver did not have this issue. Otherwise, the new unit works fine.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a wonderfully close shave with very little effort.  Have not tried it wet at this time, but looking forward to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this during the cyber Monday deals for Thanksgiving. The Amazon price was better than Wal-marts! My boyfriend loves it. He is able to use it both in and out of the shower. It is perfect for quick touch ups or detailed shaves. It holds battery life great and works flawlessly. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> A good razor for the price.  Previous razor was a XL model and this razor gives as good a shave..&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat for the price..</li>
    <li> I was expecting an improvement over my much less expensive 8 year old corded Norelco.  I was concerned that there might be chaffing or a too-close cut of my relatively light beard.  Not so.  I could not ask for a more comfortable and smooth shave.  It&#x27;s a huge improvement over my older less expensive corded model.  Shaves take less time and because they are closer, skipping a shave or not shaving again in the evening for an outing (after a morning shave) is not necessary..  And, of course, the cordless feature is great.  I&#x27;ve only let it go one week without charging, but will try longer periods to know how long of a road trip I can take without taking the charging cord along.  With my light beard I&#x27;m expecting two weeks.</li>
    <li> This replaces a Panasonic that I had for about a year.  I had forgot what a smooth close shave really feels like.  I shave in the morning and it is good till  bed time, no five o&#x27;clock shadow (at least not enough to care about).  It fits the hand perfectly, is very quite and easy to clean.  I just run it under hot water about once a week to keep it clean.  The battery lasts through the entire week, partly I think, because I can shave much quicker than with my old razor.  It does take a bit of time for the neck to get used to it.  I always had fine hairs left on my neck, in the past.  Not anymore, this razor gets all of the hair but leaves the neck a bit raw for the firs tweek or so.  This, I think is true when ever changing shavers.</li>
    <li> I have been using an old Panasonic. Because of its age its unfair to criticize it, because it worked well during my time with it. This Phillips Norelco was a breath of fresh air, it has an amazing close shave, about as good as a straight razor. It is still new to me but I have been impressed. Havent used it wet yet, but the dry shave is excellent.</li>
    <li> I am not an electric razor guy, but this product may have changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;Close quick shave.  Razor performs well.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> OK but you have to go over and over to get close cut.</li>
    <li> Fast easy to clean smooth shave, Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cut the hair so fine, It is hard to find it once I have to clean it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor for traveling.  He says it gives a nice close shave and is very gentle to his skin.</li>
    <li> The most comfortable electric shaver I have ever used, would highly recommend it to anyone who requires really close shaving.</li>
    <li> The charge lasts for a really long time, and it gives a really close shave for an electric razor. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> excelente afeitadora, practica, liviana ... la resistencia al agua y la posibilidad de afeitarse utilizando crema de afeitar son muy buenas.</li>
    <li> I gifted these electronic razors to my hubby n daddy... They liked it alot.. It made their life easy...&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and Easy to use...</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saying that I&#x27;ve never had much success with electric razors.  I&#x27;ve got curly hair growing every direction but straight up.  But even allowing for that, this razor significantly underperformed in comparison to other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.  I don&#x27;t know if I had a defective unit, but the motor seemed to run much slower than other razors, and it just wasn&#x27;t effective at shaving my curly facial hair.  Literally 5 minutes of running this thing around my face, and my whiskers are at 5:00-shadow length.  Glad they&#x27;ve got a 45-day return policy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fifteen year old for Christmas, he&#x27;s used it a few times.  It shaves fairly close, and charges quickly with the enclosed AC cord.  He has not used it with water or in the shower.  Its been a month now, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  Will update in the near future.</li>
    <li> It is ok i thought it would be more powerful</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very close shave.  The battery charge lasts for weeks without affecting performanace.  Cleaning is simple and effective.</li>
    <li> This razor did the job as expected and was worth the money I paid. It&#x27;s east to clean and I get a decent shave</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use a razor.  manscape using the pihilips norelco AT810 powertouch with aquatec.  don&#x27;t do the balls though.  weird sensation, takes getting used to.  kinda like it now though.</li>
    <li> Great product but doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Norelco shavers are the best I have used over 50+ years.  This model does not have adjustable cutting height but dones a very good job of shaving.  Cuts 3 day beard without any pulling.</li>
    <li> It just stopped working one day. It lasted less than one year.</li>
    <li> Love this razor - shaves smoother, quieter and closer than my $100.00 Braun...money well spent.</li>
    <li> I’ve had this for several years now. I like it. I recently purchased a second one not just for a fresh battery but a new set of razors. I’m still using the old one but with the new razors attached. Before I use the new unit entirely, I need to read up on how to prep the battery.</li>
    <li> Great Shaving Machine</li>
    <li> Quality I was expecting was not there , kinda cheaply made light weight  . Save your money and get a Braun or something .</li>
    <li> My girl friend hates to shave her legs because they always get tore up with regular razors. After going through a few of the &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; electric razors, I took someones advice and got this for her. She is very happy with it. I&#x27;ve tried it on my face a few times as well and it does a very close shave. I&#x27;m a fan of regular razors myself, but if I ever wanted an electric one, I would get this one.</li>
    <li> so good, i bought this for my friend , they said it is ver good to use and shape !!!!</li>
    <li> was a gift- man had no complaints.  still using it. Ordered what he said he wanted. I guess thats it.</li>
    <li> Battery life is amazing, I only charged two times so far and it&#x27;s been good and steady, doing the job it suppose to do. I would recommend this to you. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that at some point I have to replace the blade. :-(</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco....This is the quickest sharpest shave yet....Great value. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick close shave....</li>
    <li> THIS NORELCO SHAVER IS BETTER THAN MY OLD NORELCO WHICH I PAID $109 FOR, IT SHAVES VERY CLOSE AND STAYS CHARGED A LONG TIME</li>
    <li> While this razor doesn&#x27;t feel as solidly made as the Brauns I&#x27;ve used it provides a nice shave.  The wet/dry option is nice and it is easy to clean.  It also holds a charge a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco razor and unfortunately it will be my last.&lt;br /&gt;My last two were \\&quot;Coolskin\\&quot; models but the current design of that model did not have the ability to catch whiskers that were shaven which I feel is a design flaw. In addition, they went to a bulk packaging of the Nivea Lotion which in my opinion was too expensive for the benefits that I received from it. After much searching I opted for this model which unfortunately is lightweight and cheaply made. The reason it took me so long to post this review is I was nursing my old razor to the point where it simply gave out. I do not have a heavy beard and I used it this A.M. and already 4 hours later I have a stubble forming on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to look at other manufacturers for a razor that has \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; reviews and perhaps you might score with a quality product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on May 1st for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and could not give it to him until May 10 which is the day of his birthday. He has been using it but does not clean shave and constantly giving him bumps. The instruction says to continue to use it for 21 days conversion process to get your skin used to it. He has stopped using it because of the fact that it does not clean shave and continues to get facial bumps. when I tried to return it to Amazon, the claim that the return date expired already so I am now stuck with an electric razor that is worthless and cost $71&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed that Amazon does not back their product that they sell.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old one. I do not recommend this product unless I got a bad one.</li>
    <li> this is my third Norelco shaver and find it to be very comfortable in the hand, gives a good shave and is trouble free</li>
    <li> Works great. I have used it in the shower every morning for about a year now, and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
    <li> Its a razor. It cuts facial hair. I use it in the shower, wet, and with shaving cream. That&#x27;s right...world&#x27;s most sensitive face skin. I bought one of these two years ago, used it almost daily in the shower with shaving cream, with no problems. I hadn&#x27;t even replaced the blades yet and it still shaved well. If I hadn&#x27;t dropped it on to the marble floor and broken the flip up top thingy, I am sure it&#x27;d still be running. Considering that I got 2 years out of it, I didn&#x27;t feel too bad having to buy a new one. Especially considering how well it works for me.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband wanted. He was skeptical that I had found the exact replacement for his old razor.</li>
    <li> item arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> An excellent product via a flawless transaction</li>
    <li> I got the AT810 to replace my old 8170XL and well ... it is about the same.  It provides about the same quality shave, takes about the same amount of time to charge, and it feels about the same in my hand (but a bit fatter).  This version will go into the shower without frying itself (or me) but other than that it is about the same beast.  So, if you liked or disliked any of the old Philips/Norelco razors you will have the similar impression.  It is missing a travel case or a battery charge level indicator (other than a single light) so it is not optimal for traveling but for every day use this is a fine affordable product.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco with a trimmer.  I really like it.........and may I add  that I AM WOMAN.  Yes, we can actually buy razor.....and the trimmer is great for the back of our neck.  So yes it works great for MEN too.  The razor was well packaged.  It arrived FAST and I am happy with the price too.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Phillips Norelco power torch really chargeable cordless razor;\\&quot; is a wonderful electric razor to shave with. I have used Norelco for many years and this cordless Norelco is comparable to all of my previous razors. It has to flip up trimmer on the side to get scraggly hair at the neck or around the ears. The reason I choose Norelco over other razors is due to its reliability and superior blade use. I have tried using other electric razors and they just don&#x27;t hold up next to a Norelco razor.  It is hard to make a review about a product that in my opinion is superior to any other comparable piece of equipment, please take this into advisement as you read this review. I have always used Norelco and shall continue. This razor comes with a very reasonable price. It also runs on very little power compared to past Norelco&#x27;s.  I hope this review is helpful in you making your decision to purchase a product for shaving.</li>
    <li> I only give this unit a lower rating because I have had better electric razors in the past for around the same price point. That being said, this unit performs much better than the last one I had... The prior model I reviewed here on amazon yanked and pulled hair out of my face in a manner that was just not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit hasn&#x27;t given me any problems at all at this point, I just wish it would do a little better with some of the odd ball hairs on my neck area. I have several stubborn hairs that have always been a challenge for electric razors for me. Even getting at them with clippers proves to be a pain, they seem to lay right along the skin and refuse to get picked up. My old electric razor that died on me year ago did a lot better with these few stubborn hairs, well several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has done a pretty good job and will perform pretty well for most people as long as they don&#x27;t have any crazy weird growth issues like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have time I much more prefer to shave with my DE Merkur Progress, I do much more prefer the traditional way of shaving but on road trips and days when you wake up late I grab the electric and take care of the beard. It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close of a proper shave but it&#x27;s not bad and is better than a lot of other electrics on the market. While this isn&#x27;t a top of the line model it&#x27;s still rather good and should be on the top of anyone&#x27;s list that is looking for an electric razor, maybe if you bump the amount you want to spend you can get a little more performance but that&#x27;s a gamble as some of the higher priced models don&#x27;t perform as they should either.</li>
    <li> This razor is great for the price and shaves close.  I haven&#x27;t used the more expensive model that some of the reviews here talk about, but this is about as much as I want to spend.  It&#x27;s so much better than a disposable razor and well worth it, even if you have to spend more time cleaning it.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco is a excellent dry/wet electric razor. My hubby &#x27;s skin is extremely sensitive and this works really well without irritating his skin. Thanks</li>
    <li> WOW!  technology has sure ramped up since the old razor i got as a handme down from my 80 year old dad.  this thing holds a crazy charge (they say 50 hours and i am starting to believe it) allowing me to travel to south america (220 v) and not need to charge for a month!  it cuts well but i have to work at it... moving over my face many times and never getting it all (dry shave).  but its supremely comfortable and so quiet i no longer have to avoid shaving when my sleeping wife is just several feet away.  i would say its quieter than an electric toothbrush.  its also fully usable wet or even soaking so far as i can tell although its hard to bring myself to submerge it.  cleaning it with water, however, is a cinch.  so, although my previous razors were from the stone age (painful, noisy and couldn&#x27;t hold a charge) this razor is sharp.    UPDATE about how long the blades last: After about 6 months of mostly daily use, i noted a reduction in cutting quality. From the amazing initial cuts that would take a minute or so, now i was getting poor quality cuts in both closeness and number of hairs missed.  After about nine months, i needed to shave for 15 minutes to get a really lousy cut that missed many hairs and was by no means close elsewhere. I tried sharpening the blades with a fine blade sharpener on my own and it got moderately better but did not last for more than a month or so.  Now, about a year after the purchase, i broke down and got new blades online through target (i spent $22 with free shipping and taxes included). With the new blades, I am now getting amazing effortless shaves again.  I also got a replacement policy for 4$ that replaces these blades for two years even with only normal wear and tear. we&#x27;ll see if they honor that in a year... but i specifically told them my scheme (of planned replacement) and they were fine with it.     Here&#x27;s the summary:  its a great razor giving great shaves... but after about 6 months, this course stubble of mine (really anormal beard that if i let it grow comes in real soft) beat down those blades to the point of needing replacement. Philips recommends replacement of blades every year and i suspect its closer to every 9 months. So, factor that into your equations.</li>
    <li> My nineteen year old grandson loves this razor. It gives a very close shave and he is thrilled that he won;t have to buy disposable razors anymore. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I wasted 70 years with wet shaving and older electric shavers. This modekldoes well, easy, and clean.Saves hours of wet shave work. I have used for 3 months nearlt every day. Wonderful</li>
    <li> Quite&lt;br /&gt;Fast to charge battery&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;I miss a stand to hold the razor while battery is charged.</li>
    <li> I have owned many Norelco razors and this one didn&#x27;t dissapoint me. It is great to use in the shower and easy to rinse out or clean.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco El. Shavers for the past 45 years and my latest unit of 10 years \\&quot;bit the stubble\\&quot;. I had purchased this Norelco AT810 shaver (locally) and found it gave a very close and smooth shave-DRY! However with a pivoting head assembly, I thought the AT830 could even be better. So I purchased it and found the hard way-Not Better. In fact, it didn&#x27;t shave as close and due to the full pivot action, the interior held stubble that was hard to clean out. I repurchased the AT810 through Amazon and for the past 3 months have been enjoying the great attributes of the AT810...Again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can get 10 years out of this one, I&#x27;ll Really be happy. Love the Lithium Ion battery life...getting 60-70 minutes of shave time on each charge, not bad!!</li>
    <li> For shaver, only Philips...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too light &amp; it doesn&#x27;t feel like very luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;But still, the best choice ever for me</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for many years.  This one is just as good or better than my old one - which died after about 10 years.  It gives a very nice shave, smooth, almost like a razor.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Best electric razor I have ever owned. I really like the ability to use regular shaving cream with it.</li>
    <li> I chose to get an electric razor because you can&#x27;t use manual razor dry. I decided get this because you can use it in shower, but I haven&#x27;t used in shower yet, and you can use this dry. It saves me a lot of time, but i doesn&#x27;t shave as close as manual razors. But for me, it is a better trade off.</li>
    <li> what a disappointment.  i thought that this might work for legs.  no way.  a regular razón can be used wet.  a regular razor takes 5 minutes.  this new product, the Phillips could take all day and then miss alot.  the hairs are just ¨brushed aside¨.  they come back twice as fast¡  a verry poor choice for me.  $down the drain¡</li>
    <li> Owned similar item 25 years ago. this one is much lighter and nicer. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am please with this purchase. I would buy again simply for the price and quality of what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Affordable and reliable, I am yet to reach a point where I am so upset with this product where I just want to throw it against the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done, I am able to quickly shave my desired areas.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof (I never use this in the shower anymore, I did to start, my facial hair ripped out more when it was wet)&lt;br /&gt;Trusted brand and great warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;It says in the manual it can take up to 2 weeks to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; your facial hair to grow properly for this product to be effective. I am on month 5 with this product and I still have use a cheap 3 blade razor to get what this product misses.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life - It only comes with a recommended use time of 45 minutes, I have found that every 3 days I need to charge it. It take me around 8 minutes to shave each day. This isn&#x27;t much of an issue though as it takes 1 hour to completely charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone as long as the users expectations are to still need that cheap disposable to get what is left behind. If you are wanting to have the do it all electric razor and never need a blade again, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> In Chemo, and my 47  year old bear started falling out, along with the little hair I had left.  This does a great job of shaving my whole head.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, many thanks!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean, my husband is very happy with the shaver.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Very good things.  recommended many friends to buy</li>
    <li> Alot like other shavers from Norelco as far as &amp;#34;quality of shave&amp;#34; is concerned. I find myself not using it in the shower as much as I thought I would, but its nice to not worry about it getting wet. I really like the quick charge feature where I can charge it for a couple minutes and what was once a dead shaver gave enough juice to get me though a full shave without losing power.</li>
    <li> Best used on short stubble. Longer whiskers, 1/8&amp;#34; or so, especially if they&#x27;re softer, tend not to get guided into the cutting head. In that case, you&#x27;d be better off using the trimmer blade to cut everything down to a much shorter length, then use the shaver normally to get a clean shave. I get really good results on dry skin, stretched tight. On freshly washed and still moist skin, the shaver drags a bit and requires more time to get a close shave. Overall, it&#x27;s a firmly competent shaver with excellent battery life.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, works well for what it is and the use with water makes for a nice wet shave.</li>
    <li> Love the easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> Gives me a good shave in the shower especially when I use Nivea Shaving Gel. Very smooth.</li>
    <li> Returned it, didn&#x27;t cut beard well at all.</li>
    <li> With this electric shaver I can now finish my morning shave in about 60-seconds.  I think it&#x27;s always best to use an electric shaver if you intend to shave daily or at least every other day.  If you want to grow your beard from Friday morning until Monday morning you are better off sticking to blade &amp; foam/gel.  I expect I can get 2 years out of these shaving blades after that I will likely need to purchase replacement blades.  I wash my shaver, but don&#x27;t use the wet shave method so I don&#x27;t know how well it works in that way.</li>
    <li> Years ago, my first experience with an electric razor was not a good one. I remember razor burns and the feeling of hair being pulled. The experience was damaging enough that for the past decade or so I have been using manual razors such as the Mach 3 or Gillette Fusion.  Replacing cartridges is painful, and I tried to make them last as long possible stretching their point of usefulness. Recently, I calculated my needs and came to the conclusion that my system of shaving with dull blades or sporting the mountain man look was not working for my present situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I shopped and I found the Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor.  Here&#x27;s was I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive - good for the wallet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works very well - smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet - unexpected, but nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean - Just run it it under the faucet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can use for a wet or dry shave - options&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached trimmer for hacking down the beard - convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;low profile charging cord - great for travel and reduced clutter&lt;br /&gt;__________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this Electric Razor successfully changed my mind about E Razors in general. I absolutely love it, and that love came at a very reasonable price.  This product offers a lot of value.  If you are considering switching from a manual razor, this product will change your world.</li>
    <li> I have not used this shaver with water but it does a great job dry. The shave is close and fast. What is really amazing about this shaver is the battery. It charges in about an hour and lasts around three weeks! The shaver seems to run at the same speed right up to the time the battery needs charging again. I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints with this razor. It isn&#x27;t the super high end model, but I didn&#x27;t see any need to go with the AT830 which was about $20 more expensive at the time of my purchase. Overall I am satisfied, I can get a quick dry shave if I need to in the morning or late afternoon, although it won&#x27;t be very close, and wet it is as good as or perhaps closer than a &#x27;safety&#x27; razor, at least for my skin and facial hair, with much less irritation. While it did get slightly more comfortable over the first week or so, I should stress that it was never uncomfortable to use this product. I have no experience with a straight razor or any other system, so I can&#x27;t offer any insight there. The pop-up trimmer is also great for precision, which is obviously lacking with the regular shaving heads, as with every electric shaver ever. The heads take a little effort to pop off, but I suggest you do so regularly for cleaning - while the entire razor /can/ be put under a faucet, that will not properly clean out the heads, and that will cause the blades to dull more quickly, resulting in a less close and more painful shave. Then give it a chance to dry before popping the heads back on.</li>
    <li> This unit glides through heavy stubble like a hot knife through butter! I shave in about half the time it took for my previous older Norelco. I haven&#x27;t used it with shaving jell or cream. I just use it dry or with Lectric Shave if my face feels damp. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> if you want to shave only on the face buy it, but if you want to shave on the neck don&#x27;t use this, this product make me a lot of irritation, i should file a complain</li>
    <li> Our old Norelco finally died after more than 25 years, so we looked to the brand for a new one.  And I say &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; because both my husband and I use the razor.  One of the other reviews says it&#x27;s not for women and I just don&#x27;t agree.  Now, I only use it on my legs and one needs to follow the instructions and use circular strokes.  You can&#x27;t use it with the long strokes on the legs that most women are used to.  It&#x27;s supposed to be a wet/dry razor and hubby did NOT like the wet version.  He felt the heads kept getting clogged with shaving cream and he had spend too much time rinsing the heads.  But he&#x27;s completely happy using it dry.  We love the ability to just rinse it out to clean it.  That&#x27;s a great improvement from our old one.  The fast charging feature is wonderful.  Wonder if we&#x27;ll get another 25 years!I</li>
    <li> I had it for 3 months, then something went wrong, internally, and it would vibrate, but there would be no movement reaching the outside parts.</li>
    <li> This is a good close shaver, my husband said the smoothest his face has felt in years. I think so too.</li>
    <li> I bought a similar Norelco about 7 years ago and rather than wait until it actually failed I bought this one.  I mean 7 years is a long time even for a battery to survive.  I went with a company - Philips Norelco that had served me well.  I felt they had earned my loyalty.</li>
    <li> It does its job just fine.  Shave very well.  Once fully charged, it can run for a long while, a couple of months at least unless you shave a lot.  Like the washable feature, it&#x27;s now a must-have.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor ever used. Good price and smooth action. Easy to clean. Fast charge, easy to handle and use</li>
    <li> Have used &amp;#34;linear&amp;#34; electric shavers for years and really like the rotary. Much quieter and I am enjoying a rediculously long battery life (2 months+ on a charge.) Shave takes a little longer.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that electric razors have come a long way.  This is a great shave!  I&#x27;m as happy as a pig in you-know-what!</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly for his needs, no more cutting himself, he has a rare skin disorder and the razor took care of the problem</li>
    <li> Nice for shaving. A great gift for a man and it also can be used for using under water. Nice and worthy purchase for us.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift to someone. the recipient thinks this shaver is awesome. arrived quick and the price was better than retails.</li>
    <li> as always Norelco is right on</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great product, until it suddenly burnt from the inside.  Yes, the circuit board actually burned.  The only cause is that it was being charged.  Charging the razor is something I did every night, since it is an ELECTRIC RAZOR.  One day, I noticed a burnt plastic smell but figured it was not a major issue.  A few weeks later, it just flat out stopped functioning.  I opened it up and found the circuit board underneath charred to a crisp.  How does an electric razor burn itself?  Bad product.</li>
    <li> this has to be the greatest shaver made. The battery seam to last for ever.The shaver cleans so easy and fast</li>
    <li> I am well pleased with this razor and it met my expectations as i hoped it would. I have no complaints on the performance of it.</li>
    <li> shaver works very well</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my stepson for Christmas. He loved receiving it and before he left I got a chance to take a look myself. It is not too heavy or cumbersome to handle, charges rather rapidly in comparison to other shavers I have experience with and is not very loud when turned on. As for how it shaves, my stepson reports it is a smooth and closest shave he has ever had from an electric razor. He also reports that the procedure for cleaning it is simple and straight forward.</li>
    <li> Exc product easy and fast shave. Nice desing and your skin looks good !! If you use it with shaving gel it&#x27;s even better</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and I chose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The looks are cool and the quality seems good too, but sadly it kind of sucks on doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of wish I&#x27;d keep my older Remington double screen shaver :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it will NOT work while plugged in.</li>
    <li> The biggest draw on this razor was the ability to use wet or dry. I have had a Braun for some time that I have been using periodically however I would alway keep going back to my blades because of the irritation of the electric razor. With the Norelco, using it with shaving gel doesn&#x27;t generate as much irritation. And I can also shave in the shower. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference between wet shaving with the Norelco and blades. Many shaves from a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;Henry</li>
    <li> Very useful and do what are suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;the battery last a lot, and very simple to use&lt;br /&gt;and clean.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it were the blades or what but kept getting the feeling of being &amp;#34;pinched&amp;#34; . may have been pulling the hair but for being new out of the box shouldn&#x27;t be getting that feeling.  overall shave was okay as compared to other razors would have kept it if not for the pinching</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price and holds the charge well. Also very close shave, no complaints so far and don&#x27;t expect any.</li>
    <li> He got this for christmas and loves it so far. Has a close shave. The mustache/side burn trimmer works great. He has gone through a couple razors and hasn&#x27;t liked any of them. But he really likes this one so far</li>
    <li> This product is indeed good. Bought it with an $10 off deal. Serves the purpose. I am using it 3-4 times in a week. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my grandfather and he uses it every morning. It was worth every penny. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> The men in my family have tried a lot of razors.  So far, my son thinks this one is his #1 pick for wet or dry shaving.</li>
    <li> I love the ability to keep this razor clean it shaves well I have used this brand for years and this one is top of the line</li>
    <li> This one is easy to use with water-resistant power on/off button. Also the price is great. My dad loves it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all guys who want a fast, clean cut shave as well as using it wet for when you have more time. Easy to use and very close shave. The battery charge lasts for weeks without affecting performanace. Cleaning is simple and effective.</li>
    <li> Would rate as one a half stars if I could.  Works well as a nose/ear trimmer.  Not great at shaving.  Wimpy cutting and takes excessive amount of time to shave.  Would not recommend anyone buy this one.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy. I don&#x27;t use the wet shave, so I can&#x27;t say to much about that. But it&#x27;s just a razor. No better then the old Norelco I had. I do like the fact you can wash it it with out with water. I had a Braun once that you had to buy a cleaning fluid to clean it.</li>
    <li> At first, everything was great.  Nice, comfortable and clean shave.  After about a month of use, things went South.  It seems I&#x27;ve managed to somehow wear out the cutting heads in a month!  The razor now rips the whiskers out of the skin instead of cutting them.  I&#x27;m back to the disposable, and this fancy pants Norelco razor is gathering dust in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the trouble.</li>
    <li> I got this razor for my dad on his birthday and he loves it! He has been using electric razors for over 30 years so that is saying something. Full charge in an hour is impressive and charge lasts twice as long as the Remington I just bought myself two months ago. Add the flexing heads, wet/dry option, and the quick charge and you have a razor I would have to recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I had to return because it is not made in Holland. I hope my review helps other people to make the decision.</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to but all else was as advertised. I would recommend this and send it as a gift.</li>
    <li> was a gift to my son he said it works okay but didnt get all excited about it but guess most guys dont</li>
    <li> It does the job properly and it charges real quick. Very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: it doesn&#x27;t shave well if you beard is two or three-day grown.</li>
    <li> one of the cutting heads was in bad shape and had to force the one head into place so that it could be used.&lt;br /&gt;a wire was sticking out making it hard to assemble as well as having to almost pry the cutters out.  Ordered new cutting heads.&lt;br /&gt;works fine now.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using Norelco shavers sense the 60s this is the first time i have had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;not happy having to purchase ne cutters befor one shave but still better that razor blades.</li>
    <li> This Razor does the job, but is underpowered and takes longer than my previous razor.  Seems to really struggle on the neckline.  You have to leave it open for hours to dry out when you clean it with water as well.  Not a big deal, that was just not shown.  Hopefully it will last..</li>
    <li> good but hard to keep it plugged in as cord works loose.</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased to replace one that was about five years old. The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as well as the old one, but then I purchased a less expensive one.</li>
    <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco Products for quite some time.....my last one finally gave up after 7 years. Can not use a regular Safety razor on my skin.....break out in server rash. So, until I received my replacement, I had not shaved in almost 2 weeks. Great shave....even better than the ones I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to use in the past. Thank You. Ron</li>
    <li> its okay it does the job but not that great but for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> slow and battery life sucks  I would not but again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift that works perfectly!  Great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Far superior to previous razor that cost more than twice as mucg</li>
    <li> It shaves about the same as my 8 year old Norelco 7180xl but runs slower, it even uses the same blades.  After just 35 days of use, it suddenly will not hold a charge for more than a few days.  I got creative and figured out how to fix my old Norelco by replacing the worn out battery with a new Sanyo eneloop battery and it now works as good as new.  So this shaver will be used as a backup only.    Since it has been over 30 days since I bought it, I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon.  Clearly, other people have had a better experience, I have been a loyal Norelco user for over 40 years or so and this is first one that failed on me and is the worst and cheapest engineered one I have bought.    It is frustrating that it will not shave when plugged in.  When it is out of charge, happens after just a few days of use, you have to plug it in for several minutes before it has enough charge to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these now, one for my brother and one for my husband.  They are a bit older but work wonderfully!  Both men have no complaints and use them almost daily.  If you want something to take in the shower, spend the extra money because this one is better outside of the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought for Grandsons Birthday,his first Norelco,. I have had many over the years great shavers.</li>
    <li> I purchased the AT810 five months ago and like it very much. It gives a close, comfortable shave. I use an inexpensive shaving cream (Barbasol) and it works just great. Would recommend it to a friend.  Update: I have now had the AT819 (4100) for 13 months and still like it. It abruptly stopped charging two days ago. I just got off the phone with Norelco and they are sending me a new one by FedEx.  Kudos to Norelco - they do stand by the 24 month warranty! And the customer service rep was very nice, and easy to understand.</li>
    <li> Shaving –&lt;br /&gt;In general it is relatively good. I don’t have shaving ‘burns’ from using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, on some tricky contour, the blade cut seems to have the reach to cut the very short growth and need a few tries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing/cleaning -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just rinse and brush. It’s that easy.&lt;br /&gt;If the quality is the same as my previous Philips shaver, I expect it to last me for years.&lt;br /&gt;You can also dismantle the blades for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life &amp; Charging-&lt;br /&gt;I used it daily for about 1 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Charge for 1 hour use for 50 mins. This is one of the better ones. Don’t settle for shaver that needs 8 hours charge for 40 mins of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, 1 charge last me a couple of months for me. Your mileage will vary depending on your use.&lt;br /&gt;That’s very good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the charger has universal voltage. I am using 220V to charge without any issue for 9 months already with a travel adaptor.&lt;br /&gt;This is very useful for travel albeit I have a smaller shaver for travel.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this daily and is pleased with this. He likes the availability to use it in the shower or dry in front of the mirror and the simplicity of cleaning it.</li>
    <li> Had Norelco shavers all my life and the AT810 model was no exception. Close shave, no irratition, easy water clean up &amp; long battery life.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, he liked it has had no problems with it, was delivered fast. Would recommend the shaver, good price as well</li>
    <li> This was a best purchase i made. Its working as described. Very smooth on skin and a clean closer shave. Absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to see I can use this for nearly 2 weeks for about 5 minutes each day and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet. It&#x27;s super easy to clean too, just pop off the top and hang under running water. Everything is nicely sealed so I have no worries about using this in the shower. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the purchase. Great razor for the money.</li>
    <li> recommended expected I taste is good price and good workmanship, the cost is worth it, fast entry time, well packed</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my adult son (who is very picky).  His wife called to say that he absolutely loves it and uses it everyday.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just follow the instructions and it works as desired.  I  have tried to use mine in the shower and it works but it tends to be sticky on my skin if I go over it more than once.  If I wait 15 min. after I have showered it does a nice shave and doesn&#x27;t let you down.  I clean mine often, just in the sink and have found no problems.  The pop up razor does a good shave for the neck and odd spots.  I use a disposable for some spots like my jaw line and adams apple, just to get a little closer.  The battery lasts for long time and does as it says it should.</li>
    <li> Pretty good razor. Just a few comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery Lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;Very quiet&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;All-weather&amp;#34; razor&lt;br /&gt;Head is very flexible&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in hand&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is awful and takes too many angles and sweeps to get the appropriate cut&lt;br /&gt;Razor heads sometimes take too many passes to pick up certain hairs (very rare)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, I just wish the trimmer did it&#x27;s job appropriately.</li>
    <li> Love having the ability to shave either wet or dry. Gets close to the skin but is exceedingly comfortable. I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a long time, but for the ease of use and convenience, you can&#x27;t beat this electric razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. I purchased this as a gift and the recipient can not say enough good things about this razor!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with razor, was about to give up on these type of razors.  Have not used the razor for wet shaving yet but for now I have no complaints, glad I didn&#x27;t returned to the straight blade...thanks!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my son.  It seems to do the job.  He is a teenager, and doesn&#x27;t have the stiff beard as of yet.  It appears to be lightweight and well made.</li>
    <li> My husband is happy with this. He says it works great.  His only complaint is the blades have dulled quickly.</li>
    <li> Great everything I thought it would be</li>
    <li> came quick,works very good,very satisfied with it.don&#x27;t have any more words to say Good,good,good.good. All done,used up all words.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> My husband said to give Norelco AT810 Powertouch a 3-1/2 stars rating but your site didn&#x27;t have that.  So, I clicked on 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I owned an older norelco model for over 10 years and only changed blades once. served me very well. only ditched it because wife messed up blades and replacements run as much as this new norelco. so i said goodby and welcome to the new one. but what a disappointment! it felt less substantial from the very first second. the shave is a joke. I go over the same area 10 times in circles, etc &amp; all the stuff per instruction until I start getting razor burn and it still didn&#x27;t get all the stubs off. I did it for over 6 weeks now because it says you need to give it 4 weeks for the skin to get used to, etc. no change! will send it back. too bad amazon only gives full returns up to 6 weeks! guess I lost out here and wont be that patient with the next products!</li>
    <li> Although not as close a shave as with other razors, it is just what I needed with the irregular contours of my face.  I was amazed with how long the battery keeps it charge.</li>
    <li> Nice to have, and save on buying razors so often.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with razor gillette mach3/fusion for many many years,I was just tired of razor,so I bought this after my braun cruzer 4 which was not happy at all,anyway, I did not like this one at beginning too,I couldn&#x27;t just get clean shave,but after 3-4 weeks use i just start feel comfortable and get the shave I want.&lt;br /&gt;( I shave my face everyday sometimes 2-3 time)&lt;br /&gt;its easy to use after while and easy to clean,I would say go for it.</li>
    <li> I have not used the lamp enough yet to review it. Many reviews I read recounted very short bulb life. we will see how this one does.  G.</li>
    <li> Since it is my first electric Razor, Can&#x27;t really compare to other,&lt;br /&gt;But If I rate it, Price 5 star, product 4 star, it takes longer to shave than the razor..</li>
    <li> Pros:  it it very quiet. Also it gave a fairly close shave on the sides of the face area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Major skin burns especially in neck areas. My brother has this and followed his directions and others (do not press hard, try to follow mfg directions of circular motions with light pressure, etc), but still couldn&#x27;t prevent it. Then I found out that my brother always has to use this razor with shaving creme.......  Can&#x27;t say that I got comfortable with the balance of the unit - can&#x27;t use the circular motion on a number of areas (chin line, upper lip, sideburn edging, etc), but I also had it for less than a week so I&#x27;m sure I would have developed techniques as I used it longer. Returned it. Can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gifted to a friend and he really liked it. I use the same, but an older version which I bought a couple of years earlier</li>
    <li> Easy to use and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient and light weight. Easy to clean. Easy to charge. Recommending it to many friends.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only used this a few times but it&#x27;s performed well so far.  It provides a nice, safe, close shave for my dad who is in a nursing home.  Assuming it holds up and continues to shave him well, I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> -Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  +Very resistant to corrosion (derp).&lt;br /&gt;  +Long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;  +Ergonomic to work with for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;  +Very simple to charge and shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  -Initial price, maintenance price.&lt;br /&gt;  -Not a very reliable close shave.&lt;br /&gt;  -Must clean out regularly between swipes just like a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;  -Tedious to reassemble parts that like to flop out.&lt;br /&gt;  -Hokey power cable jack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask me that the razor cuts hair I say yes.  If you ask does it shave?  I would say no.  I am one of those guys who go old school and use a traditional straight razor and buckskin strop if I really need to get a shave.  Most of the time I look like a dirtball with a very large beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be fine for a quick cut of face hair to get maybe a &amp;#34;2 days without shaving&amp;#34; stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the time and money involved just buy a straight razor and equipment to maintain it.  It will serve you far better than this gimmicky thing.  Far less money and time for upkeep as well.</li>
    <li> Good electric razor, it is not the best in the market but very good value for its cost. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He likes the smooth shave and says he&#x27;s glad I got this for him.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of shaving of the hair, you have to go over it a few times. I have two razors and this one cuts hair but doesn&#x27;t cut it enough and the small flip-up blade is pretty ineffective.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it, and I love the way his face feels after he uses it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  He has mid-weight facial hair.  He said that it shaves as a good as a razor and is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> always use Philips razor,it&#x27;s great.Price is lower than those in supermarket.A good experience.Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this at all .  I have a 6 year old norelco which was cheeper that does a better job.</li>
    <li> The AT810 is easily the best electric razor I have ever used (rotary or foil).  The first shave was fast and smooth and very clean - I&#x27;ve only used it to dry shave so far, and can&#x27;t comment on its wet shave abilities yet.</li>
    <li> CUTS CLOSE IN THE SHOWER OR OUT. EASY TO CLEAN FEELS GOOD IN MY HAND. RECHARGES QUICKLY AND HAS A LONG LASTING BATTERY</li>
    <li> Good value for money - came with an American 2 pin plug (how dumb was that) so had to buy an adaptor .</li>
    <li> It met my expectations and is doing a good job.  My previous Norelco was probably five or six years old at least and was requiring recharging often.  The new razor is lighter but is performing well.</li>
    <li> One of longest worst shaves I HAVE EVER HAD WITH AN electricrazor. This is following instructions and using as directed for 21 days</li>
    <li> I chose this electric razor because of the mostly positive reviews.  My other Phillips Norelco  was worn&lt;br /&gt;out after about 10 years of use and I needed a new one.  I picked this one also because I could use it&lt;br /&gt;as a wet shaver.  Ironically I have not used this feature yet.  I like that the battery life is so long and&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t need to be re-charged often.  The razor gives a fairly close shave and works well.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver. It works well but not as good as some others. It is not spinning fast enough and is slower than other similarly priced shavers. However, it is very easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this razor from an old, cheap electric razor and this thing is incredible. It takes only a few swipes across my face and I have a shave as smooth my manual razors, including my straight razor. It is super comfortable and it contours really well with all the movement of the heads. The pop up trimmer also works really well on my sideburns. I have not tried using the aquatec part, mostly because I don&#x27;t want the water to dull it faster. I highly recommend this razor, it is worth the price, especially with the 2.5 year warranty.</li>
    <li> A PIECE OF JUNK.  IT WON&#x27;T CUT ONE HAIR OFF A BALD MAN.  IT IS TWO MONTHS OLD, I JUST CLEANED IT AND IT STILL WON&#x27;T CUT ANYTHING.  TWEEZERS ARE FASTER.</li>
    <li> My husband had this razor before and replaced it when it stopped working with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;He is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 months now, and it&#x27;s good.  As the instructions states it takes a few weeks for your skin to adjust, it irritated my skin at first, now my skin has gotten used to it.  The one bad thing that I do not like from this shaver is that it does not do a good job with removing the hairs from my neck to chin area; but I love the fact that it can get wet.  I have submerged it in water and it still works.</li>
    <li> People have crazy expectations for razors. is it perfect? no. but it is by far the most comfortable shaver i have ever had. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not designed for shaving legs. After repeated passes over the same area, some hair was still left behind. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First I was very conflicted with whether I should give this 4 or 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have a full beard, and I purchased this razor mainly for the trimmer in the back in order to maintain my beard. My previous phillips of 6 years trimmer broke, and this had the best reviews so I decided to go for it. Never found much about the trimmer in the reviews which is too bad so hopefully this will help someone like me. Essentially the trimmer pops up on the back, and the natural way to use it is to press down on your skin and slide up your skin. However, in the natural holding angle, doing this forces the trimmer to close. So I&#x27;m constantly battling against this thing closing when I try to use it! It&#x27;s very frustrating. If I go the opposite direction ie pull instead of push, there is no issue. However, this is not what feels natural to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: When you actually get to shaving,it&#x27;s AMAZING! Like I said previously, I&#x27;ve had an older model for many years. It&#x27;s hard to express, but just using this one not only gives you a nice shave, which feels great, but the actual act of shaving feels amazing too. They really upgraded how it contours to your face. I have a very large adams apple which has always been a pain to shave, but not with this guy. I was very annoyed with the trimmer issue, but after using this feature, I almost gave it a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you&#x27;re wanting to really utilize the trimmer maybe look at a different model which doesn&#x27;t close on you. If you&#x27;re wanting to use the 3 spinning razors primarily, this is amazing.</li>
    <li> SHAVER WORKS WELL, BUT DISSAPOINTED FOR NOT HAVING A STAND TO CHARGE THIS SHAVER INSTEAD OF JUST LAYING IT DOWN.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric shaver after considering 3 others. What attracted me to this one was the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have used twice a week now for 2 months and it does not disappoint. I get a close shave with no&lt;br /&gt;ripping or tearing at my beard&amp;#60; also no skin rash after using it.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband and I personally don&#x27;t have experience using a men&#x27;s shaver, but he uses it.</li>
    <li> This thing is great...the best $60 I ever spent. I&#x27;m 51 years old and had never found success with an electric razor. Man was I sick of shaving cream and blades. I tried this razor, and threw away the shaving cream. What a pleasure to have a clean shave every day in less than five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about a year now, and I think I&#x27;ve plugged it in to charge it 4 or 5 times. I couldn&#x27;t have imagined a more perfect electric razor.</li>
    <li> It is a good electric razor, but you can find some at least as good for half the price, even from Norelco itself.</li>
    <li> It is very good product and deliver on time. The only issue is it is a little harder to shave above the neck...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. He loves it and retired his old one. He said it shaves really clean. good product.</li>
    <li> Razor is good, but you can&#x27;t use it with a cord, so if, while you&#x27;re shaving, the charge runs out, then you have to charge it for 5 minutes to continue shaving. So far that&#x27;s only happened once, and I finished shaving with my old razor instead of charging this one for 5 minutes. Luckily I still have my old one, but the shaving heads fall out because the head holder failed, so you have to have it pressed up against your face, or the whole thing falls apart. That&#x27;s why I ordered this new one.</li>
    <li> Gives good shave. Been using it for 3 months now and just now have to charge it. Not sure if this helps or not but I use a pre-electric conditioner and after shave. No razor burns</li>
    <li> Still rolling on, even with the original blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about a month out from transitioning from high-end blades (I was spending enough in a year to buy one of these).  I use JackBlack&#x27;s Beard Lube with it right after a shower, and it results in a fairly close, irritation-free shave. There are the occasional stubborn hairs that won&#x27;t stand up, but that&#x27;s no really the razor&#x27;s fault.  The battery life is excellent (I keep it in my gym bag for 3-4 days without needing a charge), and the trimmer is also very effective.  I&#x27;m not going back to blades anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the AT810 Norelco. It does not give a close shave and it is much heavier than my old Norelco. I will not buy another one.</li>
    <li> my husband loves his new shaver, it holds the charge all week and travels along with him on all his business trips</li>
    <li> I bought this as an upgrade from my previous HQ6950 Philips razor and despite I was very pleased with my old shaver, now I can tell the difference with this upgrade. This razor cuts closer and smoother, so I don´t need to pass several times the shaver over my skin and I get less irritated. Having the option for using it on wet and with foam is a plus and the charging time is pretty fast and battery life seems to be longer between charges. Overall it´s is a great product that worth its price. So far I have no complains about it.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed my new electric razor which is capable of either using while in the shower under running water, or just lathering up at the sink and shaving there. It does a most wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Its a good product I had developed a rash from a blade and this was recommended its good but takes some getting use to and in some areas my rash got worse cause you have to learn how to use this with a circular motion and not hold it in one spot too long. I have gone back to blades at times while i get the hang of it.  There is nothing wrong with the product i can see just driver error so to speak. I was going lightly as your suppose to but then i felt like in some spots like chin i should hold it their longer and that was what made the rash worse their. I think with a rash gone and some more practice this would be a good product. It works fine and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for years and it is very good&lt;br /&gt;long battery hour and easy to carry,  !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Decided to get this for my twin boys who are starting to shave.  A razor blade seemed risky so why not an electric.  This has worked great for them - now no fear of razor cuts and they are clean shaven.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed when shaving i had to go over several times to get all the whiskers&lt;br /&gt;and the new razor does not cut as close as the old one.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco&#x27;s for years this the only one that i have had problems with.&lt;br /&gt;Still  like the product it is well made and lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks Paul</li>
    <li> Not close at all ....even with wet shave...Back to Remington R4 foil .....I&#x27;m stuck with this one for now..........Much better choices..</li>
    <li> He likes it!!  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. Likes that he can use it either dry or with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I have had a Norelco electric shaver for at least the last 40 years....my last one was not aquatic but served the purpose ....the AT810&lt;br /&gt;I purchased recently seems to hold its charge for over a week and the feature of allowing daily washing does improve the quality of each shave</li>
    <li> This is my second razor, but my first Phillips. I was a bit worried about the 3 head type as my last was a different style (the electric shavers were straight across instead of circular</li>
    <li> I have always used a vibrating razor supplemented with a conventional wet shave maybe once a week. The Phillips rotating cutter mechanism was therefore new - to me. I was immediately taken with its quiet whir as opposed to the aggressive buzz of my old reciprocating unit, as well as the ability of the head to conform to my facial contours. But the real surprise was its energy efficiency. My old razor battery held its charge only for three or four days; the new one lasts at least three weeks. (Both are charged via a plug-in cord.) Further, the Philips gives a clearly better shave: much faster, with far fewer little tufts of yesterday&#x27;s growth left behind. I haven&#x27;t had the guts to try its wet-shave abilities, as in a shower, but it seems not to mind its daily wash under the tap. It may be rather silly to get all excited about an every-day chore, but I&#x27;m actually enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been using the Norelco 8883XL dry shaver a more than 5  years&lt;br /&gt;bought the AT810 just recently and :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.it takes much more time (about twice the time) ,engine seems a bit slow&lt;br /&gt;2.works better wet then dry (used edge shaving gel) but still slow&lt;br /&gt;3. no charing percentage indicator&lt;br /&gt;4.comes without a bag</li>
    <li> I flirted with this one and more expensive model.. he loves this one just the same if not more I am sure. Great value.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT DEAL</li>
    <li> Did not last a year. Bought in December of 2013. Died October 2014. Worked fine till it died</li>
    <li> Excellent - husband loves it. Easy to clean and does a great job shaving.</li>
    <li> Have been Norelco user foe 25-30 years.Every 2-4 years the current model dies and I upgrade to the &amp;#34;Latest and Greatest&amp;#34; model after passing out over the price.Last investment was 3-d ,articulated heads etc, for several hundred dollars. It has done a poor job and has irritated my skin since day 1. It died 6 days ago but was under an extended [register on line 2.5 year Warranty, 1 month from expiring].As it was taking a week to replace I ordered the cheapest Norelco from the 2 day wonder Amazon. To my pleasure it arrived and was a Model I had 4 models ago which I loved.I charged and used on my 4 day beard----BEST SHAVE I HAVE HAD SINCE that model  DIED A LONG TIME AGO---QUICKEST, NO SKIN IRRITATION ETC ETC.Just goes to show you the $&#x27;s you spend do not necessarily get you the best product.</li>
    <li> Good for basic use. Not perfectly clean after shaving.</li>
    <li> Used for travel and at work site. Very convenient but had to use electric shave lubricant and the side burn cutter is only adequate.</li>
    <li> I received this Sept 4, plugged it in that evening and unplugged it in the AM, used it and haven&#x27;t even recharged it in over 1 month, now I don&#x27;t usually have much facial hair, but I do shave every day and as of this AM (Oct 14th), it still works and the light saying I only have five minutes of charge time left hasn&#x27;t lit up.  My old razor was a Remington, which worked fine, didn&#x27;t work in water though.  This is so easy to clean, just flip open the razor head (it stays attached), and run it under the water.  I don&#x27;t normally use shaving cream, but I have used it about once a week and it works great.  You probably won&#x27;t get 5-6 weeks on a charge like I do, as it takes me only 1-2 minutes to shave (unless I use shaving cream), but I am very impressed with the battery life.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I charge it for an hour or so and then I can use it for more than a month without a recharge.  When it&#x27;s getting close to needing a recharge, it starts flashing an amber light to let me know.  Best of all, I can still shave when the warning light comes on, so if I happen to have been on my way to work, I&#x27;m still able to shave when I get the warning.  My previous razor let me know that it was running low by running too slow to use.  This device is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Works great so far I use it for touch up and shave with a traditional razor at the beginning and end of the week. Not saying the razor doesn&#x27;t do the job it is fine I have always had to shave this way. I have never found an electric razor that shaves better than my old safety razor. If you are looking for a good/reasonably priced razor this one is good to go.</li>
    <li> This is a solid shaver, and works quite well.  That being said, it takes me forever to shave with it.  The shaver is able to cut most of my whiskers, but there are a few that always escape it.  I need to continually go over them, stretching the skin on my face and contorting in various ways to get the cutters to finally trim them.  It seems to take forever.</li>
    <li> This is my second razor (the previous was Braun) and I lasted about a year. This is quite different to the Braun regarding its mechanism is very quiet and good shave. I hope I last longer which is very important to me.</li>
    <li> I am not kidding about the title. I ask myself, \\&quot;why did I not buy an electric razor sooner!?\\&quot; I would hear things like, \\&quot;they don&#x27;t shave close enough,\\&quot; or \\&quot;they irritate your skin.\\&quot; Those people have never tried this razor apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally just got done using this for the first time (updates to come) and I am blown away by the quality of the shaver. I got a closer shave than I was able to get from my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor (also a very good razor). This was done dry and without washing my face first (not recommended, though superb it was)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, very impressed overall. Quality materials, genius design, lithium battery, super convenient, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions before use. It will recommend that you charge the razor for an hour before use. It will also give you good tips on quick cleaning so that the razor will remain optimal for the life of the razor head. Recommends you change the razor head annually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be important to note that my skin does not get irritated as easily as some.</li>
    <li> The shaver works as well or better than most.  I don&#x27;t experience the tugging or catching that I have with other shavers.  This seems to cut more and pull less.  I wish it had come with a stand.  It is a real pain to have it lying about in the the way and bumping around the counter.  A cheap plastic stand would probably have cost the manufacturer and few cents.  A cheap price to prevent a daily irritant on the part of the consumer.</li>
    <li> could be whole lot faster , slow one speed Thought the brand would have been better quality , would not recomend waste of money</li>
    <li> This razor was not really worth the price tag. I have used razors previously and they were much more comfortable than this ! I will definitely have to replace this piece of crap with another one. !</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son and he loves it. He uses it to shave his head and said it provides a close, clean shave. Easy to maintain, too.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had an electric razor for many years. Norelco has always been on the top of my list. Very smooth.</li>
    <li> Item works well, gives a close and comfortable dry shave.  Was exactly what I ordered, and arrived on time.  Would purchase it again if the need arose.</li>
    <li> He said it irritated his skin so back to razors for now! Also it would be more appealing if it came with a charging base.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean. Controls well placed.  But it&#x27;s not as good at actually shaving the hair as I had hoped.  You have to keep shaving in a circular motion 3-5 times to actually get a decent shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my father. He liked it a lot, but after 10 months, can&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a new electric shaver, one which did not require frequent recharging.  We found this shaver and it has exceeded our expectations.  My husband is very happy and use sit every day.  We would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> The Norelco AT810 cordless razor is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever used. It shaves nearly as close as a blade (seriously), runs smoothly and surprisingly quietly, cleans easily, and holds a charge for nearly a month of daily shaving!  It has all the features one one would ever need, including a pop-up trimmer that actually works, yet it is very light and easy to use. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this thing, I thought it would be the best shaver I could buy. I&#x27;m a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t have quite the expectations I had for it. I get a close and clean shave around the face, which I love about it, but not so close around the neck area. The little razor that pops on the side doesn&#x27;t cut very good when I use it for grooming. I have to go back to my old razor for all the missed hairs this thing failed to get. I love how its water proof but cleaning out the hairs that  get trapped in the machine is a real pain in the @$$.</li>
    <li> I chose Norelco because I was happy with my old razor that broke after 12 years.  (I don&#x27;t know if that is long or short for a razor to last with only having bought one set of replacement heads a couple of years ago.)  However, this new razor gave me a closer shave from the very first shave!</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor to shave easily.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;its battery is amazing, It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Its materials are good and its shape is nice.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this for a year now and it provides a good shave and the battery life is good (around a week between charging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Good razor but leaks hair trimmings. Every time I use it I then have to clean hair trimming off the counter. (And I&#x27;m not referring to the flip-out trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no travel case included.</li>
    <li> Phillips wet/dry razors give the quickest, closest and most comfortable shaves.  There&#x27;s never any skin irritation and clean up is always easy.</li>
    <li> It does a great job - good smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;This is my third Norelco-it  is the best one yet !</li>
    <li> It works well.  Still causes some razor burn/irritation sometimes, but its definitely better than most non electric razors that I have used.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY DAD - HIS NORELCO IS ABOUT 30 YEARS OLD AND IS FINALLY STARTING TO WEAR OUT.  HE LOVES NORELCO AND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS MODEL!</li>
    <li> Electric razor as promised.  Good product for the price.  Christmas gift.  I have used Phillips/Norelco razors for years and got one for my dad.  Came in good packaging and shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> I really like the close shave and the quiet operation. The battery seems to last a long time too. I&#x27;m not sure about the waterproof aspect. I used it in the shower and it works just fine. I noticed that a little water seemed to infiltrate the handle area near the bottom. I suppose it&#x27;s designed for wet use at a sink?  In any case, for the money it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Christmas gift and he loved it. He said he couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth his face was after first use. Very pleased. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  It is easy to use &amp; clean.  Highly recommend as a gift for any man.</li>
    <li> Grate shave, long  lasting battery, easy to clean.  It is all I expected in a shaver, you need not spend more.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have very thick  beard so even after wet shaving with this I look like I haven&#x27;t shaved at all. I have even tried lectric shave to help the hairs stand up to no avail. I believe it is made worse by the fact I have pale skin and dark hair thus it makes my stubble show even more. It is bad especially on my neck area where I have to pass over and over to get the stubble. This leaves my neck red and irritated. I know your suppose to let your skin get used to it for a couple of weeks but its been 4 months and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work due to the efficiency and convenience of use. I do suspect if my beard was less dense and lighter I would get a smooth shave. Back to wet shaving with a razor for me , I just cant go to work sporting a 10 o&#x27;clock shadow and an irritated red neck.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the bad revues are about. I have had cancer surgery on my face an am really careful when shaving with a blade to get a close shave. This razor is unbelievable.  No worries and a close shave. Really different from the old way but still easy to get use to. SUPER PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed that the 3 cutting heads don&#x27;t &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; better  when shaving the jaw bone and neck area. Like all the other Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had, the cutting blades are a pain to clean out using a brush.I have not tried using running water to wash out the blades. ( doesn&#x27;t sound like the best idea to me )</li>
    <li> I had bought this razor because the one I had broke (wouldn&#x27;t turn on sometimes, wouldn&#x27;t turn off other times). It still does the trick. Cuts smooth, takes getting used to if you&#x27;re coming from manual razors, and you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Description is correct, do not need to repeat it all, nothing bad, just couldn&#x27;t find the protective cap that should be included... recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been Buying Norelco Shavers all my life.This one is one of the Best ones Ive bought.The Battery life is Awesome Only Charge it once every 13 days for an average 4 minute shave a day.Im Satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My husband was very disappointed with this razor. He ordered it to replace a trusty Norelco he&#x27;d used for years without incident, but the new one fell apart after barely three months. He removed the top to clean it one day and can&#x27;t get it to reattach because the plastic hinges snapped off. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> This machine did not work good for his skin. It created a lot of bumps ice pick style. We will keep searching for the best solution.</li>
    <li> According to Amazon, I purchased this razor in February.  It is now the 20th of May, and it is still operating on the FIRST CHARGE.  Granted, I don&#x27;t use this electric razor daily, but I use it at least weekly.  It&#x27;s nice to know I can charge my razor, and store it in the car for that unusual occurrence requiring a quick shave, and not have to worry that the unit being drained during storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor (and the good prices at Amazon).</li>
    <li> The combination of Norelco Aquatec and Nivea Shaving Gel gives the closest shave to a blade I have ever had, but with much more comfort and convenience.  Use it in the shower, and pre-heat the razor head in hot water before use.  Several folks have complained that you cannot run the razor while it is plugged in, but 1) who wants a cord in the shower? 2) It flashed an orange LED when the battery is low so you know when its time to re-charge 3) In an emergency 3 minutes charge will power it enough for a shave.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice so far, but, I think I&#x27;m going to like it more and more each day.</li>
    <li> Only 4 Stars because nothing is ever prefect but this is a darn good shave for a reasonable price. Much quieter than I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old philips norelco razor, and so far so good.  He says it shaves great.  Maybe even a little better than his old one, which he loved.  It&#x27;s waterproof and holds a good charge.</li>
    <li> My Norelco Nivea razor died (battery wouldn&#x27;t hold charge).  I wrote the company/chat session and tried to get the battery replaced, but they said it was too dangerous.  I hate changing razors, its never good, but this one has worked OK.  For the price I get a decent shave that is actually pain free.  maybe it was time to upgrade.  the wet vs. dry thing doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good, the blades get filled with anything longer than 1 days growth.  now that I think of it, I&#x27;ve charged it 1 time since I bought it a month ago, so that&#x27;s gotta be worth something.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. The first one fell to pieces. The replacement wouldn&#x27;t charge. The 3rd one wouldn&#x27;t charge either. We bought a Remington.</li>
    <li> She says it works well on her legs, although not as close as a razor shave, but preferable to all the cuts! She does say do not use on under arms or private areas! I can contest to this from the blood curdling scream I heard coming from the bathroom. All in all, she is happy with it for daily leg shaving.</li>
    <li> Since this was not for me, all I can really say is that my dad loves this brand and he was not disappointed with this particular model.  I think some of the other reviews give a lot of great information that are more detailed than this.  All I can say is that my dad loves it and says it works great.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband for Xmas.  He had a Remington and did not like it because it did such a poor job and I kept by replacement heads and still did not do much better.  So I bought the Norelco and it does a really good close shave and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I started shaving....well it was many decades ago!  Started with a Norelco shaver.  Never did seem to give me a really close shave.  Over the years have gone back and forth between blade and electric hoping that one day an electric would give me a shave that is close to that of a blade.  Must say that my first shave with this razor impressed me.  First it was gentle and quiet especially compared to my Remington foil shaver.  And while it is not entirely as close a shave as a blade it is very, very close.  Alas, I have lost most of the hair on top of head and finally gave up with the comb overs.  Between barber trips every two weeks get a bit of stubble on top and neither my blade nor my electric would take that done.  But this razor does.  Of course to keep it giving me a good shave I will need to replace the head every year or so and that is not cheap.  But then neither are razor blades.  An electric is so convenient and I am pleased to have finally found one that actually seems to come close to a blade shave.  We will see as the months progress and should it decline in performance I will be back to add to this review.</li>
    <li> worked but had to shave over several times would not purchase again</li>
    <li> This Aquatec Electric Razor works very well. It is easy to use and gives a nice, close shave every time!</li>
    <li> Hey, it&#x27;s a solid razor.. It does work in water, which is a nice, yet odd feature. I never shave my face other than when it&#x27;s dry, but this little guy will power through wet and also shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and cuts close. I love the back side edge up flap as I call it.. Replaced my old razor with this and no complaints in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a super thick beard or anything so I can&#x27;t vouch for that, but for my little scrawny yet respectable beard it gets&#x27;er done just fine. Cheers</li>
    <li> great razor, using it during a deployment to afghan when hot water wasn&#x27;t around/ during winter months. Does the job!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Panasonic.  At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  It&#x27;s very quiet.  I push down on the heads with my finger and it didn&#x27;t even turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it works very well.  I can go 2 days without shaving, and works good.  My old shaver couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> This razor was advertised as giving good shaving performance.  It lived up to these claims.  It does take a bit more pre - shave preparation to keep my face from feeling irritated.</li>
    <li> The razor, durable, affordable, Charging soon，and Can be used for a long time，So it Is a very suitable products for me.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s first electric razor, and he&#x27;s thrilled with it.  He has sensitive skin, and this razor does not irritate his skin, and leaves it soft and smooth.  It gives him a close shave, in or out of the shower.  Battery lasts quite a while after a charge.  He takes it to the gym in the mornings, since he gets ready for work there.  Portable, easy to use, and we have not had to change the blades.  No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDSON,SEVENTEEN,HE SAID IT WAS AWSOME,THAT MAKES ME HAPPY  HE WAS OVER DURING XMAS AND USED IT,I AM VER PLEASED</li>
    <li> This was for out son who&#x27;s a fan of Norelco shavers. He was very pleased, and this was a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> My husband says he is is so grateful to finally have a razor that works really well. A great Christmas gift. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I needed a new razor and had success with Norelco in the past.  I read reviews about current models and selected the AT810.  I found the best (and a good) price on Amazon, the product was delivered promptly and I have used it daily with great satisfaction.  The fact that it charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time in one of the reasons I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> Does a clean shave? we&#x27;ll almost.. Slightly difficult under the chin area, but it does a close shave, battery life is good, charge time is almost 1hr. very light weight - good price too..</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all guys who want a fast, clean cut shave as well as using it wet for when you have more time.</li>
    <li> My husband always used disposable razors, this was his first electric razor ever. He loves it, it runs wonderfully and his shave is so close, like they say &amp;#34; his face is as soft as a babys bottom&amp;#34;. definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Gives a pretty good shave, and handles long hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super cleanable&lt;br /&gt;Infinite battery (or close to it)&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality is so-so: Not super close or even&lt;br /&gt;Shave takes longer than I would like.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I can use it with later and in the shower also.  Excellent cutting qualities and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gilette razor blades my entire life. Now I am 21 years old and this is the first electric shaver I have bought. I got it at Walmart last week, and I remember I spent like 20 minutes deciding between this one and the 830 one which was 20 dollars more expensive. The only difference I found between the two was the fact that the 830 has pivoting heads, and I honestly did not know how that made any difference. It would be bias for me to say this is the best electric shaver ever, since it is my first one, but I am completely satisfied with it. It did not irritate my skin (maybe just a little for 5 minutes but then it was gone, not bad), since it is cordless I could shave while watching TV from my couch, and it was very close to the skin, it gave me the same result I got with the razors. So speaking for myself, if you want to spend 20 more dollars on the 830, go ahead and do it, but I did not and I am glad with that because I used those 20 dollars to buy me a jacket ^_^. I will be updating after a while to se if I got the same results over and over again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 Norelco razors, the last one having lasted me 16 years, and technically is still trimming away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first razor I owned was a hand me down from my father when I was a little shaver.  It lasted a year or two before I dropped it into the toilet, which ended it&#x27;s otherwise faithful life.  The replacement, a nearly identical model has served me well for hte last 16 years, but has recently begun shorting out intermittently.  Both models were plugins, non-battery models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point I also owned a 24$ Remington cordless, which as it were, was also fabulous and honestly gave the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from a rotary.  However, the battery on it lasted just under a year ( you get what you pay for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, hte battery experience left a bad taste in my mouth so I decided to try the AT810.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it only operated when unplugged.  This is unfortunate, but acceptable.  I must have read the description for the non-aqua model that DOES allow for corded operation and then bought the wrong one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I gather that Norelco doesn&#x27;t allow this model to be plugged in while operating to avoid electrocution lawsuits.  Nanny-state at it&#x27;s most ridiculous.  I don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t have the convenience of a water cleanable model paired with a plugin operation.  I&#x27;m not a moron, I&#x27;m not going to  plug it in and hop in the shower with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the heads on this model pivot well and offer very nice contact with the face contours compared to my dated outgoing model.  It&#x27;s a nice improvement in that area.  The shave out of the box before the heads have even broken in is also fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this is as expected a very good bang for the buck razor, I just wish Philips/Norelco would provide a model that offered corded operation and water friendly features for those of us who are not morons.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Norelco is the best! I have used them for years&lt;br /&gt;but I like this one the best. I hope it last a long time.</li>
    <li> The shaver is not perfect, it doesn&#x27;t shave every single bit of your beard, but I&#x27;m really satisfied. Good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> The AT810 Shaver is very comfortable to use and gives a decent shave.  I have had razors (some Norelco) that shave closer and have more power.  This one does a nice job for the money.  I was disappointed to see it was made in China, even though it was advertised as being from the Netherlands.  I was trying to avoid still another Chinese product and that was one of the deciding factors originally.  So far, the razor has held a charge very well.  I&#x27;m not sure I would buy this again or recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It works competently and better than the Arcitec razor I had earlier. It would have been nice if there was a warning light when the battery needs recharging. This is a necessity and should not be an extracost option.</li>
    <li> First off I am a dark-skinned black male. This means my facial hair does not behave the way I have seen on the boxes or reviews from other shavers, but this product is awesome! I am hyper-allergic to razors as I found out the hard way over 14 years ago. I just returned the first set of foil screens I ever bought because they did nothing but run over my hair. I had been on a quest lately to find a new way of shaving and not taking as long as I do with some Wahl balding clippers turned teeth first into my skin. Those balding clippers get relatively close but it is time consuming and a little painful, but I have built up a high tolerance over the years. The clippers worked even better with Lectric Shave. Unfortunately because I am graying prematurely, I have to shave at least every other day now and doing it with balding clippers has gotten old quick. This has been going on for at least the last two years. Therefore, I began my quest here on Amazon reading tons of reviews about different shavers. As stated earlier, my first turn with a foil screen shaver was bust. Then I tried this rotary shaver and it was enough to write about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I purchased at Wal-Mart tonight but I am a loyal Amazon customer also, so I will save $10 off the Wal-Mart price by ordering a second one here on Amazon that I will keep that second one at my girlfriend&#x27;s home. In addition to this shaver, I also purchased the Braun Series 3 3500cc just in case this Norelco AT/810 didnt work. The Braun was $140, the AT810 was $70. If the AT810 didn&#x27;t work then I would try the Braun. If neither worked then I would give up and take both back. Now I am able to take the Braun back without even opening it, that leaves me with a clear conscience. I am saving $70 as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the experience, I was so overly anxious that I took the shaver right out the box and blister pack and instead of plugging it up, I clicked the power button. It was already partially charged; go fig. They were so quiet and didn&#x27;t seem to vibrate at all that I figured I would need to plug them up for the time required. However, I ran them across my neck and I heard them cutting the hair! I looked in the mirror and I had a bald spot where they were. Needless to say, I kept cutting. NO BITING!, NO PAIN! All I heard and saw was the hair being cut on my face and neck. It even cut around the Adam&#x27;s apple. Was this alien technology? I had a little issue with my jawline but being no stranger to a little maneuvering with some hair clippers, I maneuvered this shaver and I got that too. This is the smoothest shave I have had since the unkind incident 14 years ago with a razor. It cut all the hair within 1 to 2 runs in most areas. I am beyond impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is charging now, I am sure I won&#x27;t need it again until Thursday morning. I am secretly anxious for my facial hair to grow back now because it hasn&#x27;t had to grow from being this close for over 14 years. I am not that interested in the wet shave because this dry shave, without even using Lectric Shave pre-shave, has gotten so close. Unless I look like I was attacked by stinging insects tomorrow under my neck, I think me and this product will work out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006GQYSC8 Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor AT810/41]]</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 60 years.I never had to replace a head or battery.&lt;br /&gt;Now they(norelco) tells me I have to replace the head every year.&lt;br /&gt;This shows you they don,t make them like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;As a Dutchman shame on you.Philips Norelco[[ASIN:B006GQYSFA Philips Norelco PT720/41 Powertouch Electric Razor]]</li>
    <li> Husband hasn&#x27;t complained so I guess it was ok</li>
    <li> Excellent! Barely had my card back in my wallet and it seems it was delivered. Excellent lightening fast shipping. Gave as an early Christmas present. He barely had it out of the box and was shaving! LOL Says that it is the best razor that he&#x27;s ever had, and he&#x27;s had many. The previous one was also a Norelco. The only reason that he quit using it was he could not get a replacement head for it, was still going strong after 5years of use. Price was excellent, his response to his gift, priceless! Very happy with my purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> was very well received as a gift at Christmas. that it was usable in the shower was a huge selling point</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my sons 19th birthday; and this is his rating! He said it works really well.:-) I am happy that he likes it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very nice product</li>
    <li> Very good prdocut. I tottally recommend it. I loved the fact that it is water proof and I am able to use it during shower</li>
    <li> I held out for a long time to buy something like this. Didn&#x27;t think it would shave close. It&#x27;s not razor close but surprisingly closer than I though. Wet or dry. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have had no problem with the razor. It took only two weeks to train my beard. The battery life is excellent. Would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This item wasn&#x27;t worth the money at all. It pulls my husband&#x27;s hair so it was basically a waste. He asked for this brand specifically,  but was very dissapointed with this model.</li>
    <li> I had one of the earlier Norelco wet shavers for a number of years. I think it was the first model wet shave Norelco had made and it worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was time to replace it. I needed a new battery plus new heads, so I decided to try this one which is well rated on Amazon. I have a funny beard in that it also has lots of very fine hair plus regular growth. So, I use this Norelco with shaving cream, works great, and then I just use a regular razor to trim off the really fine hairs. It&#x27;s always been this way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best shavers I have had and I love being able to use this Norelco for a wet shave with regular shaving cream. And, the trimmer works exceptionally well. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> the outlook is fresh, and I use it very comfortable. I will strongly recommend it if you wanna buy the shave</li>
    <li> Great shaver , at a nice price … try it , you&#x27;ll like it ! I have had it now for over a year .</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper than buying cartridge razors like the Fusion, especially if you shave twice a day&lt;br /&gt;-less irritating, once your skin gets used to it&lt;br /&gt;-waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-light, long lasting battery pack (I charge it once a week)&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
    <li> The first electric razor I ever bought that didn&#x27;t give me razorburn the first time I used it.  I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Norelco&#x27;s triple bladed razors, and this one is one of the best I have bought yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this razor because it  shaves closer than my other shaver. Also, when I&#x27;m finished all I have to do is run it under water to clean it, which takes about a minute.</li>
    <li> BEFORE THESE DISAPPEAR, I PURCHASED THIS ONE, THESE SHAVE WET GREAT, UP AND DOWN, SIDE TO SIDE, NO MATTER WHAT DIRECTION MY HAIR IS OR HOW COURSE. THE NEWER ONES DO GREAT IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT HAVE A HARD TIME ON THE UPWARD DIRECTION (TWICE THE COST), THEN I CHECKED EBAY AND FOUND THE 800 SERIES (SAME ONE) HALF THE PRICE I PAID AND WITHOUT THEM CHARGING ME MY STATE SCREW-U TAX WHIC IS ALMOST 10%, APPROX. 20-30 DOLLAR DIFF. IN TOTAL,  BEFORE THESE GO AWAY WITH THE NEW ONES TWICE THE PRICE, I&#x27;LL BUY A SECOND ONE (ON EBAY) AND STORE IT AWAY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used foil shavers (Braun, Grundig, Remington) when not using blades in the past but I used my Dad&#x27;s newest Norelco a couple of times and figured I might as well give this one a try.  This is a less expensive model than Dad has, but still gets the job done.  What I do like about it is that #1 it doesn&#x27;t try too hard to cut too close, resulting in razor burn and #2 it doesn&#x27;t get hot like most of the foil shavers I&#x27;ve used.  When the foil shavers have gotten warm/hot at the foil is where razor burn was most likely to occur.  As for the negatives, these can be avoided by getting a more expensive model.  The cutting heads aren&#x27;t very aggressive and the motor is weak.  What this means is that some areas will take several passes.  If you want a quicker shave, you&#x27;ll need to step up to a more expensive model, like one from the SensoTouch line.  The one thing I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought this one was that is not a &amp;#34;cord/cordless&amp;#34; model.  I have always bought cord/cordless in the past and would have passed on this one if I&#x27;d realized it was cordless only.  The problem with cordless only is that #1- when the battery fails you&#x27;re pretty much screwed since they don&#x27;t make the batteries user-accessible like the shave heads.  Cord/cordless allows you years more service after the battery fails.  #2- If/when the shaver seems to get weak or not hold a charge, you&#x27;re left guessing whether it&#x27;s the battery or the motor.  Cord/cordless models run at the highest possible voltage when you plug them in so you can tell if it&#x27;s the battery and not be handicapped by a weak battery.  Just plug it in.  It&#x27;s a shame it doesn&#x27;t come with a car adapter, since it would make a good backup/glovebox shaver.  For the price, it&#x27;s not even a bad primary unit as long as you aren&#x27;t too impatient.</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s all ,just so so ,just worth the money,for myself,he,share it to all of my friends,that&#x27;s all.ok!&lt;br /&gt;wht not ne?</li>
    <li> My husband loved this for Christmas.  Something he needed and it replaces the previous brand that he had. Made for a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Razor is quiet, light and goes without charging for many shaves.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a dependable razor</li>
    <li> Received this on time and in great condition. Works as promissed and easy to use. Charges up quickly. A carrying case would have been nice but still a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m coming from using a COMPLETELY waterproof Norelco 755 I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years. I know this razor is able to be washed out and wettened for shaving but it&#x27;s not supposed to be &amp;#34;sunk&amp;#34; in water. I like shaving in the shower with the hot water hitting my face. Also my old razor had a plastic strap that allowed me to hang it from a mirror/hook device i have in my shower. Now I have to take it out of the shower after every use because it doesn&#x27;t have a hanging strap. The shave is excellent wet or dry even. Side burn trimmer does it&#x27;s job and gets pretty close as well.</li>
    <li> The blades seem to be made of a softer material or something, takes me forever to shave. would not buy another</li>
    <li> I just got this first time using it and its pretty good nice close shave but leaves the skin on the neck raw maybe cuz its my first time using it or maybe cuz i used it dry either way its a good and cheap razor and its really easy to clean. might give it a better rating later once i use it a little more</li>
    <li> The AT810 or AT811 (these are the same but the AT811 is color Black/Red and the AT810 is Black/Blue) are great shavers. Can be used wet or dry. Excellent for a quick shave however I see it having problems shaving a full thick beard when the rotary blades get old, but then again I don&#x27;t think these shavers are meant for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about the shaver:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wet or Dry Use&lt;br /&gt;2. Cordless use&lt;br /&gt;3. 50 minutes of shave time on an hours charge (great for travelling)&lt;br /&gt;4. The shaver is not heavy (won&#x27;t get tired holding it while shaving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like:&lt;br /&gt;1. Can&#x27;t use the shaver when it is plugged (as per Norelco, only cordless use due to safety issue. I guess there are idiots out there who will use the shaver in the shower while plugged)&lt;br /&gt;  Would be nice to be able to use it while plugged because when the battery dies on this unit then that&#x27;s it no more shaving (then again for the price that you pay for this, you can get another one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*if you don&#x27;t care for the Wet shave then just skip this and go get the Power Touch series shavers. Basically the same shaver except you can&#x27;t use them wet and in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is my first time shopping on line, so I don&#x27;t know how to express my feeling.&lt;br /&gt;But this razor is good to use and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It delivered very soon and I got it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works well, I like the wet shave and holds a charge a good length of time. Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Sony HDR-PJ230/B camcorder and accessories (Cords, cables, etc...). Takes some fiddling around to get everything into the bag, but it fits! Good size, as I didn&#x27;t want a larger bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he absolutely loves it! He loves that he can use it in and out of the shower and it leaves his face silky smooth!!</li>
    <li> Bought it in March 2015, but battery won&#x27;t hold a charge 5 months later.  It worked great when it worked and then it died.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first electric shaver so as mentioned in the users guide my skin needed to get used to it so at first it was a bit difficult to get a clean even shave, but after about 3 or 4 shaves it works as you would expect it. Time saver and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This thing is perfect, use it wet or dry, even gets three or four day old long stuff easily and quickly, very quiet so it doesn&#x27;t wake anyone else, charge seems to last forever and then recharges quickly. I am 66 years old and unless I drop it on some cement I bet it will out live me.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver it is my 4th Norelco shaver and the best so far. Will continue to use Norelco shaver as long as they  continue to keep the quality as high as my new shaver .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most certainly reccomend Norelco to a family member or good friend.</li>
    <li> Very good product, well made. Only complaint would be the side burn shaver part does not cut that well. I have to go over the same area several times to cut the hair.</li>
    <li> Not the one that I wanted.  I couldn&#x27;t find the model that I wanted to purchase on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to try this one.  It cuts too close for my skin.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he was going to have surgery on his rotator cuff  and his arm movement would be limited.&lt;br /&gt;He likes the fact that he can do a quick shave with his other hand and the results are great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for 4 months. I am always well-shaved.  The thing I like very much is a long battery life - I could use the razor without recharge for almost 3 weeks.   It seems to be an ideal product.</li>
    <li> Is any electric razor perfect. It does the job mostly. It is easy to clean. It holds up to travel. Needs a travel case!  If you drop it the razor heads come apart and a challenge to puzzle them back together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for a long time now and always bought a Norelco.  It was time for a new one so I picked this one.  I like it a lot.  Big upgrade over my last one.  Much more quieter.  Closer shave.  And I like that I can clean it out under the faucet.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I like the quick charge option too.  And I use it dry, but I like having the option of using it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s true what they say about letting your face get used to an electric razor.  If this is your first, don&#x27;t get discouraged by the results you&#x27;ll get at first.  Just keep using it.</li>
    <li> Worst case of whisker burn I have ever had.  This product is too close of a cut and I have ended up with whisker burn and ingrown hairs.  I never have had this problem with any other razor.  My barber stated he also has hear simular stories.</li>
    <li> I have never liked any electric razor before. After giving this a couple of weeks for my face to become accustomed to the difference in methods, I am very happy with it and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I love this electric razor. Very reasonably price for wet/dry razor. I would definitely recommend product for anyone in the market for one.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. I am 56 yrs. old and first time buyer for electric shaver. It just doesn&#x27;t cut the mustered, just disappointed in the performance and quality of the save. I don&#x27;t know if something is not right or what? But, I would not buy another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 6 months and it has been a good purchase. I shave every day and it can go 3+ weeks before it requires a charge. The razor gives a close shave and is comfortable. I like it!!!!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a replacement to my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend to replace the one she broke..  It was the newer version of the one he had previously.  He seems to like it, the only complaint I&#x27;ve heard is that he can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
    <li> Everything came as was advertised and the product is wonderful</li>
    <li> i loved it. so easy to clean using the water directly. Got a long time baterry for shaving. good Philips Product.</li>
    <li> Maybe electric shavers aren&#x27;t my thing, but it sure seems like I shouldn&#x27;t have to rub my face raw to get a clean shave considering I have a very light beard.  Wet makes it bearable, but come on, that&#x27;s not exactly how I want to experience shaving.  A good shave should at least leave you feeling fresh, and I&#x27;ve yet to get that from this thing and likely never will.  I&#x27;ve gone back to a good old fashioned double edged safety razor.  Takes a little longer (but not much considering how many passes this thing takes) and is totally worth it.  I&#x27;ll keep this for the road but definitely won&#x27;t spend money on something like this again.</li>
    <li> The noise from motor is ok to use. I don&#x27;t have to care about the water when using it. The build is solid and fit, no water can go through it. Nice to have.</li>
    <li> I switched from traditional razor blades and I&#x27;m never going back. The shave you get from this electric razor is closer than any shave I&#x27;ve gotten from a bladed razor and it is cheaper. You only need to replace the heads &amp;#34;at least&amp;#34; once a year. Which means for those who do not need to shave daily or have less demanding shaving needs, one set of razor heads can actually last you more than a year. Replacement heads are about $26.99 on Amazon. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A good Norelco.  No case, surprising that Phillips did not include a travel pouch; they always have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for at least three weeks on a recent trip.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable product. My friend have used this shavor for about 1 month now. Everything goes well.&lt;br /&gt;This meets our needs.</li>
    <li> it is ok, made from china. smooth shaving,  no cut.  Panasonic shaver is suck.  one time dropped, it cracked side plastic.  i don&#x27;t know about Philips brand  yet. give it a try</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the money,very satisfied with the shave it gives ...love the way you can shave while in the shower</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor is good and free volt so can use world wide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very satisfied</li>
    <li> This item is just okay.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old electric razor (which was also a norelco).  The flip up trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well either.  Strangely this model was far more expensive than my old one.</li>
    <li> Even new it didnt cut close. After awhile I replaced the head with factory new and it still wasnt up to my expectations</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco electric razors purchased in the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s.  I thought it time to get a new one.  I read all the reviews and carefully study all possibilities.  This unit is a great buy and I am really happy with all it does.  A lot of really nice features built into the original great design.</li>
    <li> The blades are pretty sharp and while someone else&#x27;s review stated that they want the model higher than this for the better pivoting heads, I don&#x27;t personally have the same issue (but I guess it&#x27;s the shape of their face?) with this...the fact that it shaves wet, I usually use this in the shower, saving me time from my old routine...shaving first and then showering.  I&#x27;d recommend this model, ON sale of course as I got it.  Not so sure about full price.</li>
    <li> My grandson has a tender face at 14, this was great for him. It was good to be able to order and know that it would arrive on time!</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I have ever bought, so I cannot compare it with any others. So far it has worked great and that&#x27;s all I need. yes I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco products for years. When my old razor bit the dust this one fit the bill for me. The basic features I needed and waterproof. Never thought much about using while in the shower, but I have to say it is convenient.</li>
    <li> its very nice razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like : 1- quick charge&lt;br /&gt;2-water resistance you can wash the razor with&lt;br /&gt;3-you can shave even with gel or foam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this razor for every man&lt;br /&gt;smooth razor .&lt;br /&gt;thank you Philips</li>
    <li> It is quieter which leads one to think the motor is not at full speed, but it is.  I think &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay,&amp;#34; but nothing more.  I chose this model due to the holiday special, but came to shop for a higher priced shaver.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this razor was underpowered because it is SO quiet.  It sounded anemic.  But it shaves really well, and is especially good at the hard-to-reach spots like under my jaw line and around my adams apple.  It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my last razor (a Braun), but does fine...and my old one left some of the difficult spots unshaved almost every day.  The AT810 shaves much more thoroughly and in less time.  In retrospect, I probably could&#x27;ve saved some money and gotten the PT730, which appears to be very similar except for the \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; option (which I never use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend the AT810 for someone with a very heavy beard.  I&#x27;m not sure it is strong enough, or cuts close enough.  But for the average guy, it&#x27;s great.  Just my $.02.</li>
    <li> I have never had such a close comfortable shave.  I&#x27;ve used a straight razor for years and thought I would give this a try.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Saves time and gives as close a shave as a blade.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great deal.  It takes about 15 days to China.  no adaptor or converter is required, direct charging with original plug.  1-hour charging is efficient, no problem for using 10 mornings.</li>
    <li> I have been a blade user for 20 years. I had an electric &#x27;back-in-the-day&#x27; but it&#x27;s quality was not as good as a blade so i reverted. No more. This electric razor is superior and waterproof to boot! An excellent buy!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s for my father, I have to say it&#x27;s great! And the price is also great! I love it, my father also love it too. ^_^</li>
    <li> This razor cuts much closer, smoother and quieter than my older corded Norelco. I would definitely recommend this razor to a friend!! It is really great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product for myself but purchased it as a gift for Christmas 2012.  The receiver of the gift seems to like it alot and does not have any complaints.  He likes that it &amp;#34;gets my face smoother than my last Norelco&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know what the razor was that he had previously.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like to shave for work a lot, but hate to use a blade razor every single day.  This Norelco is great if you use it every day because it gives you a very reasonably close shave.  However, if you have grown out your facial hair for a few weeks and then use this, it will not give you a 100% shave, there will most likely be a few whiskers here and there that it can&#x27;t get (but I think this depends on your type of facial hair/skin).  Still, even if I don&#x27;t use this everyday, it&#x27;s great because I can get my facial here close to a razor shave, then use my blade razor to finish the job, which makes shaving faster and quicker and keeps your blades lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first electric shaver was a cheap CVS/Rite Aid Norelco that was around $20-$30 that I bought many years ago, and at the very least I can say this a huge step up, and convenient too being able to rinse it in water.  But if you don&#x27;t use it every day you&#x27;ll never get a shave as close as a blade-razor.  I&#x27;d still recommend it though.</li>
    <li> For the name brand it does not give a close shave. Blades rotate weak. Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor for my special need 15 year old twins.  It is easy enough for them to figure out.  Works well.</li>
    <li> best razor I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I bought this around the end of last year, it seems to turn slower than some razors, but does an excellent job. Very good shaves at a reasonable cost. The other day my charger died. I got the 800 number for Norelco &amp; called the next day.  The man on the phone was very friendly &amp; immediately upon hearing my problem, offered to send a replacement charger. All in a fast and friendly way. You could not ask for better customer service.  Not many companies like that anymore.</li>
    <li> I like the look of it and how quiet it is, BUT it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  It takes me twice as much time to shave with this razor because I have to go over and over the same spot multiple times.  I will be returning this and purchase a different model or brand.</li>
    <li> I have tried to use an electric razor on and off for 30 plus years and was unsuccessful until now. Excellent clean shave with no dry or burning patches on my skin. I&#x27;ve been shaving with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> gave it as a gift and he gave it to someone else as it did not give him the shave he is looking for.</li>
    <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT. WHEN THE BATTERIES IN MY OLD NORELCO WHICH I HAD FOR MANY YEARS WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE, I DISPOSSED OF IT AND BOUGHT THE NEW NORELCO SHAVER MODEL 810. IT DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS MY OLD SHAVER WHICH I HAD FOR YEARS AND NEVER EVER HAD TO REPLACE THE SHAVING HEADS. PERHAPS OVER TIME MY LIGHT BEARD AND THE SHAVING HEADS WILL BECOME MORE COMPATABLE. IF YOU RATE THE SHAVER FOR IT&#x27;S GOOD LOOKS  I WOULD GIVE IT A TEN, FOR PERFORMANCE I GIVE IT a 4. I BOUGHT THE SHAVER THROUGH AMAZON. I HAD THE SHAVER AS PROMISD ON THE DAY THAT AMAZON SAID I WOULD HAVE IT, AND AT A BETTER PRICE THAN ANY OF THE LOCAL ELECTRONIC OR DISCOUNT STORES.&lt;br /&gt;PERHAPS OTHER PURCHASERS OF THE PRODUCT HAVE HAD BETTER RESULTS.</li>
    <li> This razor is a lot quieter than my previous razor.Also I have had far less skin irritation. I can shave bare dry or wet and it works really nice. A regular blade still does slightly better but I use this more often then the blade now.&lt;br /&gt;A rotary razor is ideal for someone who does not shave everyday. My last Norelco lasted about ten years, I thought I would try a foil shaver, worst decision ever. That foil shaver would not do anything at all if I was more than a day out of shaving. Very glad I went back to Phillips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Update, one thing, I thought that the blades had gotten dull very quick because it started to not cut close or very well. I was discouraged at first. I opened it and removed the blades and noticed that some of my hair ( I have long hair) had gotten caught and wrapped around between the blade and the screen, effectively preventing the blades from reaching my face. I removed the hair and it once again cut as it did the first day I got it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not as good as its introduction.it&#x27;s very nosiy.and it is heavy.so it&#x27;s not convinet to take.but it&#x27;s cheaper than in store.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my 13-year-old son who needs a very occasional shave on his upper lip. He doesn&#x27;t use it very often, and every time he goes to use it after a long period of disuse -- two weeks or more -- the battery is dead. Considering that each of his shaves last about a minute, I had hoped it would hold a charge longer.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser, who shaves my husband in the nursing home, says it is the best shaver she has worked with. My husband is very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> It did not cut very well.  Had to make lots of passes from all different directions and had to press pretty hard for it to cut all the hair.  I have very fine facial hair so this may be the reason.  Since I had to press so hard and do so many passes it also irritates my skin.  It now sits in my bathroom cupboard gathering dust.</li>
    <li> Perfect Just what i was looking for and great service.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the razor.</li>
    <li> The motor is very weak, so you have to go over your face two or three times to get a close shave.  I am very disappointed with this shaver.  I wish I could find some of the older models because they work great and have a powerful motor.  This shaver is basically a piece of junk or crap.  Norelco needs to put a whole lot more effort into its design of shaver motors in the future or I will no longer be a customer.</li>
    <li> so far it works well, I find that by using shaving gel seems to be better than cream, however using cream works better than shaving dry.</li>
    <li> exceeded my expectations. I use it more than I expected. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not as described on the description on the site and the box. Had to return for a full refund. Hoping to get something that&#x27;s a little stronger on my beard.</li>
    <li> Works really good.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, just open it up and run it under hot water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco shavers for years. I liked that this one could get wet for cleaning. Works well. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Replacement for an earlier Philips Norelco wet shaver that lasted 5-6 years until I fumbled it and cracked the head.  So far, getting nice close shave and love that it uses the same blades as my previous model.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this lightweight shaver, gives a nice clean shave without no pulling.</li>
    <li> Shaver OK but they cut back on fine points. No travel pouch. Can not shave and charge at same time.and other small points&lt;br /&gt;Jerome Ladden</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have all the features of fancier models but works very well for the price. I urge people to replace their blades, it&#x27;s a huge difference from my old razor with beat up blades.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver was received in a timely manner and has worked well.  I have noticed that it holds a charge for a very long time and charges quickly when needed.</li>
    <li> I did not use this product. It was advertised as a cord/cordless shaver, however when it arrived the labeling on the box indicated only cordless use possible. I returned it unopened and purchased the PT730 model.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  This is certainly quite a bit cheaper that you could but the same item in a store.  Have used it everyday.  Battery chargiing lasts about two to three weeks.</li>
    <li> Seems slow and not much power compared to my old a/c powered shaver. Works better wet than dry. Not real impressed but it works.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor for its price. Battery last, durable, and gives a smooth shave, very satisfied. . . . . .</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco shavers for many years.  Have tried others but are never as good as the Norelco.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cord.  Rather have the old coil type but the china products have rubber that is to stiff to make them I guess.  I have to wrap the cord around the charger and hold it with a rubber band.</li>
    <li> I have always owned Norelco but this one takes the cake,Very easy to use,Shaves very close,Excellent Razor,I would definetinely buy this style again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described and shipped quickly. E would do business with this company again, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been a blade shaver for 45 years so I was very timid moving into an electric razor. After 3 days I was ready to send this back to the manufacturer because my neck was getting bumps and razor burns. My brother told me to shave in the same direction as I did with a blade and not press hard. Following his advice, it has now been about 30 days of use and I am very impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved with both the dry and wet methods and when I wet shave, it is probably closer than with my 5 blade Fusion.</li>
    <li> I have a small mole on my face and regular razors cut it. I used clippers to cut my growth for 15 years. My wife convinced me to try this and it shaves so smooth. No pulling or cutting. Charges quickly  this product got here quickly and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good quality razor and real quiet to use.  Easy cleanup under water is nice too.  This is the 3rd I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco before and liked it. This new AT810 is even better. I&#x27;ve had to charge it only twice since I received it, it gives a&lt;br /&gt;smooth and close shave. I,am happy with it and I would recommend to all. I did&#x27; not give the razor 5 stars because nothing is&lt;br /&gt;perfect.</li>
    <li> DOES AS ADVERTISED, BUT REALLY ONLY GOOD IF YOU SHAVE DAILY. MUCH MORE THAN A 5-O&#x27;CLOCK SHADOW AND YOU&#x27;LL BE PULLING YOUR BEARD OUT INSTEAD OF CUTTING IT. BUT THAT&#x27;S HOW THE PREVIOUS SHAVER WAS TOO.</li>
    <li> I had a similar Norelco that I loved. The main advantage in this newer model is much better battery life (I charge it once a week, but it seems it could go longer). And it charges quite fast, in about an hour, vs 10 hours in the old model.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for our son, and he is very happy with it.  He reports much less irritation than with his previous electric razor.</li>
    <li> Blades found to be very dull</li>
    <li> works well close shave 0 irritation easy clean up was going to buy replacement blades for old razor 10 bucks more got a new razor</li>
    <li> Look no further --this product is the BEST for the cost --and there is no need to buy the more expensive models!</li>
    <li> I use this as a supplement to my panasonic shaver . I find that the panasonic does a better job on the face while the norelco does better on the neck. I get good shaves and save money by not having to buy blades all the time .</li>
    <li> This is a very good, nice, product. I Like it so much. ~ It was a fast arrived to my home~</li>
    <li> This gives a nice, close unirritating shave.  Good charge life on the battery (goes for weeks on a charge).  Works wet or dry as advertised.</li>
    <li> I looked at many electric shavers and I thought this product provided the best quality and value at a priice that was easy on my budget.  It works perfect - close shave - a pure enjoyment</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my husband!&lt;br /&gt;He loves it, great transaction- quick delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks it functions perfectly, no issues with use or cleaning.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a spare razor for business travel and this one is fabulous.  My husband loves it because it gives him a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. It doesn&#x27;t work or shave at all. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd electric razor and i&#x27;m upgrading from an old nerelco i have to say this razor is pretty good i don&#x27;t get any razor burn it shaves nice and smooth and the battery last pretty long.</li>
    <li> This razor rates among the best. I really l enjoy using it. I would recommend it for anyone. And it holds up well.</li>
    <li> The razor must be charged by HQ8505 powerplug,but the powerplug in the packaging is HQ850. I have to buy a new powerplug . In addition to the powerplug, the razor is very good.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  I like being clean shaven.  Good razor</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned so take that for what it&#x27;s worth. That said, I do like using it. I have found that I need to use it regularly for it to be effective. If I let too long go by, and the stubble is too long, it needs the help of a follow up close shave. The &amp;#34;pop-up&amp;#34; trimmer on the back works great. I&#x27;ve grown and shaved a beard since purchasing this shaver and was able to shave the majority of the bear off just with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this and buy again.</li>
    <li> Got this one to replace another just because it was so old. Trimmer is a definite plus and the shave is good. Batteries never went bad in the old one I had and it was maybe 5 years old</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable shaver I have ever owned.  It runs very quietly also which is great if others nearby are sleeping</li>
    <li> I love this shaver from Philips, it works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Best electric I have had so far....smooth job.....runs many shave jobs before you have to recharge. shave job is quicker and smoother than with my other Norelco electric. And being able to use it with water if need is a plus. Would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Charges quickly, and lasts a long time. Quality not as solid as older models. Made in China and a good price but time will tell on durability.</li>
    <li> Receive very quick just in time for the holidays, my fiance loved it and it working great and keep a good charge. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> So far since Christmas, he loves it and still talks about it. He actually said its the best one he&#x27;s tried yet. We are both happy!</li>
    <li> Really like the waterproof design. When used with shaving cream, leaves minimal razor burn, but takes a while to do a complete shave and isn&#x27;t a whole lot faster than a regular wet shave (of course faces and stubble are different so results may vary). And, as with all electric razors, does not shave as close as a traditional razor. Overall, satisfying for what it is and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I like that this razor is waterproof so I can use it in the shower and not have to worry about shavings dirtying up my sink.  I can use it, then rinse it out.  Of course it&#x27;s also nice to have the option to use it with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> the razor is all that was advertised and the price was great, I gave it as a gift for a first time shaver and he was happy</li>
    <li> Updated review: My only initial concern when I purchased the razor was that it would not work when it was plugged in, so when the battery goes bad the razor is trash. Well I am happy to report that so far the battery shows no signs of deterioration, and it&#x27;s been a year and a half since purchase. I would still highly recommend this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Initial Review:&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel of the grip and the look of this razor. The cut...well it takes a bit of getting used to. The instruction says it takes 21 days for your skin to get used to the razor and your razor to get used to your skin. If it doesn&#x27;t happen they say they will take it back, I&#x27;ve had mine a week so far and have begun shaving at night so the razor burns have 8 to 10 hours to calm down before I go out in public. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not too bad and my lower neck has always been prone to redness from shaving. But so far it feels like it will take the whole 21 days or darn close for me to adjust. So if you buy it be prepared for the break in period. UPDATE: The 21 day break in period is over and as advertised the razor is no longer rough on my skin. I do believe however that the break in period is less about skin getting used to the way the new razor cuts, and more about the razor blades becoming broken in and less abrasive. Either way the result is the same, the razor is working great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side: It feels like it cuts really nice and close, and you can feel the blades conforming to your face, so it is as advertised. It&#x27;s very quiet. It also seems to be a lot more gentle on your face if you shave everyday. I&#x27;m a bit lazy so sometimes I&#x27;m cutting 2 to 3 days worth of hair and that probably won&#x27;t work with this little piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side: It seems like you have to rinse it to clean it and I am used to just being able to shake the razor clean daily and a thorough brush clean weekly. Not this one. The hair seems to want to cling to the inside. I don&#x27;t know but running my hard Florida water over the blades a few times a week seems like a recipe for disaster, what with the blades being $30 to $40. Another thing I don&#x27;t like it is won&#x27;t run when plugged in. I didn&#x27;t know they made them like that. My last shaver ran cordless and plugged in so when the batteries gave out, as they always do, I used it for a couple more years as a plugin. Won&#x27;t be possible with this, when the battery dies, it&#x27;s useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall so far the razor seems to perform as it claims, gives a nice close cut, cuts the hair instead of ripping it out, and is nice and quiet. So I give it 4 stars. On star off for not being easy to clean, and the 21 day break in period.</li>
    <li> My husband had a Phillips Norelco shaver that died that he loved.  So we bought a bit better one this time and hopefully he will be loving it for quite a few years.  Whats nice on these you can replace the heads and the batteries to give them a long long life.  Rechargable is real nice as well but its a requirement for us . My husband wants no others than Phillips Norelco  shavers with the 3 heads.  One Amazon drag is that if you take advantage of the Free Shipping they wait till the last possible second to ship which to me was quite disappointing and making me mad at Amazon.  aMAZON Use to be my go to place to buy but they want everyone to do this Prime (more money in their pocket business) which i refuse to do just to get them to ship out LIKE THEY USED TO DO FOR FREE SHIPPING.  Hear that Amazon its just not me, lots of talk on the net about this very issue.  Sad.</li>
    <li> I had this thing for less than a month when it stopped working midshave.  When it worked it performed well, but this is the second one that died on me.  My wife gave me one for my birthday in December which she also bought on Amazon, although it was a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> Still working after 2 years and my boyfriend really liked the even shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a great machine.  Battery life is strong!  Cleans up nicely with water.  Gives very close shaves.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is only my third one, it is waterproof so you can shower with it and rinse the heads off after a use.  Self sharpening heads, clean close shave, a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Panasonic ES-LA63. I upgraded from the Panasonic ES-LT41K, which did not give a good shave. The Panasonic ES-LA63 does a better job as long as I don&#x27;t go much longer than 24 hours between shaves. BUT, it is $120. So, I thought I would give this Norelco shaver a try since it is so much less expensive and, because of the positive reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the two shavers is stark. The Norelco feels cheap compared to the Panasonic and the shaving results reflect that lack of quality. The Norelco pulls and irritates. I believe, that one reason is because the motor speed of the Noreclo is so much slower the Panasonic. I intend to stick with the Panasonic.  Yes, it is twice as much as the Norelco but the performance is so superior to the Norelco, it is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Actually this is my second Norelco.  First one lasted forever and this one is a great razor also.  Can&#x60;t go wrong with these razors</li>
    <li> I replaced another norelco shaver which I thought was good, this shaver gives even a better shave as well as being able to use shave cream. Well worth the extra money. would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> gift and replacement for one person loves it</li>
    <li> Very convenient shaver. Gives a nice smoother shave. Love it. Highly recommend it to any one who wants an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor does a good job, it is very quiet and handles hangovers with care! The down side is that it is a little bulky, given that my last razor was the &amp;#34;nivea&amp;#34; special and very skinny the size is noticable but probably helps with the noise so I am happy with the trade off.</li>
    <li> One of Norelco&#x27;s better electric razors.  Smooth, close shave.  Easy to clean &amp; charge. They should have included a caryying case.</li>
    <li> I have owned several electric razors in the past. The last one I had for over 10 years and I thought it time to replace it.  I bought this one, and now I wish I had kept Old Reliable.  This one does not seem to have much power behind it and it seems to take over twice as long to get a decent shave.  I have tried wet shaving as well as dry, and nothing I do seems to work well.  It does especially poor on the real fine hairs on my neck.  Because I can&#x27;t afford to keep buying razors, I&#x27;ll keep struggling with this one until it either dies or I throw it out the window.  Next time though, I&#x27;ll be looking at the reviews a lot closer</li>
    <li> Product came without a power cord. I&#x27;ve called &amp; emailed Philips Norelco 4 times now. They require me to contact Amazon &amp; request a copy of the sales receipt showing the seller, not Amazon (which is what my sales slip shows). Useless! I have a flippin&#x27; razor which I can&#x27;t use &amp; Norelco won&#x27;t send me a complimentary replacement cord!&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I purchase from them. Ever.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job and the charge seems to last for quite a few shaves.</li>
    <li> As close as a blade but without the blood of a cut.</li>
    <li> Sandpapering your face is probably a more accurate description, but I could not resist writing that headline. Seriously though, I have pretty sensitive skin and was suddenly reminded of that upon first use -- why I probably ditched the Braun I had years ago. Plus it does rather a spotty job compared to a blade and it takes longer! This was meant to save time. The power of perceived convenience is a formidable force indeed. Well, that and I get to use Lectric Shave, very vintage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An associate of mine offered that he heard  \\&quot;You need to shave with it (an electric) 25 times before your face acclimates. So I braved the fire ants for what I thought was that and more, but alas, still get burn on the neck and have to touch up with a blade. So the only time it really saves is not having to go through the whole creaming process. The creaming!</li>
    <li> Over priced. Norelco is living on it&#x27;s reputation. This shaver is worth 20 bucks on a good day.Good shave if you have the patience that is required.</li>
    <li> I use this with shaving cream. Rinsing the foam off the head fills it with water which pours out when you lift it to your face. I have to flip open the shave head to rinse it then flip it back down to keep it from filling with water. Not sure how they let this design flaw through...</li>
    <li> Shaves close and cleans easily.  It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed is that the shaver &amp;#34;sounds&amp;#34; like its spinning slower than other shavers I&#x27;ve used.  I have no idea if it actually is slower, but the sound seems like it&#x27;s in a lower gear.  On my first try I expected there to be some pulling and discomfort.  It actually wasn&#x27;t bad.  I used it on a  a dry shave. I&#x27;ve since used it with shave foam and it was a smooth, comfortable shave.  But as with all other shavers I&#x27;ve used, it does miss some spots, even while stretching your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a confusing yellow sticker on the shaver itself that has the universal slash symbol that usually means don&#x27;t do this.  It&#x27;s over an image of the shaver being plugged in.  The manual does not state anything about not using the shaver while it is plugged in.  Maybe it&#x27;s a warning not to use it in the shower while plugged in but there&#x27;s no water or other image on the sticker.  And I&#x27;ve never actually seen a shower where a plug is even close enough for that to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for casual shaves where I just wanted to clean up my appearance.  But if I had an important meeting or presentation, I don&#x27;t have confidence in this shaver to rely on it.  I&#x27;ll keep a Fusion nearby when a close shave is really needed.</li>
    <li> Will not run while charging like there older razors which means I have to have a stand-by when I am in a hurry.  Probably would not buy again - they used to have really dependable razors.</li>
    <li> My step father loves it.</li>
    <li> The closest shave I have gotten in years!  Nice!</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by closeness of shave and how quiet it is.</li>
    <li> I like that I can use regular shaving cream with it. It works well.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  It cuts closer then any other electric shaver I have used.  Usually it would take me thirty minutes or more just to get a good shave but now I can shave my legs in half the time. It also charges back very quickly.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco razors since early 1970&#x27;s, so I have built-in bias. Used of old fashioned razor off and on for short periods of time as an alternative. Saw AQUATEC feature and because the price difference between new Norelco blades and a new Norelco  AQUATEC razor was only $10-20, I bought the AQUATEC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well, both dry and wet shaving, but then they always have.</li>
    <li> just as described and the best electric razor i have owned would recommend for anyone really close shave and not to much razor burn</li>
    <li> Got this for my bf, he likes having it, but said that it doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as he would like. So, sometimes he has to use a razor to finish the job.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver. It is light and battery life is very good. I can not compare to other shavers as this is my first electrical shaver, but I have no complaints. I think all details in other reviews are exaggerated.</li>
    <li> This is a truly great shaver for the price.  It cuts close and smooth, and it carries a charge for a very long time.  I bought this one for my son because I use one of these myself, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years.  I love it that I can just open it up and rinse it out without damaging the machinery in the shaver.  It&#x27;s water tight and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The battery holds fine. Problem with it is that if you deplete it, it will not start for a while after started charging.&lt;br /&gt;The other annoying thing is that it won&#x27;t operate while charging. Maybe it&#x27;s something wrong with mine, but I didn&#x27;t see that coming.&lt;br /&gt;Rest is all good.</li>
    <li> First use was with shave cream.  Had to stop to see if it really was shaving me.  Second use was dry.....again.....you won&#x27;t even feel it shaving you!!  THANK YOU, from a sensitive skin guy!</li>
    <li> Very happy so far.  Havent used much yet but accurate descritipns.  Still using regular razor and hard to get out of that routine.</li>
    <li> Have used it for two months. When brand new it was working just fine but after the first month it got worse each time. Now in June it is no longer usable. It can no longer shave anything. Probably the worst product I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I always like Norelco shavers</li>
    <li> i had own and used a  norelco for over 6 years and when I started using the new 810 and it was i never even had to break in the new one.</li>
    <li> I love it great razor would buy it again. I would recommend this product anyone that wants to protect their skin.</li>
    <li> works great, love that you can use with shaving cream, wife won&#x27;t touch it, would buy it again, you know you want it</li>
    <li> Smooth, easy and convenient.  Ordered them with my prime membership and got them the next day.  What could be better.  Very nice Electric Razor.</li>
    <li> nice razor works with shave cream and warm water. arrived on time would recommend</li>
    <li> This product did not have a carrying case, from other suppliers I have bought shavers and they all had carrying cases.  When I looked on Amazon to buy a carrying case, they did not have one.</li>
    <li> I bought the expensive razor because I thought it would do a better job.  It doesn&#x27;t.  And it has spring open, scattering clippings everywhere over and over. I don&#x27;t write reviews.  But this was ridiculous.</li>
    <li> you have to go over your face so many times to get it to work that it&#x27;s just not worth using takes twice the time.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Norelco shavers over the past 50 years and this is the best one yet. I get a smooth clean shave and it is barely  audible.</li>
    <li> AT810 is water proof, it is very easy to clean and wash and cuting edge is always sharp.&lt;br /&gt;and price is right.</li>
    <li> Charges quickly, battery charge lasts a long time and the shave it gives leaves you with skin as smooth as alabaster.  The triple heads really do a good job and this is a second Norelco shaver to our home.  Good brand that lasts and performs well.  When it finally gets a bit dull, the replacement blades are available and reasonable.</li>
    <li> My comments as to the windsock also apply.  I hated my previous electric shavers and opted for the conventional.  I realoly like thois shaver</li>
    <li> Good razor. Good price</li>
    <li> Very good shaver ! It&#x60;s my second one.</li>
    <li> It works out great. It is one of my favorite items for my personal shaving time. Good price too! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Aquatec Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was very pleased with the Norelco Razor,  my husband loved it, it was all it claimed to be.  I am always pleased with Amazon&lt;br /&gt;products.  However, after receiving it,I was out getting my Husband a card and Walgreens had the exact model for $10.00&lt;br /&gt;cheaper, without shipping costs.  After calling Amazon, they offered to return it free of charge.  Costumer service said they&lt;br /&gt;would give a discount on my next order, but when I ordered the Dryer Stand I was told there was no record  of any such thing?</li>
    <li> Product was defective and Amazon would not let me return it. Its been just 2 days and the battery is not charging properly. I would recommend you buy it from philips directly.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. Comfortable shave and very quiet. I really like the way it flexes around the chin and jaw. Charge lasts six days for me on average. I gave it four stars because I just can&#x27;t get it to shave quite as close as my Braun. That said, I use it as my main shaver now, so the positives certainly outweigh the negatives.</li>
    <li> hard to get a good,close shave but price was right.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t cut as well as my 10 year old one :(</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my father. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Works well in shower as wet shaver.  On/off button is placed where you normally hold it so you can occasionally turn it off while shaving.  Does miss some facial but otherwise a good shaver.</li>
    <li> shave is so-so. not as close as I expected.</li>
    <li> A good accessory nice and at a great price</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor almost two years ago..I would say it gives an ok shave...Not a great shave...Worse part is it will no longer hold a charge...It&#x27;s just about totally useless now...Sorry, but I expect more than two years of service from a product like this.....</li>
    <li> The razor arrived on time, in mini condition, and performs as expected. I had spent over $200 on a more expensive model and it did no better than this does.</li>
    <li> I had an older phillips that was very similar to the one I purchased.  This far exceeds the previous razor in the shave that it gives.</li>
    <li> great little shaver. change the heads at least once a year though and keep it clean</li>
    <li> nada este producto es de lo mejor que he comprado, es algo realmente grandioso espero seguir comprando y negociando cosas tan buenas</li>
    <li> I have not had the razor very long, but being able to use an electric razor with shaving gel is great!  I really like this razor so far.</li>
    <li> This razor does a great job of shaving close and lifting up the stubborn whiskers. The charge lasts a long time and then recharges quickly.  It is the quietest razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Norelco.  It gives a good, close shave, the battery has a long charge life and it is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that the razor cannot be used while it is being recharged.  My old Norelco could be used while being charged</li>
    <li> The razor was pretty much  what I expected.  The shave isn&#x27;t as good as a blade shave, but is fine for my use.  It did take the full 3 weeks to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; my skin on the neck and it still itches once in awhile.  The time between charges is very good, I would guess about 2 weeks.  It is easy to handle and the cleaning is fast and easy, just run water over it.  I haven&#x27; tryed using soap or gel with it as I think that would just add time and cost.  I don&#x27;t use the side burn cutter as I have a small hair cutter that works better.</li>
    <li> The shaver is fine. The problem is that the charging cord supplied with the shaver is not the correct cord. When initially ordered the shaver didn&#x27;t light up when plugged in with the supplied cord. I tried a cord from my Philips brand shaver and the new shaver lit up and charged properly. A replacement shaver/cord set did the exact same thing as the first one ordered. I tried both supplied cords with my shaver and it didn&#x27;t function as well. Logical conclusion is the manufacturer is including the incorrect cord with the shaver. I&#x27;m going to contact Amazon again to let them know and to see what can be done to resolve this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor about four months. Always used in the shower. It is quality built and the flip up head makes cleaning very easy. Only gave it three stars because it does not work well under the chin and neck area. After repeatedly going over the areas mentioned I finally have to use a hand held razor.</li>
    <li> Good quality shaver, I like the fact that you can use in the shower, the battery last pretty long too. On one full shave it takes me about 30-45 minutes</li>
    <li> good first razor for my son</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco razors for 45 years.&lt;br /&gt;Always a good comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This charges fairly quickly and has lasted, with no diminished performance, for a year now.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love the water proof feature.  Take it in the shower why don&#x27;t ya!!! Easy to use. Rechargeable battery equals awesome!!!</li>
    <li> wired for u s a not uk  had to buy adaptor to use it  poor</li>
    <li> Product came in on time and works perfect</li>
    <li> Great Product, thank you very much</li>
    <li> totally unusable, it doesn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want to waste your money, please go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> sometimes neck hairs can be hard to trim. shaver works best if used daily.</li>
    <li> It does an excellent job and the service was great!!</li>
    <li> Works great, good deal.</li>
    <li> Got this for my partner. He had an older Philips Norelco shaver that finally stopped working after many years. I ordered this one and he was very happy when I gave it to him.  I&#x27;ve heard no complaints from him. I certainly have nothing to complain about since I have his smooth cheeks and chin rubbing against my skin!</li>
    <li> good.  Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Note: You cannot plug it in and use it so if the battery is drained fully, you are stuck waiting until it recharges. Took it on vacation without the cord, because I fully charged it before we left, but somehow in the luggage it must have turned on and fully drained, so no razor on vacation.</li>
    <li> Worked great as the norelco always does.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor.</li>
    <li> When my Norelcos get old they start snagging the sides of my mouth and i dont like that.  So after a forced retirement had to get a new one and after reading other comments thought the AT810/41 was good price for the amount of positive comments.  Yeah! It is much better than my old $200+ fancy schmancy Norelco 1059 Arctec that doesn&#x27;t cut as well.  And the Arcitec never caught the cuttings - they were pulverized and deposited on the countertop and my shirts etc. But this AT810 is a gem - NICE CLOSE and EVEN.  Faster and less drag on my aging face. At &lt;1/2 the price of the 1059 I will likely buy another and keep that one in the car. never think of using it in the shower. And the amount of shavings found inside the clip is assuring - 3x what I usually found in the Arcitec. Rinses out really easy. A little heavier but big deal.  I like this one a lot.  [[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> shaves real close , fast shiping to me I like the feel, although i had a norelco before iwas pleased with this one</li>
    <li> blades were dull out of box, bought for my 16 old son and he does not use it cause it rips his hair instead of cutting</li>
    <li> JUNK! Nearly ripped my face off!</li>
    <li> I know when he uses it, he will really like it a lot!!! he just turned 16 in Sept 2012, and has Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome&amp; he has a fear of sharp things - wont use a steak knife. he needs to start shaving, especailly the side-burns. Si I figured with this he won&#x27;t have to worry about cutting himself, won&#x27;t need to worry about it falling into the sink while running, no need to worry about wheather he will want to use lather or dry shave, this one does it all! And is very safe for my son!!!</li>
    <li> Good shaver, and I have had many over the years. This so far is the best bang for the buck</li>
    <li> I think it is the best choice to select this product , because it spends less but has quickly chargeable capacity</li>
    <li> At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as the last philips shaver ,which I bought in Germany, but when i unboxed it and began shave ... the reaction was WOW it&#x27;s awesome !!! so I advice it for everybody.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for price, does the job, wet+dry shave. Good battery life after 1 hr &#x3D; 50 min shave, and 3 minute charges for quick shave. Has pop up shaver that works fine. It is somewhat quiet, thought it was going to do nothing, but shaved very clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace another that I thought I lost but then found it later, so haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, but don&#x27;t expect any surprises.  Shipping was prompt and good packaging, hence 3 stars - may come back to re-evaluate after I had a chance using it.</li>
    <li> Good razor, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I good not tell much difference between the higher priced model,&lt;br /&gt;and this one.  No point spending $200-$300 for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> The product is just as described and works well.  There was some question from the description if it could be used corded which is helpful if used dry, but the possible danger when using it wet would argue that it not be usable corded at all and that is the case.  It may be that I misread the product information.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband, who is new to the world of electric shavers, and so far he loves it.</li>
    <li> I gave this norelco powertouch to my brother for Christmas. He said that it is so much better than his last one and highly recommends it. You charge it for one hour and it&#x27;s ready to go.  He just loves it!!!</li>
    <li> It takes a couple weeks for the skin to get used to the shaver, and the wet or shave gel works great. Worth the money spent especially when a blade razor can irritate the face.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas and he seems satisfied with it. It certanly does the job.</li>
    <li> My new razor was purchased as a replacement.  This razor does a good job of cutting whiskers on my face and chin.  This razor does a fair job of cutting whiskers on my neck.  The battery holds a charge very well.  I shave every day and I normally go 10 days before my new razor needs recharging.  Cleaning is easy.</li>
    <li> This shaver performs averagely.  My older Norelco model has more \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles\\&quot; and gives a closer and more comfortable shave, although it&#x27;s not aquatic.  I actually purchased new heads for my old shaver after getting this model and use it instead.  I will take this new model and leave it in my vacation condo.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The device is of good quality and feels very solid in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;havent tried the wet shave feature, but its still a pretty good shaver without it.&lt;br /&gt;Its definitely worth the money you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wish the battery would last longer, its not bad but if it did last longer it would make this a killer product</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new razor and this was perfect for what I needed. It cost less than replacing the heads and battery on my old razor.</li>
    <li> Ergonomic shaves very well, is fast battery charging, I have another Norelco shaver but this I like more, the cable for battery charging is a bit short and stiff., I recommend this machine has good price</li>
    <li> As I guess with most rotary blade electric shavers .... it still &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; hairs, so if you&#x27;re in a rush and haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days better be prepared to wet down and lather up your face well ahead of time as that&#x27;s what it takes. True to its billing, it is better when used with a gel, but regardless, it still pulls at hairs, especially if a tad more than a day&#x27;s growth ...</li>
    <li> GREAT for in the shower :)</li>
    <li> Exceptional product, great value</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for this, my son loves it.  Was a gift for him, and he uses this in the army and no problems so far.</li>
    <li> great product. arrived on time as told it was and works very efficiently in dry or wet shaves.. i may order another. very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in search of the perfect shave.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every traditional blade system out there, and have a foil Panasonic shaver as well but nothing could ever give me the close shave I could get with a Norelco.  The one draw back of my previous Norelco&#x27;s is that the shave it gave me was so close it always use to tear up my skin under my neck so I could never use it.  I decided to on a whim pick this up because of the Aquatec feature so I could use shaving gel to helpfully reduce the horrible gashing my 580XL would give me on my neck.  Thankfully it has, and I now have that extremely close shave that I could only get with a Norelco style shaver without having to wrap a towel around my neck for most of the day to stop the bleeding that my old one caused (granted I am exaggerating a little).  This really is a vast improvement over all the others I&#x27;ve used and tried.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price and doesn&#x27;t cut up my neck at all compared to past razors I have used.</li>
    <li> I end up going over the same area over and over and over again...and absolutely nothing gets shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get frustrated and just use a manual razor...and voila, there&#x27;s no more hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has effectively been reduced to being just a paperweight.</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these Aquatec razors.  One for me and one for the ole lady.  We love them and use them in the shower all the time.  I admit you cannot use it while re-charging it as that would probably electrocute your goofy fanny but I charged this razor when I got it for Christmas and it is still going fine on that charge as March 27th passes.  If that is not good enough, you need a straight razor not an electric one.</li>
    <li> Quality of shave the it gives is ok. Though the expectations from a Philips 3 head shaver was much higher.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Works good.</li>
    <li> This is very smooth saver. Battery is very long lasting so far. Convenient to hold. Recharge in short time but you can not use it when it is plugged in. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor in over 20 years. This was a total impulse buy. I am really satisfied so far. Very close shave and no irritation as some reviewers have experienced.  So far so good and I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good price for a Norelco. Overall it shaves well and is easy to use. Not a premium electric razor but it does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> not great--thought that i would get a closer shave</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  Particularly that it can be used in both wet and dry scenarios.  The rotating heads are great too!  I previously had a Braun electric razor that wasn&#x27;t as good so using this one is a huge improvement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of electric shavers, but I always regret doing so and come back to Norelco. I really enjoy these wet/dry models since they can, well, be used wet or dry and in the shower. It does take me a bit longer to shave with this than with a razor, but I also don&#x27;t cut myself, which I do a couple times a year with a razor.</li>
    <li> I like to clean it in water,&lt;br /&gt;I use it for dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really good machine, works quiet and close shaving.</li>
    <li> Thank you. quality is excellent. works fine. very comfortable shave. I loved it. I advise everyone to buy the more the price is good. Only the upper trimer for tanks is not good shave</li>
    <li> this was the first electric shaver i bought and to be honest i think razors are alot better because it is a cleaner cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall this product is okay, i usually use it when i am super lazy and i just need to clean off a bit.</li>
    <li> charge lasts long enough to take on vacation anywhere. smooth shave. easy to clean as long as you follow instructions.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a wet dry razor for a few years now. My neck is very sensitive and bleeds easily when shaving with an electric. Using shaving jel ends the problem. This is a great shaver at a good price.</li>
    <li> Has a great battery, but it&#x27;s rough on my face. After enough razor burn, I started really researching electric shavers and apparently you want to avoid multi-directional anyway because it&#x27;s not good for your face.</li>
