    <li> Love the patchouli.  Would buy this product again. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Patchouli is patchouli! The ease of application makes this product a cut above.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing for over a year and still have half a bottle left.</li>
    <li> This does not have a pleasing aroma, but an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell.  I was hoping for a nice patchouli scent, but the scent is almost rancid.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like it but smells like cannabis to me, I apply then add some Patchouli Rose to soften the leaf smell.</li>
