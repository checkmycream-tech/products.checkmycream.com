<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the peppermint in my diffuser. It&#x27;s great! The price was even greater. I forgot to say that I soaked some cotton balls in peppermint oil and placed in my vintage camper. I had ants EXITING rather than entering the camper. Yea!!!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and was a great price.  I was happy to receive a savings coupon and recipe book as well.  Will definitely use this company again!</li>
    <li> Immediately impressed by the super fast delivery and the great value of the product-- the bottle is WAY larger than I expected! I have barely used it yet, but already I love it- Just smelling the oil this morning as I started my work day made me feel energized. I&#x27;m anxious to try as a headache reliever and will be doing a soak in my footspa with the oil this evening after work!</li>
    <li> Very good product. High quality. I can easily recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have. The smell is amazing and long-lasting. This product can be used for almost anything. I can&#x27;t wait to try out all the different uses, which I&#x27;ll have plenty of oil because the bottle contains 4 ounces and really goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that it comes with an ebook you can do so many things with this! I never realized there were so many things to do with peppermint besides headaches...and the size of the bottle is very impressive for the price! The sugar scrub is awesome. Iplan on making this for christmas presents. I cannot wait to try the cellulite treatment!</li>
    <li> This really is extremely good quality peppermint oil. I am still learning this I can use this for it is really fascinating how many things you can use this for. I&#x27;ve used it for when I get migraines and I also plan to use it to keep spiders away (I read that some where) But I can tell you that peppermint is used for a lot more things than I thought.</li>
    <li> Very nice and pungent. Should work well</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and works very well. I use some to deter ants by dripping a few drops on the floors while steam mopping. I love the scent as well.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. Potent and again just love the company&#x27;s awesome super savings!</li>
    <li> Thank you for a wonder product.  I use peppermint oil daily.  I received my oil in a timely manner and will tell my family &amp; friend&#x27;s to give your oil a try.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Love the way it smell.</li>
    <li> OMG! This is my first purchase of LA Lune Naturals oil &amp; I am highly impressed! It has mentha avenisis which is more potent I believe then the mentha paperitis(not sure how to spell it.. I LOVE that it truly works. It&#x27;s less of a sweet smell like the other one I used to use, it has more of a bitter scent that I like. Still pepperminty but more harsh. I mix it with a lil bit of water in a spray bottle &amp; spray around my room. It took awhile for the smell to rise up (I was skeptical abt that at first) but when it did, Wow! It hits you hard! I am sooo happy I switched to this as *VitaCost was getting expensive. Also, that dropper is Boss! So convenient. Plz keep the price as is La Lune Naturals...♡&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it didn&#x27;t stop the mice which is c why I purchased it...which makes me believe it&#x27;s watered down but the smell is spot on. So far...Vitacost is the best I c e had...just wanted something cheaper. I&#x27;ll definitely keep trying other Peppermint oils until Vitacost goes down or it sells somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fantastic shipping! No issues at all. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Generous supply of excellent peppermint oil.  Includes a handy dropper.</li>
    <li> Really helps clear the nose for easier breathing.  I mixed it with water and spray my area.</li>
    <li> I used this for bath salts and sugar scrub</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and a great value.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, used it in the aromatherapy zaq. I purchased 3 of these. Two for myself and one for a gift. I highly recommend. I am excited about getting the eucalyptus oil also to use with it. Thanks Zaq.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells excellent!</li>
    <li> La lune Naturals makes some excellent products this is another one they have available and when I run out I will turn to them again to buy more!</li>
    <li> Very happy! Such a great size at such a great price!</li>
    <li> Who does not love the scent of peppermint? I do not know a single person who says not to the scent of peppermint. The La lune Naturals peppermint oil smells divine. It is pure peppermint and can be used in different ways. Love things that have multiple purposes. I also love that it came in a huge 4 fl oz bottle rather than the tine tiny bottles that essential oils comes in.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving it I have already used it in many ways. I used it as a room freshener, used 2-3 drops in trash bags and diaper pail to keep it from reeking, used it as a vapo rub (mixed it with coconut oil and massaged it on my forehead to reduce my headaches) and also used it in my humidifier. For the humidifier I filled the humidifier with cold water and used a dropper full of peppermint oil in it. My daughter had caught a nasty cold and was really congested the peppermint oil in the humidifier really her to sleep at night. Also I have in mind another use of it in summer; during summer time I have seen 2 mice romancing in our balcony at night..LOL. I will use the oil in some cotton ball and put them in the corner of my balcony to keep those pesky rats away.&lt;br /&gt;I can use it in my seaweed mask, for foot baths and body wraps too. I am very happy with the oil and it multi-purposes’.&lt;br /&gt;The oil came with a glass dropper and they were bubble wrapped and was shipped to me in an envelope. The dropper got broke during shipping and I contacted the seller as soon as I got the package. They offered me to ship a new dropper but I already had an extra dropper at home so I refused their offer. I am really happy with the oil and the courtesy of the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free to give my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love it great for headaches and so relaxing.Love all you can do with it.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great value!  Most essential oils I&#x27;ve ordered in the past through other companies come in 10ml &amp; 15ml.  I plan to be using a lot of Peppermint Essential Oil this Christmas and I appreciate that they offer larger size bottles and at a great price. I also love how La Lune Naturals always provides recipes with many of their products!</li>
    <li> I really love La Lune Naturals Peppermint Oil. I add drops to water, and let it boil to release it in the air. It really helps me breathe. I&#x27;m such an allergy sufferer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made homemade deodorant with this Peppermint Oil. It&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3 1/2 Tablespoons Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;  1 1/2 Tablespoons Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;  1 1/2 Tablespoons of Beeswax (Melt all the above ingredients together, and take off the heat)&lt;br /&gt;  3 Tablespoons Arrowroot Powder&lt;br /&gt;  1 1/2 Tablespoons Baking Soda (Stir until all clumps are out, and let thicken to a pudding consistency)&lt;br /&gt;  3/4 Teaspoon Vitamin E Oil&lt;br /&gt;  23 Drops of Essential Oil of Your Choice: I used Peppermint Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;  3 Capsules of Powdered Probiotics (Stir and put into an empty container. They do sell empty deodorant containers on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free from La Lune Naturals. I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> I must say I was amazed at the generous size of the bottle.  In researching, I have found that there are many good uses for peppermint oil from headache relief to clearing up acne and aiding in stress release.  This seems like everything I need all wrapped up in one.  I open the bottle often to just get the sent to give me that little kick I need in the morning.  I can not wait to try some of the other suggestions/recipes provided in the informative e-book  free through La Lune Naturals.  I am very happy with this oil and look forward to some of the other products that La Lune Naturals provides.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and customer service</li>
    <li> Awesome product nice quality smells great</li>
    <li> bought to make Christmas gifts, love it, it worked very well.</li>
    <li> I love this peppermint oil! It was lovely and refreshing in a bentonite clay with apple cider vinegar face mask (1 tbsp clay and 1 tbsp ACV with 1-2 drops of peppermint oil). It helped me breathe, smelled amazing, and cooled my skin. I also put a drop or two in my humidifier and slept wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil smells good. I plan on using is mostly for spider spray but since I like the smell so much I will probably use it for more!</li>
    <li> I have recently started with the world of essential oils so I was super excited to get to try this complimentary to review! I have another small bottle from a different brand that I was able to compare this too. I absolutely love that it comes in a 4 oz. size because peppermint is one of my favorites for diffusing, cleaning and so much more! The scent is slightly different from the one that I already have, but just as strong. Some of the oils can have slightly different scents based on the batch of plants and how they were cared for/weather conditions/etc.&lt;br /&gt;The oil also comes with a handy glass dropper to make getting the perfect amount in your diffuser/etc. much easier. Unfortunately, mine came broken which was no fault of the seller. It must have just had a rough ride through the mail. Not a huge deal since I already had one of these from a previous oil that I had bought.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really happy with this brand and think it is reasonably priced. I will definitely be back for more when this runs out! (:</li>
    <li> First I am leaving this disclaimer. Peppermint Essential oil, and cornmint should not be used on infants or during pregnancy. This goes with ANY peppermint from ANY company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 because of the description. It is listed as mentha arvensis, which is cornmint, peppermint has the botanical name Mentha piperita. With that being said, I actually wanted to try cornmint so I was happy with this.  I use this as a 2% dilution for headaches. 2% dilution in a carrier oil of coconut oil, olive oil, etc. 10 ml rollerball bottles can be found on amazon and it would be 4 drops of this oil and the rest would be carrier oil to get a 2% dilution. I received this product to get to test out in exchange for providing an unbiased review and honest feedback. I will be letting the company know about the cornmint vs peppermint confusion on their label and hopefully they will clarify whether they listed the botanical name incorrectly or not. I am perfectly happy if it&#x27;s cornmint, but I do feel it should be labeled correctly on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;CornMint (Mentha arvensis) also known as wild mint or field mint has six subspecies, is native to the cooler areas of Europe, Asia, eastern Siberia and also North America. It is a herbaceous perennial growing up to 60 cm in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leaves grow in opposite pairs and are simple hairy and broad. The flowers are pale purple in color and sometimes white or pink. The herb is grown mainly for the extraction of menthol and the production of oil. The menthol that is extracted from this plant is extensively used in the confectionery, food and beverage industries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main countries producing wild mint are China, India, Brazil, Argentina and Vietnam. The plant has been adopted both as a medicinal herb as well as a flavoring agent for food in many different cuisines around the world. The Aroma is extracted to produce everything from soap to chewing gum. One of the reasons for its commercial value is because it is relatively cheaper to produce than its close cousin peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extraction Methods:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mint oil is obtained from the flowering tops using the steam distillation process and is usually a solid before the main component, menthol, is extracted using the freezing method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characteristics and principal constituents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cornmint Essential oil is very high in menthol levels, being its main constituents menthyl acetate and menthol. It is high in free alcohols, ketones, menthone, isomenthone, esters and limonene. It has a fresh and strong aroma mildly bittersweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy Uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn Mint essential oil is put into practice to treat rheumatic pain, neuralgia, toothache, indigestion, laryngitis, and bronchitis. It is also an accepted treatment for tumors, earache and certain types of skin conditions and has been found to be very useful for the treatment of strains, sprains and bruises, ringworm, scabies and muscular pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is considered to have a positive effect on the nervous system, as it can act as a sedative and regulator. Due to its antibacterial and antiseptic properties it can be used to treat swollen gums, mouth ulcers and to alleviate toothaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is applied extensively in the cosmetics and body care industry to make everything from soaps, toothpaste and detergents, to industrial perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn mint essential oil blends well with Eucalyptus, Clary Sage, Lemon, Lavender, Peppermint, Marjoram, Spearmint and Rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cautions: Corn mint essential oil is non toxic oil but may cause skin irritation in some people. Its use should be avoided during pregnancy. Large amounts of Menthol are found in this oil. Mint essential oils that contain large quantities of menthol often carry cautions for use. A small amount of essential oil, used correctly and safely, should not cause fatal toxicity, as large amounts of menthol must be consumed before toxicity becomes a major problem. However, there are some groups of people that should take extra caution when using essential oils that contain menthol.&amp;#34;t be consumed before toxicity becomes a major problem. However, there are some groups of people that should take extra caution when using essential oils that contain menthol.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase and the receipt booklet that came with it.</li>
    <li> Arrived without any issues - I accidentally broke the dropper it came with within the first day of the package arrived - oopse - my fault - this peppermint is a bit sweeter than the last brand I bought but it does the job. While it doesn&#x27;t effect the oil in any way, I think the label on the outside is pretty cute. I use this for headaches and frequent nausea. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this around the house to keep the spiders away. I use it when I have a sinus headache. Love it!</li>
    <li> we are enjoying this product very much. the smell is very relaxing and the price was great.</li>
    <li> the oil was good not as srtong as I thought but that&#x27;s actually ok with me. one thing I would do differently is put a regular cap on for shipping and send the dropper with it, because the dropper top is a little squishy almost melted in shipping.</li>
    <li> Very much impressed, very fast shipping , nicely packed. Could feel the peppermint smell as soon as I opened the cover ....it was nice.This product is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My holistic doctor recommended this brand. I adore this brand as I&#x27;ve used some unclean oils, but this one is wonderful! The oil dropper addition is unbelievably convenient! It&#x27;s a great buy, the price is great! Try it, I bet you&#x27;ll love it;)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this oil, since it has great reviews.  But what a disappointment!  This peppermint oil cannot be pure.  It smells a little funny.  Yes, it smells like peppermint....sort of.  But it has a strange residual smell to it, that I&#x27;ve never experienced with peppermint oils before.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very concentrate.  I will buy more when I run out. This is a great oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing products and amazing company!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil that smells so good. I will keep purchasing this product.  The delivery was super fast too. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This is some powerful oil!!!  I am a new lifelong customer for this!!  I originally got it, hoping to use on cotton balls, in the room with the cat litter box.  And I have, and it works great for that, but, I have a spot in one of my rooms, that I could not get the animals from going under this end table, I had tried several things, to keep the animals out of there, and nothing worked before.  Once I put some oil, on a cotton ball, and set under this table, none of the animals have tried to go under there since.  This is a major thing!  I hope it keeps spiders away too!!  Thank you, for sending the dropper separately, as I seen in earlier reviews, that sometimes the oil was eating away the rubber on the stopper.  Since the stopper was separate, no problems!!</li>

    <li> Really like the smell of this.  So fresh and refreshing!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. And the booklet was super helpful.</li>
    <li> My Kiddos got me a diffuser for my birthday. I have tried several brands of essential oils and Lalune is the BEST! Love the bottle with it&#x27;s  wonderful &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; for the liquid. It makes loading my diffuser so much easier. Peppermint is my scent and Lalune has the strongest peppermint. It lasts longer and smells stronger. Great product.</li>
    <li> great peppermint oil. I recommend this product. I just can&#x27;t find how you get the ebook with the recipes. Does anyone know how you get the ebook? Where is the link for it. The product itself is great. I like to use peppermint oil both for aromatherapy and applied directly on muscles for pain relief. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my family can&#x27;t do without!  My son and I use it for headaches.  We get bad migraines and sinus headaches.  Because it can sting the eyes, I rub it close to the hairline from the temple to temple.  I don&#x27;t even need to take any sinus headache medicine when I catch the headache in the early stage.  For my migraines,  it reduces the pain by 50%! And then with just take meds once, I can actually be back to normal again.  Before using this peppermint oil, I would be on meds all day and be lethargic until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband gets hives from allergies and stress and this works miracles. It begins to work immediately after application.  The itching goes away first and the hives completely disappear in about half an hour. Even his meds don&#x27;t work as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the dropper that comes with it. It makes it easier to apply directly to the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint mint fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming like the Now peppermint, which is a huge plus when you are applying it for headaches. It is very effective!</li>
    <li> Excellent for getting ticks to &amp;#34;back out&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy with this La Lune brand peppermint oil. Comparing it to previous oils I&#x27;ve bought at local health food stores, this one has the cleanest scent and it lasts much longer. More importantly, the oil does its job. I bought this to rub on the back of my neck to cool and regenerate my body. Once applied you can immediately feel the effect and smell good at the same time. I also rub a few drops on the bottom of my feet when I need some extra energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other brands out there on Amazon selling peppermint oils, but the deciding factor for me aside from reading the good reviews was La Lune&#x27;s brand marketing. I think they did a terrific job with the label design. The quality of the oil really did match the aesthetic appeal of the bottle and label. The bottle itself will be a keeper after using up all the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I did get a dropper with my bottle. Smart move leaving the regular cap on for shipping and including the dropper off to the side in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering a few more bottles for family and friends.</li>
    <li> A nice big bottle, really helps with my headaches!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Strong scent, tasty flavor! A little goes a long way! Ive used it neat on my forehead for a headache, and use it to mix with coconut oil for oil pulling.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I absolutely LOVE this essential oil. Just a few drops in the bath are incredibly fragrant and energizing. One drop on a light bulb and the whole room smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the &amp;#34;peppermint-as-a-mood-lifter&amp;#34; idea is SO true. In the depths of winter, I often get &amp;#34;the blues,&amp;#34; but a little peppermint goes a LONG way to dispelling them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a large bottle, so it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Huge amount for price!</li>
    <li> Everything they said it would be! Looking forward to using it as a mice and spider deterrent, as well as homeopathically.</li>
    <li> Great addition to anyone&#x27;s kitchen, I love minted receipts and this one its a keeper :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the La Lune  Naturals Peppermint oil for lots of house cleaning lately. Put a few drops on a cotton ball place by ants the will run. If you have spiders put a little on the areas they hang out and they will move out they hate the smell. I love to dilute peppermint oil to use on head aches, sinus issues, stomach ache and many more things. This is a great essential oil to add to your collection.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It smells great and does wonders for getting rid of headaches.</li>
    <li> The glass dropped arrived broken.</li>
    <li> It is good value for the money. The dropper is very nice and useful. It is better than the dropper top bottle that you have to invert and end up using more than the intended amount. Product is also excellent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - thank you  for your prompt service and delivery. Great value!</li>
    <li> great product with fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m a mommy of Four a Wife of my Love,... And I Just gatta say,...&amp;#34;The smell will Tell&amp;#34; I think after having my kiddos my Nose is &amp;#34;Super Human&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve hade a lot of experience with Essential oils having been Natural or should I say Wholistic living for about 9 years. The smell of this Peppermint essential oil is &amp;#34; &amp;#34;Ridiculously Right&amp;#34;!!!!!

    <li> This product will be used in my hair regimen to stimulate my scalp</li>
    <li> Wonderfull and fresh product! You may use it for so many purposes and the booklet offered by these guys is also a good inspiration. I use it as natural repellent for me and my animals and it works perfectly, even my fiancé loves it when I spray my mouth with it or with a little sugar at the end of a good meal...</li>
    <li> This is amazing smelling oil, with a lasting scent.  I tested a few drops of oil over a 3 hour period on a tissue, to deodorize a waste can. and the scent is vibrant, with no signs of dissipating. The product is just as advertised, and comes with a very nice long glass and rubber dropper, for a more controlled measure.  Love it!  Making some scented lotion next.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, excellent price for a largest size bottle, peppermint essential oil is great when mixed with water in a spray bottle to keep away mice, spiders, silverfish and many other annoying little creatures when sprayed around windows crevices doorways not harmful to your animals. very happy with my purchase will be purchasing it again quite often</li>
    <li> This stuff smells very good, but it looks like it is already mixed with &amp;#34;100% steam distilled oil&amp;#34;... I&#x27;ve never had that before.  But it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> great service, great product!</li>
    <li> I love that this peppermint oil is 100% therapeutic grade. It&#x27;s nice that this large bottle comes with a dropper as well.</li>
    <li> I love this, I mostly use it for my migraine headaches. It most definitely is better than popping pills that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I love it smell so good en strong and that is exactly what I expected. I used this for facial massage and you need only a drop</li>
    <li> Strong and pure oil! Great customer service, looking forward to making some counter sprays out of this</li>
    <li> HIghly recommend this oil for pain, aches, headaches, sinus issues.</li>
    <li> Hi, I really like this Peppermint Oil.  I use it all through my home burning it in oil diffussers.  It fills my home with the wonderful fragrance of peppermint which is very nice.  I enjoy the prompt delivery of these items to my home.  And am looking forward to enjoying other items from your site.  Thank you</li>
    <li> love the many uses with recipe guide</li>
    <li> very happy with the product and the prompt shipment, thanks.</li>
    <li> It is terrific. I have ordered several peppermint oils.</li>
    <li> Whether this is &#x27;peppermint&#x27; or not, it smells just like it. I haven&#x27;t used it yet (just recieved it) but it smells heavenly!!! It came with a glass dropper as well as a coupon for my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Once you unwrap it from the 2 layers or bubble wrap, you can immediately smell the oil- without even removing the cap or seal!&lt;br /&gt;I will edit and update as I use the oil.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I used this on my muscles cause they were sore and it helped. Also the smell wasn&#x27;t bad at all. I like it. Looking forward to using it in other ways.</li>
    <li> Luv this product. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I adore peppermint oil. When I was asked to review this oil for my blog, I had to say yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is the perfect peppermint oil. It is rich and refreshing, and makes me feel cooler if that makes any sense. It can be used for a number of healthy ways in aromatherapy, and also in cleaning products. I have made dishwashing tablets with peppermint in the past, and it makes my kitchen smell fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula has a dropper in the package as well as a regular lid- so you really can close it up and store it if you wanted to. I like to use mine a lot though!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nice oil. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a freshened spray for my house. Very nice fragrance .</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Great price! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Definitely satisfied with my purchase.  It has a wonderful,  pleasant fragrance which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best I have ever smelled. I LOVE the recipes.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it everywhere and for nearly everything lol. I love that I received a large bottle wrapped very well. The dropper makes it much easier to control strength.  I recommend this oil, and plan to keep some on hand.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of Peppermint Essential Oil from La Lune Naturals.  All natural, smells great and so many uses.  I purchase peppermint oils constantly for use in my Aromatherapy work and some of my peppermint oil uses are:  Inhaler sticks, migraine roll-on&#x27;s, body creams/scrubs, liquid body soaps, steam diffuser &amp; aromatherapy diffuser use just to name a few; and this Peppermint Oil is very strong and the scent lasts and lasts.  Did I tell you Peppermint Oil also keeps mice and spiders away?  I use it whenever I open my windows/sliding glass door.  I make a mixture (in spray bottle) of 3/4 alcohol to 1/3 Peppermint Oil, shake and spray the window sills and door jam.  I just love this oil!</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase.  This peppermint oil is the real deal.  A couple of drops will change your mood.</li>
    <li> Great size, and comes with its own lid as well as a separate dropper lid. Perfect for the many things I use peppermint oil for around the house :)</li>
    <li> I love this peppermint!  It&#x27;s a clear, crisp peppermint that came just in time to help me with a stuffy nose.</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time and the packaging was well done. The peppermint oil smells divine...definitely worth buying again!</li>
    <li> Love it makes my scalp feel refresh!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil and the recipe boklet that you get.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, smells great, nice large bottle with glass dropper. Tastes and works great when used as a mouth wash. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.... Works great for what I needed it for. Thanks!</li>
    <li> We use 1 oz. of peppermint oil, mixed with 46 oz. of water, in a pump spray bottle as a fabulously effective rodent deterrent.  If you don&#x27;t want to spray, a couple of drops of oil on cotton, placed in a strategic place works great!  No more mouse traps or poison!!  Wish we had known this 20 years ago...</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product as well as the company. Quality oils, reasonably priced, excellent customer care. Will shop with them again.</li>
    <li> I am so very pleased with this Peppermint oil!!!  I use it in my oil burner and it refreshes my home and also is disinfectant in the air when there are colds, etc. in the house.&lt;br /&gt;I was also delighted with the Free 20 Page Ebook download!!!  I printed it right away and found wonderful recipes from facials, foot soaks, household cleaners and to repel rodent/bugs!!  Some really great recipes.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing more and hopefully finding a larger bottle.  With so many wonderful uses, will be using it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You La Lune</li>
    <li> Very strong! And gets the job done.  I use it on my hair, and it gives a great tingle.  Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite oil by far. Such a good smell that stays hours after you&#x27;re done diffusing. Not overpowering</li>
    <li> Lovely product, attractive, shipped and packaged well, comes with both a regular and a dropper top, includes a coupon for future purchase. Not tested on animals, steam distilled. It&#x27;s all good. :)</li>
    <li> Love the oil! Packaging was great surrounded in bubble wrap and shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected.  Thankyou</li>
    <li> very powerful stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality, strong aroma. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny... Awesome results And u don&#x27;t have to pay triple the price as u would if u buy a tiny Lil bottle from doterra</li>
    <li> Love this!  I have bought other peppermint oils from different sources and was very unhappy with quality: this oil is wonderful!  Packaging was secure also.  Very pleased with this seller.</li>
    <li> Decent size for 100% oil. Used for headache and stuffy nose and worked very well. Very excited to use for facial.</li>
    <li> I would gladly do business with La Lune again</li>
    <li> Amazing therapeutic grade</li>
    <li> great for so many uses</li>
    <li> Pepermint oil smelled like chemicals in plastic, NOT peppermint. Would not reccomend. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Loving the smell. I use it as a diffuser and OMG does the house smell good and it also helps to clear up the nasal passages.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Best and strongest peppermint I&#x27;ve ever bought, no more neck pain or headaches when applied</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find some good essential oils to use with the other La Lune products I&#x27;ve purchased- so I was very excited that I can now get Peppermint Oil from La Lune Naturals!  What fantastic value-- 4 oz of essential oils goes a LONG ways when you only need to use a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I have so many different things I&#x27;m excited to try- scrubs, masks, cleaners.... but the first thing I did when I got the Peppermint Oil was put a few drops on a cotton ball in my laundry room, where I keep our cat food and our litter box.  It&#x27;s amazing-- a nice, clean scent without being too overpowering and I can&#x27;t smell litter or cat food at all!  I&#x27;ve tried so many different air fresheners and odor neutralizers and this is the only thing that&#x27;s lasted more than 10 minutes.  Another awesome La Lune Naturals products!&lt;br /&gt;Please come out with more essential oils-- I&#x27;ve been waiting to buy teatree, orange and lemongrass-- hopefully you&#x27;ll get those soon!</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail yesterday was pleasantly surprised when I saw the size of this product for the price. It was a lot bigger than I expected! My husband gets terrible migraines so he can&#x27;t wait to try this out next time he gets one. I love that you get the ebook with this purchase, there are so many uses for this product I can&#x27;t wait to try them all! Especially the face mask, it sounds refreshing!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the very large bottle. When I opened it, everything suddenly smelled like Christmas and I was inspired to make some peppermint &amp;#34;candy cane&amp;#34; sugar scrubs for Christmas gifts. I used it immediately in a mask and could feel it working right away to help clear up excess oil.</li>
    <li> This is super duper good oil! Smell good and organic! You only need to add 2 drops and mix it with your clay mask, you&#x27;ll get the scene and tingling feeling! The best peppermint oil I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I love my new La Lune Peppermint Oil. It smells so good, my son was begging for me to put some on him.</li>
    <li> I never knew that Peppermint Oil  could do so many things. Thank you to the folks at La Lune Naturals for all the wonderful information. I bought the product to control a mice problem, and since that is under control, I will be using this product for some of the other uses  that I was informed of in the booklet that came with it. Also my home smells wonderful. Thanks</li>
    <li> I quickly received my order of peppermint oil, which I couldn&#x27;t wait to use!! I live in a country setting, so I am trying out the peppermint oil as a mouse deterrent. I placed s couple of drops on some cotton balls and placed them near my garage door, where they tend to slip in. I&#x27;ve heard it truly works, so I look forward to a rodent free winter!!  I also use this to clear my sinuses and it works wonders!! I am always congested and if I place a drop on a tissue and breathe it in, it instantly gives me relief!!  There are so many other uses, I can&#x27;t wait to try them all. Great product, quick service, lovely packaging. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best peppermint oil for the best price that I&#x27;ve found. The scent is pure and refreshing and a little goes a long way. The packaging was wonderful: multi layers of bubble wrap plus a sealed bottle. Even the dropper is high quality. The only diappointment was not getting the recipes, as promised. Highly recommend this oil as well as this seller.</li>
    <li> Love love love LaLune products.  This large bottle of peppermint oil, 100% pure, is larger than what I have found from other sources and helpful since using peppermint oil for control of allergy symptoms, nausea, hand wash mix, as well as using in cooking.  LaLune gives follow up and recipes for various products with use of essential oils</li>
    <li> I have used this peppermint oil and it is exactly as described and if in time I start to feel better I will continue to buy more. I do feel it soothing effect immediately.&lt;br /&gt;These people are very reliable. It was a pleasure to buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;Teddy J.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff! ! Smells amazing and not diluted at all</li>
    <li> The peppermint smells fantastic! I will be using this for alot of projects for presents. The one thing I did not like was that the dropper seal isn&#x27;t very good after it is opened. the oil leaks out of the top when squeezed.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this to give my honest opinion about it. I LOVE lalune products. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used any of their products that I didn&#x27;t absolutely love. This peppermint oil smells so fantastic. I read that it&#x27;s good for headaches, and stress. Also, if you get this to add drops to your bath water, please only use 3 drops. I used a whole dropper and it burned me up, lol. All in all, I love it and it serves its purpose with a strong, non diluted, scent.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, and the receipes only added to the good  thingsI I can  do..The dropper makes it easier to use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazingly fast delivery ! Great package, great eBook !&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with it, is that the description did not specify that this oil is not edible !!! Ive been using other peppermint essential oils that I love adding to my tea or water, but I only realized this one is not to be used internally once I had received the oil. I wish I&#x27;d known that prior to my purchase (I would&#x27;ve still bought it cause it has wonderful uses and its a great value size/price wise !!!!)</li>
    <li> Great product and terrific value!  I have used the peppermint oil twice and was very impressed with the results.  For a headache I rubbed two drops at the base of the skull and it was not long before the headache was gone!  I also used it for heartburn relief.  Again a couple of drops in a glass of water and a few sips later the heartburn was gone!  I am excited to use this in other ways also.  The included ebook has several recipes for use and will definitely be using the peppermint oil more!</li>
    <li> Great value.  The recipe book had included uses that I never thought about.</li>
    <li> How delightful! Peppermint oil is such a nice addition to things like soap, lotion, cleaning agents, candy, aroma therapy. And this is a very nice Peppermint!</li>
    <li> This was an unexpected delight! I just downloaded the free ebook and can&#x27;t wait to try the recipes. You rock, La Luna!</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle and will last me an eternity I think. It was purchased at promotional price for super great value, however it is not real clear on the order page that this is not for internal use.  I am new to essential oils and hope to benefit from this.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well. Very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing value for the quality and size of this product. The bottle is enormous and the oil is pure and concentrated. You really don&#x27;t need to use a lot for it to be effective but I&#x27;m a little more liberal since there is so much of it. I only use this topically because there has been some debate over whether you should ingest essential oils but I feel that it&#x27;s just as effective externally. I use this primarily for headaches and muscle tension. I also noticed that a few blemishes that had popped up went away overnight after I applied this to my forehead. The only thing you should be careful of is not getting it in your eyes if you apply it to your face. I got a little in mine and it didn&#x27;t cause any serious burning or stinging, but it was uncomfortable and made my eye water. I rinsed my eye with contact solution immediately and it was just fine. I used a 100% off coupon to purchase this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> wonderful quality. very quick shipping. Love this product and seller</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is very strong and effective as a mouthwash/rinse, breath refresher, mood enhancer, stress buster or any other purpose you might want it for. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a soothing or energizing experience.</li>
    <li> I used this oil to mix with other oils.  Thank you for the dropper.  It makes it easier for me.</li>
    <li> Love this. I purchased it to use as air freshener and ended up using mainly as a muscle rub. I add a little to my coconut oil and apply it to my sore muscles.  It works great as a room air freshener but my muscle like it better!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would definitely buy again.  I was going to buy a smaller bottle to mix in with my seaweed face mask, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price. 4 ounces is a lot and combined with the coupon code it doesn&#x27;t make sense not to buy this.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Quick shipping. Great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Does your dog have a tick? Apply a little of this and it will release in seconds! Dandruff Problems? Put a few drops of this in your hand with your shampoo and BAM you have an invigorating shampoo that wakes you up and kicks dandruff down the drain! Toothache? Just a little of this oil on a Q-tip and apply as you would Orajel and pain is gone. I love making my own face wash and facial masks with just a couple drops it opens pores and is so invigorating! Also, as a natural antibiotic combats acne! Great stuff, good price!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I didn&#x27;t expect it to come in such a large bottle, which is great because it will be lasting me a while.  It smells great and I am definitely going to be getting this as a Christmas gift for friends and family!</li>
    <li> This is SUCH a great price for this size bottle of peppermint oil and I can attest to how awesome it is. This is the second mask I&#x27;ve done with La Lune Naturals products and this time I used the peppermint oil, in additional to the seaweed powder, and it was incredibly refreshing.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is amazing! I actually woke up with a headache this morning, and when I got the mail I could smell peppermint. I followed one of the recipes in the free eBook I got in my email and put just a couple of drops around my neck at the hairline and massaged a drop into each of my temples. Within 30 minutes my headache was GONE!! I get headaches and migraines a lot so I imagine I&#x27;ll be ordering more than one of these! I didn&#x27;t realize how many great things you can do with this oil. Can&#x27;t wait to try out a few more of the recipes! AND this is great around the holidays! The peppermint smell reminds me of Christmas! It&#x27;s so uplifting and refreshing!! Thanks La Lune Naturals! Another great product!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  I added it to the lalunenaturals seaweed mask  and it made it very refreshing.. Also a few drops in my bath and felt so relaxing.  Great value for the size of the bottle.  It also arrived 2 days early... Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love the purity and large size.i spray my bedding in the am, and it&#x27;s just great!</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil smells like a chemical, not like true peppermint oil. I am so disappointed with this product. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love that this is therapeutic grade peppermint oil. This means when I use it it my hair oils, it will actually do more than smell good--it will encourage hair growth and help with my quite annoying dandruff.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Quality oil</li>
    <li> Tastes great. Less filling. Comparable to more expensive brands. Suggest packing with regular cap (for air tight seal) and just including dropper within package. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Wife bought this for a few mice that had gotten under the house....they&#x27;re gone..product worked and the smell was quite pleasing.  good shipping.</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil is wonder! I feel that i stole it,it was such a great price. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great oil. Very fragrant. I will order again</li>
    <li> The peppermint oils worked great!  Arrived quickly and used them to scent a sugar scrub for Christmas gifts.  Stored the extra in my pantry - now my pantry smells great as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil! Not to strong and opens my chest immediately.</li>
    <li> So happy to have this product. It will help me with my headaches. Also now I know that I can use it as a pest repellent. For some reason we get ants when it rains so this will be very helpful. High quality, versatile product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. We use it for various cleaning needs - kitchen, bathrooms.. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> The top on the bottle was kind of loose and a little oil spill out in the plastic that the bottle was in. I have not used it yet but I like it very much has a good strong mint smell and will buy more thanks.</li>
    <li> I really would like to give this a good review,but just can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> smells amazing, very strong but good.</li>
    <li> First off, the order to door timing is amazing, I even got it a day early!! I&#x27;m a huge essential oil lover and I&#x27;m in love with this HUGE bottle of amazing quality oil for unbeatable price!! Endless uses for this product- very happy!</li>
    <li> Just received my peppermint oil , The bottle is big. The smell is great! I will use this for many things this winter:)</li>
    <li> Nice big bottle.  Will last a while with so many uses.  The only change that I would make is to put the dropper separately because during shipping the rubber part of the dropper melts from the oil touching it.</li>
    <li> I just received my oil. It seems to be a great value for the size bottle it is. I immediately diffused it and my home smells wonderful.  Order was received quickly.</li>
    <li> It really does smell delicious!  I only just got and already am excited about using the recipes in the book that they gave with it.  Just one hint, don&#x27;t screw in the dropper right away or the container will overflow!  Lol, seriously though, it seems like the real deal to me!</li>
    <li> I just started getting restless leg syndrome and my mother who&#x27;s 85 has had RLS for some years.  I added some carrier oil to the peppermint oil and we both use it by rubbing it on our legs and feet.  It&#x27;s like a miracle,  no more RLS when used.  Love it! Great company and grade a peppermint oil!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the speed of my delivery! I was also really surprised at the size for the price! I&#x27;ve purchased different essential oils from different companies and none of them have been this big! We&#x27;ve already used it to help get rid of the spiders! We haven&#x27;t seen any for a couple of days! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> As Described,  shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this peppermint oil. It smells amazing and is very relaxing after a long day of work. This is on my Christmas list to buy for my friends :)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Peppermint oil I have purchased. The oil literally with just a few drops is so long lasting. I  loved it so much , I tried to order again and you were out. I hope its available soon and thanks for the free recipes. It sure opened my eyes to the various uses of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Critic</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way ... I keep this at my desk at work and use it for stress and love it.  I rub a little around my face and just breath it in.</li>
    <li> I like this product because of the ease of use and it seems very effective.  It has only been in use for 4 or 5 days, but already symptoms are disappearing.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> great product, many uses and superb quality. love this brand.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Will order from LaLune again.</li>
    <li> Best peppermint oil I&#x27;ve used. Peppermint oil is a good natural spider and roach repellent. I mix this with some water in a spray bottle and spray around windows, doors, air vents, every where an unwanted critter might enter and/or lurk. The scent of this oil is not overpowering. It&#x27;s also good for my migraines. The bottle is twice as big as other oils and for an extremely reasonable price if you want one of the the highest quality oils sold.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is not for ingesting/consuming. Let me make that clear from the start.&lt;br /&gt;What I have done since I got the bottle was to add a few drops to plain water to freshen the air. The house tends to get a stale smell to it because we don&#x27;t open the doors to let fresh air in. (Severe allergies)&lt;br /&gt;Spraying this around a room really does make it smell awesome. I like the way that it is light, pure peppermint oil, with no weird ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;My sister suggested that I add a few drops to the hand soap dispenser. What a treat that is! To be able to have the room freshened after every hand wash. Even better is the way that your hands feel after a wash.&lt;br /&gt;If you iron clothes, you can spray your clothes before you iron them for a fresh smell that is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have sprayed the clothes going into the dryer for a bit of a freshening when they go in, and they come out smelling wonderful, with no chemicals added to what is touching my skin. I really like this and I will be telling others how remarkable it is.</li>
    <li> This is Menthe Arvensis, not Menthe Peperita.  Menthe Arvensis does not have as lasting an aroma, nor is it as potently &#x27;sweet.&#x27; In my opinion usable as an anti-ant, anti-spider, etc., but is not long-lasting at all.</li>
    <li> This oil is great! I used to make homemade toothpaste and hand sanitizer for Christmas gifts you had to buy more to share with my friends. I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes.I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the bottle leaked on the package in shipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent customer service! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> this is a great peppertmint oil, so far i&#x27;m enjoying the many uses...</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth. The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil. You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
    <li> I was not with the huge essential oil crazy when it took off. I still wouldn&#x27;t say I am on the essential oil band wagon but I am absolutely in love with peppermint. After purchasing this product I received a recipe book in my email with tons of great uses for my new peppermint oil. I was extremely excited to see it could be used as an ant repellent/killer. I live in the south and it just so happens in my area there are more ants than people. I decided to try the recipe for the pesticide and was beyond shocked! The ants no longer get into my house and all over my sink or in my pantries! I now keep myself an extra spare bottle of the La Lune Naturals peppermint oil in my cabinets, especially during summer time! This is also a very good size bottle for the price! If you buy essential oils from anyone else the bottles are very small and cost double the price of this one! *I received this product free/discounted in exchange for my review. My reviews are completely honest and 100% my own.*</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as the other reviews said it is, but I can definitely still feel it working when I use it on my scalp.  This is a great product, and you get you monies worth in value. The bottle is cute, so if you have it around in a business setting, like a massage parlor or hair salon it won&#x27;t look like you use tacky, cheap products.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail last week at the perfect time.  I was having a not so great day when this came in.  I opened the bottle and smelled the oil, it was amazing.  I ended up putting it on my diffuser necklace and wearing it all day.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Great costomer service from laluna naturals.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to using essential oils and I am enjoying learning all the great things that they can be used for. I had been mostly using them for the scent and for their cleaning power. I received a bottle of this to review and found it to work great for easing off a headache. I also had a night that I had very strong pain from a hiatal hernia. The OTC stuff I normally take wasn&#x27;t working and I had remembered reading about using peppermint for stomach aches so I figured this was pretty close to that area and mixed it with some fractionated coconut oil and rubbed it onto my skin. I was so surprised that within just a few moments, the pain had eased off greatly! Of course I also used it for some aromatherapy and love the scent wafting through the room. Peppermint is my favorite scent and flavor so I love having a big bottle like this so I can use it for lots of different things.</li>
    <li> I received the peppermint oil, but it was&lt;br /&gt; Supposed to have a dropper.  It did nother.  I had to go and buy one.  Not happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my order. I can&#x27;t wait to try all the recipes that came with my Peppermint oil  :)</li>
    <li> Quality product. Great price. Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service.  It was amazing!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of the Peppermint Oil from La Lune Naturals to review. They sent it to me because I asked to review it for my boyfriend who suffers from IBS issues...well before he has had chance to try it out I got hit with killer sinus pressure along with a horrible headache this morning! :( After doing a sinus rinse and sitting in front of a humidifier nearly in tears from the pain I remembered we had this. I mixed a drop with a dollop of coconut oil and massaged it into my temples and around my sinus area and put a few drops of oil in the floor of my shower and sat in there with the hot water on full blast! Within minutes I could breathe again and the pressure has subsided! I&#x27;m new to using Essential Oils but this one is a keeper so far! I cannot express my gratitude to La Lune Naturals enough in responding to my plea for help for our family so quickly. I highly recommend getting this oil if you want natural means to relief for your family.</li>
    <li> Great, loved the eye drop for easy measure.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle at a great price</li>
    <li> This is a very good peppermint oil. It is a lot stronger than my normal oil that usually buy, but I&#x27;ve only used it in my diffuser so far so I can&#x27;t speak about anything else. It does help with allergies/congestion and headaches. I love it! Although it is strong right when I put it in there the scent seems to die down after awhile. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the diffuser or the oil. It&#x27;s still a really good essential oil. I&#x27;m fixing to try it out on these pesky ants!</li>
    <li> Love love this peppermint!!!! Thanks for making it reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this oil and learning about different ways to use it.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to receive this when I did, I had a migraine 2 days later and the peppermint oil was my life saver.....</li>
    <li> I love this peppermint oil. It really helps with stress, headaches,  and sinuses. I appreciate the seller, offering these great deals to try the products! I will continue to purchase from this seller,due to the great service!</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love to use this to help with nausea, smelling it really helps!</li>
    <li> Had mice, no longer. Just a few drops here and there and in the hallways and the smell, a pleasant one, fills the house. Slowly diminishes in strength over the days and we replace about once a week.</li>
    <li> Worked for my headache.  I rubbed a drop into each temple and my headache went away.  It&#x27;s very potent so I recommend diluting a bit with a carrier oil such as jojoba or sweet almond oil.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and the large size - it&#x27;ll last a nice long while.  Thanks and I&#x27;ll be trying it in my homemade toothpaste as well as an ant deterrent very soon.</li>
    <li> Use it before workouts and it really gets me energized</li>
    <li> great product  fast service</li>
    <li> awesome deal on this peppermint</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review this fast . . . I was expecting my Peppermint Oil from Amazon at work today. Shortly after eating lunch, I began having stomach cramps that felt like a gallstone attack (Yes, I&#x27;ve had those but not in eons.). I took some TUMS because it was all that was available but it wasn&#x27;t putting a dent on my discomfort (and stomach trouble is EXTREMELY unusual for me). My order arrived in the late afternoon and, after opening, it I remembered reading somewhere that peppermint settles stomach distress. I added a few drops to my drinking water and started sipping. It did the trick! Within minutes the pain subsided and I was a happy camper again. Thank you La Lune Naturals and Amazon! You saved the day!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST peppermint oil I&#x27;ve ever used! I will be a loyal customer from now on! I don&#x27;t want to use any other kind. Only takes a very little for whatever use need. Thank you La Lune.</li>
    <li> Excellent products. I know there are many other uses for peppermint oil but we are using it to repel wasps and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is really nice, I use it for everything ! Thank for such a great product !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. They wrapped it in two layers of bubble wrap but I could still smell the peppermint after taking off the outermost layer. I&#x27;m happy this product has a stopper since other jars of oil have only the lid and you had to figure out another way to apply the oil to the places I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use this on the inside of my kitchen garbage can and it&#x27;s usually powerful enough to mask any other smells. Also, since we had a mice problem I&#x27;m planning to use this in each room of our house. Mice find the smell of peppermint too strong or unappealing and they will stay away from that scent. Hopefully this will work.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Peppermint Oil to use around the house because I heard it worked on insects. So far, it&#x27;s proven to be true.  I haven&#x27;t seen any unwelcome roaches since I&#x27;ve begun using it. I love its size, its scent and was pleasantly surprised to receive an online recipe book with the many ways you can use   the oil.</li>
    <li> The quality of the oil is great, and the speed of filling the order was the fastest I have ever experience.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! When mixed with water in a spray bottle, it makes a great deterrent for ants and spiders. I just spray around the baseboards and ceiling moldings. Also smells great. There are several more uses that I haven&#x27;t tried, but will soon.</li>
    <li> Product was received quickly and is excellent.  Thanks for the recipe book; that is a nice touch!</li>
    <li> Love this peppermint oil!  It goes great with the La Lune Naturals face masks I have! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this Peppermint Oil to add to my homemade dog shampoo because it repels fleas and, so far, it works wonderfully!  The added bonus is that my dogs smell like candy canes and it&#x27;s so uplifting.  Everyone wants to hold one of the fur babies and nuzzle in their neck, to the delight of the dogs.  I&#x27;m excited to try some of the free recipes that came with my order. :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many recipes this product is used for. I can&#x27;t wait to try them all. What a great soothing smell. This helps with my stress and headaches. Very recommended.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  I have really been getting into using oils and this one is fantastic!  There are so many uses for peppermint oil!  I could not believe how large the bottle was either for the price...great deal!  My house already smells amazing too!  Cannot say enough great things about this product!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and was amazed at the size if the bottle what a great value I would definitely order from this company again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for essential oils in general and especially soft when it comes to peppermint. It has, like, a thousand uses. I have used LaLune&#x27;s to wipe down counters, use as a foot rub, for aromatherapy mist from my diffuser, to disinfect/deodorize my toothbrushes, to heighten the flavor of mint tea. I could go on. I like the dropper (though mine is slightly defective - it does not hold the oil in, but drips even without the bulb being depressed). I still give it five stars for quality and value.</li>
    <li> Good, Pure, &amp; Strong peppermint oil.  Comes with a long dropper in the bag.  Good quality peppermint oil in amber glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also comes with a free ebook with recipes and uses for peppermint oil.  It is a good size bottle and will last a long time. Peppermint candy anyone?!?</li>
    <li> Good product with multiple uses. I put a little drop of this whenever I do a mask and it feels great..</li>
    <li> The smell of this is just heavenly.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was really fragrant I had it in the dresser drawer every time I opened the drawerwhat an aroma it gave loving it going to make a room fresher.</li>
    <li> Received item on time and it exceeded my expectation.  A little seems to go a long way.</li>
    <li> I received a wonderful bottle of Peppermint Essential Oil from La Lune Naturals in exchange for an honest review. I was super excited to try this product since I&#x27;ve heard one of it&#x27;s benefits is Migraine help. I get migraines from time to time and I recently had one that nothing I took made it leave, so when I received this, I used it to make it leave.  I put a small amount of oil on my temples and the migraine went away! Incredible! The product is really easy to use and the packaging is beautiful! The bottle also contains a generous supply that will last a long time.  I gave some to my daughter to use for a cold sore, turns out she needed an antibiotic instead, but it did help dry it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peppermint Essential Oil helps with many other issues.  For instance add some to a steamer.  When placed in a steamer, peppermint oil can help reduce mucus in the throat. Simply add a few drops of peppermint oil to boiling water and breathe in the steam.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural and can be used for many more things!  This product totally does what it claims. Shipping was super quick too! I would totally recommend this product to anyone needing such an oil!</li>
    <li> This is such a huge help with both achey muscles, and migraine headaches! I now smell like a candy cane, but I love how well it works! I shared some with a friend, and she is a firm believer as well. I will never let myself run out of peppermint oil again. (I also shared with my father for his arthritis!)</li>
