<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The shampoo is great for me.  The conditioner is a little to heavy for my hair.  Having cancer and losing my hair I am trying all sorts of things to give me more volume.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Shampoo provides volume.. Use conditioner sparingly, Heavy for thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have been getting Brazilian blowouts for the past 3 years about every six months. I&#x27;ve tried so many sulfate and sodium free shampoos - even the brand name one that you are &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to use.  This is BY FAR MY FAVORITE -- I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It is light, refreshing, no overpowering smells (because I am super sensitive to that) and I feel like it cleans my hair and doesn&#x27;t strip out the blowout.</li>
    <li> Excellent for fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. Smells great without being over-powering.</li>
    <li> To me it smells a little manly. Like men&#x27;s deodorant or cologne. I find myself reaching for whatever else is in my shower instead, but I&#x27;ll probably give it another chance.</li>
    <li> Althugh it  does give the volume that it states I do not care for the dried out feeling of my hair during and after washing</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing didn&#x27;t have anything that upset my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this product! I had such high hopes after reading so many positive reviews. However, I ended up disappointed. While it may have added some volume, it left my hair very dry. It felt as if I hadn&#x27;t used conditioner at all. I usually do not have a difficult time combing my hair, but as I said, after using this, it felt like I hadn&#x27;t used any conditioner at all! The conditioner was a huge disappointment! The scent was masculine. On another note, I have used Alterna&#x27;s instant repair rx shampoo and conditioner, and loved it! Think I&#x27;ll go back to that!</li>
    <li> It has taken me FOREVER to find a shampoo/conditioner that cleans my hair without weighing it down. I have thin and, unfortunately, greasy hair that is easily weighed down by products. These products are free of parabens and sulfates which I think really help thin-haired people! I know this product works because I can go a couple of days between washes now. The first day I washed my hair I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t need to adjust or correct my pony tail during the day; I&#x27;m used to constantly correcting my hairstyle throughout the day because pony tail holders and clips will just slide out my hair (braids will also come undone), even with hair spray. Now everything stays in place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this brand on Ulta&#x27;s website, but they were cheaper here. I also purchased the Alterna Bamboo Sustainable Volume Hair Spray and Plumping Strand Expand.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t find anything too special about this shampoo and conditioner. It was just okay. I still love Lanza products.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast, and the product is the best I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does NOT make my hair greasy and also I can use it for a really long time without switching to another shampoo. You have to buy both the shampoo and conditioner together. Also my hair is thin and grows really slow but somehow its making my hair grow faster or maybe its me. I am buying this shampoo from now on!</li>
    <li> I really liked the shampoo. I have fine hair, and I did see improvement in volume from the first wash. Also it is important that it does not have any harmful substances, which makes it all the better.</li>
    <li> Very well packaged and wrapped. Been using several days now and like the shampoo and conditioner a lot!</li>
    <li> my wife says it is just so so; not bad, and also not very good; if you are not picky, this product can do</li>
    <li> The shampoo drys out my hair and causes frizziness and more severe hair loss. I do not recommend. The conditioner does not help.</li>
    <li> Did an amazing job, smell is wonderful, ( I did question whether it smelled more on the masculine side, but hubby says no) and am pretty darn pleased with the quality.  Gotta say, my hair is very, very soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> My hair is fuller and looks great.  Works as is stated,  Not falling out like it was and has repaired the problems I was having</li>
    <li> I previously raved about the Lanza product line, but from time to time I like to mix it up. I received a free sample of this product and fell in love! It smells divine and gives my hair some extra volume. I have fairly thick, naturally wavy, highlighted bobbed hair. This product keeps it all manageable. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely adds volume to your hair.  The problem with it is your hair doesn&#x27;t feel as clean and a follow-up washing is soon necessary.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me I would not spend my money to buy this product again</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo and conditioner that does not weigh the hair done.</li>
    <li> Got it today excited to use it</li>
    <li> I purchased this on sale previously looking for volume and no sulfates. It works very well on my long very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love it and will buy it again.  Love the smell and makes my hair feel great and so soft.  Wish it was in more stores</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this product and the volume it gives my hair is really great. Just what my seventy year old hair needs.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Makes my hair super soft, but it feels limper and greasier than normal. I probably will not buy again, but I will use it up and rotate my shampoo.</li>
    <li> my favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Dried out my hair and did not work as well as other shampoos I used.</li>
    <li> Alterna has great products.  It does what it claims.  I have used the Bamboo products before and came back for more.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alterna Shampoo and Conditioner for several months now. I&#x27;ve been searching for an eco-friendly product that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my hair or weigh it down. I have a lot of hair but it is very fine and most products make it limp or heavy, This product leaves my hair silky, shiny and full. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> All three of these products are fabuous - light weight - great for my naturally curly hair.  I love them all - love them</li>
    <li> uck. smell is ok, but your hair will be dry</li>
    <li> I have always had healthy hair and have taken good care of it (I don&#x27;t use heat on it very often, I deep condition it regularly, I get it cut regularly, and don&#x27;t color it), but it has always looked a little flat, lifeless (even the color), and frizzy. I had always attributed my frizziness to having wavy hair and the lifelessness/flatness to having crappy hair. The first time I used these products, my frizz had gone down considerably, my color looked deeper, my hair looked shinier and healthier, and it felt awesome (I kept asking my sister to touch my hair because I couldn&#x27;t believe how awesome it felt)! After washing my hair, I do always put a little bit of argan or coconut oil in my hair while it&#x27;s damp (this is something I have done for a while so I know the results I have gotten are from this product). I found out about this product on a gluten free blog (glutenfreeanonymous.com). I recently found out that I am gluten intolerant and hadn&#x27;t even thought about checking out my beauty products for gluten until I read this on that blog. I was reading the blog and noticed that the writers of the blog had some similar hair issues to me before they tried gluten-free hair products. I am sure it also helps that these products are also free from a lot of crap that many other shampoos and conditioners have. This has made a huge difference in my hair and I notice an improvement every time I wash it and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love Alterna products. They are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I previously ordered the little bag from alterna with the volume shampoo and conditioner and a volume spay for wet and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited how good it works and I could&#x27;nt wait to get it again so I ordered a normal size but this product doesn&#x27;t work at all for me! It doesn&#x27;t give my hair any volume and it dryed out my scalp so I would have these little white things in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutly don&#x27;T recomment it!!!</li>
    <li> Alterna has great products.  There are literally millions of shampoos and conditions on the market.  I have very fine (and thanks to menopause) now thin hair.  Bleh!  These products do help to pump up the volume.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from my sister-in-law.  Prior to finding Bamboo products, I was considering getting a wig.  Then I cut my hair short.  After two weeks of Bamboo, I&#x27;m looking forward to growing my hair back.  I am a fanatical, organic eater, so my 59 year old thinning hair was very frustrating.  Thank you Bamboo!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It&#x27;s not going to change your life, but it does a reasonable job.  Women who color their hair claim that it&#x27;s gentle on the color, but I can&#x27;t verify that.</li>
    <li> BAD...  I can&#x27;t not understand how a so expensive shampoo conditioner can be so bad.  Leaves your hair so dry, worst than a cheapy shampoo.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner.  I wash my hair at night (to save time in the morning), and this leaves my hair with more volume than I expected.  It smells wonderful.  I can&#x27;t wait to try other products by Alterna!</li>
    <li> Loooooove this stuff for fine hair....try the 48 hr volume spray booster too.  I love the smell of it and the results</li>
    <li> My all time favorite shampoo.  I have very thin and fine hair and this shampoo, heck their whole product line, does wonders.  I can go at least two days now without washing my hair, the conditioner is not over powering, the smell is wonderful.  I love, love, this product.  You just need to try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner works no better or worse than any other. Skip this and buy a less expensive brand. Buy try the 48 Hour Sustainable Volume Spray. Seller is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for thin and thinning hair. I have exclusively used this for 1 year and counting.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Does what it says it will. Fuller thicker feeling and looking hair  Alterna Bamboo Abundant and Volume Shampoo and Conditioner.[[ASIN:B006J6R23M Alterna Bamboo Abundant Volume Shampoo and Conditioner Set (8.5 Oz Each)]]</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo and conditioner. I only wash my hair once a week and I alternate this and Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner. Works wonderful and smells great! Great price for the set!</li>
    <li> I started with the Bamboo leave in thickener and was so impressed that I bought the shampoo and conditioner as well.  They work so well together and, though, expensive for this kind of product, well worth it!  After the third time of using it, I found less falling hair and less breakage and much more thickness and volume - not to mention softness and manageability.  My hairdresser was very impressed with the condition of my hair at my last appointment,</li>
    <li> I treid Alterna a few months ago and its great. I have long hair that gets kinds frizzy and this stuff really works to thicken and add volume</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  My favorite of all products I have used.  Volume, shine, fragrance, texture!  I highly recommend to all who have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Alterna&#x27;s products have always been my favorite, but I can&#x27;t seem to find their &amp;#34;green bottle&amp;#34; product as easily as some others lately, so I made the switch to their Bamboo shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried at first, because the shampoo comes out gel-like (pretty thick) versus the normal &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; shampoo, but after weeks of using this stuff it&#x27;s pretty clear that the quality is there. Proof is in the hair! My normally thin strands look like they&#x27;re on steroids! This coupled with daily biotin has really made a huge difference in strength and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great for dyed blonde hair too because it doesn&#x27;t suck out the color. Also love the smell - very delicate but fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the cost is a little pricey, but a little bit goes a long way here.  I anticipate this will last me a good 4 months, and I can swallow paying 10 bucks a month for great hair!</li>
    <li> Not worth the expense. Wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much for this. No better than other less expense shampoo/conditioner for my very fine hair. Actually love Ogx B5.</li>
    <li> The shampoo dried out my hair. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful and fresh.  I look forward to using them.  I like them so much I purchased 64 oz bottles of each.  It&#x27;s great to use a shampoo without sulfate and unneeded chemicals.  My hair is always fresh and shiny and I don&#x27;t need to shampoo as often.  Great for my long hair and my color holds.  It adds nice volume and easy comb outs and  great manageability.  Try it, you&#x27;ll feel the same, I&#x27;m sure.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE WAY MY HAIR FEELS AND LOOKS!!  SOFT AND SILKY, NOT FRIZZY!  I HOPE THIS PRODUCT GOES ON SALE.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really awesome!!  My mother and I both have really fine, thin, straight hair!  A curse!!  If we ever use a conditioner, in general, it only makes it worse by totally making it feel thinner &amp; limper!!  Not with Alterna!  It makes our hair after rinsing, feel very thin in the shower.  It, like other conditioners, makes our hair tangle free.  But the HUGE difference is, it does really add body &amp; volume when you finish processing your hair!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> Makes the wifes hair look and smell great.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t deliver on its advertising.  Gave it to my husband.  Sounds wonderful, smells good, expensive.  Would have been great if it had lived up to its description.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Katie Holmes? She is one of the owners and spokesmodel both. Great shampoo and conditioner. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  I&#x27;M A SENIOR CITIZEN AND MY HAIR IS GETTING DRYER.  THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO HELP.  SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  The Bamboo products are so awesome.  I have some of the other products in their lines and just love them all.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the shampoo is the wonderful, fresh scent that lasts and lasts.  You&#x27;ll still be able to smell the amazing scent the following day. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair limp and heavy. It&#x27;s actually the first condition I have tossed out after the first use in ages.  A small amount of both products goes a long way and as advertised, when you blow dry you&#x27;ll get lots of volume. It works. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. It smells like a man&#x27;s deodorant. The effect on volume is unnoticeable, but does leave hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Adds some volume to my thinning hair.  Use the Alterna  Strand plumper also</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Leave some conditioner in hair. Keeps frizz away.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help me with my fine limp hair. Although it did wash my hair good and not dry it out as much, my hair was just as limp as before I started to use this shampoo.  It does smell really nice and leaves your hair with a very pleasant subtle scent.  My husband liked that. I guess I am still looking for the shampoo to help put life back into my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and it makes my hair feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I first tried the regular version of the Alterna bamboo shampoo and conditioner. It worked so great with my red color treated hair I had to try the volumizing version. I can tell a difference and my hair definitely has some oomph to it all day. I&#x27;m very please and it&#x27;s well worth the price. I wash my hair everyday and one bottle last about 4 months for me.</li>
    <li> The wife goes through lots of different shampoos and conditioners due to her heavy long hair.  this product actually made her happy.  Doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy and leaves it manageable.</li>
    <li> Much too heavy and does not provide volume to thin or fine hair.  It weighs hair down.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I normally do not leave reviews (hardly have time) but I do want to take few seconds and say something about this product - I love to treat my hair nice and get all kinds of goodies for hair, but by far this is the best Volume Shampoo and Conditioner I have ever used, and believe me I have used a lot! My hair is really long, and baby fine ( a lot of it) this product will not give you dramatic \\&quot;huge\\&quot; hair ( no product will) but you will notice the difference in body, bounce and shine - believe me you will. Even, I on my long baby fine hair, noticed. Not only that, but the seller had the packet nicely secured in the box and it was brand new on all Alterna Bamboo products I got. Nothing out there will give you dramatic valume, sorry its and the ugly truth - but this product will creat bounce and some lift, BUT you will feel it under your fingers. I would recommand this product my friends and anyone that ask.</li>
    <li> Conditioner bottle very hard to operate.</li>
    <li> Very good product to maintain healthy hair.  I&#x27;ve even noticed some new growth at hairline.  Rather expensive but lasts for months so still cost effective.</li>
    <li> The shampoo seems to work okay, but when I used both my hair was flat and greasy.  I bought it because it is gluten free, but instead I just use it on my little one so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste. I purchased NUMA instead and like it much better.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair never looked better. Product was as described. Shipping was great. Arrived ahead of time!</li>
    <li> Since the bottles came unsealed, some of the shampoo and/or conditioner had leaked and gotten on the bottles, so I had to wash them after arrival. Otherwise, they appear to be the real deal.</li>
    <li> I love this line of shampoos. While I like this one alot, and love the conditioner, I prefer the Daily Clarifying shampoo. I usually use the clarifier with Bamboo conditioner. Love that combo. The Alterna line is a little pricey, but I think it evens out. You just spend a larger &amp;#34;chunk&amp;#34; of $ at once instead of spreading it over 3 months. I think in the end, you may save a little $.</li>
    <li> For a long time my hair was limp and flat.  But, I was afraid if I went with a volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner it would dry out my hair.  Living in the frozen north and traditionally having dry hair, I used hydrating products for years.  Until my hair would not respond and no matter what products I used would go flat.&lt;br /&gt;I read Alterna Volumizing had some light hydration in it but, not weigh hair down.&lt;br /&gt;So, today I used both the shampoo and conditioner and wow!  My hair was soft, easy to manage and style and had alot of shine.  Plus the volume!&lt;br /&gt;I am now a fan of Alterna and will be making this my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is worth the extra cost for what it does for your hair. And it since my hair is short it only takes a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, shiny and has body even when I use my straighter.</li>
    <li> It made my hair lay kind of flat. Don&#x27;t know if I received a defective product or what.</li>
    <li> My salon uses this so purchased shampoo &amp; conditioner. Works great. Only complaint is seems to create build up like most shampoos.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo and conditioner! It smells wonderful but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t seen any change in volume! I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals! Just too expensive!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner was just the trick for my baby fine, curly (aging) hair which I wear in a chin-length bob and blow straight each day. Because my hair is fine, I feel the need to wash it daily to restore the style and body; this shampoo provides volume but is not drying like many other volumizing shampoos that I have tried. I also bought the accompanying styling products and they perform great as well. It is such a relief to finally find a product line  that works; now I just have to keep my fingers crossed that it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued!</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first use, but after using it for a couple of weeks I am finding that it is leaving my hair a tangled mess.  I haven&#x27;t noticed additional volume and my hair feels dry.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed considering the price and the brand.  My long hair which is in healthy condition was left oily at the roots and dry at the ends.  May just not be suitable for my hair type, however will definitely not be repurchasing.  I kept thinking maybe i was not washing enough but the formula doesn&#x27;t seem to be cleaning my hair at the roots- within 24 hours of washing it looks and feels like i haven&#x27;t showered in days. YUCK! Highly disappointed considering the cost and surprised since it is supposed to be volumizing.  I like Alterna&#x27;s Anti-aging line much better.</li>
    <li> I was referred to the brand and it works great.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for a few weeks---it strong smell but its not bad---I&#x27;ve grown to like it--the man in life also likes it----does a good job on volume---will order again was so glad I found this product---if you are like me fine hair is a hard to work with but this product makes it easier &amp; your hair look nicer</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight and limp hair and have spent years searching for the best shampoo and conditioner to help with my hair.  I can honestly say, Alterna Bamboo Abundant Volume Shampoo and Conditioner is the absolute BEST in it&#x27;s field!  Just cannot adequately express in words how much this stuff helps my kind of hair!  Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed I promise!!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST smelling shampoo and conditioner I have ever used in my entire life! Sometimes when using sulfate free shampoo it leaves a strange residue and feels as though your hair did not get cleaned, then when styling your hair will have absolutely 0 shine and feel almost fried. I used Alterna Bamboo Abundant Volume shampoo and conditioner for the first time and knew right away this was the perfect product for me! I have thick dark hair, it&#x27;s wavy and I straighten it. When I blow dry my hair I can feel such a difference from the shampoo I will be using this product for a very long time!! The kendi oil dry mist is a must!!</li>
    <li> The scent of this is almost like a feminine cologne–it smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t weigh down finer hair.</li>
    <li> Great price, love the product.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Great product.  Fast shipping.</li>
