<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Filters were sucked down into the tubing and plugged up machine. Really good results from machine when it was working though. VERY disappointed with how the filters don&#x27;t stay in head.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought this! Don&#x27;t bother with other machines! After looking for a long time or personal Microdermabrashion system, I finally decided to buy this one.  If you can get over the price then get it. Other machines don&#x27;t use a diamond tip so crystals get in your eyes and then you have to buy crystals which is more money.  You won&#x27;t believe what comes off your face when you use it for the first time, it&#x27;s gross haha! Happy buying 😊</li>
    <li> The results appear similar to what I was seeing with professional services which was on overall healthier and radiant appearance when used with my daily products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin with sun damage that comes with being mid 40s.</li>
    <li> I used to pay $70 per visit at the dermatologist&#x27;s office, but I could no longer afford that, so I started researching at-home options. I spent a few months looking in to different machines and this was the only one I found with consistently good reviews. I&#x27;ve only used this machine once, but I am very pleased so far. The suction is right on par with professional machines. There&#x27;s also a really good variety of tips to use depending on your skin type and where you are using it. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the instructions are not very good at all. I finally gave up and watched a YouTube video, which explained it much better. It only took about 1 minute to hook up after watching the video, so I highly recommend doing that!</li>
    <li> It took some time to research a good microderm machine.  One of the most important aspects for me was the suction and how many tips the machine had. After much debate, I purchased the Kendal HBSF01. I was a bit skeptical when the box came from China, but after using the machine for a few months, I LOVE IT! I have had microderms for years at salons and this is just as good. The suction is powerful and the variety of tips gives you a choice of different texture levels.  I would buy it again and recommend it to everyone! The time spent researching the product was well worth it. Five Stars!</li>
    <li> I love this machine. It took me 4 months before deciding because of a negative comments on it. I regret not buying it sooner. I highly recommend. I love my skin. Worth the money....</li>
    <li> I love it! Such good quality for the price and the same exact model the spa i work for uses. Definitely worth the investment to start up your own business!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my oily/combination skin. I am 30 and my pores are getting bigger. This machine is very basic and the tips wear quickly which makes me question the quality. It does an good job of removing the dead skin but only if I use it in conjunction with a salicylic and glycolic acid peel. When I used it with out the peel I had poor results and my skin was irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost was very reasonable and I have used it 4 times and each time the suction is strong and consistent. I watched YouTube videos to learn the direction to move the wand on my face. There are a lot of filters that come with the machine. The small flat filters that came in the machine were black, I called the company about this and they said it was because they test the suction prior to shipping. There is also a good selection of tips to choose from with two solid metal wands. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating is because the tips aren&#x27;t very good. I am guessing I will have to replace the frequently used tips at least three to four times a year. Overall, for the cost it was a decent purchase and has already paid for itself considering it does cost $75 for one treatment at the spa I go to. My skin does look &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; after I use it and it has been good for removing stubborn blackheads.</li>
    <li> very good deal works perfect</li>
    <li> I almost bought the  Nubrilliance microdermabrasion machine after seeing an infomercial, but too many poor reviews and you had to keep buying disposable tips etc. I found this Kendal brand and for slightly more $ I got a solid quality machine with reuseable metal tips and a variety of different tips for different uses. Aside from \\&quot;refinishing\\&quot; my face I have found this invaluable for the huge ugly and sore zit I get once a month. Only one chin zit, but one horrible whitehead. This may sound gross, but I use my Kendall to suck out the pus after popping. It helps my zit to heal faster than when I tried to extract it by hand, and with less trauma to the surrounding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too had the switch break, it was the plastic push button, not the switch itself that broke. One day, after a couple months of use I went to use it and the red plastic button had broken apart, as if the plastic failed. Aside from the white housing, this is the only plastic part in the unit.  I could still use it, but eventually the rest of the button fell off. I contacted the seller (keep the papers that comes in the box as contact information is on it), and they immediatly mailed me another switch. I had to have my husband replace it  because it does have to be soldered to the wires, but if he had not been able to do it, I am sure I could have sent it in for them to do but I don&#x27;t know about the postage.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bought mine last year so hopefully they realized there was a problem and got a new button supplier.&lt;br /&gt;I love having a professional machine at home. It has paid for itself many times over from salon appointments and the time convenience as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer who had a bad experience should contact Shining Image and have them help her, no matter how long ago she bought it, because they would realize the problem is the button plastic. I doubt we are the only two with the problem and their customer service was great for me.</li>
    <li> this machine is amazing and solid.</li>
    <li> I purchased this May 2012, and I&#x27;ve been using it on a consistent basis over the past 2.5 years. I have been very satisfied with the machine and had no problems whatsoever. Yes, it was an expensive purchase, but the machine paid for itself quickly as often as I use it. I prefer the diamond tips over crystals (I had a terrible reaction to professional crystal micro and left me with swollen eyes for 4 days back in 2002). I prefer to use this machine more frequently (every 2 weeks) with - gentle setting and fewer passes, so I am not recovering from a sunburned appearance over the next few days. This machine is high quality, and I am happy that I took the risk to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but I&#x27;ve had a terrible time comparing the different microdermabrasion systems.  I just purchased the HB-SF01 directly from Shining-Image.com and I chose this machine for a couple of reasons.  I should note that I haven&#x27;t received the product yet so my five star rating is somewhat misleading (sorry but I had to put something in as a placeholder.  I will update this review after I receive and use the machine).  However, for those of you who are weighing your options, I thought the following information might be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I evaluated a total of five different microdermabrasion machines:&lt;br /&gt;1) The Kendal BM01 (Kendal Diamond Microdermabrasion Dermabrasion Machine for Facial Skin Care Bm01);&lt;br /&gt;2) The Kendal BM02 (Kendal 3 in 1 Diamond Microdermabrasion Dermabrasion Machine w/ Vacuum &amp; Spray including 360 cotton filters and 2 plastic oil filters BM02);&lt;br /&gt;3) This one (Kendal Professional Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine HB-SF01);&lt;br /&gt;4) The Diamond Microdermabrasion Portable Machine NEW SPA HOME Skin Care Kit; and&lt;br /&gt;5) The MicrodermMD Medical Grade Home Microdermabrasion Machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was particularly interested in suction power because I have large pores and stubborn blackheads.  There are other variables as well, like the number of diamond heads, etc., but suction power is one thing that can be independently measured, verified, and used as a point of comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction power of these machines is measured in inches - or in one case millimeters - per Hg.  I looked up Hg with respect to vacuums and I found this quote: \\&quot;The Hg in regards to a vacuum stands for Mercury. This is directly related to the functionality of the vacuum and what it is capable of doing. This measures pressure.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m no expert but I assume that higher inches/Hg equals more pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Diamond Microdermabrasion Portable Machine NEW SPA HOME Skin Care Kit specifically states in its description that it has \\&quot;up to 16\\&quot; Hg suction\\&quot; so that one is taken care of right in its description.  The others do not provide this data so I contacted the manufacturers/distributers directly.  The three Kendal machines are difficult to compare from their descriptions so I also asked the distributer, Shining-Image.Com, about the differences between the three models.  Here is their response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;BM01/SF01: The difference is that SF01 has a dial plate indicating real time pressure.  BM01 does not have it.  BM01 has a carrying case for easy traveling, with 2 pounds less in weight.  Suction pressure for the SF01 is up to 26\\&quot;/Hg while BM01 is up to 23\\&quot;/Hg.&lt;br /&gt;BM02/SF01: The BM02 has extra vacuum/spray function with a maximum suction pressure of 23\\&quot;/Hg.  The SF01 (stated above) has a dial showing real pressure with a maximum pressure of 26\\&quot;/Hg.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also contacted Trophy Skin, manufacturer of the MicrodermMD Medical Grade Home Microdermabrasion Machine.  They measure suction in millimeters and their response was that the machine has 450mm/Hg.  If we convert 450 millimeters to inches, we get a power of 17.716\\&quot;/Hg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when all is said and done, the Kendal HB-SF01, at up to 26\\&quot;/Hg, has the greatest suction power.  That said, suction power is obviously not the only consideration here and may or may not mean the machine is any good.  But this is the one I chose.  I will update this review after receiving and using the product.  I hope this was helpful to those of you evaluating microdermabrasion systems!</li>
    <li> After I went for a round of 6 professional microdermabrasion treatments *I had the crystal microdermabrasion used in the spa* I noticed how great my skin was after that so  I did LOTS of research to find a salon quality diamond tipped microdermabrasion machine.   The reason I chose diamond tipped is for many reasons;  1.  Cheaper because you do not have to replace crystals like other machines. Also, when I was using the salon my results were inconsistant.  About 3 out of 6 provided obvious results.  When her chrystal machine was working properly I had great results but when It was not I would leave there with chrystals all cloging my pores. Also I would have the Aluminum oxide crystals in my nose.  If I would have been smarter I woulnt have gotton a treatment with chrystals because having them enter your lungs can be dangerous:( Since I loved the good resluts I decided to research how to get a diamond tipped one they give NO debri (all skin sucked up is put threw two filters that should be replaced after each session.    2.  The diamond tips can be cleaned with a soft *must be a soft* tooth brush, toothpaste or dawn and hot water *Be sure before putting any of your tips near the sink that you have a plug in the sink. You would not want to loose any of these precious tips.  Diamond tips are also far better for your health than the *crystal system* because there is not any debri put into the air and since it is diamond tipped there is nothing to clog pores.  From my experience with the chrystals I had inconsistant results becuse the machine has to both blast out chrystals and suck the debri up at the same time.  The Professional Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine HB-SF01 by Kendal is the absolute highest product on the market. This product is the type that is used in day spas and dermatologist offices. It comes with 9 different diamond tips.     3. It is very easy to use and easy to clean. To find a good deal on filters contact me and I will help you find the cheapestfilters.    Also, I would highly recommend any one who wants greater detail about what I wrote above go to:  [...]    4. I also recommend purchasing a facial steamer like this one   [...]  - If you look at the comments you will see mine :) Katie Katiek    I do hope anyone who wants amazing skin try these products.    Katie  Coweta, Ok</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this machine I had been receiving professional Microderm treatments every 5 weeks for the last 2 years. This machine paid for itself after 2 uses. It arrives with easy to follow instructions and is easy to use.  I love it. I miss the pampering from the esthetician so will return to her for other treatments but it is wonderful to have this machine to use at my convenience. It comes with everything you need. I got a quick though not entirely clear response to a question I emailed sender, but I figured out what I needed to know anyway. I highly recommend this product if you are serious about taking good care of your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dermatolgist and I bought this for my office.&lt;br /&gt;I simply love i.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, to assemble, to clean, and the results are very good</li>
    <li> Good gift for my wife - she really enjoys it.  Maybe the Manufacturer will some day include specific documentation for this model so we don&#x27;t look for buttons that are NOT there.  Must be really hard &amp; rocket science to accomplish this.</li>
    <li> I love microdermabrasion facials but I cannot afford to get them as often as I would like (in my area they run $80-100 per treatment). So I decided to research a microderm machine that was reasonably priced and would give me spa quality results. I decided to buy this machine mostly b/c of the reviews. So far I am very satisfied.  I did my first facial yesterday. The results were silky smooth skin just like the spa facials!  There&#x27;re 9 different options as far as grit and size and the manual informs you as to which ones to use for what area.  The beauty of having this machine is I can do my facials at home and save some money too. If you have any reluctance on purchasing this machine because of the cost rest assured the machine will pay for itself in 2-3 uses.</li>
    <li> Have had this for a couple of years.  It does a great job of exfoliating my skin.  Not sure that it has helped with my wrinkles but for my age my skin has never looked better.  Just be careful not to overdo it.  This is a professional grade product and it doesn&#x27;t take much to abrade the delicate skin around your eyes and nose.</li>
    <li> Received machine with attachments as described.  This came in the mail very quickly. Easy to assemble and use.  I was very happy with the results.  I&#x27;m glad that I decided and purchased this particular machine.</li>
    <li> I was looking at getting microdermabrasion procedures done on me for some superficial scars, fine lines, pore reductioon and over all texture of my skin. I found that the procedure runs from $80-$$200 a visit. I looked all over and I researched each model that amazon has listed and I read the reviews of this machine and while there are only a few reviews I really felt good about this machine. I am so happy I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is a 9 pound machine, this is a professional machine.&lt;br /&gt;2. It comes with 9 different heads that can be used and the box tells you which head for which area.&lt;br /&gt;3. It comes with a booklet that tells you how much suction to use on each area, as well as how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;4. It comes with a whole bunch of filters and if you get it from the Shining company when you run out they said contact them for replacement filters. They are awesome too! great customer service! I asked about filters and they responded on a weekend within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once so far I have had it less then one week, and it has serious suction, I was not sure how it was working, I took before pictures that I will update every 5 weeks until I am at the results I am seeking. In one use there was a difference in my skin texture that I could see when comparing to the pictures and days later my skin is still super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review with before and after photos when I have them. My first use was on January 23rd 2012.</li>
    <li> Too large for available amount of suction</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 34 year old guy and I&#x27;m starting to really notice some fine lines around my eyes.  I also acquired a new scar across the bridge of my nose after a nasty fall.  So I started getting some rather expensive microdermabrasion treatments on a weekly basis.  I found this machine on amazon and hoped that it would give me comparable results to the salon treatments.  I have been thoroughly impressed with the device and I&#x27;m getting great results.  The fine lines are diminishing and the scar is 98% gone. My pores are smaller and my skin has a nice even tone now.    I&#x27;m not only treating my face, but also the back of the neck where my skin looks a bit thick and sun damaged.  It would cost me a fortune to microderm both the face and neck professionally on a weekly basis.  Also, I love that I don&#x27;t end up with sand in my mouth and ears after the treatment like I did with the old fashioned kind of microderm.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what was described.  I have been usding this for a couple of months now and still have the same suction as when I first purchased.  I know that I will eventually need to purchase new tips.  But you can find them on Amazon sold as singles.  I was happy with the results on my overall acne.  I also see my age spots minimizing because I can use it often (3 times per week).  I am 36 years old and was told to be careful not to use it too frequently, but I think my skin handles it well.  I have done lots of professional microdermabrasion in the past.  I think this gives me better results because I needed to be able to do it more frequently to keep my cystic (hormonal type) acne under control.  I have told a friend of mine to purchase it.  I will be alternating with chemical peels going forward because I have reached my goal for the minimization of age spots.  I know that mechanical exfoliation should not be the only type of procedure for anti-aging.  My anesthetician recommended chemical peel for more collagen stimulation.</li>
    <li> Great product! Absolutely love the way it makes my face feel!!!!</li>
    <li> I really can see the difference</li>
    <li> Purchased this item and it arrived at my front door in less than a week!  it was very easy to assemble and clean. I used it right away and quickly learned that I need to practice!  My face looked ridiculous after words.  I looked like a cat attacked my face and it remained like that, plus red, inflamed and swollen, for about a week.  But once it subsided my skin did look brighter and smoother.  I will watch more youtube videos and will try again in a few days.  Hoping to do a better job the next time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this machine for just over a month and have done 4 treatments. I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in my skin tone; my face is so soft and smooth. I have deep acne so it&#x27;ll be a little longer before my face is completely clear but it&#x27;s definitely helping with scars and helping my skin purge. I&#x27;ve gone from wearing heavy foundation to light powder and blush.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this machine. I use it only once a month, but I can definitely see a difference in the over appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> This machine works. if you are a Salon or spa looking for a machine that works this is it. we use it only for facial treatments and our clients have been very happy with results.</li>
    <li> I am an RN who worked in a derm practice doing cosmetic procedures, including microdermabrasion.  I transitioned into a new role several years ago, and missed having my free monthly microdermabrasion treatments.  On the rare occasion since then, I would splurge, and spend $125 per treatment.  I often entertained the idea of buying my own machine, but knowing that the machine I used on patients cost $9000, (even a used one is priced at over $4000), I couldn&#x27;t justify the expense.&lt;br /&gt;A recent email from one of the popular &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34; websites advertised the NuBrilliance Microdermabrasion Machine for slightly more than the cost of one treatment by an aesthetician.  It was a weak moment, and I took the bait.  When the machine arrived, I found it to be very light-weight and the attachments to be very cheap (easily cracked or breakable) and poor fitting.  I turned the machine on, and had no suction.  In fact, air was blowing OUT of the hand piece.  Two calls to the manufacturer provided me with two different responses, neither of which were satisfactory.  The first representative told me the problem was a missing gasket-like device, basically a silicone rubber band.  (Attempts to fix with a rubber band as others suggested failed.) She would send me one at no cost, but I had to provide credit card information, which I refused to do.  The second representative told me that since the machine wasn&#x27;t purchased through them, they couldn&#x27;t help me.  A call to the company that offered this fabulous deal resulted in a return shipping label, and a credit to my account.&lt;br /&gt;For an additional $20, I purchased the Kendal Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine model #HB-SF01.  Right out of the box, the machine seems to be made of much better quality materials.  The design is simple, yet everything you need to do a spa quality microdermabrasion at home.  The variety of tips included is excellent, with coarse, medium, and fine textures, and sizes that accommodate small surfaces, such as the tip of the nose and eye corners, and larger areas, such as the forehead, cheeks, neck and extremities.  The hand pieces and tips are made of sturdy metal, and fit well.  Extra O-rings, fuses, and an abundance of filters, both large and small are included.  Assembly is easy, although the instruction manual isn&#x27;t well-written, and for someone not familiar with microdermabrasion machines, might be a bit confusing.&lt;br /&gt;Once I turned on the machine, I felt the vacuum immediately, even when the dial was in the lowest position.  I turned it up to the half-way point, and then to full vacuum.  I tried all of the tips.  This machine is every bit as good as the $9000 ones I&#x27;ve used.  I read the other reviewers&#x27; comments regarding the On/Off switch.  That was my one concern about purchasing this machine, but the response they received from customer service to me was satisfactory.  If I have a problem and they are willing to send me the part to do the repair, I don&#x27;t mind making a simple fix.  In summary, I think this is a great machine, and a great value at slightly more than the cost of one spa or physician&#x27;s office treatment.es, such as the tip of the nose and eye corners, and larger areas, such as the forehead, cheeks, neck and extremities.

    <li> Great delivery time. Looks like a great products. Works excellent.! Recommended. Price is excellent. Tips ere very good quality and machine does a excellent professional work.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best microdermabrasion machines that I have bought. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s pretty big and I don&#x27;t have that much space. Great suction, but only if you make sure and keep the filters clean . That means as soon as you notice a decrease , even a little in the suction it&#x27;s time to change them. If they get sucked into the wand accidentally , which you will hear, all you have to do is turn it off, take the wand off, and either blow on the smaller end or take a Qtip and push it out. If you don&#x27;t microderm all the time, again the filters have got to be checked and replaced, I hate to keep emphasizing this, but that is the main reason you will stop getting suction, plus you could damage the machine. I have gone through as many as 15 doing my legs. I didn&#x27;t even bother with the oil filters. This was very easy to set up and use</li>
    <li> could have better instructions but now that I know how to use it , it is wonderful. I has helped to lighten my melasma although I have to use the highest tip. Much cheaper than going to the spa for the $40 treatments when you dan do it itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and my skin already looks so much smoother and youthful.  I&#x27;m surprised at the quick results!</li>
    <li> After I read all the rave reviews I was so excited to receive this device. HOWEVER,  It is EXTREMELY COMPLICATED TO USE.  Directions are inadequate, (written only and confusing to say the least), No DVD to show how.  As far as I am concerned you need to be an electrical engineer or highly trained to use this device with any type of SAFETY and accuracy.  I Returned it asap.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> love this product. my skin showed immediate  improvement after using first time. i&lt;br /&gt;every two to 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase.  First I have to say that the company I purchased it through \\&quot;The Shining Image\\&quot; replied to my email questions promptly, and the shipment arrived on time, I also liked the fact that I could go to the ups site and see exactly where my shipment was at any time.    I had a microdermabrasion treatment at a salon for 80.00, they suggested that I should come back weekly for the first 4-6 weeks.  I knew that it wasn&#x27;t going to be possible to afford to come back weekly so I started searching for my own machine.  I am happy with this purchase, I received it today and used it for the first time tonight, the instructions were easy to follow and the the amount of suction felt the same as the one at the salon. My face feels smooth and fresh!  I am also using the obagi skin care regimen so this will all work nicely together.  I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It works. Does a great job. I ordered &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; it was &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; that was disappointing. I cleaned it and changed the filter pads and used it.</li>
    <li> Good, but the diamond heads didnt seem very hard, and it was missing one of the rubber legs on the bottom, so it teeters.</li>
    <li> Have only used this machine about 4 times since receiving a month ago. Seeing dramatic difference in pore size and texture of skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see results after 2 months!</li>
    <li> the diamond wand looks cheap- but comes with tons of different diamond tips. I stopped using this product, my dermatologist was not happy with me using it since I have psoriasis. Ive used it twice, the product is not bad, but leave it to the professionals</li>
    <li> This machine works nicely, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It is also nice that it came with a ton of filters. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that some of the diamond tips seem to be too dull to do any work. The only tip I like to use is the one labeled 150, which is rough enough to actually work, all the other tips seem to be dull and not work at all. I haven&#x27;t seen big results yet but I want to continue using this machine and hopefully it will help me.</li>
    <li> Cancelled this review  and deleted my own comments because not worth the bickering . Not interested in having to defend my opinion or prove myself. My review was HONEST!</li>
    <li> I received the Kendal Diamond Microdermabrasion a little over a month ago and I love it! I use it a few times a week and I can really see a difference in the appearance of my skin. I have had enlarged pores and blackheads (on my nose mostly) for years and I hated them! But after using the machine just once I could see a major change and my skin had never felt so soft! After several weeks my pores are tiny and my blackheads are almost gone. My skin looks younger and much smoother and I was told I have a ¡§glow¡¨.  I have used it to treat a few wrinkles and it is working pretty well for those too. I have a few small lines under my eyes and a scar on my upper lip that I am treating. The wrinkles under my eyes are much improved and my upper lip scar is getting much better. One thing that I really love is that the suction gives me awesome pouty lips¡Ksuper sexy and a free benefit!&lt;br /&gt; So what I think they could improve: The instructions are super lacking. They need to send along better directions and maybe even include a video on you tube. It actually tells you to just look up videos other people have posted but none they have created. Come on Kendal! I would be happy to star in a video for you if you decide to make oneº&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this machine. It actually works better than I even hoped! Money well spent for me!</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as I got it. I LOVE it. Much better than paying $100 or more per session at a spa!!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this today, it was very easy to hook up after looking at the illustration. I just finished my first treatment and I am estatic! I spent over a year researching these machines, I am so very astonished with the results after the first treatment. If you are serious about purchasing a home microdermabrasion machine, this is it. The suction was great, I even had to turn it down a little. Sign me, one very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I have used this machine weekly for 5 weeks and am really pleased.  My skin looks and feels really good.  I didn&#x27;t have bad skin before, but I had some dry areas and some oily areas.  Things are now more even.  I also have some age spots that are noticeably lighter.  I think using this product lightened my skin by a shade because I had to change my foundation and it&#x27;s wintertime so it&#x27;s not because I have a tan that has faded.  Overall, I am very pleased and think this product was worth the money and is super easy to use.</li>
    <li> Never had a professional microdermabrasion done, so I can&#x27;t compare to a treatment you&#x27;d get in a spa.  It took me a couple of tries to do it right and I still question myself (first time, I barely did anything to my skin; second time went too hard...ooops).  Now I can do my face, hands, chest and neck in about 20 minutes, once a week.  I wish the company put out a youtube video on how to use it, as that would have greatly helped.  It does give me a healthy glow and helps treat zits/ acne at a deeper level.  As to whether it can diminish age spots, I don&#x27;t know whether it can do that, although I would love if it did!  I guess I will keep trying it - you definitely get a more effective exfoliation than using any over the counter scrub products.  One one gripe I have with this machine is I wish it was more compact and came with a suitcase or bag to hold all of the components.  The machine is very large and I have a small bathroom.  I store it under the bathroom sink on the floor, which isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
    <li> I have malasma and I&#x27;ve tried different ways to lighten it up. The Kendal microdermabrasion helped a lot by removing the dead skin, I can now apply products and they get absorbed better and I get quicker results. I love the way it makes my skin feel, much smoother and more even toned.</li>
    <li> I am 46  year old and had moderate acne as a young adult. I have mild adult acne and large pores. I bought this machine about 3 months ago and it has made a great result in my skins appearance.. As you can imagine, at 46 I also have fine lines and aging problems with my skin. this address all of these issues. After I use this machine ( approx, every 10 to 14 days), I follow it up with 5%  Glycolic Acid mask. I don&#x27;t know that I could control my skin without it. It is simple to use and requires little time from set up to clean up. My pores are so small now and my skin looks refreshed and young. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I still look 46 but, my skin looks and feels healthier. I have and will continue to recommend it .</li>
    <li> This machine is the bomb. I have been using it for a month now and it&#x27;s the cats meow. Skin is looking better and is so incredibly smooth afterwards. Comes with a ton of extra&#x27;s too. Big bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I love it. My 74 yr old mother is IN LOVE with it.  The improvement to texture and dark spots is immediate.  What a great deal. Easy to use and a quick process.  The spa treatment is designed in part to create the illusion of value.  I dont need a face massage and oxygen.....100 bucks and an hour to boot.  Not to mention that you can use this all over your body.  How many sessions would that be in a spa?  My mom is loving what it does to improve the look of her hands.  I see it too.  Big difference.This is a 15 minute process.  More extensive facials are at my convenience.  I do this microdermabrasion once per week.  My topicals do seem to be soaking right in and doing their thing like never before.  I was going to get a cheaper machine with a Groupon but research and recommendations made me choose this Kendal instead.  Good Advice.  Thanks Internet!</li>
    <li> I purchase this to help deal with my son&#x27;s acne scars and am very disappointed that after 15 sessions there is no change</li>
    <li> Love the machine. The heads wear out too quick and are expensive to replace.</li>
    <li> I just got this and absolutely love it!  My skin looks so much better after just one use.  I&#x27;ve had professional microdermabrasion before and this is comparable.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used to get microdermabrasion treatments at the spa from time to time but this is just as good and much cheaper in the long run.  It is so nice to be able to give yourself a spot treatment if you have an area of dry skin.  The only issue is the little filter that you put under the head of the wand tends to get sucked into the wand.  If I really screw on the head very tight is will usually stay but not always.  I have to use a pipe cleaner to get it out.  It also took me a while to figure out that you have to unscrew the metal connection where the hose connects to the machine to insert the larger round filter.  Overall, I love this thing because my skin looks great all the time!</li>
    <li> works well on microdermabrasion. the cost is approx. 3 treatments at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are very poor and they refer you to some utube video not theirs though&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are poor on cleaning the machine also</li>
    <li> This Kendall microdermabration works right.. The suction is perfect and safe.. It came with the box of diamond tips. The manual  is in English. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> Love this machine works great will recommend to others</li>
    <li> I purchased this on ebay from the same seller- I actually ended up returning it - only because I decided I wanted a multi use machine instead - the seller was great at responding to my questions immediately - it was a easy return. I was very impressed with the quality of the machine it felt heavy duty  and like it was professional quality and had very powerful suction -</li>
    <li> Simple to unpack and set up but the machine had very low suction even at the highest setting. If I can get one that works it looks like it may be a decent product. I&#x27;m returning the product to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ordered a new one and it worked great! After one treatment I saw an immediate difference. I use it once a week now and haven&#x27;t had any more issues. The suction is great and I like being able to easily change the tips. I&#x27;m changing my rating from 1 star to 4 star.</li>
    <li> My wife is very much excited when she received the package but quite annoyed when she can&#x27;t find the MANUAL. She was so pissed but still  she goggled for manual online hoping she can find in website but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;We order a lot from amazon and this is the first time we will provide a review on a product. I mean come on! It is 200 DOLLARS!! and not  a manual in the package? How the heck will she know how to operate it? It AGGRAVATES more because there is this sheet of  paper, that goes with it, that specifically will tell you not to use the product unless you  read page blah blah blah of the manual!!... Isn&#x27;t it annoying?&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even find a way where to email the seller!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and I loved this!!! Perfect for at home treatments!!! I would recommend this microdermabrasion machine to anyone!</li>
    <li> I take really good care of my skin and always have.  I use prescription tretinoin, copper peptides, vitamin C serum, and exfoliate aggressively.  But I&#x27;m almost 59 and it&#x27;s starting to show.  I used this machine for the first time today and am astonished at how much smoother my face is after only one use.  The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth are dramatically reduced.  I&#x27;m actually quite shocked.  The machine is easy to use.  I see in previous reviews that some people had trouble with losing the little rubber bands but on my model they are black and therefore easy to see plus they included a few replacement rubber bands, so the company must have improved on this issue since those reviews were written.  This machine is well worth the money.  I would purchase is again, even at a higher price, and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Love this machine!! Got it faster than expected , well packaged and very professional . Easy to operate, great choice of stanless heads and handpiece. Suction is great and heads don&#x27;t scratch you. Was using the Nu Brillance double the price and horrible heads that  have to be replaced every 10 uses, replacement heads don&#x27;t fit and then unit is useless, heads also scratch your skin. Returned it after replacement heads didn&#x27;t fit and found this one , so much better and professional grade at 1/2 the cost!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician and wanted to buy a microdermabrasion machine. I LOVE THIS MACHINE. After reading the reviews, most people were saying the suction was too high, they probably just did not know how to use this machine because you can change the suction power. It has great suction but I don&#x27;t let it pass the 15 on the gauge. I bought this for personal and client use. It came with a lot of extra filters, which i thought was a huge bonus! Definitely recommend this machine</li>
    <li> Works fine, nice machine.  I can&#x27;t tell that my fine lines are gone nor my sun spots.  No one has complimented me on a younger appearance either.  I will continue though because my face fills refreshed even if I don&#x27;t see it.  Maybe 3-4 more months will pay off.</li>
    <li> Love this machine.  I can see the difference when I use and don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> I have had quite a few spa microdermabrasion treatments. Some great and others not at all. I have tried an at home machine that was scarcely comparable to the worst. That&#x27;s not true of this device. I am very happy with this purchase. It is comparable. Well worth the expense! I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star rating because the filter has been sucked into device twice but cannot get past wand handle. I cannot get it out. Suction is still strong despite. Great machine. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times per week for about a month.</li>
    <li> I love this machine and the only thing is sometimes my face looks scratched after I use it for two or three days I wonder why that is do I have to get different tips?</li>
    <li> Love this, Ive had it for a few years now, still works wonderful. my skin looks so silky smooth after</li>
    <li> Works great and makes your skin look amazing.  It is gentle and you can see results the same day.  It lasts for several days.</li>
    <li> It works great and the attachment are very good</li>
    <li> When I first used it, I was very happy with the suction and how I could see &amp; feel that it could make a difference on my skin, than after 25 minutes the suction became weak.  I thought it could be a clog, cleaned the filters &amp; checked to make sure everything was clear, it still did not have a good suction.  I must have received a defective machine....I sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once and did see a difference. I  am anxious to try it again!</li>
    <li> It was more than she expected. Perfect condition. Excellent</li>
    <li> Great starter machine. Im a fulltime esthetitian and i use it on my clients and they love it!!  Delivery was great and machine works good</li>
    <li> I have used this machine 4 times now and I&#x27;m getting amazing results. My acne scars are fading, and the around my mouth and forehead are less noticeable. I&#x27;m 41 and I&#x27;ve receive mircoderm treatments before and this is just as good.  I recommend this for anyone!</li>
    <li> Love this machine. Does exactly what it says. Only gave it 4 stars only because of the poor directions.  What are those red and green things for anyway?  And what&#x27;s this hot and cold stuff? Help???</li>
    <li> I love this machine! I decided to purchase after reading the other reviews. I have had pimples/bumps on my arms and back for years treated with prescription medications (pills and creams)that DID NOT work.Spent a fortune on them and just ended up frustrated and broke. I was told my condition was caused by the dead skin not shedding fast enough thus resulting in clogged pores. That is not a problem anymore. I use this machine 1x weekly all over and what a difference it has made! It is helping to get rid of sun damage spots and blackheads on my face and giving me a radiant look!Fewer break outs! I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I had been paying 75+ dollars a month to go to a salon just for facial microdermabrasion! This has already paid for itself..it is WELL worth the price and more effective than the salon machine! I told my friend about it and she just got one too!!! If you are tired of going to the salon and paying high prices, this is for you. The suction is strong so be careful with it until you practice a few times, they send A LOT of filters and it comes with instructions on which tips are for what body parts along with a letter requesting that you call them with any questions.IT IS AWESOME!</li>
    <li> First let me say that I am dealing with way past mid life cystic acne, large pores and blackheads that after seeing 4 renowned dermatologists in my area, I did not get better so I decided to try to treat myself.  Yep, this beats $100 microderms at my esthetician&#x27;s but it doesn&#x27;t have the suction that I expected. I can&#x27;t say that after 4 uses I see any results (I have had microderms off and on for over 16 years by both dermatologists and estheticians. This machine operates almost the same as my esthetician&#x27;s - not in a medical facility).  I would recommend this to those with an occasional pimple, or for an occasional refreshed look.  I think mine is a too-far-advanced-stage. The seller was very accommodating and provided good customer service.  The product did not have the \\&quot;power\\&quot; that I expected.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it. solid professional quality.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my Kendall.  I chose it because it had the best reviews.  The machine works great.  There is plenty of suction and I liked that you got different tips to use.  They also give you many filters.  The product is also very easy to use.  My results, however, left a little to be desired.  I know it takes some time before you see results, but I have used my about eight times and I thought I would see a little improvement.  I bought the Kendall to get rid of fine lines, hopefully a wrinkle or two, and in general smoother skin.  I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed any improvement.  I am not giving up though.  I might have expected too much too soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very deep pock marks all over my face from severe cystic acne in my teens and early 20&#x27;s.I know this machine is recommended for lighter scars and fine lines, but I tried it out on my deep scars because I was afraid of the dangers associated with harsher medical treatments. After about seven months of using this every three weeks, what were once deep cavernous horrors have become shallow indentions. Many have disappeared, and the remaining ones are very shallow and fading very quickly.  You can&#x27;t even see them when I smile. Nobody stares at me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that I eat a simple plant based diet and exercise about an hour a day. (which I started doing about the same time)</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this for my daughter at Christmas because I worried it might be something that would do damage to her beautiful face. As it turns out it is gentle. We tested it on our hands to see what it felt like right after she opened it. The suction was good and it was not damagingly abrasive. Since Christmas she has given her whole family (husband &amp; three sons) a facial with it. I&#x27;m still waiting for my facial :)</li>
    <li> OK, first off, this machine is pretty big, it&#x27;s not a tiny little thing. it has some power to it, and you can feel it. The directions on how to connect what are not too clear, so pay attention to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to clean the tips you&#x27;ll be using!&lt;br /&gt;1. Unscrew the \\&quot;cap\\&quot; on the machine, to make sure there is a little ring and a filter there. The ring will ensure no loss of suction&lt;br /&gt;2.Connect the little \\&quot;hose\\&quot; with the cylyndrical filter to the machine&lt;br /&gt;3. Connect the long hose to the one described in step 2.&lt;br /&gt;4. Connect the wand to the long hose.&lt;br /&gt;The wand should already have a little ring at the tip, again, this is to prevent loss of suction. Before screwing in whatever tip you&#x27;ll use, make sure you put a little filter in there (there is a little bag in the case with all the tips).&lt;br /&gt;There are LOTS of extra filters (big and small), including a couple of fuses and some more \\&quot;rings.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;In the instruction manual there are diagrams to show you in which direction you should be moving the wand on her face for the different areas. So far I used it only ones, and it took some practice, as you have to learn how to hold the wand so that the tip is constantly in touch with your skin to keep the suction going. It helps a lot if you use your free fingers to gently pull on the skin for better suction/contact. My face was just a little red that night; it&#x27;s no longer red, but it is a bit sensitive (which it says, for 48 hours will be). I plan on using the machine on weekly basis, so I&#x27;ll update my review later on and may be add some pictures.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of research online, this is the best deal, with good reviews, and 12-mo warranty. Most machines have only 6-mo warranty, so beware of those!!! Plus the seller will sell you any additional supplies you may need later on!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought this machine after several years of going for Microdermabrasion treatments.  It works great and better then the old  machines.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time believing it until my daughter looked at my skin and said it looked glowing and healthier.  She wanted to know what I was doing, I had to share my secret. :) My husband has even asked me to use it on his face. He is a manly man that would never get caught using girly stuff, but once a week he has a standing appointment.</li>
    <li> powerful machine, works fine</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this machine. Not only is it easy to use on myself but it is easy to use on others as well.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my machine.  I purchased it through \\&quot;The Shining Image\\&quot;  in USA, is a professional grade  microdermabracion machine,I have acne scars and this machine help me a lot! And the shipment arrived on time, I had a microdermabrasion treatment and this machine perform as good as a professional. The instructions were easy to follow and the the amount of suction felt the same as the one at the salon. My face feels smooth  I am very pleased!!! Will do it again!</li>
    <li> I am loving this machine!  After just a couple of treatments my skin feels softer and fine lines have all but disappeared.  Would highly recommend this machine....worth the money!</li>
    <li> wow this thing is professional quality</li>
    <li> It helped get rid of dead skin cells</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews on this machine and it&#x27;s definitely one of the best..</li>
    <li> I have had \\&quot;crystal\\&quot; microderms (in a dr&#x27;s office) for the last ten years and my newly purchased Kendal matches the quality of the service I used to pay $50 per visit to receive. Now, I can micro any time I want; I don&#x27;t have to struggle to fit an appt into my busy schedule.  It only takes me 10-15 mins and when I&#x27;m done, there are no grainy crystals left in my hair. I love all the attachments, which make it easier to hit the narrow bridge of my nose and the sides.  Even tho I&#x27;ve only used it four times (I&#x27;m micro-derming 2x a week now :), I can already see an improvement in my skin.  It&#x27;s smoother, softer, and less oily.  Best of all, in just a few uses, it&#x27;s already paid for itself!  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. The dead skin on my face sloughs off quickly. Will continue to monitor and report results. I am hoping that my fine lines around my mouth will diminish after continued use. I would recommend this machine.</li>
    <li> I own a Spa, and I need it for some very based facials. This Diamond Microdermabrasion is very nice and easy to operate. The only thing about it is it&#x27;s very hard to clean.</li>
    <li> Microdermabrasion can get costly and you need multiple sessions...buy this machine and do it yourself it&#x27;s quick and easy and saves you money in the long run!</li>
    <li> Suction is not strong compared to the microderm system that was in the med-spa Where I previously worked, however for a home system and someone without another professional system to compare it against the suction would be considered strong and actually works but you have to move the wand very slowly across your face to achieve a good exfoliation, but the wands are terrible.  Where I worked, we used the diamondtone Altair system.  I actually ended up splurging on a wand from the Altair system and currently use it with this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the wand from a different system, and weekly to a week and half exfoliations I can definitely see a difference in my acne, my sun spots, and the overall general appearance of my skin.  It is smoother and has a nice healthy glow.  I do also use a beauty control acid pad and obagi products to help with the sun spots.  So for a home system (with a better wand) this gets the job done for a decent price considering this price would only buy you a few microderms at a med-spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months and I admit I don&#x27;t change the filters regularly and I haven&#x27;t had any issues, yet, knock on wood. :)</li>
    <li> The only negative thing I will say is the directions are bad.  It really doesn&#x27;t explain how to put the part together.  Still not sure I have done that correctly.  But the machine seems to work great.  Skin felt really soft after 1st use.  Worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, first time I used it I saw difference in my skin. Good price also, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this machine! I am prone to rough, dry skin because of thyroid issues and It does make a difference. I have been using it about once to weekly to every two weeks and started using a glycolic acid peel I got off amazon also and between the two the tiny, hard seed like spots on my skin have disappeared!  I&#x27;m posting before and after photos taken with my iPhone and a magnifier, poor quality but you&#x27;ll get the idea.</li>
    <li> I am a believer in spa micro dermabrasion treatments, but when they increased the price to $125 per visit, I thought I&#x27;d try an at-home machine. I am very happy with this unit. It doesn&#x27;t work quite the same way that the med spa procedure did, but it&#x27;s just as effective. Simply choose which tip you&#x27;d like to use (there are 9 ) and adjust the suction according to your own preference/tolerance. I use it at least once a week and my face always looks like I&#x27;ve just had &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34; 58 years old and a co worker of the same age accused me of lying about my age. Use heavy moisturizers when you are done. I prefer Epionce Medical Barrier which is pricey, but since I&#x27;m saving so much on the treatments, it&#x27;s worth splurging. I highly recommend this unit</li>
    <li> I have had many crystal micro-dermabrasions.  This machine gives the same results.  I have a lot of acne issues and rough skin.  I have used the machine about three times a week at 3/4 suction for two weeks now, and my skin is looking so much smoother.  My scars and hyperpigmentation are starting to fade.  I am thrilled with this machine.  It has strong suction and is very easy to use.  The different diamond heads are very useful and easy to clean with warm soapy water.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have an electrolysis business. I find this machine as a great service for my clients. They love it. So do I.</li>
    <li> I think it has helped my skin.  Pigment issues are better, fewer pimples, healthier looking.I have used this on my upper arms which were plagued with pimple like bumps.  Totally gone. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase so far.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I purchased another brand of microdermabrasion machine.  The plastic cracked on the wand, and it lost its suction.  I decided to go for a better quality machine, and this Kendal is amazing!  There are different size tools, made of stainless steel.  I can only turn the suction halfway up!  For the price of two visits to a med spa, you can have a machine that would easily be at home there!</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  My skin is so soft after using it.  I like the fact that it comes with multiple size diamond tips for use on the face and the body.  It&#x27;s amazing how much dead skin is taken off.  Make sure you use the filters and if working on a large area, you may have to use more than one filter.  I bought some pipe cleaners to make sure that the wand gets completely clean inside after use.  I use this about every two-three weeks and I have noticed a big difference.  It has paid for itself after 4 uses.  Having one at home is great as you can use it on your own time, use it as often as you want and no appointment or tipping necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s quite a large unit and doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying/storage case.  I ended up using my slow cooker carrying bag to store it in when not in use. The wand is narrow (like a pen) so when holding it for a long time my hand gets cramped.  I will end up buying or making some type of grip (like the handles on OXO kitchen utensils).</li>
    <li> Having worked in several med spas in the past, I am VERY familiar with the professional microdermabrasion machines. I routinely would come into work early just to give myself a quick treatment before work. I missed those treatments &amp; not being in the industry any longer, I&#x27;ve been considering paying for a package of microdermabrasions. On a whim, I checked Google wondering if there was anything remotely comparable. After much comparison &amp; pouring over reviews I selected the Kendal. During use I was absolutely blown away by the powerful suction &amp; the diamond tip wands are exactly the same ones I used on the 5k dollar machine my plastic surgeons owned. The results were amazing!!! I regularly chemically exfoliate &amp; my skin couldn&#x27;t handle the full power suction. I&#x27;ve already told at least 5 girlfriends that they MUST buy this machine. Best purchase ever!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Kendal HB0SF01 after carefully reviewing all of the other machines on the market.  I was very excited to get the product, however, once I opened the box I could see immediately that this product was bought by someone else and resold to me.  I contacted the manufacturer who assured me they do not resell their equipment. Hogwash.  All of the bags with product had been opened and tied together, the fuse had already been placed in the appropriate place and the power cord was crumbled up and re-tied sloppy.  I am not happy with the way this company does business.  I paid alot of money for this machine and like all customers I expected to get a new one, not a used one.  My question is why did the customer send this back and why was I the unlucky customer to receive it.</li>
    <li> I think it works like it should,there&#x27;s no directions and even tho I&#x27;m a licensed professional in the industry, there should be a manual,at least.GOOD LUCK,and I recommend if you are not licensed to AT LEAST utube it.or you could RISK SERIoUS damage.</li>
    <li> Amazing - Professional results. Easy to use. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> So far I have had mines for a month and I love everything about it. It looks extremely complicated but once you get to using it, you will see how simple it is to put together and use. I&#x27;m super happy about this purchase and recommend it to anyone who compliments my skin. I&#x27;m using it mainly for my hyper pigmentation on my cheeks, and I&#x27;m African American btw. I took what I have learned from esthetician and started to do this all by myself. Wonderful purchase and it comes with plenty of extras to last you a long time.</li>
    <li> this machine worked exactly as i expected it to. i have had professional microdermabrasion many times.&lt;br /&gt;while this may not be as good as the best one i have had, it tops others i have had done by professionals.&lt;br /&gt;i started out using it twice weekly and plan on tapering after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;my skin has a glow and my pores look smaller.  i would definatley recommend this machine.</li>
    <li> I researched and researched, kept changing my mind about brands and finally after a great review from another thorough researcher decided to buy the Kendal.  I&#x27;ve had many microderms but not consistently due to cost, time, blah blah blah.  I now scrape and suction once a week and my skin looks amazing.  I think the suction is perfectly adequate for home use and if you leave it on one spot too long you will have a noticeable mark for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As further testament, my husband now sits in the chair once a week for his treatment.</li>
    <li> So after having a nubmer of microderm sessions leading up to my wedding, I realized I loved the way my skin is when I&#x27;m getting it done regularly. But it gets very expensive very fast. When I realized how cheap you can get the machine for (the same cost as a few sessions at the spa)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After investigating microderm abrasion techniques online, I realized that it is in fact a very simple process and all you need is a good piece of equipment... and this is it! I spent ages reading reviews and researching different models. I went with the Kendall HB-SF01 because it was a professional grade machine at a great price. I also wanted to go with the diamond tips vs. the crystal type machine. It&#x27;s just easier and less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the equipment you get is professioanl grade and you get a bunch of differnt sized heads with different coarsenessesl You also get a ton of cotton filters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So worth the investment!</li>
    <li> This machine is perfect for home use. I use it on my face, arms and legs. I exfoliates very well and is easy to use. It has probably saved me hundreds of dollars by now and I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price</li>
    <li> I used to go to a very upscale spa to get regular microdermabrasion facials, until a fellow spa visitor (and former aesthetician) told me that I could do it myself at home with one of these machine.  This one that I purchased is amazing.  It comes with tons of extras: filters, fuses, tubing, etc.  Extremely easy to use.  My skin looks great!  I would buy this machine again in a heartbeat, and I have recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> Hi, this is my experience with this machine. First, a little background on my skin, very fair, very sensitive, occasional pimples before menstral cycle. I also am from Irish descent. The first time I used it, everything seemed to be fine. Four weeks later when I re used for treatment, my skin was not the same...and has progressively gotten worse. I had to go to dermatologist for acne/rosacea. Which I&#x27;m told the rosacea was dormant until I aggrivated/activated it. Don&#x27;t use this if your skin is very sensitive, delicate, or fair. Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> This type of machine works by using suction to suck up dead skin, you glide the different Harshness rated diamond tips along your skin basically sanding your face, this thing will ABSOLUTELY NOT remove acne scars, old wounds etc, I honestly find this thing useless, it could maybe smooth out already nice skin, or improve a face that is naturally average, but if you actually have any damage done to you this will not fix it, in fact it will likely make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aggravated my friends acne and actually gave him an abscess on his cheek, you would need to use it hundreds and hundreds of times, basically sanding your face, and it will never get rid of ice pick pimple scars, or do anything other than smooth the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know this, good for you, I however spent nearly $300 on something that did nothing but scar a friend, and it was a birthday gift because they where self conscious and I wanted to help them beings they where talking bout the whole Derm Abrasion thing to me prior, so I figured hey, lets buy a machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEED THIS WARNING! I&#x27;m not some competitor, or out to ruin a business, it is what it is, and this is a quack device for obsessed rich people who want to hide wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at this because you legit have a medical condition and are not vain, don&#x27;t do it!&lt;br /&gt;Even if you applied all the correct substances, and sterilized the equipment, allowing time to heal, and repeated time and time again, this will NOT remove acne damage, heck it won&#x27;t even hide it, it will just smooth the skin down, if reducing the size of a bump, while still having the hole and scar is worth $300 have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a medical condition see a Dermatologist, don&#x27;t go to a spa, to get real treatment you&#x27;re going to need to pay a real doctor to help you.</li>
    <li> This machine is honestly amazing!  After studying esthetics, microdermabrations were my all time favorite thing. This machine works great.  I use it personally and on clients and the results are truly professional.  It&#x27;s amazing for such a great price.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job well, but then the cheapness of the machine shines through. Had less than a month (used 4 times) and the on/off switch quit working. Emailed the seller and they responded by sending me a new switch but no instructions on what to do with it... I&#x27;m fairly handy but I don&#x27;t normally tear apart electronics apart without detailed instructions and most salons aren&#x27;t going to be the right environment to do any type of repair work. So we have rigged it to stay on and now use a power strip with an on/off switch on it to control the machine.</li>
    <li> This was my first home microdermabrasion machine purchase, and it was really easy to use.  it took probably 5 minutes to really get the hang of it, but then it was smooth sailing.  There are quite a few good videos out there on the Net that give a good illustration of how to use the professional machines correctly.  The wand wasn&#x27;t plastic like some of the cheaper microdermabrasion machines out there, which enabled it to glide much smoother over my skin without scratching.  After the first time using it my skin was smoother, and after the second time I saw great improvement in skin clarity.  I oftentimes struggle with light to moderate adult acne and serious hyperpigmentation issues (I&#x27;ve had some spots for going on a year now), and by the second time I used this machine I could see fading of the hyperpigmented spots.  I also have light &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34;, which this machine aided in diminishing.  I highly recommend this machine for anyone looking to do low cost but effective microdermabrasion treatments at home.</li>
    <li> Kendal is nice and it really work . Try it is makes your skin nice . I love this products .</li>
    <li> I was reviewing brands for home microdermabrasion and could not help noticing all the questions on filters.  It seems that the filters at the following link might work and for the money it is a large supply of filters.  They are available in 11mm and 18mm sizes.  Just wanted to share the information at the following link in case anyone wanted to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical, but after reading all the good reviews, I said what the heck... What do I have to loose ? $200 bucks ?  Thats almost what I pay for 1 visit to the estetician. First of all I live in Puerto Rico, so I had to contact Shinning Company directly to see if they would ship the product here.  And they did !!! They were really helpfull and answered my request very quickly.  It arrived very fast. I have to tell you I wasn&#x27;t expecting the results I get from my estetician. But I was willing to give it try.  The machine arrived.  I looked up some videos on youtube before performing the micro on myself. I assembled it, very quickly and easy. I started on my arm, just to get the feel of it. Then I did my face.  The results??? Incredible !!!!  The same result I get from the estetician.  I couldn&#x27;t believe I had been paying $120 monthly for a facial &amp; micro. Ive told everyone I know about this machine.  I can wait to do it again.  My skin looks refreshed and clean. If your are thinking about buying this product you shouldn&#x27;t think twice. I am a very picky and perfectionist person and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if it didn&#x27;t work. I purchase alot of stuff online and harly ever give a review.  But this machine really deserves a review and if you have a acne prone skin like mine you deserve my review. This is the deal !!! Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product especially because I don&#x27;t need to go to expensive saloons any more. The only problem I have with this is how to clean the diamond tips after use. It&#x27;s like the dirt is stuck there. Any body can help?</li>
    <li> If you were someone getting microderm as regularly as recommended (this product allows you to do some areas as frequently as weekly) this easily pays for itself in less than a month, with $80 sessions...I was driving my SUV 30 minutes each way for treatments when I could squeeze them in...it just wasn&#x27;t working. I gave up going because I couldn&#x27;t afford it, then I began researching and was pleasantly surprised that I could get a professional machine for this much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it twice now. The first time, I was a little distracted and gave my cheek a &amp;#34;hickey...&amp;#34; beware of this! The machine is very strong if you aren&#x27;t cautious with the intensity! Basically, I&#x27;m saying this because it is definitely professional strength, consistent suction. It&#x27;s big and bulky, but you get the good with the bad, and this is bulky because it&#x27;s powerful. The only other con would be that the manual lists several different models, so it was annoying to have to shuffle through to find my model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for having tried other machines, but this one is awesome. After 2 uses, my skin definitely shows improvement! It makes sense, dull skin cells are gone, leaving skin glowing. You are pretty much polishing your skin, and with anything that needs polishing, some elbow grease is involved. With our fragile skin, the &amp;#34;elbow grease&amp;#34; is the machine. Once you get the hang of it, this is a fun way to make a positive difference.</li>
    <li> It may or may not be good. Instructions did NOT cover my model and I have no idea how to hook up what looks like brushes. The info that came with it was of no help. I have never used one before.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product so far. Worked well and was easy to use. Have only used it once so no major skin changes other than skin was softer after use.</li>
    <li> I am a master esthetician and was skeptical for the price what I was getting. This product provides a great diamond dermabrasion.</li>
    <li> It came on time. The set up was easy. Using it is even easier. I was compelled to buy because the reviews were really good and consistent out of all the machines and a lot of people who did have issues said the company was very accommodating. I have had no issues at all and found the Manual to be all I needed to start. Face feels great but I don&#x27;t have skin problems. Just wanted it for preventative measures.</li>
    <li> I received this machine in a very timely manner.  I have had many professional microdermabrasion sessions. I decided to purchase the machine because of all of the positive reviews. I was paying $125 per session at my doctors office. It definitely isn&#x27;t like the professional sessions I&#x27;ve had. The machine doesn&#x27;t seem as strong but it does leave your skin feeling and looking good. I&#x27;ve had many compliments about how good my skin looks and it helps my confidence. I bought the machine primarily to help with the little wrinkles that started creeping around at 40. My skin feels youthful and wrinkles ALMOST non existent. Women at work have asked me if I&#x27;ve had Botox treatments. I try to do my microderm once a week and machine and parts work well. I believe I&#x27;ve had the machine about 2 months. Like I said its not a professional treatment but it also pays for itself after two treatments and it works well. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I now have more money in my pocket and extra time on my hands.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it&#x27;s a hundred percent guaranteed. Actually, I recommended Kendal to my friend and sister and their planning to buy this product soon.</li>
    <li> It works great! I have had professional microdermabrasions performed on me by a dermatologist, and this one worked just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> In love with my new machine so many great reviews but also searched other websites &amp; this one came up as #3. I got scars from picking at my face &amp; was left insecure to be without make up. I tried the chemical peels &amp; microdermabrasions at spas &amp; became expensive. My mom bought one from amazon for $100 great one but then she bought new one for $600 even better so i decided to pay for one in between that price &amp; with good reviews purchased this one. Im so happy with it ill be using it once a week until scars get lighter looks good already with one try great suction. Also tried it in my bf face as he looks darker now from sun burn and he looks even lighted now just like when I met him {african american } his back to a light skin brother. He impressed as he never had a facial and is happy to have purchased this one for my bday 😍😁 I will be pool bare skin ready in no time 👌🏽def a must buy !!!!</li>
    <li> This review may seem a bit premature, but I will change it depending on how the company handles my complaint.  I recently received this machine and the set up was reasonably simple.  I used it the first time, didn&#x27;t notice much but didn&#x27;t expect much with just one use anyway.  The suction/exfoliation did not seem to be very strong, even on the highest level, to be honest, and it does not begin to compare to what you can get at a salon that does this treatment professionally (some here claim it&#x27;s as good, but I can&#x27;t agree, if the salon is truly using a professional type machine)....again, this is just MY opinion based on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I attempted to use the machine, the on/off switch did not work.  The only way it will stay powered on is if I HOLD the switch down in the on position....needless to say I was not happy that this would happen with a brand new machine.  I had read at another web-site that this is a problem that is known about, yet I&#x27;ve not seen any of the reviewers here mention a problem with their power switch so I guess it&#x27;s just my bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve reported the problem, and again, depending on the quality of customer support I will be back to let people know if their service is fair and reasonable.  *Keeping fingers crossed*...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10-19-2012:  As soon as I posted my initial review I emailed customer support...they only offered to send me a replacement switch and I have to install it.  They emailed the instructions to take the machine apart and replace the switch.  Sooo....Just got the replacement switch yesterday...have not installed it yet, not sure I really want to take on this task or dispute this purchase, just does not seem right that I should have to take apart something that cost this much to repair it myself.  Will again update after I try to communicate with them and see what, if any, my options are at this point.  I&#x27;ll be back...</li>
    <li> this machine has great suction and comes with filters and tips for all applications, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Machine looked great when I opened the box however I found it mechanically intimidating and returned it without issue.</li>
    <li> I would say it&#x27;s a average machine, bit over prices for what it does. But for a non professional it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this machine about 9 months ago.  My neighbor, who is a professional make up artist, saw this and remarked that I have diamond-brasion at its finest.  I looked at demos on You Tube and read the instructions, but it was pretty intuitive to use. I had tried mild chemical peels but I had to wait several days to even see the results--- this method is much easier and less scary.  You see results right away and have complete control. For the first few months I used it every week, but I find that once or twice a month works fine. Having this machine lets me work on my hands, arms, thighs, and it&#x27;s a a nice treat that I could never afford if I went to a spa.  The results are dramatic--dark areas are gone(this took some time and several treatments), brighter skin, less breakouts (right away), and blemishes can be smoothed down to almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this, I keep an eye on the meter, when it does not return to zero, I change the small filter. This happens every few minutes. I find that a toothpick helps poke out old filters and can help seat a new on. I turn the machine off every time I change the filter. I clean the diamond tips with a very soft brush, liquid hand soap,  place the clean diamond tips in a shallow bowl of alcohol, and then dry. The machine gives no evidence of a problem and expect it to last for years, but if it gave out tomorrow, I have already gotten my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large machine, I would buy a smaller version from the same company next time, but that is a matter of taste.</li>
    <li> I have no regrets ordering this product.It is common sense to me,buying a product that saves you on fancy/expensive miracle creams and the local spas that cost big money after lots of repeat visits.The treatments so far are working to smooth my pores and I am in the process of checking for more long term results.The competitive products out there,I&#x27;ve read,have flaws but the reviews on the Kendal are top notch.</li>
    <li> This unit provides results comparable to those from a professional.  I do think it would be beneficial to have had a few professional microdermabrasion sessions so you know what it should feel like and what the results should be.</li>
    <li> meet my expectation and easy to use. I will still use it every time I need it. Great product! Thanks Shining Image</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I was expecting but works extremely well. Very easy to assemble and clean.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! Since I received it I&#x27;ve used it twice once a week it is been amazing results it has tighten my pores. It has really removed a lot of my dead skin off my face. rejuvenated my face. My face is bright and collagen is awake again. Caution use the finer diamond tip first then the courser one second in one session so ur not hurting ur skin no more than 12 to 15 hg in the beginning and a good moisturizer after. Well worth the price. I paid in a professional setting a lot to have this done in the past so having my own has already paid off with my two sessions arrived on time!!</li>
    <li> I want to purchase a good Microdermabrasion machine for home use and the review by \\&quot;Katie\\&quot; sounds great but am concerned if she is legitimate. Has any one bought this machine and can give it a good, legitimate rating? Also, where do you buy your replacement tips and filters?  Joyce</li>
    <li> Love! Watching it fade scaring is pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> This product provides professional results equivalent to those from treatments at a specialists office.  It has been received with great enthusiasm and is frequently in use.</li>
    <li> This machine works very good. I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> only try 1 time , i guess i did to hard at the first time. my skin was so hurting after when i was done. yeah,... i don&#x27;t see any different now, but i hope look better later??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used thus machine 3 times now and I have to say....I LOVE IT! I tried an experiment on my.fiance. I didn&#x27;t tell him that I used it for the first time just to see if he could tell a difference and as soon as he walked in the door he stared at me for a second and then told me how soft my skin looked. Of course that was thr first time I had used it but I&#x27;m not kidding....3 times of using It now and my skin is drastically better. I have HORRIBLE scars from getting a MRSA infection when I was younger working in healthcare and I have always been discouraged about anything helping my skin. Obviously nothing will be able to totally clear my scars but I&#x27;m telling you this machine had done wonders already.  As long as you&#x27;re realistic about what this machine is capable of you will be ecstatic with the results. Here&#x27;s ANOTHER reason to try it...I have some stretch marks on my hips and bum from having children so just because I can I decided to give the machine a chance to really show me what it can do and OH MY WORD....my hips and bum felt fantastic after I was done. The marks were considerably LESS noticeable and my skin was like silk...again my fiance complimented me before he ever even knew I&#x27;d used it there...lol. take care of the tips though...I&#x27;ve noticed one of mine is already having some flaking of the diamond tip.</li>
    <li> I have been using this microderm machine for about 3 months now and have seen much improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have alot of hyper pigmentation on my skin from having cystic acne for over 20 years. I use this machine once a week and have noticed a marked reduction in the amount of breakouts i am getting. My uneven skin tone is improving weekly. The machine removes alot of dead cells from my skin which are collected onto the cotton filter. Doing this weekly removes a ton a dead cells which no longer clog my pores. After, i moisturize with organic argan oil. Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So happy with the Diamond Microdermabrasion machine. Quality product.  I will save hundreds by doing this at home instead of at the salon.</li>
    <li> It is very good - low cost - very effective!</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this years ago! I have gotten Microderm done professionally and this is just as good! I love the way my skin feels after, so soft. I also have notice my acne scars are less noticeably after only two uses. Such a smart buy, seeing as you pay $50-$80 for Microderm at a salon and you can do it weekly with this machine!</li>
    <li> This is my first ever online review and i am soo much happy with my purchase that i felt like writing review after my first trial. it definitely gave me better results than what i got from SPA. You can use it lavishly wherever and however you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had microdermabrasion done at spas and they cost quite a lot for each treatment, so I thought why not buy the machine and do it my self. So that is exactly what I did and no regrets, I like this machine, it does its job.</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician and I have been using this machine for a month. My clients love it! You do need to be careful with sensitive skin types and and I never put the suction past 15. I&#x27;ve seen great results!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet. The real pro is the diamond head. Crystal heads are dangerous and may lead to cancer because of the compounds in the aerosolized crystal head may interact in a negative fashion with lung cells. Shipping was pretty standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update soon.</li>
    <li> This machine was not only simple to set up, but it works great and does everything that it says it will do.  With so many to choose from, I am glad that I chose this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Kendal for only a short time and have been pleased.  I wish the product would have come with more instructions on how to use the device instead of directing you to watch YouTube videos.  It has been a learning curve with the amount of time per session and the suction settings. I have seen an improvement in my skin tone and so far a slight diminishing of sun sports and fine lines. I hope with continued use these results will improve.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Showed it to my sister who pays large $$ on visits to the plastic surgeon!!! She is now an owner of the product!</li>
    <li> I used to get my face professionally micro-ed once a month.  Bought this and love it.  Does everything you&#x27;d get at a pro.  Easy to set up. Quiet and compact!</li>
    <li> Works fine for home use, no instructions with it, but that said pretty easy to use.</li>
