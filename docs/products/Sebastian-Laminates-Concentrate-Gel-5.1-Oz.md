    <li> It&#x27;s good for taming frizz. My hair is course and looks dry after it is dry-no shine. This product gives a shiny look.</li>
    <li> Same great formula that I remember. It makes my hair super soft and a little goes a  l  o  n  g  way. Only problem. Doesn&#x27;t last long....I&#x27;m 1/2 way through my tube.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sebastian Professional Laminates Gel for at least 8 years now and just ran out of my last tube and I&#x27;m unable to find it anywhere.  Does anyone know whether or not this product has been discontinued or if a new product has taken its place.  Help!!  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff&#x27;s available 5 or 6 places on the net for $15 with a list price of 19.95. How can they sell this for higher than list with a good conscience?</li>
    <li> I liked the product more when the ingredients were a little thicker. I have fine hair and it worked well at one time.</li>
    <li> I adore this product and was so upset when I found out it was no longer on the market at my salon.  So happy I found it here so I bought 2 of them.  It&#x27;s very pricey but I love it so was happy to pay</li>
    <li> I love this product I have been using it for years and have been unable to find it now that they discontinued it. It was like winning the lottery when I found this item</li>
    <li> best product ever WHEN it was being made.  but, they don&#x27;t make it anymore and if you do find some online, as i did - DO NOT BUY IT.  someone is selling decomposing chemicals not fit for use on the hair or anywhere else, packaged in the same original tube.  sadly, the original is gone and it&#x27;s time to find something else by Sebastian.</li>
    <li> The product is great but it&#x27;s discontinued and there are old bottles so the texture could be better. At least I could fine it.</li>
    <li> This product was not up to the standards of Saebastian Gel I have purchased in the past.  The color and smell were off in my option however the seller quickly refunded my money and I sent product back.</li>
    <li> This laminate is perfect in giving me a little bit that makes my hair shiney, and it&#x27;s great if it is available to buy it again soon!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product.  It&#x27;s suppose to be in a gel form.  When I received it, it was a bit too liquified to be the hair product that I have always used it for.  Maybe it was an old tube....I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> The product I received was not what was advertised.  There are several Sebastian hair styling gels and the one I wanted is the one shown in the picture  -- &amp;#34;concentrate gel&amp;#34;.  What I received was &amp;#34;concentrated body shine&amp;#34; -- not the same thing at all.  After convincing the vendor that this was the case, I was able to return the merchandise.  So my complaint is with the vendor, not the product itself.</li>
    <li> is the best product that makes my hair shine and its clean, no mess al all, it is real good</li>
    <li> The gel was half gone, and WAY beyond out of date.&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT be doing business with these people again.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t send it back because it would cost ME MONEY&lt;br /&gt;so I threw it away. NOT HAPPY.</li>
    <li> Sebastian blew it when they took this off the shelves :(</li>
    <li> It is very sticky and thick  Hard to get out of tube  Will not purchase again.  Expensive for an old product</li>
    <li> Thank u!!! I have been looking for this gel since they discontinued it in the stores. Thanks for the great product and the promt delivery. Packaged very well and delivered on time. Once again. Thank u</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price. Shippment was fast and also reasonable in price. Would do business with them anytime!</li>
    <li> Service was good.  My only concern is that the product is authentic.  I loved this product and am happy to have it...but Sebastian discontinued this more than a year ago so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
    <li> This line is discontinued and I can&#x27;t find another product like it!  It is the best for dry hair.  Get compliments on my hair every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product in stores for what seems like ages.  Was very pleased to locate it here, and at a similar price that I paid in the stores.  It came quickly and am very happy to have finally gotten it to add to my hair care routine.</li>
