      <li>great, no issues :)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This battery operated toothbrush works great and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B toothbrush I had</li>
      <li>Those who say the head spins...need to do some testing of their own.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a no-frills kind of guy, and thought electric toothbrushes were a gimmick to replicate some elbow grease.</li>

      <li>Many elderly users would not be able to operate the switch at all.  </li>

      <li>Fast delivery and great price.  </li>
      <li>They are OK for a week or two.</li>
      <li>HOwever, the newer versions of this toothbrush are much, much better.</li>
      <li>For the most part, the toothbrush does all the work.</li>
      <li>, I am SO glad I gave this a try.</li>

      <li>I have been using these brushes for several years and they have always been just great.</li>

      <li>and it does a great job and lasts a long time, eventually the on/off switch quits working (4-5 months)</li>
      <li>Feel clean by using this.</li>
      <li>This one makes my teeth feel as clean as if I just came from the dentist.</li>
      <li>Spinbrush Classic Clean Battery Powered Toothbrush, the personals I bought that for enjoyed it and thinks it works well.</li>
      <li>Adequate battery life.</li>
      <li>I love a spin-brush, but it turns out that on this version, the very top circle spins, but the bottom portion doesn&#x27;t move up and down.  </li>
      <li>This one is definitely better than the new design.</li>
      <li>The brush head I replace exactly at 3 months and also, I thoroughly clean this brush after each use (according to directions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Been using this for a few months now, it works great.</li>
      <li>Great brush for heavy duty.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old Spin Brush had seen better days, so I replaced it with this one.  </li>
      <li>so I figured this was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>You might want to take the included brush with you to make sure you get the right dual action one as they look almost alike.</li>
      <li>My gums are now a healthy pink, teeth very clean</li>
      <li>With pliers, it pops right</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d say yes -- every six months right before I came in.</li>
      <li>I put my old dual action brush head on my new brush, and I&#x27;m finally happy with it.  </li>
      <li>It certainly gets my teeth clean, but even with soft bristles it is easy to be overly aggressive with the brush.</li>
      <li>Amazing how much cleaner your teeth feel compared to using a regular toothbrush.</li>

      <li>[[ASIN:B0012E0REM Crest Classic Clean SpinBrush Multi-Level Bristles Toothbrush]]  </li>
      <li>This toothbrush works fine, but it is so loud.</li>
      <li>These suckers clean teeth good.</li>
      <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t pinch my inner cheek like the Top Care brand does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pay off was that I&#x27;ve boycotted the P&amp;G brand since then, and switched to the Arm &amp; Hammer spinbrush, which not only works well, BUT the handle is far more comfortable for me to use.</li>
      <li>Comes with batteries and ready to use--also a plus!</li>
      <li>If you buy this product, the first thing you should do when you get it is to throw away the brush that comes with it.</li>
      <li>In future will pay a couple bucks more for the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; model which both sets of brushes move.</li>
      <li>Because this is NOT a Sonic type, I was able to find Dual Action replacement brushes that fit this one in a local brick and mortar store.</li>
      <li>Soft and fast, perfect for those hard to reach molars!</li>
      <li>It was then sold with an extra brush head, but I couldn&#x27;t fit it on when the first one needed replacing.</li>
      <li>This is a great little toothbrush, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>and I ordered mine in light blue.</li>
      <li>really &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Really wish a dentist had recommended this to me at some point.</li>
      <li>and it vibrates too much, like the other brand I bought much better.  </li>
      <li>IT cleans better than other battery powered ones i&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>First, my old one was &amp;#34;dual action,&amp;#34; this one is not!  </li>
      <li>For a full replacement, they sent me a Citi credit card with $10 credit, but to use it I had to actually open an account with Citi.</li>
      <li>, it comes with a non dual, older style of brush head.</li>
      <li>These $6 battery powered toothbrushes cannot be beat for performance and longevity, recommended highly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>The tooth brush work normal.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fast delivery and great price.  Have used this brand before and it does a great job and lasts a long time, eventually the on/off switch quits working (4-5 months) on every one we&#x27;ve had.  Batteries (AA) are replaceable as are the brush heads but heads are very expensive.  Highly recommend.  As an add-on item the price is $5 less than Walmart&#x27;s price.  Took off 1 star because only the round brush rotates and the other bristles are stationary.  In future will pay a couple bucks more for the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; model which both sets of brushes move.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of these.  They are OK for a week or two. The little \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; switch is only a small plastic bump---impossible to manipulate, especially if your hands are wet. Many elderly users would not be able to operate the switch at all.  After a week, water collects in the battery compartment and corrodes the terminals causing it to stop working.  And the terminals are down in a hole to keep you from cleaning them.  As others have mentioned, the battery compartment is hard to open and the orientation of the batteries requires some study.  Now, the little bearings have gone out and the thing howls like a banshee when I can actually get it to run. Today it&#x27;s going into the trash and I&#x27;m going buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush.  No issues with the dentist since using it.  HOwever, the newer versions of this toothbrush are much, much better.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0012E0REM Crest Classic Clean SpinBrush Multi-Level Bristles Toothbrush]]  Although the Spinbrush provides good cleaning, I found the changing of batteries very difficult.  I needed a pair of pliers to remove the base of the brush and actually had to use a hammer to replace the base.  The second time I tried to change the batteries I was unable to seat the base into the body of the brush.</li>
    <li> Need clean teeth.. works!</li>
    <li> My hygienist used to ask me if I flossed regularly and I&#x27;d say yes -- every six months right before I came in. That was ten years ago when I bought my first spin brush. My hygienist now has said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, but make sure you keep doing it\\&quot;. My first spin brush took ten years to break and I just replaced it with another one. The secret to low plaque levels, I believe is the actual spin brush attachment itself. If you buy this product, the first thing you should do when you get it is to throw away the brush that comes with it. Or, do as I do and use it for cleaning jewelry or grout. Go to your favorite grocery store and buy new refills, BUT, make sure they are \\&quot;dual action\\&quot;. My refills all seem to have the Arm and Hammer brand on them and it&#x27;s hard to find the words \\&quot;dual action\\&quot; but it&#x27;s on the back of the package about a third the way down. What this means is 1) the round part spins as expected, and 2) the lower part moves forward and back at high speed. This movement allows the lower brush bristles to work their way in between the teeth, the same way floss does, ergo the statement from my hygienist. You might want to take the included brush with you to make sure you get the right dual action one as they look almost alike. And, yes, I agree that the battery compartment lid is hard to get off and the on/off switch gets slippery when wet, which is why 4 stars instead of 5. But oh how nice it is to have really clean teeth. Remember, if you don&#x27;t get the dual action brushes you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
    <li> PROS...Two brushes that rotate in different directions. Vigorous vibrations. Cleans very well, making me feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office. Adequate battery life. The brush doesn&#x27;t pinch my inner cheek like the Top Care brand does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS... the battery cover is hard to remove without using a pair of pliers. With pliers, it pops right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another when this fails.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband....he loves it. He actually brushes thrice in a day now. I feel like i got my husband a toy to play with...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied. Battery is working fine..its been more than 2 months now.</li>
    <li> I love a spin-brush, but it turns out that on this version, the very top circle spins, but the bottom portion doesn&#x27;t move up and down.  A little bit disappointed in this particular version.</li>
    <li> I like the action of the bristles, but the handle gets very slippery when it gets wet. I&#x27;ve had it slip out of my hand several times.</li>
    <li> It is what it is! The batteries and heads are also replaceable!</li>
    <li> It has great rotation.  Have had other more expensive brushes that did not do as good a job of cleaning tarter.</li>
    <li> This one is my favorite, I keep buying more. IT cleans better than other battery powered ones i&#x27;ve bought. Cheaper than buying replacement heads.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works fine, but it is so loud.</li>
    <li> Been using this type of brush for years. Has worked great for my type of teeth. I have periodontitis problems.</li>
    <li> Original Review July 8, 2015:  &amp;#34;Works great, no issues :)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Review September 2016:  I expected (for some reason) for this “Arm &amp; Hammer Classic Spinbrush Toothbrush (Battery Operated” to last for quite awhile, so I ordered extra brush tips.  I used the toothbrush for about 3 months and the battery died, no problem.  Put new batteries in it, and it worked for another month or so and then suddenly the Spinbrush just stopped working.  My husband, the ‘handyman extraordinaire’ even looked at it and I had high hopes for it to return to live, no such luck.  I ended up having to throw it in the recycling bin.  I must say that I was pretty disappointed.  I am going to, (I believe this to be reasonable), drop my review to a (4) star rating because I truly expected this Spinbrush to last at least (6) months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize it took me so long to write the updated review, I had a major back surgery and have been completely pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read our review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0012E0REM ARM &amp; HAMMER Spinbrush Classic Clean Battery Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years. They clean much better than a manual toothbrush and cost much less than some other big name brands.</li>
    <li> Water and toothpaste shoot out of the little hole below the brush and gets all over everything-your arms, the mirror, the sink, etc. I basically have to take a washcloth to my arms after using it. I am throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Hubby requested it &amp; likes it!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months now, it works great. It is a little noisy, but that is expected with this kind of toothbrush. Amazing how much cleaner your teeth feel compared to using a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> They Work Great-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; these brushes.  They work Terrific I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
    <li> Works good.  Good price</li>
    <li> Great Seller/ Great product</li>
    <li> Great brush for heavy duty.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter both use this type of Spinbrush and they love it. The toothbrush batter lasts a very long time without needing to be replaced and the spinning nature of the brush makes for a cleaner experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is water proof for the most part, has a nice texture on the bristols, and yet it is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have since moved onto the superior Sonic Care, I still recommend this cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> This is my third one is the last 10 years.  The replacement heads are not to expensive and it cleans just fine.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; model does NOT do what every Spinbrush in the modern era does: move both sections of the brush - spinning the round brush and gyrating the lower, rectangular section. This model ONLY spins the round brush. The rectangular section remains stationary.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for several years and they have always been just great. There is a newer version but the same brush heads will not fit.</li>
    <li> Never used an electric toothbrush before. Then I bought 2 of these. One for me and one for my husband. I dont know how they get away with calling it a &amp;#34;Spinbrush&amp;#34; when the head doesnt spin...it only oscillates !! The head only moves each direction less the 1/4 turn. My husband marked the plastic part of the head with a dry erase marker and turned it on and watched the head movement. Those who say the head spins...need to do some testing of their own. We will use these until the bateries die then toss em in the trash. They arent worth the few dollars it would cost for new batteries !!! &amp;#60;thumbs down&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> rechargeable batteries do not fit</li>
    <li> For me, when I read the reviews about this toothbrush, I was just a bit unsure as to whether to purchase this battery powered toothbrush OR NOT...However, I did and I am glad I did! What I found is that this brush is so gentle and cleans both my teeth and massages my gums wonderfully (I have Gingivitis and tender gums and this toothbrush has helped my dental health improve). My gums are now a healthy pink, teeth very clean etc!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it comes with a non dual, older style of brush head. But this is what I discovered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) When I brush, I brush rapidly in a CIRCULAR MOTION and take my time. I brush for two FULL minutes  and also I brush TWO TO THREE times daily at least. *By brushing in a circular motion and focusing on each tooth and in between each tooth, gumline etc, this really does a through and effective cleaning for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I purchased the SOFT brush because this is recommended over a medium or hard one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The brush head I replace exactly at 3 months and also, I thoroughly clean this brush after each use (according to directions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) After brushing, I rinse with Listerine Antiseptic Rinse and my teeth and gums are very clean and I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Because this is NOT a Sonic type, I was able to find Dual Action replacement brushes that fit this one in a local brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> handle is too fat and it vibrates too much, like the other brand I bought much better.  Oral B is smaller and no bad vibration and less noise.</li>
    <li> It certainly gets my teeth clean, but even with soft bristles it is easy to be overly aggressive with the brush. It took me a few tries to discover that my teeth were perfectly clean even when I felt the brush was barely making contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also noisy and the batteries are difficult to get in and out, as other reviewers have noted. Still, the price is good and the replacement heads are easy to find, so I guess I&#x27;ll stick with this model...for now.</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with a neuromuscular disorder that causes me to struggle with weakness when even performing the most mundane tasks - including brushing my teeth. I was on the fence about getting an electric toothbrush because of the expense ($60+), and I wasn&#x27;t even sure it would help. So, when I saw this inexpensive option, I decided to give it a try. For less than $6, it was an affordable &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am SO glad I gave this a try. It has changed brushing my teeth from an exhausting chore to an easily manageable one. For the most part, the toothbrush does all the work. It requires very little pressure against the teeth to get them clean and the rotating head makes getting behind teeth much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it makes some noise, but I don&#x27;t see that as a problem. It certainly isn&#x27;t as loud as the hairdryer I use every morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any reason yet to move up to a more expensive electric toothbrush. This one makes my teeth feel as clean as if I just came from the dentist. I am sticking with this one. Very glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Spinbrush Classic Clean Battery Powered Toothbrush, the personals I bought that for enjoyed it and thinks it works well.</li>
    <li> Really wish a dentist had recommended this to me at some point. I&#x27;m a no-frills kind of guy, and thought electric toothbrushes were a gimmick to replicate some elbow grease. But my teeth were getting tea stains and no amount of brushing and flossing did it so I figured this was worth a shot. Five seconds with one of these and I looked like I&#x27;d stepped out of the dentist&#x27;s chair. My teeth look great now.</li>
    <li> Mine works great. It&#x27;s very powerful. I discounted one star because mine came in violet and I ordered mine in light blue.</li>
    <li> Break battery powered spin rush. Soft and fast, perfect for those hard to reach molars! Feel clean by using this.</li>
    <li> I missed this style of electric tooth brush. This one is definitely better than the new design.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a replacement for one I still have but has been used several years.  The current one I use has dual action and the new one does not.  It will not go up and down on the lower portion of the brush as my current one does. That part of the brush is fixed, not movable. The brush at the end does rotate oK.</li>
    <li> Good as going to the dentist!</li>
    <li> Cleans teeth, what more can I say.</li>
    <li> Excellent power toothbrush for a great price. Shipping was fast as usual for Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old Spin Brush had seen better days, so I replaced it with this one.  First, my old one was &amp;#34;dual action,&amp;#34; this one is not!  Also this one spits water and toothpaste out of the little hole on the back, ALL OVER the place.  I put my old dual action brush head on my new brush, and I&#x27;m finally happy with it.  Now to find replacement heads in the old design.....</li>
    <li> Only one part of the head work.  But I have back up heads.  And when I put the back up head on. The tooth brush work normal.  These suckers clean teeth good.</li>
    <li> Loudest toothbrush on the planet.  The sonic waves it generatesmust be what cleans your teeth.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Oral B powered toothbrush for some time. It was then sold with an extra brush head, but I couldn&#x27;t fit it on when the first one needed replacing. Contacted Proctor and Gamble and went through weeks of wrangling with them. For a full replacement, they sent me a Citi credit card with $10 credit, but to use it I had to actually open an account with Citi. I declined to do so. Finally P&amp;G grudgingly sent me a $10 coupon, but the drug store didn&#x27;t want to honor it because it wasn&#x27;t for the full amount of the replacement - there were a few cents left over and I was not allowed to top it off with some change. Then the manager took pity on me, and after almost half an hour on the phone,  the company  agreed to accept the coupon. Pay off was that I&#x27;ve boycotted the P&amp;G brand since then, and switched to the Arm &amp; Hammer spinbrush, which not only works well, BUT the handle is far more comfortable for me to use.</li>
    <li> Have a Colgate model which I could NOT find anywhere and hoped this would be a good replacement; sorry to report NO!!  Located replacement heads for the Colgate and it easily out preforms this model and NO folks, NOT getting paid to say this OK??</li>
    <li> great product great seller</li>
    <li> Lasted a week, not worth it. Going back to Oral B.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Especially for the money- you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little toothbrush, especially for the price. I&#x27;ll buy another one when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> These $6 battery powered toothbrushes cannot be beat for performance and longevity, recommended highly.</li>
    <li> Nothing makes your teeth feel cleaner than using a spinbrush. I love these things. I also liked that I couldn&#x27;t choose a color--you just gotta wait til it arrives and see what fate paired you up with! Comes with batteries and ready to use--also a plus!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush at a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> Always buy my four kids these at Christmas time for stockings.  Before you know it they are brushing more often without being asked.</li>
    <li> Great transaction! Good quality merchandise at a great price.</li>
    <li> This battery operated toothbrush works great and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B toothbrush I had before had a small oval hole below the bristles and would actually pinch the inside of my cheek.  Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good purchase.</li>
