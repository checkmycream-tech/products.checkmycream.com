      <li>/&gt;Overall, its just okay.</li>
      <li>Nice blow dryer, get&#x27;s nice and hot.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to assemble.  </li>
      <li>Assembly was easy.</li>
      <li>Item was lightweight and easy to use.</li>
      <li>easy to adjust.  </li>
      <li>Works fine and drys well.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the dryer works fine.</li>
      <li>heated up quickly but more noise than air flow...</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>PERFECT for small salons....</li>
      <li>The downside is that hood almost covers the face and the heat gets pretty hot on top of the clients head.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good dryer, it definitely gets super hot.  </li>
      <li>it averages to about $3/month which is worth every cent I paid.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had nothing but success.</li>
      <li>It gets hot and stays hot!</li>
      <li>dryer itself is good and gets very hot to dry quickly, but the lack of the ring has me at a loss for the proper</li>
      <li>it gets really hot</li>
      <li>It heats well and is very nice to look act, but extremely top heavy and the connecting piece from the bonnet to the stand was plastic, so all it took was one pull down to break it....</li>
      <li>Really  rubbish it caught fire as I switched it on for the first time  </li>
      <li>This thing looks really fancy and if not for my thinning pate</li>
      <li>It also dries my hair really well.</li>
      <li>I have very curly mid-back length hair.</li>
      <li>The dryer is light-weight yet very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>If you set it on a lower setting it still does the job but without as much noise.</li>
      <li>This dryer gets extremely hot and it does live up to its name.</li>
      <li>If you can afford to pay more you might want to check out other options.</li>
      <li>Whithout the second ring the dryer lacks the full height adjustment</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really give it a solid rating overall because I&#x27;m sure it was meant to sit still during use.</li>
      <li>After I heard my girlfriend mention how she could maintain her hair in-between salon visits if she only had a good hair dryer,  I decided that I could save my self a little money if I bought her one.  </li>
      <li>Got a little noisy on first  minute of being on..but delivers a hot n quick drying time. ...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>She really loves this dryer and uses it frequently.  </li>
      <li>With the top being to heavy both fell and broke on two clients.</li>
      <li>I used flex rods (jumbo) and the top of my hair dried fine, but it was hard to get my whole head under the dryer with the rods sticking out like tree branches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>gets hot enough.</li>
      <li>But it is loud!  </li>
      <li>I used this hair dryer on my mom&#x27;s hair last night for the first time.  </li>
      <li>It is a tight fit but it fits.</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble and our very versatile for various color applications when it is necessary to have heat moved from one side of the head to the other.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product and found the wheels consistently unstable, but because I had thrown away the box, I opted to keep trying to use it even propping it on furniture to dry my natural hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s considerably quiet when you compare it to other dryers that sound like lawn mowers.</li>
      <li>Therefore I had to go to old universal replacement of &amp;#34;Duct Tape&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Entirely too loud...</li>
      <li>This dryer is much sturdier than I expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Pretty good dryer, it definitely gets super hot.  It was easy to assemble.  The downside is that hood almost covers the face and the heat gets pretty hot on top of the clients head.  It also is already starting to lean to one side in a months time.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst hair dryer!!! I purchased two for my salon and what a mistake. The hood part is way to heavy for the poles it leans forward and you can&#x27;t adjust it to up and down. With the top being to heavy both fell and broke on two clients. What a nightmare!!!!! Poor quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted.  The heating is great.</li>
    <li> I sent it back because it was broken.</li>
    <li> Item was lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This dryer served me well while it worked. I bought it in September of 2012. It is now July 2015 and it started heating less a couple of months ago, well today it started squealing and knocking and sparked. So that&#x27;s that all dead and gone. I&#x27;m not sure what the life expectancy is on these but mine lasted just shy of three years. I got it on sale at Sally&#x27;s and at the price I got it it averages to about $3/month which is worth every cent I paid.</li>
    <li> It takes longer to dry out the hair but okay not perfect tho</li>
    <li> This dryer and others of thus style have a design flaw. The heavy hood is not sufficiently supported. Therefore if your guest bumps it at all while underneath it will come off the post and fall on your guest or onto the floor. Otherwise the dryer works fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy but Works great! I am glad I made this purchase! I recommend it especially if you have curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product waz very easy to put together and looks quite nice it also has the feel of being in a salon it gets really hot I just store in a safe stable area where there is no movement til I need it again</li>
    <li> Hmmmm, This one is hard as it seems I did not get the one of the black rings in the pacakage. Therefore I had to go to old universal replacement of &amp;#34;Duct Tape&amp;#34;. Whithout the second ring the dryer lacks the full height adjustment functionality.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is good and gets very hot to dry quickly, but the lack of the ring has me at a loss for the proper function.&lt;br /&gt;Of course Amazon delivered it perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great style,nice color,easy to adjust height,good air flow and heat temperature for color, perm ,highlights. Cost was a lot less than buying from a Beauty supply house.</li>
    <li> Entirely too loud...Did not meet expectations...do not recommend for salon use. heated up quickly but more noise than air flow...&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
    <li> Works fine and drys well. Doesn&#x27;t  burn my ears. If you set it on a lower setting it still does the job but without as much noise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 2 weeks and have used it to deep condition as well as to dry my transitioning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For deep conditionig its okay, works good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dryiing. In fairness my hair is long thick african- american hair and even when I go to the salon I have to sit under the dryer for 1-2 hours to get my hair completly dry. I bought this because I want to roller set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I used flex rods (jumbo) and the top of my hair dried fine, but it was hard to get my whole head under the dryer with the rods sticking out like tree branches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. cold perm rods. My hair dried half wayl! I took my rollers out after 2 hours and then sat back down for 30 minn and 15 minn on cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try this with curlformers (the Vakind knock-offs) to see if I get different reslts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its just okay. if your hair is shorter and not as dense, than go for it! If you have hair similar to mine, just save your money and get something stroner.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and doesnot get in the way!  Works well, runs quietly...  PERFECT for small salons.... I would reccommed it to others...</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I&#x27;m loving it. It&#x27;s considerably quiet when you compare it to other dryers that sound like lawn mowers. Perfect for salon use or privately at home. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked superbly!!! This dryer gets extremely hot and it does live up to its name. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This dryer will get the job done. But it is loud!  If this is your price point give it a go. If you can afford to pay more you might want to check out other options.</li>
    <li> This product is a low-quality have not had it three months and the leg has already broken</li>
    <li> I only used this for about 30 minutes a week in the salon. It is already making a rattling noise and has for the last month or so.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and found the wheels consistently unstable, but because I had thrown away the box, I opted to keep trying to use it even propping it on furniture to dry my natural hair.  However, recently, it came apart even braced and fell on the floor very narrowly missing chipping my glass table.  An effort to seek a refund or replacement about two weeks ago stalled after a representative from the company said they found no record of my purchase.  I sent a screenshot of the transaction and have not heard back since.  Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> It gets hot and stays hot!</li>
    <li> After I heard my girlfriend mention how she could maintain her hair in-between salon visits if she only had a good hair dryer,  I decided that I could save my self a little money if I bought her one.  This isn&#x27;t a good dryer it&#x27;s a phenomenal dryer.  She really loves this dryer and uses it frequently.  Her mom and sisters are all jealousy and think I&#x27;m the greatest boyfriend ever!  This thing looks really fancy and if not for my thinning pate I think I&#x27;d give it a whirl.</li>
    <li> The dryer is light-weight yet very sturdy.  It dried my hair efficiently in less time than my old dryer.Easy to move around, and has a nice design.</li>
    <li> should have invested in a stand hair dryer a long time ago.  this is great.  easy to adjust.  gets hot enough.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great and super easy to put together!</li>
    <li> This dryer is much sturdier than I expected. It also dries my hair really well. I love it.hope it never breaks lol</li>
    <li> Instantly overhead when I plugged it in.. It started to glow, smoke and making electrical noise. .. very dangerous,  take it off the market before it seriously hurts someone... terrible product</li>
    <li> I received the item with a broken wheel lock. I tried reaching out to the seller, even sending them a picture of the broken wheel lock but I got no response from them.  The inability to lock the wheel causes the dryer to roam while in use so I can&#x27;t really give it a solid rating overall because I&#x27;m sure it was meant to sit still during use.</li>
    <li> It heats well and is very nice to look act, but extremely top heavy and the connecting piece from the bonnet to the stand was plastic, so all it took was one pull down to break it....soo disappointed</li>
    <li> This dryer is not a good quality dryer. It is now unuseable after two dryings.  The hood broke and is no longer attached to the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just too much trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> Really  rubbish it caught fire as I switched it on for the first time  never  used it once  I made a complaint and was told to ship it back  postage was 170 Au dollars so now I&#x27;m sitting with a burnt item disgusted with purchase</li>
    <li> Got a little noisy on first  minute of being on..but delivers a hot n quick drying time. ...love it</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this dryer at Sally&#x27;s(on sale)! Assembly was easy. I have very curly mid-back length hair. It is very difficult to hand blow dry and the flat iron is very damaging on my dry curly hair. I have to use about 7-9 jumbo rollers and about 4-6 medium rollers throughout my hair. It is a tight fit but it fits. I stayed under about an hour just to see and it was about 85% dry!!! For my texture and length of hair this is very good. At the salon in under for 3-4 hours and they end up blow drying the rest of the way. Mines came with a two year warranty plus an additional year purchased from Sally&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used it a total of four times and I&#x27;ve had nothing but success.</li>
    <li> Items delivered ahead of schedule. Easy to assemble and our very versatile for various color applications when it is necessary to have heat moved from one side of the head to the other.  You could not do this with standard stationary dryers.</li>
    <li> It is a good dryer but the piece that holds the head on the stick broke. I believe the head is too heavy and that middle pc should be made of metal vs plastic.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer on my mom&#x27;s hair last night for the first time.  She fell asleep while under the dryer and woke to a beautiful head of hair.  Her hairdresser fell ill and we are left to care for her hair.  I have no experience doing hair, but this convenient hair dryer made it a great experience.</li>
    <li> Nice blow dryer, get&#x27;s nice and hot.  I use it for my hard core protein treatments only.</li>
