      <li>However, when I came across this Argan Luxury Organic Pure Argan Oil it attracted my attention because the one I have been using has more ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>This is an exceptional product that arrived in a box that was sealed which actually contained a sealed bottle too.</li>
      <li>It might be just the thing for my hair as well as my hands as my hair is generally thick and unruly and needs a good product to keep it manageable and nice looking.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly when you put it on your skin too.</li>
      <li>I just love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, my hair still gets pretty tangled during the night, but the moisture at the ends of my hair certainly made my hair more manageable.</li>
      <li>In less than a month I have seen great improvement.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed by the skin quickly</li>
      <li>Argan oil should smell like fresh olives which Luxury Argan Oil does.  </li>
      <li>I love the red pouch which adds a special quality to the purchase.  </li>
      <li>I started right before Christmas.</li>
      <li>It does not absorb quickly, but it definitely does what I expected - moisturizes  face, neckline, and hair beautifully.</li>
      <li>I have recommended it to clients for Dry brittle hair and have seen amazing improvements.</li>
      <li>It looked exactly like it did when I purchased it on Amazon.com.</li>

      <li>I also love to use it after a shower on my skin, it really has done wonders for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>To me it is so much lighter than what I had used before and when I massaged it through my hair</li>
      <li>It really saved my skin this winter.  </li>
      <li>I even went to their website just to see if the company really existed and it does.</li>
      <li>Sellers are very helpful as well.</li>
      <li>It has way too many other uses to list here.</li>
      <li>I find that the only time the oil doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly is when I use too much.  </li>
      <li>--you&#x27;ll not waste a drop of this oil thanks to the eyedropper applicator!</li>
      <li>I am very health conscious and I just want organic, pure products on my face and body.</li>
      <li>Most hand creams that I have tried usually only last maybe 1/2 to 1 hour</li>
      <li>The argan oils from high quality hair product lines don&#x27;t do this.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>I have only been using the product for a few weeks, but I love it!  </li>
      <li>Plus I received it in a timely manner, and with the nice little red satin pouch to go with it.</li>

      <li>I have been using this argan oil under my eyes at night and on my entire face first thing in the morning for about a month or more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave hair grease, but be careful not to apply more than 4-5 drops for long hair.</li>
      <li>Familiar with Argan oil from previous use.</li>
      <li>I could feel my body absorbing nutrients, especially in my legs and feet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the advertised brand and can&#x27;t see any difference so far.  </li>
      <li>I also use it on my feet and hands to keep them soft.  </li>
      <li>It smelled like old moldy olives.</li>

    <li> Argan oil should smell like fresh olives which Luxury Argan Oil does.  If Argan oil has no odor, then it has been overly processed.  I have very sensitive skin.  I am allergic to many face creams, especially in the winter when my skin is extremely allergic to almost anything I apply.  Luxury Argan oil is one of the few things that does not cause my skin to have an allergic reaction and sting.  It really saved my skin this winter.  Now that the weather is warmer, I am mixing a few drops into my daily moisturizer and love it.  I find that the only time the oil doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly is when I use too much.  I also use it on my feet and hands to keep them soft.  Love this product.  I have been using it for well over a year and I am reordering.</li>
    <li> My hands can get very dry and that becomes very annoying.  Most hand creams that I have tried usually only last maybe 1/2 to 1 hour and then I&#x27;m getting the dry sensation again.  But not with the Argon oil.  A few drops of this thoroughly rubbed in to my hands and they stay feeling properly for hours even after washing dishes.  So I&#x27;m sold on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because my wife didn&#x27;t seem to like it. I&#x27;m not sure why, I think she tried it on her hair.  I have noticed though that she is using it on her hands.  So that could be where it works best in our family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do plan to try it in my hair and see how it goes.  It might be just the thing for my hair as well as my hands as my hair is generally thick and unruly and needs a good product to keep it manageable and nice looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and I Love it. I am a Hairstylist and have found multiple uses for it. I use it to smooth out a clients hair before and after blow drying. I have recommended it to clients for Dry brittle hair and have seen amazing improvements. I love how it instantly absorbs into my skin. I have had Callluses on my feet from standing all day and use it at night with socks and my feel feel so great. I use it for dry skin, my arms and shins have been my problem areas and really have seen improvement. Oh yes, I also use it in my bleach applications when highlighting hair, it keeps the hair shaft from damage and dryness. Love Love Love this product.</li>
    <li> I received my Argan Oil earlier than what I expected. It looked exactly like it did when I purchased it on Amazon.com. I use it for my skin, hair and nails and I use it everyday. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate me at all. I also like the fact the the argan oil was in a dark bottle and pouch because it preserves the effectiveness of the oil this is the reason why I chose to purchase from Luxury Manufacturing. I even went to their website just to see if the company really existed and it does. They also have other products that you can purchase on their site. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful. Occasionally I&#x27;ll catch an odd odor, sort of forest-like, but otherwise it is almost completely odorless. My nails are dry with peeling layers. The argon oil was absorbed into all the white peeled sections making them look normal, wonderful to use while waiting for my nails to grow out healthy. I also use a few drops for dry skin, or to work through damp hair. It can be added to toner or to lotion to increase their effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Familiar with Argan oil from previous use. I am impressed by the quality and no fragrance; am getting my husband to use it for very tender skin which has gotten sunburned.  Great pricing as well.</li>
    <li> I was given this oil as a gift and I absolutely love it!!  This is a great oil, I use it especially for my nails and cuticles and they are in the best shape they&#x27;ve been in in years!  I also love to use it after a shower on my skin, it really has done wonders for my dry skin.  Highly recommend this Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Pure Argan oil has helped to relieve an eczema condition that I have. I have very dry hair as well and this oil has helped enormously, Over all, it has contributed to my skin being healthier</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending me this product.  My husband uses it daily and has expressed his pleasure at the changes in his skin created by this product.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops on hair ends to moisturize and add shine and manageability.  Hair looks and feels soft and helps to fight tangling and frizz.  Be careful not to use more than 4-5 drops to avoid weighing hair down, it&#x27;s an oil after all and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love the oil-always have and this is good quality, for a fair price.  Don&#x27;t love the packaging with the dropper but it works. Especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I had Rosacea in my face for 20 years and had to use antibiotics at times to handle it. It was horrible in summer - all red splotches. No matter what I did, it always came back. A few months ago I started to use this Argan Oil daily and my Rosacea is GONE! Disappeared! I have only used 1/3rd of a bottle - it only takes a few drops per application - THANKS! AWESOME PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I was actually searching for Agadir Argan Oil.  However, when I came across this Argan Luxury Organic Pure Argan Oil it attracted my attention because the one I have been using has more ingredients in it. This one is pure Argan Oil so i decided to order it.  I am very happy that I did.  To me it is so much lighter than what I had used before and when I massaged it through my hair I did not notice any oily consistency like I have had with the Agadir product.  I even tried it on my face which i would have never thought of on the other product.  I love that it comes in it&#x27;s own box plus a special red velvet bag that is perfect to travel with.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My Mom and I are trying Argan oil for the first time and we both really like it.  We are using it on our faces, hair and neck and can already see and feel a nice difference.  Love this oil. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil on my skin and most specifically my knee scar from my knee surgery. I started right before Christmas. My scar was very dark, puffy and sore. In less than a month I have seen great improvement. Not sore at all now and the healing has speeded up a lot. My doctor commented at the beginning of January that I was way ahead  of where I should be at 5 months. This product is great.</li>
    <li> disappointed with this product..didn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as others claimed it would.  I have very sensitive skin and my skin did get slightly red after applying the oil.</li>
    <li> Wow! I got a cut working with some equipment and put the Best Argan Oil on it and it healed up right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses if on her hair to make it more smooth and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we both carry a bottle with us where ever we go!</li>
    <li> I got this product, and wasn&#x27;t sure about it. Well, it didn&#x27;t take me long to adore this product. I use it on a daily basis. In the morning, I apply some on my face after cleansing On wet hair, I apply a drop or two to ease and speed my hair styling. In the evening, after cleansing. According to my friends and family, I look radiant and my hair is so much more in control. I just love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this argan oil! It has a wonderful texture, absorbs readily, and there is no odor, just a mild, pleasant, fresh smell.  I love the red pouch which adds a special quality to the purchase.  I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about argan oil, and look forward to lathering myself in it to obtain all the great benefits it offers!  Plus, I&#x27;m an organic kind of person, so love that this is a pure, organic product!  I am definitely happy with this purchase and recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This is a light, delicate oil that I&#x27;ve been using on my face and neck area -- and also a bit on my fingernails. I really love how it feels on my skin and how it softens and smooths it.  I&#x27;ve also seen some improvement in my ridgy nails after just a few applications. And a little goes a long way--you&#x27;ll not waste a drop of this oil thanks to the eyedropper applicator! This is truly a luxury argan oil minus the high cost. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a few weeks, but I love it!  It is an oil, but doesn&#x27;t look oily, it makes my skin look soft and supple, no dry skin lines like some moisturizers do, and my wrinkles have somewhat diminished, so far.  I expect as I continue to use it, my skin will look better each day.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and can&#x27;t get enough.  I&#x27;ve used the advertised brand and can&#x27;t see any difference so far.  I especially like it on my lips and hair.  Plan to expand my uses with the list you sent me.  Like those masks, etc. and lip treatment.  Thank you for sending it to me.</li>
    <li> Incredibly disappointed in the product. I was expecting something similar to the Josey Moran oil that I have been using for the last year. When I opened the package and went to use this oil it smelled rancid. It smelled like old moldy olives. Disgusting!</li>
    <li> This oil is exceptional! From.the moment I applied it to my skin I could feel my body absorbing nutrients, especially in my legs and feet. Also, my hair is feeling better and my scalp has stopped flaking, finally!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing oil.  It is absorbed by the skin quickly so you are not left with greasy skin.  Sellers are very helpful as well.</li>
    <li> I have really thick curly hair, and it gets damaged easily because of the color I put in it, plus hair drying, etc. I was very happy with this product. I could tell the difference with one application. I used it on my hair while wet. I didn&#x27;t put any other product in my hair as I wanted to see the difference alone. It kept my hair feeling soft, with little frizz and manageable. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, my hair still gets pretty tangled during the night, but the moisture at the ends of my hair certainly made my hair more manageable. Plus I received it in a timely manner, and with the nice little red satin pouch to go with it. It was actually larger than I anticipated. My daughter had just received argan oil in one of her monthly boxes she subscribes to... and I hate to admit it but mine was better. :) I have not used it on nails or skin yet but I&#x27;m assuming it will have the same results. If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll come back and revise.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product that arrived in a box that was sealed which actually contained a sealed bottle too. ( I have purchased quite a few other oils here on Amazon that are not sealed ... and therefore dubious in origin.) I have an ongoing battle with dry hair and frizz. This stuff has solved the problem and is not greasy. It absorbs quickly when you put it on your skin too. I put a little into my hands and run it through towel dried hair. It is magic. It has way too many other uses to list here. You will never regret this purchase ... something I have never said about another product.</li>
    <li> the product itself is fine, and good for skin, but does leave hair looking oily. Same effect if used on wet or dry hair. The argan oils from high quality hair product lines don&#x27;t do this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this argan oil under my eyes at night and on my entire face first thing in the morning for about a month or more.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that bags under my eyes disappeared and my skin is dewy-looking in the morning when I see my husband without make-up and then I put on my sunscreen and foundation over it before I go out.  I would say it&#x27;s a hit!</li>
    <li> has seemed to be the same as the expensive product</li>
    <li> I have seen such a difference in my hair, just shines and is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Got great suggestions for using as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Josie Maran argan oil for more than a year so I was already &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; on the benefits of argan oil, but I am so glad I switched to Argan Luxury. I am very health conscious and I just want organic, pure products on my face and body. Argan Luxury is just that organic and pure. It feels so good on the skin. And I have noticed that a single drop goes a very long way. In fact 1 drop of Argan Luxury goes a longer way than 1 drop of Josie Maran. A bottle of Argan Luxury is less expensive than a bottle of Josie Maran argan oil when you buy it, but also a bottle of Argan Luxury lasts longer...</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is a wonderful natural product that feels smooth and silky on your skin.  It never leaves oily residues but simply penetrates into your pores. I use it every night on my face, hands and neck and have been happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops and apply it to hair ends for moisturizing and shine.  Hair feels really nice and helps against frizz.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair grease, but be careful not to apply more than 4-5 drops for long hair.</li>
    <li> This argan oil was the perfect choice for a gift. The person I gifted it to absolutely loved it and now wants to buy more! Thank you very much for the great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long grey hair. This oil helps to keep it shiny, silky and manageable. I Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this Argan Oil. It is everything that I expected, and delivery was very quick.&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the feedback I receive from seller, and suggested uses. Be sure to use very little of this product, especially when applying to face or hair. It does not absorb quickly, but it definitely does what I expected - moisturizes  face, neckline, and hair beautifully.</li>
