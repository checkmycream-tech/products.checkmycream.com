### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Still very happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>They do have excellent customer service in my experience-</li>
      <li>but when I use this, I can skip shaving for 2-3 days which is great in the summer!</li>
      <li>I am fairly pleased so far......but be warned that you have to be patient for this process!!!  </li>
      <li>great product, wish I would have bought this before wasting my money on laser.</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>great results, in fact.</li>
      <li>What it is, IME, is a great way to get rid of hair and not have to put a lot of effort into it.  </li>
      <li>I also used it on the bikini area and had good results there.  </li>
      <li>This product for me is a good investment.</li>
      <li>I was going to do a treatment today, but my lamp went dead.&lt;br /&gt;Getting this through Amazon at this price was a good investment.  </li>
      <li>warm weather is coming</li>
      <li>THIS USES &amp;#34;light&#x27; rather than a laser on the marker, honestly did not know what the difference in results might be.</li>
      <li>More pain&#x3D;more effective.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working fastest and most effectively on my underarms, but bikini line is also working well.  </li>
      <li>It is very fine</li>
      <li>Maybe because the hair is very fine it was easier to damage the follicles in that area.  </li>
      <li>so it is more time intensive to use.  </li>
      <li>On top of needing to make an appointment and let the numbing cream set in for about an hour, the upkeep per treatment was rather pricey.</li>
      <li>I also paid more though.  </li>
      <li>More treatment areas - when I was at the salon I paid strictly for one targeted area.</li>
      <li>I will have more needs again.&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge</li>
      <li>but I will update if I find it to work better than the Silkn.  </li>
      <li>The lower settings a pre-set so you can get acclimated to the sensation of light and a warm feel.</li>
      <li>and I cannot committ to staying out of the sun! :)</li>
      <li>was unsure ordering this, but in hindsight, I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>More course hair does take more treatments, but finer hair was gone after 2-4 uses.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(please see the comments on this review for more info on flash life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
      <li>Meylis Narlyyev says that he is satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>and you just have to make sure you are on board for the committment this requires.</li>
      <li>Note, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe to use for the face so not recommending this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s still hair there, but it&#x27;s very light, fine peach fuzz, rather than longer, darker, noticeable</li>
      <li>aware, it works best on people with fair skin and dark hair like me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, but not too pleased with the warranty not being honored by the main company and the amazon seller not being helpful with that issue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;3) Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>I think the more hair follicles you have, the more discomfort you might notice on higher levels.</li>
      <li>I shave super close because if you have any growth at all the machine is going to have to use more energy than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Feb 9th.  </li>
      <li>but I am super happy so far.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge reduction in hair,</li>
      <li>the reviews for the Remington I Light on Amazon someone has posted a great review on how to make cartridges last longer.  </li>
      <li>but that area takes longer because the hair is light brown.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and not painful.  </li>
      <li>lost my power cord for the original Silkn model</li>
      <li>The original manufacturer would not honor the warranty because the amazon seller was not an approved vendor.</li>
      <li>Both of my first cartridges acted like they were out of pulses, sometimes more than once.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for purchase to those willing to commit to the process :)</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know if this is OK with this device so please don&#x27;t do this without checking first.  </li>
      <li>The good thing is that it&#x27;s easy and saves a lot of money in the long run.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and very dark hair, which helps.  </li>
      <li>Large Lamp head to cover more area.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was good enough that I wanted to purchase the newer one and keep at</li>
      <li>My skin is also kind of sensitive.  </li>
      <li>and it really didn&#x27;t hurt on most parts of my body.</li>
      <li>It was at that point that I returned the SensEpil to Amazon for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting the full amount of flashes.  </li>
      <li>Once the full spectrum or higher light source engaged (five levels), then the results were almost immediate.</li>
      <li>I will be happy if I end up with 60 to 80 percent less hair to deal with even if I have to do maintenance treatments.  </li>
      <li>is easy to use, has a nice long AC cord to the unit so it is easy to find an outlet near a convenient place to use the unit.</li>
      <li>It worked and was well worth it</li>
      <li>but I believe that it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I can get the same thing in the comfort of my home in the matter of minutes,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started to do my bikini line, which I think will also take some time but even thinning it out would be a success.</li>
      <li>At the salon I used numbing cream, but to be honest it only numbed my skin, I still felt it zapping the hair underneath</li>
      <li>That alone makes it worth the time to me.  </li>
      <li>, I was expecting it, and the cost/convenience of this device is worth the ongoing need for treatment in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The review from Ulka X was interesting- currently the most helpful critical review on the I Light.  </li>
      <li>and they sent a new one free of charge.</li>
      <li>My hairs are black and I am fair skinned, and the sensor does detect and remove them.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>through August- did one last treatment in June and haven&#x27;t done any more since then.  </li>
      <li>If you can afford laser treatments, then do that first.  </li>
      <li>It is not uncomfortable, and it takes about 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I continue to buy more bulbs in hopes that it will work \\&quot;the next time\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This worked after the first time used.</li>
      <li>It did feel like my first session in the salon.</li>
      <li>In that comparison the Tria had a much higher hair reduction over time.  </li>
      <li>What I loved about the previous model is that my legs felt so much smoother even though all the hair wasn&#x27;t gone.  </li>
      <li>I turned it off, waited the next day, tried a few more times and the pulses came back for a good amount of extended use!</li>
      <li>no tweezers and multiple hairs easily came out.</li>
      <li>Would certainly buy it again for business purposes.</li>
      <li>Hair on legs and bikini line is so much smoother, easier to deal with.  </li>
      <li>I ordered and received the SensEpil in a very timely fashion from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have had professional laser done and this device is well worth my money compared to what you would spend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian, and I have a light shade skin colour.  </li>
      <li>I really noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>but I really wasn&#x27;t paying that much attention.  </li>
      <li>Really does not hurt on any of the settings.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
      <li>For me it varies, sometimes it hurts on Level 5 and sometimes I don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
      <li>and my legs feel so much softer than they did before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it was very inexpensive-</li>
      <li>I have a lot of very dark coarse hair and very fair skin (some would call it fish-belly white).  </li>
      <li>From what I&#x27;ve read ipl can actually increase hair growth for some reason in the face area in some unusual cases but it has only happened in skin tone that is darker than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update April 15th, did some more on legs/bikini area today.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Results so far: I used this device for the first time a couple of days ago.</li>
      <li>More affordable and less time consuming treatments -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not done yet; it&#x27;s going to take a couple more treatments to finish, but as of now I have a lot less hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would recommend buying from the main company.</li>
      <li>The main company did offer me a new unit at a discount.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work, hair keeps coming back.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a few days. It seems to be working, the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s are the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) Large Lamp head to cover more area.&lt;br /&gt;2) Charges up quick.&lt;br /&gt;3) Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;4) Really does not hurt on any of the settings.&lt;br /&gt;5) Its quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) Large lamp head is hard to hold against skin on areas such as the ankle and sides of wrist.&lt;br /&gt;2) Seller forgot to send bonus cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Do not use on tattoos, the light heats up dark pigment, any dark pigment. For example, dark birth marks or dark tattoos will be targeted by the light and this is only time it burns.</li>
    <li> I bought this  almost a year ago and have been doing my son&#x27;s back (light skin, dark hair). I have been through 4 bulbs and still no difference in the amount of hair that keeps coming back. I continue to buy more bulbs in hopes that it will work \\&quot;the next time\\&quot;. If later the hair is thinner I will re-rate. How long will this take to actually work, if CUST SVC is reviewing???</li>
    <li> I plugged the product into the socket 220w then I heard a noise like something exploding inside the device and then do not work anymore.</li>
    <li> This review will probably be updated from time to time so the star rating could change. I am basing this current star rating on my past experience with salon treatments.  When it came to the salon treatments, they worked to an extent, but when I stopped going the hair eventually all grew back to the rate it was before I started the treatments.  I saw this device and it looked very similar to what they used at the salon.  At the salon I used numbing cream, but to be honest it only numbed my skin, I still felt it zapping the hair underneath and it did sting. This is not a painless process, but at least it&#x27;s brief. More pain&#x3D;more effective. The last time I bothered going they used the \\&quot;pain free\\&quot; machine and I didn&#x27;t feel anything, but I didn&#x27;t notice slower hair growth either.  So as someone with past experience with laser hair removal, what do I hope to get from this device?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hair reduction - I wouldn&#x27;t say the device permanently removes hair, but it does noticeably reduce the rate of growth.  When I was undergoing the treatments I shaved less and my skin looked better and was less irritated. I also recall having less ingrown hairs. I&#x27;d like to see the potential doing this from home over an even longer term period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) More affordable and less time consuming treatments - On top of needing to make an appointment and let the numbing cream set in for about an hour, the upkeep per treatment was rather pricey. It&#x27;s nice to know I can get the same thing in the comfort of my home in the matter of minutes, no numbing cream necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) More treatment areas - when I was at the salon I paid strictly for one targeted area. Now I can use it wherever I please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results so far: I used this device for the first time a couple of days ago. Since I had prior experience I went ahead and set the level to 3 for now and I will increase it in a couple of weeks. It did feel like my first session in the salon. I felt the hair zapping. If you feel it, then hair is there. For a comparison, at the salon they tested my inner forearm once where there is no hair and I didn&#x27;t feel anything, so if you feel it, it&#x27;s working! I also noticed a burnt hair stench. That also means it&#x27;s working!  My skin wasn&#x27;t as red as it would get at the salon, but I didn&#x27;t use it on its highest setting either. I am curious how that will turn out. All in due time.it, then hair is there.

    <li> It takes dedication, but it&#x27;s working for me.  I have very fair skin and very dark hair, which helps.  I wear the lightest shade of foundation, and people sometimes mistake my hair for being black (it&#x27;s really dark brown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on my lower legs, my mustache, and my sideburns (which are coarse, like hair on my head).  I did the treatment as directed, doing it every two weeks at first, then less as I went on.  After about 6 treatments, I only have to shave once every 7-10 days, instead of every day or every other day.  That alone makes it worth the time to me.  My mustache is all but gone too.  After about 4-6 treatments, I haven&#x27;t had to remove it at all.  There&#x27;s still hair there, but it&#x27;s very light, fine peach fuzz, rather than longer, darker, noticeable hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coarse hair takes a little longer.  I&#x27;ve done about 6 treatments on my sideburns so far.  There&#x27;s much less of them, but still some noticeable dark hairs that still have to be plucked and then treated when they grow in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this.  It is cheaper than professional laser treatments, and it&#x27;s easier for me because I can do it whenever I have the time at home, rather than scheduling an appointment.  I&#x27;ve started to do my bikini line, which I think will also take some time but even thinning it out would be a success.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received the SensEpil in a very timely fashion from Amazon. Everything was packed well in the device and the box still had it&#x27;s seal on it, etc. After plugging the device in and powering it on, I gave it a try on the skin of the back of my hand (after shaving it). The device worked for 10 flashes, then threw an error and would not recover. I attempted to unplug the device and try it again, just in case anything needed to cool down. On reboot, the machine threw the same error and would not start up. I attempted to look up the code on the internet to see if there was something I had done wrong (note, that the error was not that the bulb had blown, etc. I even tried using a brand new replacement bulb as a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;, to no avail). After finding no information on the internet or from the Silk&#x27;n site, I attempted to contact Silk&#x27;n about the problem. I had emailed multiple times and never received any response back from the company. It was at that point that I returned the SensEpil to Amazon for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently stuck in limbo trying to decide if I should bother buying some other device (Remington I-Light Pro, or Tria, etc) or if I&#x27;ll run into a similar issue.</li>
    <li> My review may be a little early but I am super happy so far. I have only used it 4 times, 2 times a week. I know it says not to but I have very thick, very dark hair and lots of it. The last 2 times I used level 4/5 and it really didn&#x27;t hurt on most parts of my body. I don&#x27;t see a huge reduction in hair, (it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks) but the hair is definitely growing much slower. I normally need to shave every day, I have only needed to shave every 3 days the past 2 weeks. Also i read that the hair falls out, it made me curious so I lightly tugged on a few hairs with my nails, no tweezers and multiple hairs easily came out. The price may seem a little steep but I believe that it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Silk&#x27;n SensEpil Hair Removal Device Bonus Set....there is no bonus!! I Have not tried the device yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian, and I have a light shade skin colour.  Sadly my leg hair is quite thick and dark. So I tried to use this one.&lt;br /&gt;Actually it worked! Of course I know it takes more than half year to remove hair completely. However, the hair got much thinner and grow back so slowly.&lt;br /&gt;But I recommend that you should use something cooling before and after shot especially if you use high levels. My skin got burn a bit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since mid/ late November 2013 and am definitely seeing results.... great results, in fact. BUT, there is a method to this madness and you just have to make sure you are on board for the committment this requires. It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; results.... but, you will get results! I am planning to use it regularly through early/ mid May before any suntanning/ sun exposure begins. I have had professional laser done and this device is well worth my money compared to what you would spend. The pain is negligible and if you do feel pain, it is brief. It&#x27;s more annoying type than real pain. For me it varies, sometimes it hurts on Level 5 and sometimes I don&#x27;t really notice it. I think the area you are treating also matters on the pain. I think the more hair follicles you have, the more discomfort you might notice on higher levels. I would recommend this product for purchase to those willing to commit to the process :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if I like it! May let you know when i know!  Until then.</li>
    <li> Meylis Narlyyev says that he is satisfied with the product. Would certainly buy it again for business purposes. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only done 3 treatments and so far have had no results. I was doing them on the lowest setting so that may be why. But I recently started on the 2nd setting. Hopefully I will get results. If I do I will update.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for nearly 5 months and it does not work for me. I does not remove any of the hairs. My hairs are black and I am fair skinned, and the sensor does detect and remove them. I have tried all the settings and none appear to have any effect. I have been using this device weekly as directed and am very disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical, but I read all of the reviews and thought I&#x27;d risk it.  I have a lot of very dark coarse hair and very fair skin (some would call it fish-belly white).  My skin is also kind of sensitive.  This think WORKS.  I&#x27;m so psyched.  I&#x27;m not done yet; it&#x27;s going to take a couple more treatments to finish, but as of now I have a lot less hair and what&#x27;s left tends to be finer than what was there before.  I wish I&#x27;d tried it years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a long time. It works great. I&#x27;m not getting any re-growth and just need an occasional touch up these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, it works best on people with fair skin and dark hair like me. More course hair does take more treatments, but finer hair was gone after 2-4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying from the main company. My unit stopped working after a few months. The original manufacturer would not honor the warranty because the amazon seller was not an approved vendor. The main company did offer me a new unit at a discount. I did have to take that deal (and pay again) because the amazon seller didn&#x27;t follow through on getting me a new unit to replace the broken unit. That was disappointing, but since it was working well for hair removal I did want to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, but not too pleased with the warranty not being honored by the main company and the amazon seller not being helpful with that issue.</li>
    <li> I have used this 3 times so far.  I wasn&#x27;t really sure it was working because I shave every day or two, but I decided to wait a few days after the 3rd treatment.  I was surprised that not as much came back, and what did was much slower growing.  I was going to do a treatment today, but my lamp went dead.&lt;br /&gt;Getting this through Amazon at this price was a good investment.  I like the convenience of at-home treatments and it is cheaper than one laser treatment at a salon.  It is not uncomfortable, and it takes about 30 minutes.  I would say that after the 3 treatments, I&#x27;m probably at 50% growth.  I have a darker complexion and very dark stubborn hair.  I am encouraged that I&#x27;ll continue to see reduction in further uses.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I&#x27;m having difficulty with is being patient.  I want to use this every other day to get results faster.  However, there is a growth cycle with hair that needs to be taken into account.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I only got one cartridge with the Bonus Set, which makes it a Not-Bonus Set.  That cartridge lasted 3 times, which is not 750 pulses.  I do legs and underarms only.&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure ordering this, but in hindsight, I&#x27;m glad I did.  Even if I only have to shave once a week, that is a bonus!</li>
    <li> THIS USES &amp;#34;light&#x27; rather than a laser on the marker, honestly did not know what the difference in results might be. My unit came with a cartridge. The lower settings a pre-set so you can get acclimated to the sensation of light and a warm feel. My earlier results were average. Once the full spectrum or higher light source engaged (five levels), then the results were almost immediate. I&#x27;ve used it on my lower face and mustache area, bikini area, legs &amp; big toe. So far, so good. I purchased an additional set of cartridges for long-term use. After several months I&#x27;ve needed to use it less, however with the summer approaching I will have more needs again.&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge Suggestion: if your&#x27;s seems to run out of pulses, turn it off and retry it another time. Both of my first cartridges acted like they were out of pulses, sometimes more than once. I turned it off, waited the next day, tried a few more times and the pulses came back for a good amount of extended use! So if yours run out, try it Again Later!</li>
    <li> This actually works but is a little annoying because you can only cover so much hair at a time with the small light surface so it is pretty time consuming. The good thing is that it&#x27;s easy and saves a lot of money in the long run. I usually have to shave every other day but when I use this, I can skip shaving for 2-3 days which is great in the summer!</li>
    <li> This product does what it advertises---it slows hair growth. Only expensive laser treatments will permanently get rid of hair and not all hair is treatable.  After having laser treatments for over a year, some of my hair still remains and this product does delay the hair growth.  It is easy to use and not painful.  I mainly use it on my facial hair.  If you can afford laser treatments, then do that first.  This product for me is a good investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this device from 3 months and yes there was reduction of hair BUT a lot of burns although I am using it on low energy level (maximum 3 out of 5). I&#x27;ve been using other hair removal systems before but I didn&#x27;t experience such burns on low energy level. I would avoid using it and throwing it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 times now but it still not working as what I thought. But its samilar with what I do in salon.</li>
    <li> This is going to end up being a very long review because I will update the process as I go. I&#x27;m giving Silk&#x27;n four stars at the moment based on my use of the previous model.  It worked and was well worth it but the cartridges that you needed to purchase were more expensive than the newer units.  I bought the previous one used on ebay and also resold it on ebay.  . This model came with four cartridges.  I also paid more though.  I believe 260, the price has since dropped to 199.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One review almost convinced me to buy a Tria instead, google hairremovalaboutcom tria to read it.  In that comparison the Tria had a much higher hair reduction over time.  The problem with the Tria is the head size is very small so it is more time intensive to use.  My results with the previous Silk&#x27;n gave me noticeable hair reduction after a couple of treatments. My results from the previous Silk&#x27;n were not permanent (although I only used it for five treatments).  I used the highest setting with that model for every treatment.  What I loved about the previous model is that my legs felt so much smoother even though all the hair wasn&#x27;t gone.  I also used it on the bikini area and had good results there.  I wish I could give a percentage of reduction but I really wasn&#x27;t paying that much attention.  Maybe forty percent?  It was good enough that I wanted to purchase the newer one and keep at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my lower legs is brown. On a fairness scale I consider my skin pale, probably a 2 on the Fitzpatrick scale.  I can tan but it takes a long time and I would end up with a lot of skin damage if I didn&#x27;t wear sunscreen year round.  I do let my legs get somewhat tan in the summer but they have now gone back to their winter paleness. On my thighs the hair is either blond or pale brown.  It is very fine but I always get razor burn on my back thighs no matter what I try.  I guess the skin is just really reactive and sensitive there.  I do remember getting some reduction in growth on my thighs with the previous model even though the hair is lighter.  Maybe because the hair is very fine it was easier to damage the follicles in that area.  As for results, I&#x27;m not expecting permanence.  I will be happy if I end up with 60 to 80 percent less hair to deal with even if I have to do maintenance treatments.  Especially in the bikini area which is expensive to get waxed professionally and difficult to diy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First treatment Jan 16th 2014, lower half of left leg. Highest setting. Hard to tell right now but it does feel a tiny bit smoother compared to the right leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second treatment today, Jan 23,  zapped the rest of lower legs, back of thighs, bikini area and this pesky hair I get above my outer upper lip.  It can be hard to keep track of where you have used it but if you press hard it does leave an indentation on your skin that you can use as a guide.  Highest setting, no pain.  I shave super close because if you have any growth at all the machine is going to have to use more energy than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Feb 9th.  The hair from my lower leg -first treatment is a bit less dense and feels softer but it&#x27;s a subtle difference.  Did another treatment on back of thighs and lower legs.  So far the only reduction I notice is from the first treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update,Feb 23, did lower legs and back of upper legs.  Noticing less hair overall but it is subtle, nothing dramatic. Legs feel smoother than they normally would so I assume some hairs are gone.  First cartridge died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, March 7th-went over legs and bikini area again today, now on my second cartridge.  The hair on my legs in now obviously reduced, as I can see patch areas that aren&#x27;t growing back.  It&#x27;s still not a huge change, but if it keeps going at this rate the hair growth should be considerably lighter after another two sessions. Bikini area has some bare patches too.&lt;br /&gt;Update, March 13- Noticed on my lower legs at least one fourth (in some areas) to one third (other areas) less hair growing now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did treat a few hairs under chin and face, I don&#x27;t know if this is OK with this device so please don&#x27;t do this without checking first.  From what I&#x27;ve read ipl can actually increase hair growth for some reason in the face area in some unusual cases but it has only happened in skin tone that is darker than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update April 15th, did some more on legs/bikini area today. My third cartridge hit the 90 percent finished symbol on the machine so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting the full amount of flashes.  I may call Silkn about this.  They do have excellent customer service in my experience- lost my power cord for the original Silkn model and they sent a new one free of charge. I&#x27;ll report back on what they say about the flash count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still very happy with my purchase.  Hair on legs and bikini line is so much smoother, easier to deal with.  Maybe 40 percent gone but it&#x27;s really hard to estimate.  Back of my thighs is less too but that area takes longer because the hair is light brown.  Bikini area seems to respond the fastest, probably bc of dark hair/pale skin in that area.  The hairs I zapped near the outside of lip area are gone. Note, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe to use for the face so not recommending this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the reviews for the Remington I Light on Amazon someone has posted a great review on how to make cartridges last longer.  The review from Ulka X was interesting- currently the most helpful critical review on the I Light.  I think her explanation of why the cartridges fail prematurely at times makes sense and her recommendations may be helpful for Silkn users too. I think I&#x27;ll try this with the Silkn to see if it helps. Upgrading my review to five stars because this is working so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- May 23- did another treatment on lower legs, bikini,back of thighs- overall hair reduction is about the same, hasn&#x27;t changed since my last treatment.  Some hairs on my face are growing back the same texture/thickness but they are white now. Tried doing the flashes at slower intervals as Ulka X recommends so as to not overheat the unit and wear out the cartridge.  (please see the comments on this review for more info on flash life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June through August- did one last treatment in June and haven&#x27;t done any more since then.  About 60 percent reduction in hair- maybe 70 percent in the bikini line area- so not a miracle, but it did make wearing shorts and swimwear a lot easier this summer.  I still shave but it&#x27;s a lot faster now and my legs feel so much softer than they did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, sorry this review is so long, just want to mention anything that might be helpful.  OK, so I&#x27;ve slacked off, no more treatments since June.  And the hair has started to grow back somewhat, slowly, IME.  That&#x27;s OK, I was expecting it, and the cost/convenience of this device is worth the ongoing need for treatment in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Feb 2015 OK, I get lazy about hair removal in the winter.  Basically the reduction I had has pretty much all come back, which is what I thought would happen. Possibly some hair is still gone, but it&#x27;s really hard for me to gauge that exactly.  It&#x27;s not permanent  hair removal IME, at least for me most has come back.  What it is, IME, is a great way to get rid of hair and not have to put a lot of effort into it.  The regrowth happens slowly if you stop using it (it seems like it lasted at least 3 months for me).  The time you spend using this is nothing compared to shaving or waxing. (Even though I did still shave it took much less time and I could get away with shaving less often.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Aug 2017- I do have some hair now that seems gone permanently- 20 to 50 percent depending on the area. I&#x27;ve moved on to another ipl device that you don&#x27;t need to buy cartridges for as it should be less expensive to use.  Not that the Silkn is expensive imo, I&#x27;m just super cheapand like to save where I can.  Too soon to compare the two yet but I will update if I find it to work better than the Silkn.  Got the other device as an open box return so it was very inexpensive- will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I really noticed a difference.  the only drawback is that you cannot use it while you tan, so I had to put it away for the winter, but I am about to start using it again.</li>
    <li> used several times, but see not results yet.  Will keep trying as I know sometimes it takes repeating every couple of weeks for months.</li>
    <li> Have used unit 3 times per instructions, but it is too early to say if it works for permanent hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Unit is easy to use, has a nice long AC cord to the unit so it is easy to find an outlet near a convenient place to use the unit.</li>
    <li> I can FINALLY write a review of this now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and a half. I have very fine, very dark hair on white skin.  I&#x27;ve only used it on my underarms and bikini line because shaving my legs takes about 10 seconds every day.  At this point is has totally eliminated the hair along my bikini line - maybe like 2 stray hairs still grow back SLOWLY over time. My underarms have a dramatic reduction in hair to the point that I no longer feel self conscious if I don&#x27;t shave them every single day during the summer. I never had much underarm hair, but it grew back fast enough and was dark enough that I always felt I had to shave it every day. Now, if I shave one day and get up the next morning and want to go to the beach or pool, it still looks like I&#x27;ve just shaved. Considering shaving my delicate underarm skin HURT every day, this was totally worth it. IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I am fairly pleased so far......but be warned that you have to be patient for this process!!!  Seems to be working fastest and most effectively on my underarms, but bikini line is also working well.  Have not tackled legs yet.....warm weather is coming and I cannot committ to staying out of the sun! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product after having laser hair removal with no permanent solution. This worked after the first time used. No hair growth for a week and then less growth after every session.  some sections haven&#x27;t grown back at all after 2 treatments.  great product, wish I would have bought this before wasting my money on laser.</li>
