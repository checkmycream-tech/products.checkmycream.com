      <li>some people dont know what kind of glue to use...</li>

      <li>not buying any more</li>
      <li>These nails are just ok.  </li>
      <li>I AM GOING THROUGH EACH NAIL, 1 BY 1, TO MAKE SURE</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I ordered these nails.</li>
      <li>Surely volvere to buy from you.</li>
      <li>Love these nails</li>
      <li>For this price, the quality should have been better...</li>
      <li>IT IS OKAY</li>
      <li>I use them for nail art with all sort of goodies I love these nails</li>
      <li>Got the item i wanted, they are durable and fun to play with!!</li>
      <li>but if you use the professional nail glue it works great and stick...</li>
      <li>Great item,  need more of certain sizes and lessof other uncommon sizes,  I found out I used more size 4 and 5 than any others..</li>
      <li>They are easy to measure when you are doing your nails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to use them because I think they would break really easy.</li>
      <li>The material of these nails is not an easy one to glue.</li>
      <li>These are more like full nail beds that tips, but thankfully I still have use for them.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not in the description that they are not curved to fit the hand nails..</li>
      <li>These tips are OK, but very very flimsy.</li>
      <li>They are more for covering the whole nail.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say about the nails was  there were lots of them.</li>
      <li>THE TIPS THEMSELVES ARE NICE LOOKING, EASY TO TRIM, HOWEVER THEY GET SPLIT MARKS WHEN USING A REGULAR NAIL CLIPPER TO TRIM THEM.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re just straight across, and you glue them on and stuff and put your gel/acrylic over them... not gonna complain I just like the tips with the smile line at the top</li>
      <li>These nail tips worked great and stayed on for 2 weeks but the fit is a little big may have to file a bit but comparable to most</li>
      <li>The nail tips are very flimsy and cheap feeling.</li>
      <li>BUT OTHER WISE</li>
      <li>it looks natural and are easy to use...</li>
      <li>I have others to use first instead of these.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>fast shipping...</li>
      <li>Work really well.</li>
      <li>They fill down with ease and you are able to fix any problems without having to removed and use another.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the quality seems decent from what I can tell.</li>
      <li>First time user and found it pretty simple.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>they are very thin they bend, I can&#x27;t read the size on any one of them most are already cracked, they are scrapped up and I am not going to use most of the sizes anyways.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, they were not number right, and some of them were the same number(in size).  </li>
      <li>I bought these to try some new designs.</li>
      <li>I did not even go so far as to try and glue them on anything I put them right back into the shipping package and away they will go.</li>
      <li>Very thin and bendable cheap plastic compared to the ones I bought from my manicurist which were more sturdy and glossy.</li>
      <li>I Completely Hatedd Them!</li>
      <li>so I have to make them fit, by trimming them down on the side.</li>
      <li>but these cant be used as far as just clear tips maybe for some practice MAYBE.........</li>
      <li>Also, the sizes are a bit off (The 2 largest nails aren&#x27;t around the same size..the largest is WAY too big, and the next smaller size is too small for my thumbs, so I have to file down the largest size to fit which is kind of a pain).</li>
      <li>most of the nails where cracked they are so weak and they just suck.</li>
      <li>Received this product in which many of the nail tips were broken.  </li>
      <li>I bought these because I was tired of always going to sally&#x27;s for more nail tips.</li>
      <li>I got this produce because I&#x27;m always doing other ppl nails they work very well</li>
      <li>Be careful, and inspect them carefully when you first get them.</li>

<li> were vety very thin, I don&#x27;t think using this product will give my clients elegant durable nails.</li>
<li> They are super thin, and not what I was used to.</li>
<li> BUT THR ROUGH EDGS ARE NOT FOR DOING LONG NAILS</li>
<li> even a bottle plastic is harder than the nail they all rip</li>
<li> THE TIPS ARE A BIT ROUGH AROUND THE EDGE</li>
<li> These clear tips are not good quality.</li>
<li> from the beggining i thought it was going to be bad quality since yhe box is cheap..</li>
<li> mine last for at least 2 weeks...very durable since i work in an office and am on the computer all day.  </li>
<li> YOU WILL HAVE TO CUT IT DOWN SHORTR.</li>
<li> i mean you cant go wrong with little plastic tips right ?</li>
<li> They just lifted at the tip of the nail a little on a couple of fingers.  </li>
<li> They are cheap for a reason, that is because they will not stay on your nails, do not buy this crap product.</li>
<li> I will use them , no choice, I don&#x27;t want to waste them.  </li>
<li> I tried quit a few type of glues, nothing keeps these nails in place.  </li>
<li> These nails are not strong at all.</li>
<li> WHEN IT ARRIVED THE CASE DID NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THE WINDOWS LIKE SHOWN IN THE PICTURE, AND THE SIZES WERE NOT IN ORDER WHICH WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING</li>
<li> Not satisfied with ths item.</li>
<li> The nails are not completely clear and they are very thick and round at the base instead of curved like the white tips.</li>
<li> but no its hard nail tips</li>
<li> not good at all just like a plastic beg</li>
<li> They are the worse nail tips I have ever seen.</li>
<li> Not happy with these ..they seem like toe tips</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so thin.  </li>
<li> They are worthless for anything other than practicing on them.</li>
<li> They are very thin.  </li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> this was really great as it did come the way it was in a box. it is great to work with and the price was great also</li>
    <li> I got this in a timely manner, but I&#x27;ve yet to use it. They look good though and will work well with my color acrylics. Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> WHEN IT ARRIVED THE CASE DID NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THE WINDOWS LIKE SHOWN IN THE PICTURE, AND THE SIZES WERE NOT IN ORDER WHICH WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING WHEN I WAS TRYING TO GET ORGANIZED. I AM GOING THROUGH EACH NAIL, 1 BY 1, TO MAKE SURE THE SIZES ARE GROUPED TOGETHER AND TO PUT THEM IN ORDER, THEN I WILL BE USING NAIL ART PENS OR SOMETHING TO MAKE MY OWN NUMBERS ON THE CASE. THE TIPS THEMSELVES ARE NICE LOOKING, EASY TO TRIM, HOWEVER THEY GET SPLIT MARKS WHEN USING A REGULAR NAIL CLIPPER TO TRIM THEM. I AM STILL WAITING ON THE NAIL EXTENSION CLIPPER TO COME, HOPEFULLY THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE WILL UPDATE WHEN I TRY THAT</li>
    <li> Love these nails I use them for nail art with all sort of goodies I love these nails they are a great buy</li>
    <li> I got this produce because I&#x27;m always doing other ppl nails they work very well so I would but this again.</li>
    <li> The nail tips are very flimsy and cheap feeling. I&#x27;m not going to use them because I think they would break really easy.</li>
    <li> These nails are just ok.  They are very thin.  I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so thin.  They just lifted at the tip of the nail a little on a couple of fingers.  I wouldn&#x27;;t order them again.  I will use them , no choice, I don&#x27;t want to waste them.  I have others to use first instead of these. They are useable and suite the purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was tired of always going to sally&#x27;s for more nail tips. These tips are OK, but very very flimsy. They are super thin, and not what I was used to. I&#x27;m going to finish using them, but I wish I had a different brand, that came in bulk. Also, the sizes are a bit off (The 2 largest nails aren&#x27;t around the same size..the largest is WAY too big, and the next smaller size is too small for my thumbs, so I have to file down the largest size to fit which is kind of a pain). For this price, the quality should have been better...</li>
    <li> I bought these a while ago. I finally had a chance to use it. These clear tips are not good quality. Very thin and bendable cheap plastic compared to the ones I bought from my manicurist which were more sturdy and glossy.</li>
    <li> very good product, I am very satisfied and happy with the quality and speed of delivery.</li>
    <li> My order just came in and wen I had opend it the box did not come with it they was in separate baggies  e_e  but it is a great deal ^_^ so will let yhat slide for now</li>
    <li> Great item,  need more of certain sizes and lessof other uncommon sizes,  I found out I used more size 4 and 5 than any others..</li>

    <li> I tried quit a few type of glues, nothing keeps these nails in place.  The material of these nails is not an easy one to glue.</li>
    <li> I did not like this item. The nails are not completely clear and they are very thick and round at the base instead of curved like the white tips. Not satisfied with ths item.</li>
    <li> Got the item i wanted, they are durable and fun to play with!! just don&#x27;t drop the case when its opened, or youll have to go through and reorganize them!! great product!</li>
    <li> Not happy with these ..they seem like toe tips it&#x27;s not in the description that they are not curved to fit the hand nails..not buying any more</li>
    <li> They are not tips. They are more for covering the whole nail. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good material, is a great deal the quantity for the price, I would have liked to choose measures appropriate to my needs. Surely volvere to buy from you. Excellent seller</li>
    <li> from the beggining i thought it was going to be bad quality since yhe box is cheap.. but no its hard nail tips</li>
    <li> most of the nails where cracked they are so weak and they just suck. point blank period!  I Completely Hatedd Them!</li>
    <li> not good at all just like a plastic beg even a bottle plastic is harder than the nail they all rip</li>
    <li> didnt like the product at all...... i use them because i am not going to throw them away but these cant be used as far as just clear tips maybe for some practice MAYBE.........</li>
    <li> These nails are not strong at all. You have to put a lot of acrylic on them in order for them not to chip. But the amount that you get for the price is good an get&#x27;n the box is a plus.</li>
    <li> no too good !!&lt;br /&gt;;/&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;/&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> These nail tips worked great and stayed on for 2 weeks but the fit is a little big may have to file a bit but comparable to most</li>

    <li> highly recommend this product.  great value.  mine last for at least 2 weeks...very durable since i work in an office and am on the computer all day.  fast shipping...great value.</li>
    <li> They are the worse nail tips I have ever seen. They are worthless for anything other than practicing on them.</li>
    <li> These are more like full nail beds that tips, but thankfully I still have use for them. There are a lot for the price, still happy with the purchase.</li>

    <li> Dont stick well for me</li>
    <li> these are great to use if you dont want to see the tips under ur acrylic or gels... it looks natural and are easy to use... some people dont know what kind of glue to use... but if you use the professional nail glue it works great and stick...</li>
    <li> They are cheap for a reason, that is because they will not stay on your nails, do not buy this crap product.</li>
    <li> good product. does its job and helped with what i needed. for those looking for something similar i would recommend this,</li>
    <li> THE TIPS ARE A BIT ROUGH AROUND THE EDGE AND ALL BUT OTHER WISE IT IS OKAY BUT THR ROUGH EDGS ARE NOT FOR DOING LONG NAILS YOU WILL HAVE TO CUT IT DOWN SHORTR.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re just straight across, and you glue them on and stuff and put your gel/acrylic over them... not gonna complain I just like the tips with the smile line at the top so i can use it as a guide when doing glitter tips and stuff.</li>
    <li> I should have gone with a more expensive tip.  As soon as you apply the glue and touch it to the nail bed, the glue...and the tip...turns white.  I guess I&#x27;ll practice artwork on them since I can&#x27;t actually use them on anybody.</li>
    <li> N ails did not stayed glued on.  The only good thing I can say about the nails was  there were lots of them.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try some new designs. Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the quality seems decent from what I can tell. Not only did they arrive on time, but they arrived just as they are seen in the picture.</li>
    <li> these things are junk. I took them out the box thinking I was getting one and it turned out to be three they are very thin they bend, I can&#x27;t read the size on any one of them most are already cracked, they are scrapped up and I am not going to use most of the sizes anyways. I would not advise these to anyone. I did not even go so far as to try and glue them on anything I put them right back into the shipping package and away they will go. I would not even use these for nail art.</li>
    <li> Received this product in which many of the nail tips were broken.  There were no wells in tios and tips were vety very thin, I don&#x27;t think using this product will give my clients elegant durable nails.</li>
    <li> they work great like they are supposed to ! haha i mean you cant go wrong with little plastic tips right ?</li>
