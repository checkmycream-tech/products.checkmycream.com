      <li>The quality of this item is excellent.</li>
      <li>Being inexpensive you would think it would not be well made but think again it&#x27;s made in Japan where they make some of the best tools.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be the perfect test because at this point if I would&#x27;ve used a multi-blade, it would&#x27;ve been torture with all the tugging, pulling and razor burn.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not expensive but works ok. Went back to my expensive G***** 5-blade disposable razor since it is so much more comfortable and simpler to use.</li>
    <li> Good razor at a good price feather is the best.</li>
    <li> High quality products from Japan , please do not buy any other products,  trust me dude</li>
    <li> You can spend a lot of money on a DE razor. Don&#x27;t. This plastic but rugged product is safe enough for even the novice DE razor explorer -- even with Feather blades, speeds shaving by not being overly aggressive, and is a true bargain.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Stop wasting your money on domestic, store bought razors in the U.S.  Buy this and blades from Amazon and get a great shave like your dad used to get and a price like your dad used to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for the lady legs too.  In fact this one was requested by my daughter.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price put you off.  This thing is great.  I like it better than some of my more expensive razors.</li>
    <li> I must say I was skeptical of this razor. It shaves flawlessly with a feather blade. If your a beginner at wet shaving this razor is fantastic to shave with. It has to be the mildest razor I have ever used. I really don&#x27;t think you could cut yourself if you tried to. I have many more expensive razors and bought this one for a travel razor. It is that and much more. Sure it won&#x27;t last forever like a gillette but it is so cheap you can replace it easy if it wears out or is lost. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> Just like the old days, close shave with only the inexpensive blades to dispose of. This Razor is a metal and plastic copy of the old twist to open Razors. Closer shave than disposables but takes a little more time as the blades are sharp and if you have never used this style razor it takes awhile to learn technique. Since I am an old geezer it was a breeze to transition.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this razor.  I had given up on shaving after decades of infections and painful skin irritation until I was tired of the beard and had to do something.  A little research (20 years too late) and I realized the problem was probably ingrown hairs from razors that were far too aggressive for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor feels well built and not flimsy.  Considering others in this category cost several times as much, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot.  Well, I can say my face has never been happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is NOT aggressive.  It barely feela like it is doing anything and sometimes i will shave twice, using different directions.  With the multiblade razors, I could go for two or more days without shaving and almost get away with it.  If you have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow with a multiblade disposable, I would guess this isn&#x27;t the razor for you.  I now need to shave every day but that is fine since I&#x27;m also free from the pain and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have irritation or skin problems from your current disposable I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to even try this model.  You will be shaving all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thought on the safety razors- I definitely am nicking myself more but getting better at it.  Take your time.  I can&#x27;t imagine what a more aggressive razor would be like.  And, read up on the subject if you&#x27;ve never used one of these.  Lots of good shaving information (and opinion) on the web.</li>
    <li> No, it&#x27;s not me. I was bleeding a lot so I purchased a vintage Gillette Flare Tip... for half the price of this item... and haven&#x27;t cut myself on it yet and it&#x27;s been about 2 months. The handle on the Feather is too long for me and it lacks a good balance. The Gillette is perfect... nice weight and a short handle helps me keep the correct angle for shaving. I use Derby Extra [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]] and Astra Superior [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]] blades in both so that wasn&#x27;t the problem. This is a nice razor overall so that would get it 5-stars but since I was making a blood sacrifice using it gets 3-stars based on how it worked for me... who knows, perhaps it was made on a Friday and doesn&#x27;t meet the standards of what others are using.</li>
    <li> Great shave for an excellent value. I owned one of these a few years back, which only broke after a couple years, so well worth the $18.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a complete newbie buying this razor, as I had used an ancient Gillette butterfly previously until the opening mechanism permanently locked up, but this required some getting used to. The head is massive compared to modern razors and the plastic is a little off putting at first. However, the overall weight is good and you start to appreciate the superior grip of the plastic handle as opposed to a metal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the cutting angle right and figure out the correct amount of pressure, it cuts very nicely. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m getting nicked on my neck no matter how careful I am. I guess that&#x27;s just a trade off to using the technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the quality considering there are other German made razors that proudly tout their teutonic superiority. Turns out I didn&#x27;t have to worry. The packaging says made in Japan, which while not German quality, is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Its a nice shaver for the price, I cant complain, I would start with higher quality if I could do it all over again though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and like many guys my age, I was sent a Gillette razor in the mail when I turned 18 (I think they had just introduced the Mach 3). So for the past 15 years I have spent ungodly amounts of money on the latest \\&quot;breakthrough\\&quot; in razor technology as well as the crazily priced blades. The whole time I have had issues with shaving that we all have experienced. Irritation, razor burns, and not close enough shaves. Recently a friend of mine Said he had switched to an old fashioned safety razor. I figured I would try it out so I found this Feather razor for under $20 and figured what the hell, I spend that on replacement blades. I have been using the Feather for about a week now and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results. It took a day or two to get used to and to refine my technique but now it is easily the best shave I have ever had. Extremely close and virtually no irritation at all. I also have yet to cut myself because you are basically forced to go slow and pay more attention. This is an awesome product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this Feather Popular razor after reading a few reviews and watching a couple of videos on youtube. I also bought an Edwin Jagger DE89bl at the same time of purchase because my first Edwin Jagger broke where the stud screws into the shaft. I must say I was used to using the Edwin Jagger which I have been shaving with for a few years now and really liked it. Here enters the Feather Popular. My first pass I thought it wasn&#x27;t cutting any whiskers but in fact it was, it&#x27;s just that coupled with the Feather blades it slices right through them. This razor is made of a plastic handle and a metal twist to open top piece. You would think with the price it would be of cheap quality but it&#x27;s made in Japan with the Japanese quality you would expect. This razor is not as aggressive as my Edwin Jagger DE89bl but gets the job done well. I would highly recommend this to the beginner single double edge blade wet shaver because it&#x27;s so forgiving. I would even recommend this the more experienced shaver just to change things up. This will be the razor of my choice to travel with which comes with a travel case. Saving up for the Stainless Steel Feather.</li>
    <li> Woh, I am not nearly as cool as I thought.  If you don&#x27;t smoke Marlboro Reds while you shave this is not for you, you will bleed to death.</li>
    <li> I used to use this razor for about 2 weeks now and i really like it. It&#x27;s my first safety razor though I have wet shaved with my parker shavette for some time now and must say I&#x27;m very impressed. I have thick hair with a medium beard and was able to do all  3 passes with out a single cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Van Der Hagen luxury set and feather blades. This razor is worth every penny and is good only as an every day kind of shaver. The only downside is the  weight of the razor, plus it seems to me that the intended use is for traveling since it comes with a nifty travel case. Great &amp;#34;substitution&amp;#34; for the AS-D1 for all who want to know if they like to use safety razors or shavettes</li>
    <li> A reasonably priced razor not made in china. Surprisingly well balanced despite the plastic part. The plastic material by the way is a very tough class of plastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using disposables and most recently a Gilette Mach 3 -- I just used this DE this morning....and even though I took it easy to avoid slicing myself I could hardly tell I was shaving.  I had to double check I had a blade in the razor.  GET A DE RAZOR !</li>
    <li> At first, I was cutting myself a good once a week, using the included blades.  When I started using the Personna blades, cuts were very rare.  I might of pressed too hard with the included, supposedly (from other reviews) very sharp blades.  Only razor I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Tons cheaper to buy blades for this than for other razors, and it shaves just as close as a Gilette Fusion ProGlide (at least, so says my fiancee after testing one on each half of my face).</li>
    <li> Down right the best razor I have ever owned. Very cost efficient, durable, and the shave is the closest I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
    <li> This is a great cheap razor. Coupled with Feather blades this is the best DE shave I have had for a long time.  I have purchased a number of DE razors from Amazon at much higher prices and they cut or scraped me up pretty badly. This razor is smooth.</li>
    <li> Decent shave but feels somewhat cheap.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a solid product all around. Lots of plastic parts, would prefer a metal handle, but for the price I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also comes with a nice case that doesn&#x27;t show in the pictures very well. Holds the razor and a standard pack of blades. Imagine it would be good for traveling with it.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. I was using the Gillette Fusion but after shaving with the Feather Popular I don&#x27;t plan to use the fusion again. The reasons I would recommend this razor are it is traditional, I can purchase a pack of 5 blades at my local grocery store for $1.25 and it is what my father and grandfather shaved with. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good close shave and does not want to pay a fortune for overpriced cartridge razor refills.</li>
    <li> Even though it is a light razor, it does deliver a great shave. I prefer the Astra preminum blades over the Feathers that came with razor.</li>
    <li> A replacement for the one I thought was lost. Does its job and is light and easily cleaned</li>
    <li> item was as described and was shipped promptly</li>
    <li> This razor is incredible! I am never going to shave with a mach3, schick, fusion, or anything else again. This razor and the feather razors that are recommended to be used with it give me a close and virtually irritation free shave. I also recommend this to anybody who apprecaites nostalgic shaving gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor&#x27;s construction is plastic and steel. I find it to be very durable and easy to use, and for it&#x27;s price you are bound to get your money&#x27;s worth five times over if not more. For me a pack of 10 razor blades (with about 10-12 shaves per blade) sets me back about 8 dollars--give or take. Using one of the regular three blade from the super market will set you back about 23 dollars for about four cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone looking for a new razor and a great shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I first bought a very cheap one, but that was a very bloody experience. So I went for this one, after reading some reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a good price - quality.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves well.</li>
    <li> shaved off piece of meat</li>
    <li> The Feather \\&quot;Popular\\&quot; twist-to-open (TTO) razor is a good entry-level product for those interested in trying out traditional shaving.  There are other currently manufactured TTO razors on the market, but the quality is generally hit or miss.  Despite the light weight and partial plastic construction, in many ways this is better than razors from Parker that cost the same or more.    The best feature of this razor in my opinion is the more sloped profile of the cutting head.  The vintage safety razors from Gillette had a head like this, before they moved to a more \\&quot;slim\\&quot; profile in the early 1960&#x27;s, ostensibly making it easier to shave the tight areas under the nose.  But in keeping this \\&quot;fatter\\&quot; head, the Feather Popular is a very good choice for those with sensitive skin, since it requires a less-steep blade angle.  The drawback to this, combined with the razor&#x27;s overall light weight, is that the shave is very mild.  But if paired with a very sharp blade like Feathers (probably the sharpest blades currently available by some stretch), it&#x27;s possible to get a close, smooth shave with no irritation.  And it&#x27;s also worth noting that blade alignment in the cutting head is even on both sides.  You&#x27;d think this goes without saying, but you&#x27;d be surprised at how many modern TTO&#x27;s don&#x27;t get this right.  The blade is also locked securely in place.    However, given the Feather company&#x27;s high standards, I have to wonder why 85% of the razor is plastic, including the entire lower portion of the cutting head.  This affects the razor&#x27;s glide a bit and shaving cream/soap scum is more noticeable on the black plastic over time.  But that&#x27;s more of a cosmetic concern and it doesn&#x27;t mean the razor is \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; by any means.  This is something that will probably last on the order of 50 years with proper care.  And with 6 to 7 shaves per blade, with less irritation than modern cartridge systems, it&#x27;s a smart choice for men who are curious about wetshaving.      I still think the Lord L6 razor (also available on Amazon) is the best choice for a cheap starter razor, but you could certainly do worse than the Feather Popular.</li>
    <li> I think I found my new favourite razor.</li>
    <li> Switched to a safety razor and loving it. Replacements are so much cheaper and much sharper than the disposable ones. Single blade keeps the shave smooth. Materials are high quality and have a nice weight.</li>
    <li> Great razor and a very good shave. This is the low end of the feather razor&#x27;s but it is a very good one. Not aggressive at all and not to mild. It is just right for the average beard. Heavy beards may find this not as aggressive enough for them but for me it is just right.Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance, he likes it.</li>
    <li> works as its supposed to, bought due to the price of all the other razors being expensive. Econimcal blades.</li>
    <li> This was my first Double-Edge razor purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is light, but sturdy. The twist to open mechanism holds the blade in place in a very sturdy way. You will never question if it&#x27;s going to loosen up in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades that come with this razor are possibly the sharpest razor blades available on the market. If you&#x27;re learning how to use a double edge razor; you should order other blades. If you don&#x27;t your face is going to be absolutely destroyed. Nicks, scrapes, blood and irritation everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to shaving with these kinds of razors, or you&#x27;re looking for a cheap travel razor. The little dude is great.</li>
    <li> Excellent DE razor for those new to wet shaving. Got tired of dragging 5 blades across my face and also got tired of spending $20 on 4 cartridges. Watch some videos on how to use these razors and you&#x27;ll have an irritation free shave. The trick with this and all DE razors is to let the razor do the work, no pressure!!</li>
    <li> I just got my razor yesterday and purposely waited until today to shave.  I think i had more hair on my face when I was 13 than i do right now.  But this sucker is sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the most toilet tissue I have ever had on my face at one time.  I must have cutmy self 10 times or more.  But the places I did not cut myself, my face is as smooth as a new born babies behind.  Did I tell you this is a smooth shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used one of these razors before, soihave nothing to compare it to as far as double edge razors go but it is much more comfortable using this razor than the multiple bladed razors you buy at the super market.  There is no pulling of hair, it cuts it nicely.  I am sure with practice, this will be the razor i have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fast tip, make sure your water is hot... That will soften every thing up for you.  I used Barbersol and it did well, but I will get soap and a brush and try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I got this razor.  Like i said, I cannot compare to a better quality razor, but this one seemed sturdy and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, did I mention it gives a smooth shave?</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and articles about how double edge razors have improved and are so much cheaper to use than Gillette&#x27;s Fusion and similar - I decided to give it a try.  I have a thick beard and have been able to grow a beard from age 14 on.  I am always looking for a better way to get a shave - and if it saves money - that&#x27;s a bonus.  When it comes to shaving, the blades are the most important part, then the razor and then the shaving cream.  This was the best double edger razor I tried. Unfortunately for me, even with the best blades I could find - a double edge razor just doesn&#x27;t cut my beard.  I&#x27;m still supporting Gillette.  BTW, you can significantly increase the life a any blade by rinsing and drying them when you are finished.</li>
    <li> After years of wasting money on virtually all the modern, high-tech razors, I decided to do some research into double edged safety razors.  The reviews on Amazon were very helpful.  I made my decision to buy this \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; based on several of the reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I forgot what a pleasure using a DE razor is, and after several weeks, I&#x27;ve only had only a couple of minor knicks.  You need to pay attention to what you are doing.  The trick is not to use any pressure or force.  I liked the Feather razor blades so much I ended up ordering 100 of them.  I am getting the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years with this combination.</li>
    <li> This is for my money the best DE razor on the market!  For 21.95 or for 100 dollars- this razor is just spectacular especially with the feather razor blades.  Shaves as comfortably as a multi blade- no cuts or nicks- but it shaves off all the hair in two or maybe three passes.  Great head angle- allows you to use a little more pressure than you might actually need without too much danger of nicks or cuts.  I personally put it above the Lord L6 because it is made better and has the butterfly head.  This razor is just a pleasure to shave with!  And I am sticking too it!</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor and first time ever trying one. I also used a nice shaving cream brush before shaving.. Took a few trys  to get the right angle but once I did it shaved very nicely I did short small strokes and it left my face very smooth with no cuts just make sure you shave with the grain. I felt it took the same amount of time to shave as a 5 blade razor and I don&#x27;t feel any razor burn... I&#x27;m looking forward to using thus razor alot more. It&#x27;s very hard to cut yourself with this razor</li>
    <li> This is not built like jewelry (Edwin Jagger), nor does it have a fine industrial tool look to it (Merkur).  Once you get past the plastic/resin look and shave with it, you will be pleasantly surprised. A word of caution: don&#x27;t initially use the included Feather blade with it.  Use your normal blade. This will provide the best way to evaluate just the razor. I got a great shave with it. It turns out that the long handle has a nice balance to it. It would make a fine travel or gym razor, a good introductory DE safety razor, and even a decent gift. The performance is quite good.  April 15, 2015 Update I have other razors (Edwin Jagger and Merkur) and I am pleasantly surprised to say that I get my best shave from this razor.  I don&#x27;t find the plastic to be a drawback in any way.  The razor is easy to use, holds the blade in a consistent alignment, and feels great on my hand. I am going to buy 2 more: one for me and one for my nephew.  July 1, 2016 Still the best shave out of all my razors, including the great Gillette razors from the 1950s and 1960s.  It is easy to handle and almost impossible to get a bad shave.  I can shave with this razor with a Feather or Astra blade and literally never nick myself.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this razor. He is an ole fashion kinda guy....doesn&#x27;t care for all the latest and greatest razors. He is enjoying this very much, so glad you guys had it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect razor to use for transitioning from the multibladed, overpriced offerings into the single bladed shave world.  The lightness &amp; length of the handle helps prevent nicking for the first-time user as well as provides a familiar feel when shaving. The feather blades are extremely sharp and gives as close of a shave as the multiblade cartridges.  I am getting to the point of moving to an all-metal razor as I have found that I am pressing too hard on certain areas of my face, which increases the chance of nicks.  The heavier handle weight should provide the closeness without using undue pressure.  This razor will then go into my travel kit.  All-in-all, I am very pleased with this razor, and my wallet is thankful as well!</li>
    <li> I decided to give the straight razor thing a shot after hearing the internet sing its praises.  I bought it for shaving my legs and armpits, not face, so keep that in  mind while reading this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes in a nice plastic case that also holds a pack of blades.  The top opens in a really neat and convenient way to allow easy placement of the blades.  I can&#x27;t imagine how someone could mess up inserting a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought shave lotion, as opposed to cream, to use with this so it would glide smoother since it&#x27;s easier to hurt yourself with a straight razor vs a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; one.  I  also exfoliated and did every preparatory step possible to get this to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went slowly and carefully while shaving my underarms and it worked great.  However, my legs were a different story.  Even though I went slow and steady, I cut myself about 5 times on my legs when I first used this.  I figured I was just ignorant to the finer points of straight razors so decided to try again in a few days.  Lo and behold, I flayed my legs again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor may be great for beards, I have no idea though.  I do know it works well for underarms but would suggest maybe not using it for your legs.  There&#x27;s just too many curves and bumps and lumps around the ankles and knees to use one of these effectively without cutting yourself up.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd de razor. Was actually hoping for something in between my edwin jagger and Van der hagen.  This one compares almost identical the the Van der hagen as far as aggressiveness.  It is a very mild mannered, non aggressive razor.  Almost impossible to cut yourself even with a feather blade.  This razor provides a great shave with a 2nd pass.  The extra long plastic handle gives a good feel in my hand.  Easy to grip and maneuver.  Plastic makes it a lightweight, which I like.  I know with the heavy razors you are supposed to let the weight apply the pressure.  I prefer to apply the pressure myself, just my personal liking.  This razor washes clean easy without plugging.  Positions the blade nice and even.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and it&#x27;s a good, moderately priced one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve officially been converted to DE shaving! :-)</li>
    <li> Simple double-edge razor that works well and within my budget.</li>
    <li> After a fair bit of research on double edged (DE) safety razors I decided on the Feather Popular razor.  As I&#x27;m sure you have by now, I did a lot of reading up on the practice of DE shaving.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was exactly getting into, so I didn&#x27;t want to lay out a huge amount of money.  The price, combined with the positive reviews (here and elsewhere), were the primary factors that drove me to purchase this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the razor itself, in construction and materials, doesn&#x27;t entirely justify the cost at about $22.00 to me.  Some of that is certainly due to it&#x27; packaging, which includes a plastic case (suitable for travel).  While this is by far on the low end of the spectrum on DE razor pricing, I feel a more fair price for this product might be around $15.  That said, I would buy this razor again at $22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the image on the product page, what you see as the black parts of the razor are plastic.  It&#x27;s light in weight (seemed lighter than the 3-blade cartridge system I had been using) but the plastic doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  What you see as the sliver parts of the razor are stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action of the TTO (twist to open) mechanism feels a little loose when open, but I found that once a blade was loaded, and the mechanism was closed, it held the blade very securely, and dead-on straight with the razor&#x27;s protective guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the razor in place, I found the fully assembled device was very nice to shave with.  I used [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shaving Soap, Ultra Sensitive Skin]] applied with a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]], with the included Feather blade (2).  I have just one shave completed with this razor, but the experience was very much like shaving with my previous 3-blade cartridge system, although far superior in removing the 5 days&#x27; growth of my thick whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lower price would certainly have gotten 5 stars out of me for this review.  This is a very nice product, I would buy it again, and would certainly recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic \\&quot;my-first-DE-razor\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Straight and secure blade retention&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a case and blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;(and this a pretty minor one) Could potentially be a little less expensive</li>
    <li> Works well to shave my legs.... just don&#x27;t use any pressure. Love the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> Got here safe and sound. Thanks</li>
    <li> I liked it so much, I bought a second one.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> OMG!! I love this razor even though it is a plastic handle it works flawlessly. Never realized how close of a shave you could get with a safety razor I am sticking with this from now on. It does only come with two blades so you will want to purchase more at the time you buy it or at some later date.</li>
    <li> I had been debating switching over from disposable razors to safety razors for a long time.  Did research on many items, and decided to take the plunge.  Prior to purchasing this item, I had never - repeat - never shaved with a safety razor.  I went online and watched a few videos as to not slice my face apart, and after setting everything up, I was shaving away!  The blades are quite sharp, and the handle is sturdy.  Like others, I too was worried that this item was plastic, but this is a solid handle in my opinion.  I now use this for shaving, and don&#x27;t plan to go back to a cartridge razor if I can help it.  I recommend this to anyone debating moving over to a safety razor.</li>
    <li> The safety razor while an old (and well tested design) works as well as any other blade system and is loads less expensive over time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different safety razors and this is one of the very best. The only razor I like better is also made by Feather and cost $175. For the money this is the best razor I know about. It gives a close mild shave without producing irritation. It is made of a lightweight stainless steel head and some sort of very lightweight plastic/polymer handle. It is not low quality and I think it would hold up to years of daily use. Since I broke down and bought the high-priced Feather DS-A2, this has become my travel razor. If you want great shaving on a shoe string, you can&#x27;t beat this razor. Paired up with Van Der Hagen Natural Boar Shave Brush, Arko Shave Soap and Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades 50 Ct  you could shave for at least a year for about $50. The quality of the shave is far superior to multi-blade disposable razors or any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I switched from Mach 3 to this DE razor.  It is incredible.  The blades are razor sharp and you simply wet your face up real good after a shower with hot water.  Take a badger hair shaving brush, wet it, and rub it around in something like [Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol - $5 bucks here].  Spread it all over your beard generously and shave using the weight of the razor to cut.  Wet it frequently under hot water.  Use the brush to relather if you need to and keep everything wet.  You will be a pro at WETSHAVING in no time and will never switched back to those lousy old carts.  You can buy 100 blades for 10 backs and shave for years.  BECOME A MAN.</li>
    <li> Feels plasticy/cheap, and very picky about angles.  Not recommended for first razor.</li>
    <li> This a a beautiful razor at a reasonable price. Well constructed with a moderate blade exposure that is not too aggressive but does a good job. If you have ever struggled with changing the blade in a three-piece DE razor then you will love the clam-shell design of this razor. It is light in the hand but has good balance. The handle is long enough to feel comfortable in the hand. Some purists complain about the use of plastic in this razor but there is nothing inherently wrong with the use of quality plastics. Is this a &#x27;classic&#x27; razor to be passed down the generations? Probably not, but it appears to be a good razor that will provide long service.</li>
    <li> I really like twist to open razors so that is always a plus.  I get pretty good shaves with this razor, the long handle is a big plus for me.  It gives a fairly mild shave so I would pair it with an aggressive blade, like the feather blades it comes with. Over all I would say it is a good value, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only double edge razor that I really enjoy. It is light and handles well. The plastic handle is easy to handle when wet. The last one I used before was slippery when wet. I also received nicks and cuts. This has not happened with the Feather.</li>
    <li> Very nice grip, and a very high quality razor for the price. I have just defected to the double edge razor after using multi-blades for the last thirty years, and this Feather double edge has helped me make up my mind: I am not going back to multis...ever!! The shave really is feather light.</li>
    <li> Very mild, perhaps too mild for many users. I got a very nice shave with 2 razor blade shims and a common sharp (nonfeather) blade. Teamed with a feather blade ($$) and no shims its close but still a full step too mild for me. However, I favor razor/blade combinations that are moderately aggressive. YMMV, your mileage may vary. It seems to be very nicely made, precise and is quite reasonably priced. its very light which I do like. I can use it with 2 shims and a sharp, inexpensive Personna lab blue, Crystal or Astra SP blades or give it to my father in law who likes mild razors and could use a TTO style (less blade handling).light (hes used to disposables) razor.</li>
    <li> I will never buy this again. I miss the solid construction of my Parker double edge razor I used in Iraq.</li>
    <li> Since I had nothing to go on but other&#x27;s experience on how to use one, and getting tired of paying out the nose for cartages, I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on spending a lot of money for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like or use.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very easy to use and very forgiving, especially with my rough beard.&lt;br /&gt;Figured I would try this and move up, well I have decided that this one will be a mainstay.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, easy to use.</li>
    <li> These work fine, but not the best. I prefer heavier ones with longer handle. Butterfly opening however is very convenient.</li>
    <li> works well and an inexpensive tool for those wanting to try  wet shaving  comes with  none other than the  famous Feather blades  Yes its made of plastic but then so is my Glock  If on value alone it would have been a 5 but then what would you rate their top of the Line stainless AS-D2 :)</li>
    <li> This is a well made no frills TTO DE Safety razor.I have some more expensive  razors but none do a better job than this Feather Popular. It comes in plastic case that makes it great for travel , I recomend if you want to try out wet shaving, a great way to get a close shave at a tremendous saving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and first time user of a safety razor. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on one in case I hated using it, so I went with this affordable Feather. It comes in a plastic case with two Feather brand blades. Putting the blade in it is super easy, you just twist the handle and it flops open, you place the blade in, then twist the handle again to close it. It is made of very cheap metal and plastic. I see this rusting and falling apart quickly. But again this was perfect for a first timer that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it shaved my legs like a charm, I had to be slower and more careful but I didn&#x27;t cut myself once and I got a really close shave. I was told to not start off with the Feather brand blades though as they are very very sharp, it is recommended that you work your way up to Feather brand blades (but that was just one man&#x27;s opinion).</li>
    <li> I started thinking about a safety razor a few months ago because of the high price of replacement cartridges. It is surprisingly hard to find a safety razor at a store, so I searched on Amazon, I almost settled on a cheaper razor than this one, After reading the reviews on them, however, I chose this one instead. One of the things the reviews said of the cheaper one was that the blade was loose, and wasn&#x27;t even when put into the razor. I am very happy I chose this one! I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, since I had never used one. I used it for the first time this morning, expecting a few cuts while learning. No cuts, but I do have minor razor burn. I think this can be avoided next time by getting a good shaving soap. The razor itself is very well made, easy to clean, inexpensive, and replacement blades are very affordable. I give it five stars because of value and how well it is made. Can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say about it at all.</li>
    <li> Hi,  I copied this from a review written under the Japanese version of this razor that is sold on Amazon (the writing on the top of the packaging is in Japanese)  I thought what he had to say about the &amp;#34;little block&amp;#34; was very observant and important to note.  By Richard Curtiss on December 15, 2014 Verified Purchase This is by far the best safety razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my opinion it&#x27;s the best safety razor on the market why do I say that if you look closely at both edges on the razor out you&#x27;ll find a little block there so the edges won&#x27;t nick you that&#x27;s the only razor on the market that I know of that has this I&#x27;m 75 years old and believe me I know little bit about these razors and Mrs. gives you nice shave I bought four of these just so I had some to give to friends are such a good gift and a reasonable price I would buy these again anytime.</li>
    <li> I must have two dozen double edge razors, this Feather razor is the equal of the best I have.  I was skeptical of the plastic construction, but it is a nice weight, easy to control, holds a blade securely and centered in the head.  After trying a couple Parker razors that had too much play in the strip that holds the blade I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and quite pleased.  The handle is long enough for my big hands and fingers to hold without feeling cramped.  I highly recommend this as both a starter and long term razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that is very comfortable to use, compared to the other safety razors available on the market.  A definite recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth more than the price of admission. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to my Mach 3 with it&#x27;s overpriced cartridges and gimmicks and after some research online I found that this old school style of razor may be a better way to go.  Now, I highly recommend watching some YouTube tutorials on how to learn to shave with these as there is more to it than a modern razor; the safety is off so to speak. That you can look into on your own time.  I had a lot of apprehension on this razor versus my thick beard hair plus ironically sensitive skin but once I shaved a couple times I felt like a pro.  It was a great compliment to my shaving brush, mug and creams I already upgraded to. It gives me a much better shave at a fraction of the price.  It also is really awesome how it looks and the mechanism to open and close it is really rad.  Its easy to clean and I am 100% happy with it after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to save on razors and you can actually rinse the hair from the blade with ease. For close face shaving stick with the stainless steel blades. They are smooth as silk.  Since I also shave my head I prefer the cheaper (less nicking of the scalp) regular steel blades... win, win for me.</li>
    <li> Good quality product.  I am not getting a close shave.  I don&#x27;t believe it is the razor&#x27;s fault, as I am having a hard time getting adjusted to this style of shaving.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to love this product since I ONLY use feather razors. It could be that it does not work well with my skin. The razor itself was made of bent and not molded metal. It seemed solid, but not like a more quality razor. I am much more happy with my less expensive LORD razor, but again, will ONLY use Feather blades. Nothing compares to them.</li>
    <li> Very very mild shaver compared to razors such as the Merkur. Shaves really well though, darn near impossible to hurt yourself with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;For those worried it does have good weight.</li>
    <li> Good product and came delivered as expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Decent shave, especially given the price point, but expected more given the Feather name.</li>
    <li> The feather razors a non-aggressive DE fazor that gives a good shave.  It is an a good beginer razor that won&#x27;t nick you even if you try.&lt;br /&gt;They also will accept any brand blades however I feel that Feather blades are the best blades in the world.</li>
    <li> I like it. good weight long handle easy to clean. there are probably better but it does the job</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower and this razor is absolutely perfect for that. Don&#x27;t worry about the polymer either. You can&#x27;t get anything better for a wet environment. The butterfly mechanism works smoothly and cleans easily. The handle is as long as my Parker long handle razor, but the razor is obviously much lighter. I have a heavy beard and the wife can&#x27;t stand any stubble. The included Feather blade has blown me away! I have gotten two shaves a day for seven days. There is no pulling or tugging with this blade, just once with the grain, once against the grain and once sideways on those stubborn neck hairs and my face is baby butt smooth. I tried the blade in the Parker, but got a closer shave with the Feather razor. If you are new to DE shaving, I would recommend a different blade until your face and beard get used to the difference from the disposables. All it takes with DE blades is good lather and a light touch. I won&#x27;t shave with anything but a Feather from now on. I haven&#x27;t had a shave like this since I was a teenager using my old Gillette. I very highly recommend both the razor and the blades.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t get a closer or better shave than with a single edge blade  all this stuff about 2,3-4,5 blades  is nothing but getting you to spend more for less&lt;br /&gt;I have used these before  and loved them  the ultimate shave with these is the best</li>
    <li> My hubby was always complaining about cheap razors, disposables and the like, so for Christmas I got him this razor as well as the shaving soap and brush.  His shaves are now as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the critics steer you away from this razor.  The packaging and graphics look like cheap junk from a discount store, but Feather blades are awesome.  The company dominates the medical/surgical market, so they know how to make sharp and dependable blades.  They just don&#x27;t comprehend our association of that labeling art style with inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a plastic handle, but so what?  It&#x27;s a tool for shaving, not a prized heirloom to show off and brag about.  It is lightweight, but to me that&#x27;s a plus, giving better control around the chin and adam&#x27;s apple.&lt;br /&gt;Alignment is good, blade fits perfectly on the metal center rib.  Blade exposure is perfect for shaving. The critics who claim it isn&#x27;t enough for a close shave want a straight razor, not a safety razor., The mechanism is smooth and secure.  The top opens by twisting the metal ring at the top of the handle, so it won&#x27;t loosen up by accident while shaving, but still opens easily to rinse or change blades. Cheaper than disposables, shaves better, and doesn&#x27;t clog up like multi-blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll quit shaving before I go back to twin blades or disposables.</li>
    <li> Got this for my grandson who has just started shaving. He is happy with the razor and I would recommend it for the beginning shaver. Very easy to use and don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Bought this not wanting to spend 100 dollars on a manual shaver before I knew I liked it. This was just the right price for me to take a chance on it. Trust me it is way more comfortable than any of the shavers gillette comes out with these days. Been using it for a few months now. Absolutely no problem at all. Blade stays tight and easy cleaning and the storage in the case it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather blades it comes with are also really good. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for strong beard I recommend to all nostalgic boys......  Will pay the price I strongly recommended a razor pit and you are done!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this double razor for my son. He loves the weight and length of the razor. I will buy this razor for my youngest son soon.</li>
    <li> I TRYED DRUGSTORES.COM, CVS.COM, RITEAID.COM AND THEN I GOGGLEDIT &amp; AMAZON.COM CAME RIGHT UP, BUT THE PRICES WERE WAY TO HIGH, BUTI KEPT ON LOOKING AND FOUND THIS ONE THAT I COULD AFFORD SO HAPPY. AND MY FRIEND BETME 20.00 I WOULD NOT FIND ONE I COULD AFFORD. SO I CALLED HIM TO COME OVER FOR COFFEE &amp; PULLED OUT THE RAZOR WITH EXTRA BLADES, YES IT COMES WITH EXTRA BLADES. HE WAS LOOKING SOME WHAT STUNNED LOL. HE GOT HIS RAZOR &amp; I GOT BACK WHAT I PAIDED FOR IT WITH 20.00 EXTRA DOLLORS.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for what it is.  It is a beginner razor.  I&#x27;ve had it a week and it is starting to rust on one of the butterfly doors...</li>
    <li> It works just fine. The feather company makes surgical equipment and their blades are very good, probably the best. I also use their replaceable straight razor blades and can&#x27;t imagine a blade any sharper. Far superior to anything I&#x27;d used before.</li>
    <li> Well, I decided to return to shaving basics. Learned to shave with one of these many, many moons ago. With the continual escalation of razor blade prices I thought why not give it a try once again. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had read several reviews for a product called Shave Secret shaving oil and decided to try it since I was making a basic shaving move. This shaving oil works fantastic and lives up to the high ratings by other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many double-edge razors, including Merkur and Parker, and this one beats the others hands down. An absolute joy to use--loaded  with a samurai-sword sharp Feather blade (reportedly the sharpest on the market), this razor will give you a fantastically close shave. Since buying it, I actually look forward to shaving each morning . . . And I like it so much I bought a second for travel. Gillette&#x27;s European lather shaving cream (available on Amazon) is a winning partner . .</li>
    <li> Not near what it is advertised made cheap</li>
    <li> Very good for the money</li>
    <li> Great razor I love it. This was a trial long handled razor for me. I found the long handle to be just what I was missing in my shaving. It gave me a far greater control than any of the other razors in my collection. The quality was suprising considering the price and we who use the DE razors know that you cannot beat the Feather blade.</li>
    <li> Great value for an entry level or travel DE safety razor. Seems to be on the mild side but get BBS shaves every time</li>
    <li> I suppose I should have realized that a plastic razor, no matter the reputation and reviews, would never be as precise as a metal one.  I think it&#x27;s a simple inertia thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is great for what it does.  My own fault for expecting progress level performance from a lighter unit.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice starter razor, the blades that come with it are not so great but then again it&#x27;s been 20+ years since I last used one</li>
    <li> Feather blades are amazing and I bought this razor combo for a trip. The razor works Okay but not as good as a slightly more expensive one. Great buy for a short trip when you need something you don&#x27;t care about breaking or losing.</li>
    <li> Feather makes some of the best Razor Blades I&#x27;ve ever used, so I had high hopes for this razor.  And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but it works just as well as I had hoped.  The butterfly &#x27;doors&#x27; operate smoothly and hold the blade securely at an angle that is not overly aggressive.  On the con side, the plastic handle makes the razor feel a bit light and cheap, as well as giving it an awkward balance compared to my Merkur Futur.  And they only included two blades!  But really, for the price, I don&#x27;t think you will find a better razor, and any fan of DE shaving who is on a budget would be well served by this piece.  UPDATE: Unfortunately my Feather DE razor suffered a catastrophic failure when I dropped it in the bathroom.  The plastic bit holding the head to the handle broke.  I will likely purchase another at some point, it really is a good value.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use and clean, the opening device works well. It will be a long time before I have to buy another.</li>
    <li> I just received this today (I didn&#x27;t shave this morning because I knew it was coming today) and tried it out with one if the Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades I ordered with it. I didn&#x27;t use the Feather blades that came with yet so I will update when I do. My dad used this type of razor when I was a kid and by the time I was really shaving I used electric or disposables. The Feather worked as well as anything I&#x27;ve used in the past, better than the triple blade razors I normally use. What more can I say, works just as well and will save me a load of cash ; ).</li>
    <li> I wanted to introduce my adult son to the benefits of a double edge razor without shelling out big bucks for the Seki Feather, so I bought one of these. I would be disappointed if it were as nice as my Seki; it is not. But it is very, very close in many respects. It is not such a pleasure to use, though the longer handle and lighter weight may please some users. The clamshell design makes blade changing easier than the 3-piece Seki, though the blade does not seem to be locked into position as precisely. But the results are comparable. With the same Feather blade, it is mild, but not quite as mild as the Seki. If, on a scale of 1-10 I rate the Seki a 9 for closeness and a 10 for comfort, I make this product two nines. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have had.  There is no comparison to the ones I have been usisng.  I would highly recommend this to all men who want a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I was using a Gilette safety razor when I came across this long handled fancy razor and decided to try it. I like it&#x27;s lighter weight and the longer handle makes it feel better balanced AND the screw down stays tightened more so than the Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;  This is a quality well constructed razor. Part of it is plastic but it is very strong. It works!&lt;br /&gt;  I have a heavy beard and would have to shave again if I was going out for the night. If not, I can even skip a day if I wanted to.  One blade lasts me a month or longer.&lt;br /&gt;  Lastly, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I am still using this razor its been a year or so. This is still the best buy if you looking for a DE razor this is ain&#x27;t bad, you got some feather blades. Very good for beginners who just got into wet shaving. Still two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I used a Parker for about 3 years until it finally broke. It was heavy and I was frequently nicking myself no matter how careful I was. I used Feather blades, not realizing that Feather actually made a razor as well. Unlike the more expensive Parker, the blade fits perfectly into the razor so it&#x27;s even on both sides. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months and have nicked myself only once and this is because I was in a hurry. I liked it so much that I decided to buy one for my daughter. I was a little apprehensive because she is only seventeen and fairly new to shaving. After she had used it a few times, I asked her if she had had any trouble with cutting herself. She said no and that, not only was she shaving nick free, but that it was &amp;#34;a thousand times better&amp;#34; than the cartridge type she had been using before.  So men, don&#x27;t just buy one for yourself, get one for the women in your life as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the all-metal version, which concerned me at first when finding a safety razor to buy. However, now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple months, I can see that the concern was misplaced. This instrument is very high quality (even considering it&#x27;s mostly plastic). They&#x27;ve weighted the shaving end (just like more expensive razors) so no direct pressure is needed when shaving. Just let the weight of this razor fall against your skin and you&#x27;ll get a close shave. The three reasons I switched from my Mach 3 to this? First, the Mach 3 cartridges were insanely expensive (as I&#x27;m sure you know). Second, I have really sensitive skin and the single blade really lessens the irritation (a single-blade shaver was recommended by my dermatologist for this reason...more blades equates to more potential irritation). Third, it&#x27;s manly and bad ass.</li>
    <li> Although it is plastic, it works smoothly, centers the razor perfectly, and is easy to use. I wish I could give it a 4.5 because my only qualm, which is very small, is that this razor is not aggressive enough to take full advantage of Feather Razor blade sharpness. Thus it would be a five star for a new user.</li>
    <li> I luv this razor because it&#x27;s stylish &amp; it cost a $1 too replace da blade..shaving is real smooth on my skin. Bye Bye 2 all da other razors that wants u 2 pay $15 or more 2 replace da blades</li>
    <li> This is a nice DE razor. I own a Merkur HD 180 and this Feather handle. The feather is surprisingly less aggressive than the 180. This is a good thing for me, since I&#x27;m just learning. If you&#x27;re on the fence about 3 piece, 2 piece, or this  1 piece design, it really doesn&#x27;t matter. I like the Merkur because I can take it completely apart to dry. The feather is also good because it only requires a twist to change blades. No matter what, you&#x27;re going to have to handle the blade with you&#x27;re fingers to change them, so one is not actually safer than the other. I alternate shaving between the 180 and the feather. I keep coming back to the feather because it shaves less aggressively, and shaves cleanly without as much irritation. I&#x27;ve never used any other blade in this feather razor besides feather&#x27;s own blades. I will say about the feather blades that you have to shave with good form, because these blades cut very well! Feather&#x27;s own brand for razor and blade really are a perfect match. Other blades that I have tried are Astra SP and Sharks Super Chrome. And those shave well too, and are not as likely to cause cuts you didn&#x27;t realize as the feather blades. However, I use those with the Merkur. What I did was buy both astras and feathers packs of blades, because I like both of those very much.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I got into DE shaving. I&#x27;m coming from Gillette fusion pro glide! I was searching for some shaving cream other than the canned stuff, and somehow in my search, got turned to the world of classic shaving. I can say that the DE is a superior shave to the cartridges. The blades are extremely sharp, so care has to be taken when switching to a DE. Overall, I&#x27;ve gotten much closer shaves and I actually shave more often now! Just take your time and use very very little pressure or none at all, and you will see how incredible real razors are!</li>
    <li> saves money on razors.  no need to fill the landfill with disposable plastic razors.  the refill is like a dollar for like ten or twenty at walmart.  the feather razors are of superior quality though.  i think its the japanese steel.</li>
    <li> At first I thought I forgot to put a blade in it, so smooth; maybe not as close a shave as some, but well worth it</li>
    <li> This razor is my second. After first purchasing an [[ASIN:B002QTX8WU Edwin Jagger Double Edge (DE) Safety Razor - Lined Chrome Handle]], because of the good review for that -- and the nice chrome finish -- I found it to be too aggressive and was not satisfied using Astra and Feather blades. I found it to be irritating, so I wanted to try something else. This Feather razor is fantastic! I can use just about any blade and get a close and comfortable shave, without irritation. It makes shaving a lot easier. I think many of those people who claim that you have to have a great technique to not cut yourself with the sharp Feather blades are simply using the wrong razors. [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades]], [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]], and other blades work wonderfully for me with this razor.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a better experience with this. I have been a \\&quot;straight razor\\&quot; shaver for many years, so I know a thing or two about these double sided blades and all. For some reason though I just can&#x27;t stop cutting the crap out of my neck, and it just doesn&#x27;t shave all that smoothly even on my cheeks. Maybe it&#x27;s my form, I dunno, but I&#x27;ll keep giving it a chance and possibly update a while down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I rarely shave my face these days- working on a bitchin&#x27; beard, but I still do my upper cheeks and neck. When the neck hair is still relatively short, I find a pre-shower dry shave with this unit to be just right. It still isn&#x27;t amazingly close, and that is probably just what I get for buying a cheap-o handle, but it is good enough for most situations. One word of caution though- don&#x27;t be lazy, use a fresh blade.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I know it is customary that to vote not helpful for those reviews that are rated lower by those buyers who actually like the item and rated for ti higher. Therefore, I do not expect to my reviewed to be voted as helpful. This has almost become a norm at Amazon\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review...&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this item simply because of high ratings on the brand. Feather brand supposed to be the best of razors out there...I also decided to give a try the old fashion razor to replace my modern 5 blade Schick just for nostalgic and coolness purposes. I was not sure of the expectations. Based on reviews however, I really tough that these razors, especially this brand, both the blade and the razor would be superior to my 5 blade Schick. I was not really concerned about the cost but functionality and style. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing concerned me was that the fact that many reviewers warned that first shave would be bloody hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came in 2 days with my Prime membership. Item was well packed, and Made in Japan, very good quality razor. Package had 5 blades also.&lt;br /&gt;Based on reviews, with my concerns, I tried it with care to avoid cutting myself...However, the razor was as smooth as it can get. Not a single drop of blood. So, unlike many reviewers, this razor is very safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, quality of shaving was very disappointing.  Despite several runs over the face, the razor left my face desired to be shaved again with the 5 blade razor. Believenit or not, right after the shave,  I had 5 pm shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the smooth shave, the razor failed to give me the close shave I use to get from my 5 blade modern Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps since I have a smooth facial hair, this did not work for me..So, despite its failing, instead of 1 start I am giving 3 start to this item, hoping that as reviewed by other, this thing actually works for some..It did not work for me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i see that, when it comes to shaving, there is no reason to be nostalgic. It is your face you are dealing with, there is a reason to have 5 blades in new razors, upper blades pull down the hair for the lower blades to cut below the surface level hair giving you a very clean and deep shaving. At least, that is what I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry guys..My verdict is; Don&#x27;t Buy !It is your face you are dealing with, there is a reason to have 5 blades in new razors, upper blades pull down the hair for the lower blades to cut below the surface level hair giving you a very clean and deep shaving.

    <li> Before anyone decides to purchase this, please consider one thing. You get what you paid for. I like this razor. It&#x27;s a butterfly opening which makes it safer to load the blade and also easier. The handle might be a plastic, but the top is heavy enough to apply right amount of pressure to your face, which makes it easier to shave. It&#x27;s got grids for better gripping, which i had trouble with razors without any grids for gripping. However the expose of the blade is very small and i have to do more touch ups for that BSS (Baby Smooth Shave). I even used the feather blade and still had stubbles at the end. I can still feel it around my chin, which i had no problem with my Edwin Jagger DE89. Does that mean it&#x27;s a bad razor? NOT AT ALL~!! it&#x27;s actually an excellent razor for starters who are looking for a milder shave that doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn on their face. From that point on, they can purchase other DE razors that are more aggressive. I only gave it 4 stars, because of it only comes with 2 feather razor blades. It would&#x27;ve been better if they came with at least 5 blades. I know the description says 2 blades, but still the company should include at least 3 more blades to make a better value for the consumers. It&#x27;d definitely increase the marginal benefits.</li>
    <li> (UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this razor for just over two months now and it is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s just like the old Gillette G1000 with the Super Speed head, a slight tad more aggressive but not that you&#x27;ll notice; your angle will be about the same and finding the best angle for your face is easy. It&#x27;s an easy shave and a damned close shave. Best for men with light to medium/medium-heavy beards. Heavy beards might like it? Great first time razor and great daily shave for old experienced wet shavers. Buy this razor and you won&#x27;t regret it.)&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this razor for $20.00 that came in a plastic case and a pack of Feather blades (like all razors used to come) and I was completely shocked at how good a razor this is.  It shaves exactly like my 1970 Gillette G1000 (was called the Gillette Knack between 1967 - 70)which was famous for a great close razor-burn free shave with one difference: This is a better made razor.  Perfect balance, perfect lenght, and the TTO at the top of the razor is bigger and easier to open than the old Gillette.  I love this razor!&lt;br /&gt;As to the complaints from some about it being a \\&quot;plastic razor\\&quot;...So? My Glock .45 has a forged steel slide that blows back to eject a spent shell by using the energy from firing a 230 grain .45 round on a polymer frame and after over 1000 rounds fired the \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; frame is still just fine.  Don&#x27;t knock this razor for the use of a polymer base and handle, If taken care of it will last as long as a plated brass razor.  The head is stainless steel as is the TTO dial and being made by a company that for over three decades has made some of the best surgical instruments for eye and nerve surgery in the world, I&#x27;m glad they decided to branch into the shaving business as a side line.&lt;br /&gt;This is not an aggressive razor but is just a little more aggressive than the old Gillette Super Speed. Again, it shaves like the G1000 or like the Schick Krona from the 1960&#x27;s. You&#x27;ll only notice the difference in the quality of shave you get.  If you have a light or medium beard you&#x27;ll love this razor as it is almost completely nick and cut free; if you (like me) have a heavy beard: 3 - or - 4 way shave time without razor burn.  Like the old Gillette or Schick Krona the secret is don&#x27;t press the blade into your face, let the razor do the work, first with the grain of your beard then however you do your second approach.  Bought my son one of these and he has a medium beard and all he does is a one time pass with little touch ups on the left over stubble as he goes.&lt;br /&gt;A well made razor at a good price made by a surgical supply company?  You can&#x27;t go wrong.he quality of shave you get.

    <li> Good heft, durable plastic handle, excellent enrry level razor for beginners like me.Do not use the included Feather blades because they are too sharp for beginners, cut too close, leave nicks.I use Derby extra DE blades in the razor. Not as sharp but sharp enough for me.No nicks.After 2 passes I use my old Gillette Pro Fusion for difficult areas--under the lip and chin for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to use and the shave is great. I have used the razor several times, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself once.</li>
    <li> Simply awesome. This razor works great. I highly recommend it for your first safety&lt;br /&gt;razor. I love mine. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Good razor, but, not as good as other name- brand originals.</li>
    <li> Meets my expectations, check youtube videos on best ways to shave,&lt;br /&gt;The prices for the 3-5 blade inserts and there short usefull life prompted me to change</li>
    <li> I got really tired of spending $25 on 5 shaver cartridges these days, and I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric, makes my skin break-out.  I decided to try an old school shaver first - $3.00 one on Amazon and the concept worked fine so I upgraded.  Wow... love the close shave.</li>
    <li> Works like my grandfather&#x27;s razor did!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because I wanted to try shaving with a double edge type of blade. I have expensive electric razors, as well as the new 5 blade replacable head types as well. This is a great razor to get if you are like me and wanted one to try, it comes in a nice plastic case, is easy to open and clean, and does give a nice close shave. I suppose it is cheaper to buy the packs of double edge blades that this uses as opposed to the cartridge types, but that was not my reason for getting it. The only negative thing about it is the construction is not really durable. It is by no means junk, but it is mostly made of plastic. Still, it works fine and I have no regrets of any kind about buying and using it.</li>
    <li> First of I would like to start with how I was not smart for 14 years shaving with regular Gillette razors. Mach 3, 4 fusion and quattro. I spend a lot of money changing each blade every 3 shavings Max.doing it every day so 4 blades lasted around 2 weeks total 20 $  times 2 and times 12 and times 14 which is 6720 $$$ life time till now.  I still have 42 years more  to shave and my hair are getting harder every year to cut. So one fusion blade  lasted recently for 2 shavings so cost would increase definetly. I don t want to spend 20.160 $$$ for shaving Gillette blades so I switched to DE made by feather with blades made by feather too. What is my impression?  First time was rough because a lot of blood was spilled all over the sink. I had to use zinc ointment to make sure that I won&#x27; t get any infection.  Second day was better but still some cuts were present because I forgot that I m not using any more Gillette.I was putting to much pressure not smart but.....  Third day I was finally happy because I did nice job and even my girlfriend told me that my face fill smooth.  Now what else I can say,  more money in my pocket and my love is smiling.In future I will want to try feather razor made with 100% steel but is expensive cost is around 200$ but I would really like to try it and make nice review.   Also, feather blades are super sharp because I used one for 5 times and is still sharp as shark teeth.  I started also using Proraso shaving cream for 10$ and is amazing. Smells great and is tighting your poor so even if you will cut your self put leather again on top and you will see how cut and blood disappear.  I m really happy about my choice because Feather DErazor is precise there is no movement of the blade where it seats perfectly without loose . Handel is very friendly and steel top and mechanism is made very well.  I will get the same one for my father because he likes to count every peny like me.hehehehehehe</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It provides the closest, most comfortable shave I have had in years.  It is far better than any modern cartridge razor that I have ever used, and is much easier to clean.  All at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This is my first razor I used to start wet shaving before I learned a lot of the art of it all. I warn anyone that doesn&#x27;t understand wet shaving; feather blades are the sharpest out of the bunch. I recommend trying a sampler pack of blades to see how they shave. This is enough to test if feather is too much for you or not though. Not a bad product but it feels as if a plastic part is tugging on my face as I shave. I tried changing the blades to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I would recommend a different razor personally, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> has nice weight opens easily and easy to clean and replace blades.  i used shave foam and shave gel and got the best results with the gel. do purchase extra blades along with the razor to compensate for th long ship time for extra feather blades</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing wrong with the construction of this razor, but for my technique it&#x27;s a little too light. Seems to be better for me when using Wilkinson Sword blades. Guess it will be OK when traveling, and attempting to keep weight down.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor works great.  Nice clean shave but one has to careful not to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Good &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; razor with a close shave.  Much cheaper that the disposable razors and just as good or better shave.  Had razor burn for the first two weeks, but my skin got used to the new razor and now I would not chnage.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and save money</li>
    <li> Good solid razor that does the job I bought it for.  You could spend more but I&#x27;m not sure why you would bother. This razor is my  balance between the super cheap razors and the fine German craftsmanship razors. I won&#x27;t be upset if I drop it or leave it behind in a hotel room.</li>
    <li> Ordered one from a different establishment but it never showed up. So when I ordered this one I was so very happy when it arrived early. A great gift, it was just what I ordered I would order more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I got tired of buying the most expensive shaving razors and throwing them out after 2 or 3 uses&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my beard changed as I got older or what anyway decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m delighted&lt;br /&gt;I get a real close shave and can get over 4 shaves with the same razor&lt;br /&gt;Happy and saving mucho $$$$$$</li>
    <li> Good buy for the money, I use this when I go camping instead of taking my gelette. Cuts just as good.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor heck of a lot better shave than these new razors. Cheaper and a he** of a lot better thanks Rene</li>
    <li> Love this razor! This is a very good starting razor for anyone new to DE shaving. Easy blade access,and easy to clean. Also gives a bbs shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price, seems to be constructed well.  Handle is plastic, but all the important parts are steel, blade changing is easy with butterfly open, and holds razor in place very well.</li>
    <li> I bought a Merkur 180 and was not very happy with it. I bought this razor and it gave me the closest shave with few cuts and no irritation. It does feel cheap in the hand, but works very well.</li>
    <li> My first  safety razor  I have ever owned..  I wanted to get away from all these new cant be beat , best shave in the world  razors and go back to old days. Kind of neat using a razor that was invented  in 1903 and used for so many years.  This razor works great.  Closes tight and  the blade is perfectly straight. Only  nicked myself once the first time . Need to let the weight of the razor do the work and don&#x27;t press down. Of coarse it is heavier and bulkier than my old Bic so it  took a little getting use to.  Would highly recommend this razor to anyone.  You wont be  disappointed.  You will never go back  to the modern wonder razors again</li>
    <li> For the price it works quite well....specially for a first time user. Came with two blades and the travel case.&lt;br /&gt;Very light as the handle is plastic but sturdy,</li>
    <li> Some months ago I was informed about the unparalleled quality of the [[ASIN:B005G2CJ6K Feather Blades]]. So it was only natural to seek out the appropriate Double Edge safety razor to yield them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside Japan there are only two models of FEATHER safety razors, this Popular one and the much more expensive [[ASIN:B004E5GV82 All-Stainless Steel one]]. I decided to start with this one and move up in the near future if I was satisfied. And was I ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is streamlined simplicity. On top of a sturdy plastic-covered handle sits a stainless steel head that opens with a twist to receive the double edge blade. The mechanism is precise and works with clockwork perfection both dry and wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touching edge guarding the blade&#x27;s cutting edge is also plastic - a design detail that I was apprehensive of at first. However, once I tried it I appreciated how much more aware I was of the blade&#x27;s cutting edge and how easier it is to control it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quality product at a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> A safe razor, but because of the thick head it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as&lt;br /&gt;I like. Even after several passes still not as close as I have experienced with other razors.</li>
    <li> A good budget razor. It&#x27;s simple, but has a good comfortable weight. Nothing special, no frills, but also provide no complications or problems. There might be other razors a few dollars more, and a few dollars less, but more or less i don&#x27;t see how they could provide anything that much better, or something this razor doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; or tidy up razor added to my collection.  Not as aggressive as my EJ and that&#x27;s perfect because I use it for touch up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as an attempt to go back to double edge razor shaving.  Better for the environment and the wallet.  Blades are less than 50 cents each if you buy Feather (the sharpest and best blades) from Amazon.  This razor is perfect if you are thinking about doing the same.  Takes some practice, but, plenty of You Tube videos out there to assist.  Great razor that I will now use as my travel razor.  I enjoy the double edge shaving so much I splurged and bought an Edwin-Jagger for $36 on Amazon for my everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong for the money on this one.  I recommend Feather blades for use in this razor.  Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s made for. It holds a razor blade firmly, and it shaves your face as well as you maneuver it. It&#x27;s a razor blade-holder - why would you pay more?</li>
    <li> I love being free from the cost of multi-blade razoers and I love the closeness of the shave. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with nicks, either. Pair this razor with a nice shaving oil and you will have the best shave of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade is easy to use. It is lightweight and long enough for big hands. Changing blades is a breeze with the butterfly twist open design. It takes a little angling to get just under the tip of the nose but otherwise I have not had any problems with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The plastic head on this has worn out in less than a year. Now replacing the blades is a pain because the entire head detaches. Spend a little more and get a razor with metal screw-on head. Unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I learned to shave with a safety razor but as disposables became cheaper I switched to those. My preferred disposable are the Mach 3&#x27;s I have used them for about 4 years but no more. This Feather razor is awesome, I get a closer shave with 1 single blade than with the 3 blades on the other razor. Very easy to clean and it comes with a 5 pack of blades. I have to shave daily and have a fairly thick goatee and my facial hair grows pretty quickly and fast. I wish that I would have found this years ago. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, Mach 3 4 5, Fusion, Hydro 3 4 5, you get the drift? The cartridges are so expensive and they barely last a month for me. I shave about 3 times a week and those indicators always would be gone by now. So I decided to read up about going old school with a straight razor and found that safety razors were almost about the same without the constant upkeep. The replacement blades are cheap and I was told that feather makes the sharpest blades. They are so sharp that yes I did cut myself the first time I used it but after the 2nd and 3rd time I went from 1 to zero nicks/cuts. If you like having that baby smooth face, this is definitely the way to go. The replacement blades cost only 6 dollars for 10 on Amazon, you can&#x27;t buy one fusion replacement blade at that cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a beginner like me 20 dollars is perfect. I know they make more fancy and nice adjustable&#x27;s, but this is fine as it is. I&#x27;ve gotten so use to it may my time to upgrade soon! This would be perfect for anyone who would like to try out a Double-Edge razor or anyone starting out. It comes with 2 blades as well, it is very easy to set up, unscrew, pop the blade in and screw it back in.</li>
    <li> This product allows me to shave at a reasonable price. Got tired of overpriced blades and their tactic to increase revenue.</li>
    <li> Like this Feather for travel.  Nice long handle and not as heavy as my daily razor.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the plastic handle.  Works well and blade positioning appears to be as solid and accurate as my other TTO razor.</li>
    <li> A superb value for entry into the classic shave method of the double edge safety razor.  Solid Japanese construction, good balance and feel, and the butterfly blade holder mechanism works very well.  The blade is secure and well aligned, making for a smooth and satisfying shave.  Give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This was my first shot at DE shaving and I loved it. The razor shaves great and the feather blades included ran through my 4 day growth like a knife through butter. No nicks or cuts. My only complaint is that razor is fairly light because it has a plastic handle. Also the razor head has some cosmetic blemishes but nothing major. These complaints don&#x27;t get in the way of the shave and you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather should make this razor but with a better handle and finish and I would be happy to pay double if they did that. The only other feather razor I know of is the 200 dollar all stainless steel model. Feather needs to make a mid range razor since they apparently know how to make good razors that shave great.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, price and quality. Mercury Futur, which I bought prior to this one, does not even come close to Feather. Do not be fooled by how slick it looks, don&#x27;t waste your money. Feather is much much better razor.</li>
    <li> Began wearing a beard 6 months ago and was having trouble with the big name razors I tried. They just didn&#x27;t provide crisp edges to my beard which helps with a good grooming appearance. I also found I was nicking myself repeatedly, bearing down with the razor cutting through the course hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Barber suggested shaving me with a Feather. He did and I knew I had to have one myself, although I was nervous at first that I might really end up looking like I&#x27;d been in a cat fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story is, In the months since I started shaving with my Feather - 0 nicks. ZERO. and my barber comments every visit on how balanced I am now keeping the shape of my beard. Cant say enough about how good it feels to be really clean shaven, and my blades last me a month and more each (I only shave every 2-3 days now). Outstanding value!</li>
    <li> I will never go back to anything else! After seeing commercials from a bald headed television personality, I decided to look into getting a double edge safety razor and happened upon this one. I decided to purchase it with some decent shaving cream and some nice Japanese razors. I&#x27;ve been using a quality electric razor for the past couple years because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with shaving, but after trying this I wish I hadn&#x27;t made that decision. This is the smoothest closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with any product, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can come up with is that the razors that come with this shaver aren&#x27;t the best quality and it&#x27;s worth your time and money to look elsewhere for the actual razors. I shaved with a couple of the razors that came with this unit and although they were good, after I switched to Astra Superior I stopped getting nicks and the shave was a lot more smooth. I&#x27;ve told most people I know about this and a few have switched and say the same as me, they&#x27;ll never go back to anything else for shaving.</li>
    <li> Purchased to use as a travel razor.  Have only used it a few of times but so far I am very pleased with the results.  The razor appears well made and shaves as well as my Merkur.  The overall weight is light, but does not cause any issues when shaving.  The TTO design makes blade loading and cleaning quick and easy.  The blade centers as well as much more expense razors and for the price you cannot beat this razor.  The plastic handle is not an issue considering all of the other applications of plastics found in our everyday lives.  An excellent first DE razor, travel razor or everyday razor.</li>
    <li> Tired of using those crummy disposable plastic razors? I bought this razor as a travel razor( it comes in a plastic case) and backup razor to my Edwin Jagger razor. It shaves almost as good as my EJ DE89L. You can feel the weight difference due to the part plastic construction but it really does a good job of shaving.  Being from Japan, you know it is manufactured correctly and will last a long time. The butterfly mechanism works very smoothly. Get this one if you are looking for a DE razor and not sure if you are ready to pay $35-$75 for one. Just add a box of razor blades and you are ready to go.</li>
    <li> Good Price,Great razor how can you go wrong.No one tells me how many words I must use,seeing I&#x27;m doing this on MY time!</li>
    <li> This razor product will save me plenty of money over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot say enough about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I did the research. This feather safety razor is the best shave you can get for the money. Its performance is comparable to the best razors of its kind. The blade fits snug into the butterfly head giving me a great shave every time. I even started shaving with upward strokes using this thing cuz it works so well. Despite being part plastic it is still a quality piece and will last a long time if you take care of it. If you want to save money and still get a painless shave this razor is the way to go. I highly recommend you stay away from anything cheaper than this one. My last safety razor cost $8 and it was way too painful and bloody. Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using double edge blades to shave is ridiculously cheap. I wish i knew about this a long time ago that way I could get back all the money I threw away buying Gillette cartridges. The old timers are really on to something here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone considering a safety razor. With the feather blades it gives one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had and at a great price too.</li>
    <li> This is the best new 70s double edge shaving razor. This will save you so much money and it looks classy. I will never change it.</li>
    <li> Gift for my son. Less expensive than the current offerings.&lt;br /&gt;Brings back thoughts of the old days. Blades are available.</li>
    <li> Several months ago after experiencing a bad rash on my neck, which was made worse by shaving, I elected to try a different razor type.  I went with the double edge Lord L6.  I liked the shave but not the razor.  It was rather cumbersome to remove/replace the blade.  I ended up going on the auction site and I obtained a few old Gillette&#x27;s.  My first one was from the 40&#x27;s.  I loved it.  Ended up buying  a Fat boy, Black Beauty and Slim boy.  All great razors.  Each requiring a slightly different technique due to their size and weight.  Then I stumbled across this thing.  Although inexpensive (not cheap), it in many ways offers the best of the above mentioned razors.  The handle is thick like the fat boy making for easy holding, it has a long handle and great styling like the black beauty, but still is very light weight like a disposable. I don&#x27;t think the light weight aspect can be addressed strongly enough.  With a really sharp blade like the  feather, you need a very light touch.  When you have a heavy razor, it&#x27;s easy to bear down harder than you should , and inadvertently nick your self.  This razor makes that less likely.  At first I was really disappointed in this razor.  I thought it was cheap , particularly seeing the inside made of plastic, and didn&#x27;t believe it would last very long.  What I previously viewed as a shortcoming I now see as a very distinct advantage. Although I enjoy using the old Gillettes, whenever I come back to this razor I always find myself more impressed by it. A few notes on other things.  I found a better price on the auction sites for feather blades, particularly in lots of 100. Although I love the sharpness, the feather blade is very unforgiving.  If your skin is not smooth it will remove anything in it&#x27;s path, hence the need for a VERY light touch.  I am considering trying Astra blades, which may not be quite so lethal. It&#x27;s important to wash your face well before adding any shaving cream or soap. Apply a good aftershave afterwardsto clean up any small nicks you have, then a good skin cream such as Cetaphil moisturizing lotion.  As someone with very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m forced to pay a bit more attention to these details, and hope perhaps this helps others in the same boat.Likewise I appreciate your tips.  Update: 2/26/13 Love love love this razor. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the feather blades, or my skin has just had all the high spots shaved off.  IN any case I almost never get a nick anymore. The lightness of the razor , really allows a lot more control than my old Gillette&#x27;s.  Still impressed. I would give this 5 stars now if I could change it.  Update 7/1/2016 Still using the original razor, although I did buy a spare about a year or so ago. Sometimes when I travel I take a disposable double edge razor. When I come home I really appreciate the great shave I get with the feather. Now I can change the review to 5 stars and did so.</li>
    <li> I just received the Feather and decided to try it out. I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for many years and prior to that the other newer Gillette double and triple blade systems. Being in my 60&#x27;s I used the older double edge systems for a few decades. Back then I used Wilkerson Swords. I would shave at least 6 days a week and did so for decades. So my review is based on lots of experience with both systems.&lt;br /&gt;Cutting to the chase the Feather is a very good blade, the shaver is ok, but, don&#x27;t match up to my old chrome heavy weight  handles. As for the over all shave the Mach 3 wins hands down. I always take a double shave. I did the first pass with the Feather and reached out for my Mach 3 for the second pass over to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;In summation the Mach 3 is expensive, but well worth the price. For you young bucks I say give the Feather a whirl you might like it and save some money in the process. I&#x27;m sticking to my Mach 3!</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into the world of double edge shaving.  I wore a beard from the time started growing facial hair until I was 36 and by then started with multi-edged shaving devices and electric.  I decided to take the plunge into the world of double edged shaving and the Feather Razor met the mark.  It is light and well built.  Though some parts are plastic I do not see that as a fault.  It is very light and easy to maneuver.  Make no mistake, you will draw blood on your first attempts, I sure did!  But, as another reviewer stated you are either getting better at it or you are planing down the high spots.  My wife says the shave is as close as Fusion gets me.  It does take more time, or you will be sorry.  The Fusion is much more forgiving but double edge shaving is more rewarding!  As a beginner I can say that this would be a good starter and likely a keeper for the double edge shaver.    UPDATE 4/20/14:  I&#x27;ve been using the Feather Razor now for 5 months.  My first shave was a bit of a nightmare!  I was wearing a white Tee-shirt and after the first shave it was flecked with red from the nicks and scrapes of that first go at it.  But I continued and have gotten better and I believe that you are really planing down the high spots on your face as well.  I get a good shave blood free these days. The process has sped up, but is still slower than the Fusion.  I enjoy it more than using the using the Fusion for some reason, maybe because of the perceived danger involved.  One thing I did note is that I often do not shave every day and may go several days between shaves.  I have a medium to heavy beard.  The feather handles this type of shaving much better than any multi-edge shaver I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t get clogged up at all. As far as the durability of the Feather is has proven very durable showing no wear, tear or malfunction.  I have only used Shark Super Chrome blades and they work great.  Cleaning and oiling (I use baby oil) the blade after use gives an extra 1-2 shaves and they are noticeably smoother than not oiling.    UPDATE 10/03/14:  I have been using this razor now for about 9 or 10 months and have recently purchased it some company.  I wanted to try out a screw together style and not wanting to spend much money on the trial I got a Baili for about $14.  This gives me something to compare the Feather to.From this experience the Feather is a less aggressive design.  It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close, but it feels safer.  Using the Baili I have to be more careful due to the added aggression of the design.  This makes the Feather a better choice for beginners and those with less aggressive beards.  God knows what my first shave would have been like with the Baili!  The Feather drew enough blood!    As far as the speed of shaving I am almost up to par with shaving with the Fusion.  I have switched to Wilkinson Sword blades and they are the best I have used yet!  I&#x27;m getting 5 easy shaves from a blade with them.  I could push it to 6 or 7 and still be doing better than after 3 with the Sharks.    I am really enjoying double edge shaving.  I highly recommend the Feather, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> A definite winner!! Love how this razor shaves, nice mild cut with excellent balance and feel. Shaves like a much higher priced razor. You would almost have to try to cut yourself with this razor, even with the extremely sharp blades included with it.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably cheap for what you get. It is very solid feeling. It is plastic but it has a great feel in the hand. The blade is held firmly in place. I liked the blades that came with it, maybe a little sharp for a beginner. Once your skin gets used to them they are great! I have ordered the same blades in a separate order.</li>
    <li> Best lightweight inexpensive, safety razor out there period! Also they&#x27;re blades are the sharpest I also use these in my old stay at home heavyweight German safety razor, this is the ultimate lightweight high quality, inexpensive travel razor,&lt;br /&gt;The only lightweight safety razor, period, hands down!</li>
    <li> would not recommend this razor. shaving edge does not allow for a smooth clean shave. not enough blade exposure..not well designed for men.. possibly young boys.</li>
    <li> everything I was looking for!this hard to find product does everything I was looking for,close shave and quality product!very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving. This inexpensive razor does the job well. the blades that came with it were amazing and lasted me for weeks. I have switched over to cheaper blades and I am still good for a week at a time.</li>
    <li> This razor is crazy sharp. It looks like a they should yellow tape my bathroom when I shave. So much blood.</li>
    <li> This raizor is good for the price. It does the job on the budget. A little bit too light for my hand. A lot of plastic parts so you all know, but once you get use to it, it is pretty well balanced.</li>
    <li> Just used it. I noticed one has to hold it a steeper angle than the disposable razors, but it does a great job, feels smooth, has a nice handle, did not nick myself and I really like the way it opens up for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my last disposable!!!</li>
    <li> It is a good buy, I am satisfied with the product. I also got the one made in China but it is cheaply made!</li>
    <li> Good 4 multiple use, save money, live better, go green. Would have been 5 stars if it was completely stainless steel (indestructible).</li>
    <li> 1st time shaving with a safty razor.switched because razors cost alot...i should have tried this a long time ago.this is amazing very smooth shave,read reviews and sounds like some people rush and have problems with it but i can say i love this razor,it very easy to use</li>
    <li> I like this double edge razor. I am able to get a closer shave than when I use a multi-blade razor.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  The long handle helps prevent slippage.  The twist handle blade release makes it easy to change the blade.  In my experience, you can&#x27;t buy this in stores.  It is, or is similar, to perfected razors from the 60&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s.  It is sad you can&#x27;t purchase this now in any stores that I have checked.  I guess they want to sell the much more expensive (per shave) disposable razors with 2 to 5 blades.  I get as good a shave, or better, with this razor.  Plus, I am only disposing of metal blades which are Earth friendly.  The plastic disposable razors are not, and you have to dispose of the whole razor.  Every time I disposed of one of those expensive plastic razors, I thought about the swirling mass of plastic in the Pacific Ocean covering an area the size of Texas!  But, even if you are not into environmental issues, you can get as good a shave, or better, with this razor saving half the cost, or more, depending on what disposable razor (that I have found) you might want to compare it with. I gave it 4 stars only to leave room because I haven&#x27;t tried them all.  I am very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> holds the blade perfectly and at the right angle to prevent cuts or skin irritation. shaves great, you can go against the grain for a smooth shave without worries.</li>
    <li> Very good razor for price.  Not as heavy as other more expense razors but sufficient as inexpensive version.  Bought one for each of my brothers.  They like as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using the merkur 38c for the past 6 years with great results, I also have the merkur bakerlite which I also enjoy as does my wife. So when I got this razor it was going to be for my 15yr son as his introduction into the world of wet shaving, of course I had to try it first to make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to butcher his face.  I have very sensitive facial skin especially my neck area, I am sporting a chin strap beard and I have found shave secret oil to be the best protection for my face giving me a clean close cut free shave while allowing me to see my lines. Having said that, I had not shaved for 5 days when this razor arrived so I put in one of my gellette  silver blue blades, oiled up with my shave secret shave oil and had at it. Many say this is a mild shaver and I found that to be true as well, but mild in this case does not equal not close and clean on the contrary. This razor gave a very close shave (bbs) with only three passes and no irritation on my neck. At first I thought the handle was to long, but it turns out to be just right allowing precise handling in getting my lines barbershop straight. Now I thought well I did test it on a five days growth so irritation would have been minimal using any of my razors, so I shaved with it again one day later and again no irritation and as my wife commented my face was bbs!  This has now become my daily shaver, I have yet to try it with the included feather blades, will try them next month when its time to change blades.</li>
    <li> Wow what a nice shaver. Smooth operation. I was a little skeptical at first because of some plastic parts and the price, but I was proven wrong. So far so good.</li>
    <li> It was a &amp;#34;straw purchase&amp;#34;. I bought it for a neighbor who couldn&#x27;t find one locally and doesn&#x27;t do computers. He has yet to threaten me so I&#x27;m guessing he likes it.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to relearn how to shave with a single blade (use gravity, and do not apply pressure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few shaves, some nicks and some blood, to get the technique right.  No regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has never felt smoother, and my breakouts have gone away.  I think, multi blades were responsible for the breakouts (in retrospect, that is how I feel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired it with feather blades - initially (the one&#x27;s that came with the razor), but have moved to Astra.  Prefer Astra over feather (don&#x27;t know if the blades that come with the razor are different from retail blades by feather, kind of like the tires and battery that come with a new car :-) )</li>
    <li> Cheaper and better than the other brands! I will never go back to a multi shave razor. Great Product GG</li>
    <li> Good for the price. But i didn&#x27;t like the plastic of this razor. I think it is a good entry razor.</li>
    <li> My husband is SO glad to get back to a real razor again, after using disposables for years.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and soft skin, not a good combo. Have always used an Atra, the best cartidge style by far for my skin and beard. But wow, getting pricey! Yes I have also tried the multi blade monsters what a mess. And the price, no thanks! Bought a Merkur (not adjustable) to try out safety razors and was not overly impressed. Then I tried Feather blades in the Merkur. World of difference! So I thought if the blades are that good how is the razor?? I know, not the best logic, but hey for the price, why not. Holy cow, best shave ever from day one! This Feather, with Feather blades, is wonderful. Close, no nicks, no pulling, did not even have to get used to it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the Merkur is a good razor with the right blade. But for my skin / beard type this suits me to a tee. Weather it wil work for you, hard to say, but I am more than pleased with it.</li>
    <li> at $20, this is arguably the best in its price point.  It&#x27;s light, easy to use, durable, and shaves well.</li>
    <li> hard time getting the hang of using it but after quite a few nicks and cuts it gives me the best shave i have ever had&lt;br /&gt;i started with the razor advertised by the pawn shop guy but it did not hold a candle to the feather double edge.&lt;br /&gt;i have told a lot of my friends about it.</li>
    <li> A plastic razor with just one blade!!! Imagine that!!&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s important here is what this plastic DE razor does with that one blade.......It puts al the multi blade plastic razors to shame giving you a smooth cut free shave without all the waste of materials (and money!)  that all the other lousy plastics razors do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one ...buy a few blades...get a great shave...and never look back!!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be glad you did.........</li>
    <li> Not good its rough on my face and head the blades are not near as sharp as my Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, but surprisingly good.  Excellent for travel. The handle is made of plastic, but the design is very precise and it shaves well.</li>
    <li> After trying this razor, I will never again buy the (too) expensive razors that have the disposable heads. VERY reasonable price for the razor and the blades are MUCH less expensive than the &amp;#34;triple edge&amp;#34; razors that last for about 3 or 4 shaves.</li>
    <li> One pass with the Feather produced results comparable to two with my Merkur 180. Two passes produced a smooth finish with no nicks or burns. It does very well with Feather blades, not surprisingly, but I&#x27;m liking it with my favorite blade, the Astra Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . . . And after two weeks, this is my favorite razor. I am surprised. Don&#x27;t let the light weight put you off - - even if you like a hefty stainless steel handle, you will want to give this product a spin.</li>
    <li> There are several good, objective, comprehensive reviews of this razor already posted, and you should read them. What I can add to them is how the razor works with a tough beard.  For some reason most of the men who are double-edge shaving (or at least the ones who write about it) seem to have sensitive skin and medium or light beards.  I have neither.  If you have a coarse or heavy beard you will be making several passes with this razor because it is MILD.  The typical three passes probably will not be enough so allow yourself some extra time for your morning shave.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a beginning DE shaver that mildness is not necessarily a bad thing.  This was the first razor I tried and even with the Feather blades, reputed to be the sharpest razors available, I was never able to cut or nick myself. That is something I can&#x27;t say about the more expensive razors I purchased later.  The &amp;#34;Popular&amp;#34; is light and mostly plastic but the fairly long handle gives it a nice balance. I found it to be a great razor to learn about DE shaving with.  You may not hand this down to your grandchildren but you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Just got this razor delivered, haven&#x27;t shaved in 3 days, tried it out and I&#x27;m impressed.  This is a really good cheap TTO safety razor.  Great for the beginner.  It is partially made of plastic so it doesn&#x27;t have the weight that an all metal razor would have but I like the design.  I will get a much heavier razor at some point, I have a birthday coming up soon but I&#x27;m glad I bought this one first just to learn with.  I&#x27;ve never used a TTO razor until today and I was expecting it to be a rough bloody endeavor but surprisingly it wasn&#x27;t that bad.  I only knicked myself once and it barely even bled.  I got the el-cheapo soap and have some razor burn but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase...when I get a heavier razor I&#x27;ll just use this Feather as a travel razor and it comes in a clear plastic folding travel case.</li>
    <li> I would say that this razor is good for beginners like myself who are making that switch from cartridge razors to safety razors.  Yes this is made of plastic, but the head is made of metal, and it&#x27;s still heavier than multiblade razors, but lacks the heft that all metal safety razors have.  I&#x27;ve had this for a month now, and it&#x27;s given me good shaves, it&#x27;s also easy to clean and maintain, and it&#x27;s pretty affordable.  So if you want to start using a safety razor, but aren&#x27;t entirely comfortable shelling out $25+ for one, try this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> pretty good razor,close shaves.</li>
    <li> I switched to a safety razor because I was tired of spending $40.00 for 8 replacement cartridges.  At a cartridge per week, it was costing me over $250.00 a year in blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Feather Double Edge Shaving Razor will save me over $175.00 the first year, and then about $225.00 each year after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use, shaves great, and easy to clean up.  I highly recommend this to anyone thinking of taking it old school.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor and it is pretty good one thing I like about this razor that has a long handleThe quality overall it&#x27;s not bad I like it</li>
    <li> My husband thinks it is great. This razor compares well with the high-end chrome plated, magnetically balanced nonsense. It holds a blade and curves it to shave. Geofatboy has an excellent review on his site, this razor is amazing and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I will keep it simple. This is the best razor I have used, can&#x27;t go wrong with old school. It&#x27;s cheap and durable. Just be careful because it can cut really easily.</li>
    <li> I use this razor daily and just can&#x27;t find a real fault. For a TTO razor the blades are held in place in the correct position every time I use it. The tightening nut always stays tight and it is very easy to clean. No rust issues, no stuff feeling cheap issues, it just works. I know there are many shaving snobs who insist on a Parker, Jagger, or Muehler razor and I agree that they look better and are fancier but I just want to shave. This razor has gotten some bad press due to the plastic handle. The only reason this isn&#x27;t a 5 star review is that the handle does get slippery whereas the Edwin Jagger I also have doesn&#x27;t. I use this razor everyday over the Jagger because is simply feels like a better shave and that is the point right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price fool you - this is a good, serviceable razor and it even comes with a five pack of Feather blades. If you insist on spending $200 on a razor, I would highly suggest the Feather All Stainless - my barber uses that one when I get a shave there and it feels awesome. Just not worth $200 awesome for me.</li>
    <li> great shave just waiting for extra blades that I bought along with razor from other seller in Thailand it sucks</li>
    <li> I really enjoy it! I&#x27;m 46yo, tired of buying expensive disposables for decades wasting my money.  This razor was shipped quickly, is sturdy, feels solid, not to light, well balanced.  The mechanics are operate smoothly.  No nicks or blood on my first try but I was a bit cautious then soon relaxed and simply shaved without worry!  I recommend this razor, great price cant be beat, reputable company.</li>
    <li> Problems I have with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Difficult to clean.  It always ends up with a white film over it, which doesn&#x27;t clean with hot water, alcohol, witch hazel, vinegar, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Need to slightly turn the neck to let shaving &amp;#34;debris&amp;#34; out when rinsing in water.  The butterfly doors need to be opened when you&#x27;re done with a swipe so the hair can be let out.  Otherwise it just &amp;#34;clogs&amp;#34; and sticks inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Butterfly &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; (whatever you want to call it) sometimes get stuck or don&#x27;t open all the way.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go back to less expensive blades and this razor does the job very well, blades are readily available and extremely econmical.</li>
    <li> if you have to do your beard every day&lt;br /&gt;this product is very good to shaving your face or your head&lt;br /&gt;the blade is amazing and very easy to use, to clean and to change.</li>
    <li> You can buy better razors if you spend more but I got this one because I wasn&#x27;t sure I would go back to shaving with a Safety Razor. I am going to. Never again will I shave with 3,4,5, and 6 bladed razors that cost so much and don&#x27;t give as good of shave as double edge razor does.</li>
    <li> I finally got tired of the expense of the $4+ Fusion cartridges and ordered this Feather DE razor. I wanted to experience DE shaving without dropping a ton of $ on the shaver since, I thought, I might not like the single blade shave. My shaver arrived on time as scheduled, as is usual with Amazon:-)  I like the hard plastic case the Feather was shipped in. It will serve as a travel case. The razor&#x27;s handle is plastic, but it has a nice feel, is textured, and provides good grip when my hands are wet (I shave in the shower). The build of the razor is very good, it in no way feels flimsy, and it secures the blade very securely. All-in-all, the razor is well-built, and the butterfly mechanism works smoothly. Much of the Feather is made of plastic, but it doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34;.  I wondered a bit about how that first shave would go since I had been shaving with disposable cartridges for almost forty years. I made sure to prep my face well, and I used King of Shaves Alphagel since I had used it most recently on my last couple of months of Fusion cartridge shaving. I found the Feather, with it&#x27;s Feather blade (2 were shipped with the razor), to be easy to use, very effective at removing my heavy beard, and it gave me a great shave without even one nick or cut! I used that same blade for just over two weeks before it began to give me a tinge of irritation (after shaving I wipe the blade with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball to avoid having hard water minerals and shave gel corrode the steel).  One month of Fusion cartridges would equal what I paid for this Feather razor and it&#x27;s two included blades. I just now ordered 50 Feather blades (I&#x27;ll say, very conservatively, A YEAR&#x27;s supply of blades), for about what another 4 cartridges (A MONTH OR LESS of shaves) would have cost. The shaves I get with my Feather are as good or better as those with the Fusion. The head of the Feather is much easier to clean and much less likely to clog as were the Fusion&#x27;s. I&#x27;m still regretting not making the switch years ago.  The Feather Double Edge Shaving Razor (and it&#x27;s Feather blades!) get my highest recommendation! Buy one - you, your face,  AND your wallet will be happy you did! ********************************* UPDATE 07JUNE2015 - How do I feel about my Feather razor after 14 months? Still feeling the love. The Feather razor itself has performed almost every day for 14 months without any sign of breakage or loosening.  My shaving technique is better. I have found an inexpensive, high-tallow shaving soap, Arko, that I really like. I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the Feather blades that I have used since converting to wet shaving w/a safety razor. And the damage is less than two bucks per month, even when switching blades every Sunday morning. I wish I had converted years ago.   And I give the Feather Double Edge Shaver a very high &amp;#34;Buy&amp;#34; recommendation!</li>
    <li> this razor is great ! I wish I started using it a loooong time ago.  It gives a great shave and is cheap as hell !  finding the right blades was the challenge, but I ended up going with the feather blades that came with it, they work great and last a long time.</li>
    <li> For that price you make a good deal with buying this item. The razor looks like on the picture and is really good on handling.</li>
    <li> Yes, there are some plastic parts but don&#x27;t be fooled by that. This is a very capable razor, the blade aligns perfectly (not necessarily the case even in razors much more expensive). It&#x27;s also very forgiving in the sense that you don&#x27;t have to hold it in a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; angle for it to do its job. The only minor complain might be that since the handle is plastic it&#x27;s a little top heavy. The upside is that it&#x27;s more agile and since I shave the &amp;#34;cabeza&amp;#34; too that suits me fine. Lastly, the blades that it comes with are super sharp, so much so that I prefer to use the Personna blades instead.</li>
    <li> I gave up paying the ridiculus prices for the 2,3, 4,5 10, 20,30,100 (being sarcastic, if you hadn&#x27;t noticed) blade cartidges that I have discovered are one of the causes of skin irritation if you have sensitive skin. Seriously... 30 dollars or more for 5 or 6 cartridges? I ordered 100 Feather razors for less than that! Actually, I kind of screwed up while placing my order, so I have 230 blades coming at me... regret it? NO. Still WAY cheaper than the multi-blade BS. Will probably last me a lifetime, where it would have probably gotten me 2 or 3 packs of the multi blades. I normally use a straight razor, have all the hones and strops, etc. Bought this for travel and when in too much of a hurry for the straight. As a result, I have been using badger brush/soap for quite some time, so it was the natural thing to use with this razor. As others have said, this is a very forgiving razor, I have yet to even nick myself, much less a bad cut, with it. While I still enjoy using my straights, this has kind of spoiled me, and I&#x27;ve got my eyes on the $175 all stainless model, but due to finances, it&#x27;s going to have to wait for about 6 months.... can&#x27;t wait! In the mean time, this will serve me well, and I will still use it for travel and when I&#x27;m in a hurry, and the straights when I have the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I edited this because I forgot to mention...even though some parts of it are made of plastic, it is not cheap plastic. More of some type of composite, and definitely does not have a cheap feel to it, rather, it has a fairly solid feel to it. The fit and finish are well done, and it is a quality razor despite the use of \\&quot;plastic\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the plastic fool you. this is a good razor. Love the butterfly opening vs the 3 piece style.&lt;br /&gt;Does not get as close as more expensive razors, which makes it good for those looking to try one out.&lt;br /&gt;the plastic keeps maintenance low, never have to do more than hot rinse and shake it off.</li>
    <li> A well made safety razor. The disposables were convenient, but the shave of the Feather razor &amp; blades is fantastic. And, since the it rinses clean easily (unlike those 2 to 4 blade disposables) I have reduced the time shaving considerably.</li>
    <li> Received two weeks before specified due date.  Item is shipped from overseas.  This is a basic old style razor.  You would be better off with one of the old classic adjustable razors.  The razor came with two Feather stainless steel double edge blades.  They are excellent and very sharp..</li>
    <li> After searching through review after review I finally picked this razor for my initial switch to the DE style razors. So far it has been the best shave I have ever had. The blades that come with it are good(the feather ones) but I have tried others and found that they work just as well. This is definitely good for those with a light to medium beard. I have a pretty thick beard and it works well but I do have to go over a few spots a couple times. It is definitely worth the price and it is also a great gift for the fellow man.</li>
    <li> Very good razor.  The handle may be plastic, but the razor performs like a dream.  I thought I preferred a heavy handle better, so I purchased a Parker.  The Parker is a great razor as well, but not better than this Feather.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor, especially as a first DE razor.</li>
    <li> I like the safety razor because it is simple, successful and reminds me of time gone by. Easy to clean and cheap to use.</li>
    <li> Got this as a starter DE razor.  It performs great.  It is a very mild shaver, and one must be real careless to get a cut, and careless to get burn.  Feather blades, or blades that are real sharp, are a must for this razor, as it is that mild.  It is plastic and will not last forever, however, at this very reasonable price, you will get your monies worth easily. Great for a beginner wet shaver.</li>
    <li> First time trying this kind razor and omg never going back to the multi blade s*** they sell in stores</li>
    <li> Hubby says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s had in awhile. He stopped using his electric razor for this one and he has a heavy beard. No more 5  o clock shadow for him!</li>
    <li> This is a good starter DE razor handle. I recommend it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Lightweight, if that&#x27;s what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Sturdy construction, don&#x27;t let the plastic fool you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Comes in a handy case for travel. Does not rattle around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Razor blades align perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Low-cost. So you won&#x27;t feel bad if you forget it in a hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Lightweight, if that&#x27;s not what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Aesthetics: There are a lot of prettier models, particularly the all-metal ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Angle not really adjustable.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of paying for the machs. I was scared at first of getting cut. Now I can&#x27;t believe how much better it is and how much money I was wasting.</li>
    <li> Bought both of my adult sons these for a Christmas present. Like me they are sick of paying hi high prices for the new style razor blades. I wanted something nice but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money in case they didn&#x27;t like this type of razor. They both like them. The quality of this razor is good for the price point.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day 2013. He likes it, has used it every day and has no complaints.</li>
    <li> this gives a pretty good shave, much better than the el-cheapo one I tried for les than $3 a few months ago. It will save a fortune compared to the disposable cartridges.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of safety razors before, however I became interested in them when I found the feather pack of 50 blades for $16 dollars here on amazon while searching for cheaper razors.  After looking into it, these razors really do make the most sense cost wise.  I can shave about 4 times with each razor (each has 2 edges, so 2 shaves per edge), which means the 50 blades I bought will last 200 days!  Definitely the most cost effective approach to shaving I have found yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other upside I have found to these razors is that nearly every shave is with a brand new razor.  If you think about bic razors and how sharp they are on the first cut, shaving with the razor is essentially getting that perfect edge shave every time you shave. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside of these razors is that the head doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; like cartridge razors do.  As a guy, shaving my face really wasn&#x27;t any more difficult, it just took a couple days to get used to a slightly different technique, though I have yet to cut myself with it! (This was a concern when I bought it as I heard that it is easier to cut yourself, but I have had no issues)  However, my girlfriend wanted to try it for her legs and she found it very hard to use because the razor must be held at the right angle to cut, so it was difficult for her to hold it like that while getting hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the razor itself, I was a little concerned initially because it is made out of plastic in parts, but I have had no issues with it!  The contraption that holds the blade in places works great, and the razor feels very sturdy despite being made of plastic.</li>
    <li> Bought this and a box of 100 Personna blades and my first shave was amazing. So it had been a few days since my last shave and my hairs were quite long. I thought this would be the perfect test because at this point if I would&#x27;ve used a multi-blade, it would&#x27;ve been torture with all the tugging, pulling and razor burn. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but do get bumps if I don&#x27;t use the right razor or shave with a multi when my hairs are longer than the width of a fingernail! The basic, single blade Feather sliced right thru like I had just a little shadow. Coming from disposables I can appreciate the lightweight feel of this razor. Not much else to say about this razor.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months ago and I can&#x27;t recommend it high enough. Just bought my first blade replacements - about $3 bucks, hard to top that.    HOWEVER if you decide to go this route, be sure to read about how to use this - it&#x27;s very different than shaving with commercial, disposable razors, and if you&#x27;re not prepared you&#x27;ll really cut yourself up. Basically you go really, really light and keep the thing almost perpendicular to the floor, just slightly angled down. This link had good advice, start about this halfway down: [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good razor for those who know what they&#x27;re doing but not for the rest of us. You&#x27;re starting with a DE razor this is both difficult to use and unforgiving. What I discovered too late is that Feather is a Japanese brand and their blades are well known for being some of the sharpest on the market making them not recommending for beginners. I lost a pint of blood doing a simple head shave. Also, the adjustable collar is a nice feature but it doesn&#x27;t stay where you set it for long. If I didn&#x27;t keep it in the tightest setting, which sets the blade at the steepest angle, I would constantly have to readjust the setting every few passes. It did provide a close shave and DE razors are very economical but this is just garbage.</li>
    <li> Sturdy. I don&#x27;t loose it when wet shaving. Holds my astra blades at the perfect angle. Go slow if this your first safety razor this one can be less forgiving than some others.</li>
    <li> There may be better razors available, but this is the best one I have purchased so far. It may not be as good as the high dollar razors, but with the price to replace the blades this is an inexpensive way to go.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my Mekur. Feels cheap.</li>
    <li> use this razor for beginners and some one with sensitive skin. The razor is comfortable and basic. It is a starter to get use to DE razors. Got some for my 17 year old son. He loves it.  USE GEL SHAVING SOAP it is better than most shaving soaps.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my husband and he loves it.  It gives a good shave, the price is right and razors are cheap</li>
    <li> This Razor is very attractive, well build and give a close none aggressive shave.It has become one of favorites, The Razor is a Classical.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, holds blade evenly (Compared to another purchase) and has a nice sized comfortable handle (Again, compared to another purchase). Liked so much gave my first review and ordered another as a back up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor as a travel piece that I would not cry over if lost for any reason ... I&#x27;ve grown attached to my Weber razor and no longer risk it to the TSA folks, they can be moody in some parts of the world.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a fine tool!!  I have been using DE razors for over 60 years and this fine instrument holds it&#x27;s own against any as far as shaving quality.  Obviously, for the price, it&#x27;s not going to compare with my all stainless, polished Weber in appearance but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re discussing here.&lt;br /&gt;The safety bar on this razor would allow a moron to wack away at their face without much threat.  I have never so much as nicked myself with this gentle razor even when violating all the rules and shaving against the grain.  I have a medium heavy beard and it&#x27;s no push over!!&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the mechanics of this tool here is what I recommend.  After using it for over a year this works.  I keep the main supporting pin and the tightening mechanism lubricated with a drop of 3 in one oil about once a month.  I clean the razor a little every three or four days.  I NEVER TIGHTEN THE PLATFORM CAP MORE THAN FINGER &#x27;SNUG&#x27;!!!!  That&#x27;s all that is necessary to perfectly seat the blade that is precision placed by the guide bar.&lt;br /&gt;I use cheap, $2.00 a can, Barbasol shaving cream because it easily clears with a splash of water from any DE razor.  This is not true of some gels and some other shaving potions.  I loosen the mechanism after shaving and do not apply any pressure again until the next shave ... this preserves the mechanism.  This razor&#x27;s moving parts are all stainless and, yes, they are not hefty but that makes no difference.  Treated with some care, don&#x27;t screw down on the lifting mechanism, this razor could last someone for years and years!!!!&lt;br /&gt;No, it is not my Weber Stainless but it is one fine, forgiving, well constructed, for it&#x27;s purpose, razor!!!  You will never go wrong for the price here and you won&#x27;t go wrong with it mechanically unless you unnecessarily stress the head my jacking down on the lifter!!!</li>
    <li> I had tried Feather blades before I bought this razor; at that time I used the blades in fixed angle razors and in adjustable ones, in each case finding that the blades were very sharp and in each case nicking myself. With this razor, the cutting angle is such  that I get a close shave and rarely cut myself. Although I like/prefer Feather blades, I&#x27;ve found that my Merkur blades also work well in this razor. Once I&#x27;ve used up my old supply of Merkurs, I&#x27;ll probably stick with the Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Love the single blade shaving experience, in an age of 3 or more blades a good sharp single blade gives a very clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution: There is no safety features and it is very easy to cut your self, but I love the closeness this razor gave me. Would buy again, and recommend it for good close shave.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the mention of plastic scare you...this feels solid and well made.&lt;br /&gt;I use this razor every morning and I appreciate its feel every morning.&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I purchased</li>
    <li> Gives a smooth shave.  Easy to clean.  Fun to use.  Flawless manufacture.  I look forward to shaving in the morning.</li>
    <li> I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by this DE razor.  I have a small collection of DE Razors, including an Edwin Jagger DE89BL and a Parker 22R, and this plastic handled Feather razor definitely holds its own against them.  My personal favorite is the Edwin Jagger, but to keep that chrome bright and shiny is a little extra work that I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about each morning -- so I use it only on the weekends or when I know I have a little extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather razor is pretty light, but gives a nice, close, and comfortable three pass shave.  With a quick pat dry and easy blade removal via the butterfly mechanism, I am on my way.  I can&#x27;t recommend this razor enough as an excellent, economical every day DE razor.  I should qualify that I don&#x27;t mean that it is good \\&quot;for the price.\\&quot;  It is great little razor that puts some of my other more expensive razors to shame!</li>
    <li> I am giving this product four stars, but not because the razor itself is inferior. I actually love the look, the light weight, the one-piece design, and the \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; method of placing the blade. Its very easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is... we all have different beards and different face contours, so this razor is not going to be consistent for everyone. In my case, I just could not get a close shave. I really gave this razor an opportunity to shine. I tried different creams and a variety of blades, but had to give up. It&#x27;s simply not aggressive enough for me. I am not going to disparage this product. But the only way to see if this razor is for you is to try it and hope for a sound return policy.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I&#x27;ve been really bothered by spending so much on cartridge razors lately and looking for a better way. My brother recently got an old Gilette adjustable DE safety razor. He raved about it, so I started researching. I wasn&#x27;t wanting to spend a lot to get a double edged razor; That&#x27;s why I was looking for razors to begin with. I found this Feather razor to fit the bill price wise. It&#x27;s also very nice quality. About the 3rd shave, I was slinging it around like a disposable cartridge razor. Great shave, and amazingly cheap. Not sure why I waited so long to use a DE razor.</li>
    <li> Nice feel and length and a pack of 5 blades.  Not sure how long the plastic will look good after a year</li>
    <li> If you are trying to decide if this is worth the price or should you get the Merkur, well, I got both and this one is just a good as the Merkur and easier to change the blades. It shaves just as good and lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> Bought for my brother. Last I checked he said it was the closest shave of his life.</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me.  Bought it to shave my legs thinking the plastic handle and lighter weight would be quicker and easier to shave in the shower.  Not so!  That was painful and didn&#x27;t accomplish much.  3 stars because the company was nice to give a refund.</li>
    <li> I originally was going to buy a metal Merkur safety razor&lt;br /&gt;but I wanted something a bit less expensive and read all&lt;br /&gt;of the positive reviews on this Japanese plastic/metal&lt;br /&gt;safety razor so I gave it a try. Very good so far. There is no&lt;br /&gt;varying the shaving angle, but you&#x27;d have to spend much&lt;br /&gt;more to get that in one of the Merkur models, so I am happy&lt;br /&gt;with this one for the price (16-17$).</li>
    <li> My husband said it didn&#x27;t shave any closer than his double edge razor which he has been shaving with for 58 years now.  It is the only razor he has ever used.  It is pretty much worn out and does not shave close enough.  He does not use the new one because it just does not shave close enough!  It now resides in a drawer; not being used.  It  looked like a nice razor, that is the reason we ordered it.  His old razor has an adjustment on it, just below the razor head; numbers from 1 to 8; the smaller the number, the closer it shaves.  Personally, I would not recommend this razor, unless it is a &amp;#34;first razor&amp;#34; for young teen.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I now have one...and my daughter needed one for legs and .... try the Feather or Astra blades. Both work well with this razor.</li>
    <li> First time using one of these single blade razors and now I&#x27;m never going back to the multi-blade type. The cartridges are too expensive and they don&#x27;t last very long; the handle or the cartridges. But the Feather Double Edge Shaving Razor is very affordable, easy to use, and feels/looks a bit classier. Includes a case, handle, and razor blades. There is a place inside the case to store extra blades which is pretty neat and helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and this is my first safety razor. I purchased this razor because I was tired of getting razor burn / ingrown hairs, and I heard that safety razors helped alleviate that. I was slightly cautious during my first shave, but I quickly realized that the process is no different than shaving with a simple bic razor. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to get into wet shaving. Once you start, I doubt you&#x27;ll go back to cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for a few months now, and it continues to give excellent shaves. I have since purchased a Merkur 33c and to be completely honest, the Feather razor shaves just as well.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be hard to adjust back to using a Safety Razor, but it was like riding a bicycle.  A little strange at first, but easy to remember the process.  I&#x27;ve very happy with my Feather.  It came with 2 razor blades included and they both gave me a very nice and close shave.  No knicks as of yet.  At first, I thought the razor looked a little cheap because of all of the plastic, but it does a great job holding the razor tightly and it also cleans up nicely with just running water.  I also found that if i twist the top open just a little when I clean it, all of the gunk collected on the blades slides off with just running water.  What I really like is not having to pay $4 a blade for Fusion or Gillette.  I switched about a year ago to Harry&#x27;s but those blades turn out to be about $2 each.  With the Feather and Personna blades, I am only paying about 31 cents per blade.  Big difference and a much closer shave.  I do recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> The long handle and light weight of this razor make it easy to handle. But the best feature is that it&#x27;s blade angle feels more oblique than other safety razors I have tried. It gives a very smooth shave with significantly less risk of a nick or cut. The twist-to-open action is very smooth. Best safety razor I have tried, and a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> The razor is smooth to perfection. I like the hard plastic inside which makes it easier to clean. The plastic prevents the inside from staining or rusting which was my problem in the past. I recommend it to those who use a double blade razor or even a straight edge razor.</li>
    <li> of giving my hard earned cash over to the big boys of shaving.  Even trying to buy in bulk for razors was like saving up for college or a new car.  I had tried awhile back the straight edge route...which turned into a scene from Friday the 13th and probably should have gone to the ER to stop all the bleeding.  So what&#x27;s a fella to do, when you&#x27;re done paying stupid prices for 5 blades, the old school straight edge razor took my beard down to my nerve endings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the answer.  Love this razor, love this shave.  The blades are great, but I&#x27;m going to try all sorts of blades in the future for the perfect fit.  I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m getting about 3 shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also let you in on a great product that works miracles with this system...and frankly, is my go to shave product.  Secret Shave.  Made with pure oils, this stuff smells fantastic, and makes all razors glide through your beard like Jason&#x27;s machete through a ...stick of butter.  Best of all, it&#x27;s under $3 at your local WallyWorld and one small bottle lasts forever when all you need is 3 drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Was an excellent gift for my father. He was very pleased to have a razor,just like the one he had when he was younger.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this razor for a month now and I’m completely satisfied. The long handle and light weigh closely approximates my cartridge razor so it feels comfortable and familiar in my hand.  I was a bit surprised as this razor produced less nicks and burning sensation after my shave. The blade fits evenly in the head and both edges are exposed exactly the same. I tried a more expensive razor and the shorter handle and additional weight were in my opinion a real disadvantage especially with wet or soapy hands. All I really want is a razor that produces a close and comfortable shave and the Feather does that without question.</li>
    <li> I found myself tired of paying nearly $4 a cartridge for Gillette razor blades.  After doing some research, I decided to try a double edge razor.  Since I have a very sensitive face, I did not want to spend $30+ on a razor that I may only use once.  The Feather razor was a reasonable option.  It comes pre-packaged with two razor blades.  The top of the blade where the shaving area is located is made out of metal.  The handle is plastic, however the overall unit still have a good quality feel to it.  The top of the razor unscrews easily to change out blades.  If you are still unsure about D/E shaving, this would be a good option to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note:  I feel like I get a closer shave with D/E razors, however new blades do seem to irritate my skin more than Gillette cartridges.  After a couple of shaves, the blades get more dull and this irritation subsides.  The major benefit of D/E razors is the low cost of use.  A 100 pack of razors only costs $10.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Better than I had expected. Would recommend it to anyone. The price was also very reasonable. Was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Fifty three years ago, started with a safety razor Gillette. While in college and for four years in the army and a few years afterward until the Trac-2 arrived that was all I used. Got great shaves and the occasional nick but nothing serious. I used Wilkinson Sword Blades and really liked them. They even worked well with cold water shaves in the field in Vietnam. Then the blades and razors disappeared. The Trac-2 and its ilk were OK but they never really gave a close shave. I really didn&#x27;t like the 3, 4, or 5 blade razors. They were and are obscenely expensive. So about 6 years ago I switched to electric. At first they gave good shaves, but in the last 6 months, even after replacing shaving heads, I just didn&#x27;t get a close shave. So, I switched back to the best of the multiblades that worked for me the two-blade razors from Shick/Wilkinson. I wasn&#x27;t too happy, Then I &amp;#34;rediscovered&amp;#34; that you can by DI blades and razors.&lt;br /&gt;I received my Feather Popular two days ago. It works well. Yes, it&#x27;s plastic, but it appears to be a high grade industrial plastic. The fit and finish is excellent. The first few shaves with the supplied Feather Blades were smooth and close, Yes, I could do better, but I have to get back in shape, so to speak. I will be trying out some different blades I expect to receive in a few days, and will try them out and update this evaluation. I will say the razor does hold the blades securely and shaving is a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving 4 stars a this time, but I may change that after using the razor for a while. ( I have to have more experience with the razor to give it 5, but if it performs as it is now, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new wet shaver, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare against other than cartridge razors.  Based on what I&#x27;ve read and the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using this on both head and face, this seems to be a very mild razor.  I bought it with a sample pack of blades and have started with the ones that I&#x27;ve read are a little milder and am slowly working my way up to the Feather blades, which I&#x27;ve heard are very sharp.  So far I&#x27;ve only had a few nicks that were easily cleaned up with a styptic pencil.  I&#x27;m pretty sure most of the nicks were due to poor beginner technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the blade I use, I get a pretty good WTG / XTG shave with about 4 passes.  I have very thick hair, and as I mentioned, am currently using milder blades.  Keeping with WTX / XTG shaves, keeping well lathered, and using good prep, I have almost no irritation.  Shaving ATG is really necessary for me to get a BBS shave.  I have found it very difficult to shave ATG with this razor and the milder blades without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old cartridge razors, I do get a much better shave with less irritation, but it takes me an hour to shave both head and face, compared to 15 minutes with my old cartridge razors in the shower.  I&#x27;ve only been using this razor for 3 weeks, so time will tell how well the plastic holds up.  It does seem to be a little on the light side for a DE shaver, so it takes a lot of effort to not apply pressure.</li>
    <li> Been shaving with these for years. Missed not having one for about 20 years (step-son lost the 2 I gave him) lost mine moving years ago. These Razors today do not come close in performance and costs are so high! Amercans don&#x27;t make the razors, or blades anymore. This Razor is Japanese, great price. Funny the out  sourced their blades to India, Indonisia &amp; Thailand. I bought my blades from Thailand (Feather brand), I bought 10 packs of 5 to pack (50 blades), way cheaper to buy in large quanities. Anyways I will not have to worry about blades. Its been awhile, but I think shipping was free on both Items.</li>
    <li> Got tired of the hype and cost associated with modern day shaving experience, and did a retro flashback. Decided that if it was good enough for Dad, it would be good enough for me. Guess what? I was right. A nice close shave for a whole lot less $$. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like it so far.  I got tired of using disposable razors that were expensive and didn&#x27;t work.  This is first time using a double edge shaving razor and it shaves close.  Don&#x27;t think it feels or looks cheap.  The only disappointment is that it only came with two razors, would have liked more as a starter kit.</li>
    <li> Great safety razor. I really like the weight and length of the handle.</li>
    <li> Great Razor for the feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;No nics or cuts I highly reccomend this shaver for the feather blade. the angle seems to be perfect.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I would buy this again. Seems to be really sturdy. I didn&#x27;t care for he blades that came with it but that&#x27;s not why I got it.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the razor I ordered. I received some sort of cosmetic wipes with the razor bar code on it.</li>
    <li> You get everything you expect from this razor.  It does what you expect.  The only problem I have with it is it&#x27;s light weight.  You have to go up to the next price point if you like a little bit of heft on your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a few blades in a plastic carrier, so if you are looking to try wet shaving for the first time this is a wonderful and inexpensive way to start.  If you are thinking about trying a wet shave for the first time I would encourage you to pick this up and give it a try.  There is nothing quite like it.  I had been using cartridge type systems for over 25 years and finally decided to give safety razors a try.  I am experiencing the closest shaves I have had in my entire life and the least amount of irritation too.  I do not understand why this is, but I am pleasantly surprised.  Yes, you need to take your time and resist the urge to press the razor down into your face, but once you get the hang of it you will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have an extremely heavy beard, and this is the only way I have been able to get a good shave.  When you consider the price point of razor blades this is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> bought to replace a Mehaz razor. nothing wrong with the mehaz, a little too gentle and just not enough feedback. the Feather is just that step more aggressive that makes it GREAT. razor is plastic and lightweight so watch the pressure, but otherwise it is well made. No alignment problems. also less metal less rust. definitely a good gentle razor with a very good price.</li>
    <li> Good razor for the price.  Use it for travel.  Is much lighter than metal double edge razor.</li>
    <li> Nice razor with good balance and easy to use twist opener/closer just under the head of the razor.</li>
    <li> I have two other other DE razors, both manufactured by Merkur (Futur and classic short), as a basis for comparison. I just could not find the right combination of settings to get a satisfactory shave with the Future despite it being the only adjustable DE razor in my collection.The Merkur classic tended to give me cuts -- needing great respect and attention! When I came across the Feather DE razor, and reading the reviews, I thought that this was what I was looking for. As others have reported, the build quality is very good despite the use of plastic. Balance is very nice as well. Alas, I cannot achieve as close a shave with this razor that I do with either of my Merkurs, although the Feather does not nick my skin. It may be that I haven&#x27;t found the correct technique yet. I am still experimenting and may be will write an update in future. I watched You Tube videos which gave me some ideas to try. In summary, this is a well made razor, gives a gentle shave; but may not give you the results you want.</li>
    <li> Get it. Stop reading reviews. Stop thinking. You will not regret getting this razor. I certainly did not. Also to get rid of the \\&quot;residue\\&quot; issue, use olive oil to re-hydrate the plastic.</li>
    <li> I SEEM TO GET MORE NICKS WITH IT THAN MY GILLETE RAZOR</li>
    <li> an excellent way to start this old-new way of shaving. I&#x27;ve now started trying other razors in this double-edge razor with good results.</li>
    <li> This is a decent razor although It might be worth spending a little more money since the quality difference is pretty noticeable for an extra $10. It works well, but I spent $13 more on my Edwin Jagger and the quality difference is staggering. Not a bad razor to get into the DE safety razor game though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor with Prosaro green and Arko shave soap for a little over a month now. I don&#x27;t know what a more expensive razor would do for me. I continually get a shave that is like a babies bottom.  I use 4 passes and have not experienced a nic, razor burn or pimples. This razor used with Isreali Crystal blades ( and other blades as well ) has given me the best shave I can ask for.</li>
    <li> Its okay for the price if you don&#x27;t feel like spending more on the full metal ones , but after use I am growing tired of its flimsy design. I will keep it until it breaks but I do feel this product is worth the money you pay.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to cartridge shaving go ahead and buy this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this feather double edge shaving razor and Astra razor blades for a little under 30bucks, I can shave with a new razor daily for the next 3+ months for under 30bucks, it is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shaving with a single sharp razor over 4 blades like a cartridge&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy throwing away a used razor blade daily that only cost 10cents.</li>
    <li> Great to shave with and it shaves as good if not better than my Mach III I&#x60;m glad I bought it</li>
    <li> This razor is as good as any double edge razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I recommend it for the price value and how good a shave it gives.</li>
    <li> I have coarse stubble and could grow a beard in a week.  I tear up the expensive 5 blade razors so I gave safety razors a chance.  Love this one.  Didn&#x27;t get nicked at all (yet) after a weeks work on my face.  Easy to clean.  Solid.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This razor looks and works great. It has a nice solid feel while the plastic pieces save on weight.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a nice clean shave as long as the blade remains sharp.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an inexpensive introduction to shaving with a safety razor. Razor and blades got generally positive reviews and price was right so I ordered. Compared to an Edwin Jagger razor I&#x27;ve since purchased, with either Wilkinson or Astra blades, I find I get cut more with the Feather and have problems shaving around my nose. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Spend the extra few dollars for a better razor.</li>
    <li> This is my second DE razor. I had a Parker model before. This one may be plastic, but it feels very solid. It&#x27;s survived MANY falls in the shower and a few trips in a bag. So, don&#x27;t be turned off because It&#x27;s plastic. Besides, I think some of the parts are metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s MUCH more gentle than the Parker razor I had before. I don&#x27;t think it shaves quite as close, but it is still quite a close shave. That&#x27;s probably why the Parker wasn&#x27;t as gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the included Feather blades. Some people claim they&#x27;re too sharp, but this isn&#x27;t an aggressive razor so I think they work well together. I bought a sampler pack of blades and was surprised to find my next favorite blade is the Bic Chrome Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great razor for a great price. I&#x27;ve bought this as a gift for 2 other people since then.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a terribly aggressive DE Razor. The side view of the top let&#x27;s you see the angle of the dome that comes down on the blade. It&#x27;s not terribly aggressive but I wouldn&#x27;t say its the best choice for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said the blade is only as good as your level of skill and level of prep. Even an unskilled shaver can get a masterful shave with the proper amount of quality prep for their skin type. This handle comes with Feather Razors. They&#x27;re exceedingly sharp and good for 3, maybe 4 shaves depending on the level of prep and how close you want to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said I only wish the handle were a bit longer.The handle itself is rather light and easy to manipulate, but the lightness of the handle makes it hard to properly gauge the angle the head is at as well as grip it properly. Something with a bit more weight would force you to concentrate on how you&#x27;re gripping it instead of how hard you&#x27;re gripping it. This is also a function of the plastic grooves on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something with more weight would be easier to handle with less pressure. Applying less pressure or force to the handle will allow the razor to do its job. Without getting a super-expensive metal DE Razor (well worth it regardless) a happy compromise would be lengthening the handle on a DE like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the prep and the shave you still have to clean this razor. I considered dropping it another point just for the head assembly. It collects hair and makes it hard to keep the chamber where the razor is kept clean and dry. It&#x27;s only a few extra seconds work and I&#x27;m not expecting a hermetic seal but the grooves and channels in the plastic parts of the head are difficult to get a towel in and even with a hanging razor rack you&#x27;d have to find a place to keep the razor blade while the handle hung upside down and completely open to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This I would say is a good starter razor and an excellent one for someone willing to settle.to settle.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor and it was perfect. It&#x27;s not too aggressive and is pretty good quality for the price. I used this for about a year and only used it for shaving my head. I recommend it if you&#x27;re switching from a multi-blade razor to a DE. I moved on to a more aggressive razor but this was a great razor for my beginning stage of DE razor use.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first double edge safety razor, and it&#x27;s definitely a good budget razor. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the feather blades or the razor itself, but it  does tend to cause irritation after a couple months of use. I think it&#x27;s because the razor itself started to degrade in quality because of the cheaper materials used. I found myself having to replace the blade more and more often to get a comfortable shave. I&#x27;d still recommend purchasing this  if you&#x27;re wanting to try DE shaving, but consider a less aggressive blade (feathers are the sharpest ones available, and dig into your skin whenever they hit a thick hair patch)</li>
    <li> works like it supposed to.</li>
    <li> I use Feather blades so I figured this was a good idea.  Its a pain to disassemble my Merkur MK030 to change blades so I was intrigued by the twist-to-open design of the Feather.  Somehow the angle of the blade on this razor is totally wrong.  Shaving with this thing is like dragging a butter knife across your face.  When it does manage to remove any hair, it does so unevenly.  Avoid Avoid Avoid!  The twist-to-open concept is solid and deserves to be perfected.  This product needs to be redesigned.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the razor.  Says it is much cheaper to use than the fancy disposable ones being sold</li>
    <li> This razor is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for over 5 years now, and I&#x27;ve currently got a Merkur 34c and a Merkur Futur in my rotation, at $35 and $75 respectively. This little $15 plastic Japanese razor blows the expensive Germans out of the water. My beard is exceptionally heavy, and my skin is somewhat sensitive, but I decided that for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t regret the purchase if this thing didn&#x27;t work out. After shaving with it, It&#x27;s my new primary. It&#x27;s not very aggressive, and coupled with the samurai-sharp feather blades, this butterfly-top is simply brilliant. I&#x27;ve never been able to shave against the grain in my life, but that all changed with this thing. the last time my face was this smooth, I was eleven years old!&lt;br /&gt;The key is using a feather-light touch (pun somewhat intended), and somewhat shorter strokes than one would with a Merkur or EJ. I&#x27;ve found the angle to be somewhat different as well, but with the longer handle, it&#x27;s fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;As a collector of traditional shaving tools, I may find myself ponying up for the feather all-stainless razor in the future, but I don&#x27;t imagine that the shave could be terribly much better; this thing is that good.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re concerned about the materials that it&#x27;s made of, consider this: The Nipponese have been making little plastic cars for quite some time, and as anyone will tell you, they&#x27;re far more reliable than their expensive Prussian counterparts... The build quality of this razor is fantastic, and although it may not have that Mercedes-benz status attached to it, It&#x27;s simply a joy to use and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart anytime soon. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Best shaving razor I ever had. you can adjust the dept of the shaving which is nice feature. I love it.</li>
    <li> have not used de since 1971 but thus is a great razor not very aggressive easy to learn with works great with feather blades better with blue personnas</li>
    <li> I’m an African American male who was in the market for a shaving alternative to combat razor bumps and general skin irritation that oftentimes plague men of color …..Like most guys I used both Gillette and Schick razors for years, spending hundreds of dollars yearly on wherever new motorized shaving device they came up with. Despite paying exorbitant fees for ‘motor razors’, I oftentimes  found shaving to be a dreaded chore, something to rush through…..only to be left with razor bumps that despite my best efforts, continued to appear.&lt;br /&gt;The cost for replacement cartridges from Gillette and Schick is OUTRAGEOUS! I mean really $15 or more for a set of FIVE??!!  If the cost doesn’t dissuade you, the quality of the shave should…..From what I understand, these razors ‘pull/rip’ the hair follicle from your skin [increasing the potential for skin irritation and razor bumps]&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research I learned about the ART of shaving using a traditional safety razor YouTube is your friend, use it!] . Sure, I like most newbies was concerns about slicing my face to shreds with a blade but believe it or not the process ain’t bad at all…in fact the learning curve was NOT daunting for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Feather Safety razor is easy to use [‘the screw open’ loading mechanism] is simple to use. The starter blades I chose were the Astra brand [a pack of 100 blades for $10]&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased a shaving cup and brush set, again entry level [about $9 for a set]….&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I must say that my shaves have been GREAT! Once you go down the route of making shaving an experience and not a chore, there is no going back!&lt;br /&gt;This shaving experience requires that you tailor a process for your particular lifestyle and skin type, for example if you have course hair like me, you might need a bit more prep time [i.e. heat and lubrication on the beard 1st]  In my case, the morning  shaving routine consists of the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face with  moisturizer face wash&lt;br /&gt;2. Fill sinkwith HOT water and soak blade&lt;br /&gt;3. While blade is soaking, make lather in soap cup&lt;br /&gt;4. Coat face and proceed with shave [shave beard with 2 complete passes]&lt;br /&gt;5. Rinse face and  add lubrication moisturizer [I use Shea moisture –tea tree Herbal Bump preventer]&lt;br /&gt;Free yourself from the Gillette/Schick rip off …..You’ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> This razor is unbelievably good--and would be at any price. It out-performs razors costing two or three times as much. (By that I mean DE safety razors, not the multi-blade monstrosities most of us have scraped our faces with over the years. DE safety razors inhabit a superior universe.) This modest little marvel sets the super-sharp Feather blade at an unusual but perfect angle and shaves like an effortless dream. The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I recently reviewed an open-comb razor and raved about its performance. This razor is superior. I can&#x27;t imagine any of the top-of-the-line Feather models doing a better job.</li>
    <li> good razor for those days you want a close shave. Some getting used to, but worth learning to return to a real shave.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I would not however shave fast you will regret it.  The blades are indeed sharp!</li>
    <li> Do not know how it compares to others seeing this is my first one. That&#x27;s why I did not give it a 5 star review. Fast delivery and after a few shaves I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Shaves close smooth and without nicks if you are careful and take your time even shaves through multiple days growth</li>
    <li> I was excited to try and shave like my dad and granddad did, but the single razor shave is just not up to par with modern shavers. Cool looking though. Its something I will pass on to my 19 hear old and laugh when he tells me how bad the shave is...</li>
    <li> I have tried the Parker 92r and the Merkur 38 I use this one by far the most.  its easy to use and works great. when paired with the Feather blades you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Love this razor type bought another so I have 1 for work &amp; 1 for home. That is how much I love the razor system.</li>
    <li> Bought this to try out the double edge experience. Yes, Im a newbee, been using cartridge razors for 20+ years.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is lightweight but still needs very little pressure (if any... depends on how thick your beard grows). Lightweight and parts are plastic but it is made very well. Took 2 times using this to get a nice, close shave with it, bascially because I needed to get used&lt;br /&gt;to getting the right angle. The blades that come with it are super sharp but you can come away nick-free using the right angle and&lt;br /&gt;a little patience. This is not a razor to drag across your face for a quick 60 second shave, like you can a cartridge blade. Now that I am used to it, I can breeze through a shave relatively quickly and haven&#x27;t had any problems cutting/nicking my face. This will get you a much closer shave than a cartridge razor with less passes across your face. All in all, very nice...would recommend! Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Decided to move back to shaving with a safety razor and have since moved back to a straight razor. Heard a lot about Feather quality but did not want to spend a couple hundred dollars to check it out. This one was reasonably priced and I knew from the start that weight and balance was not going to happen with a safety razor made of plastic. The build was very good for a cheap razor. The shave is amazingly close and I find that I can be more aggressive in my shaving technique with this safety razor than with my straight. The included Feather blades are excellent blades and I would recommend using those blades for any safety razor. I use this as my back-up razor whenever I am in a rush and it has never let me down. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I like Feather Blades so I thought I would give this Feather Razor a Try because the price is good not like their stainless steel models, I would have to say this is a very gentle razor but it gets the Job done. It would be very hard to cut or nick your face with this razor it is very forgiving even when you use bad technique. The reason for 3 stars because its does not give a close enough Shave for me. I like that baby smooth feel when I have finished shaving and this razor did not deliver that for me or her.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s less aggressive than what I really need, but does do the job with repeated swipes. The positive side to that is that you&#x27;d really have to make a special effort to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> What can be said about this razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month with feather razor blades.  The razor does what its suppose to do...namely assist in giving me a clean and close shave.  Feels good in my hand.  Good weight and good length.  My hands are probably of average size.  Not huge but not small.  The razors that I use fit snuggly inside the butterfly and do not jiggle around while I&#x27;m shaving.  It is a combination of metal and plastic.  The handle is plastic and very light.  The butterfly is metal.  In terms of functionality the plastic parts don&#x27;t affect your shave.  In terms of appearance...ya an all metal razor would look cooler, but I&#x27;m really more interested in how well this thing does its intended job.  In terms of price...well you can&#x27;t beat it.  So the value is definitely there.  It does everything that I&#x27;ve expected it to do and it is inexpensive so it gets 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a couple weeks now and I shave every 2-3 days with it.  I wanted to try it because I get ingrown hairs on my neck when I shave and peoples&#x27; comments seem to suggest that this is a good razor to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;learning curve&#x27; is a little bogus, it didn&#x27;t take much time at all to figure this guy out. Sure, watching a video on Youtube is useful to help you respect the DE razor, but it isn&#x27;t rocket surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ingrown hairs did not go away completely, at first. It seems like each successive shave has reduced the irritation, it may be because the razor doesn&#x27;t shave your hair clean to the bone like a 7-bladed razor does; it is likely that I am now paying closer attention to the direction my hairs grow and try to only shave with the grain, not across or against. I&#x27;m sure that both factors help. The bottom of my neck has been the worst and I used to shave it last. Last week I started shaving it first to give it the attention that it needs and I think that is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather DE razor is a very high quality blade! The other day I pulled out a brand new Gillette 2-blade and a Schick 5-blade just to compare the experience, and honestly, there is nothing to compare. The Feather blade is much sharper and manufactured to a higher quality than the disposables or the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this, I&#x27;d say my neck irritation is about 10% what it used to be and to me, that makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> I saw some TV adds on a similar product. This one seemed to get better reviews on Amazon. Tried it and am very, very disappointed. Did not shave nearly as close as my regular 2 blade Gillette. Also needed shaving brush, which was an added cost.</li>
    <li> These reviews are really over exaggerating,  this blade is absolutely no different than a single blade disposable.  If you enjoy shaving with a single blade disposable, this is one step above that.  Honestly it is the same thing, I will go back to using my electric foil razor, much less irritation than a blade scraping across my face.  The blade also got stuck on long hairs, they did not cut smooth, this is great for somebody with leather like skin with thick stubble whom already shaves with a Mach3 or single blade disposable type razor.  It is defiantly not better than electric.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor by accident (I thought I was just getting the razors for my other handle) and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleasantly surprised. The shave edge is aggressive and you will need to most likely change your hand angle but nothing that an experienced safety razor user can&#x27;t handle. The handle is extremely light, but it still manages to feel well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaced my Merkur 180 as my daily shaver. It feels a bit smoother with the feather blades due to the internal structure. The feather razor has a long single post which holds the razor which allows the razor glide a bit better. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the 3 post design of the Merkur, but this just works better with the feather blades.</li>
    <li> This is a well made TTO razor. Unlike a cheaper one I purchased, the blade sits even in the razor.</li>
    <li> I was shopping for a safety razor, and this one was ridiculously cheap and had ridiculously good reviews, so it was a no-brainer. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, I am not disappointed. Not much to say other than it works perfectly, and I have no issues with it. I use Feather blades, which are better than most according to reviews.</li>
    <li> Even my wife wants one after borrowing mine.</li>
    <li> This razor has exceeded my expectations.  There is a learning curve and I recommend watching a video on shaving with a safety razor prior to use.  It is very different than my Gillette, but closer shave.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have the ability to store a razor and numerous blades in case a shortage develops.  The razor was to come with two, free blades.  The vendor informed me by e-mail that the supplier had shipped him units w/o the blades which, unknowingly, he had transshipped to me.  Consequently, my order was to be free.  The razor arrived with the blades.  The only way I can repay the vendor&#x27;s honesty is to  give him a good review.  Unfortunately, I lost the label with his name on it.  Sorry. He is in Thailand, the only one I saw from there.  Thank you, whomever you are.  I value your honorable treatment.&lt;br /&gt;  The razor seems well-made; the blades seem  to be sharper than those to which I am accustomed.  I cut myself seven times during the first shave with the Feather...my fault, not the razor&#x27;s.  The touch technique needed for a safety razor is very different from that needed for using a Gillette Mach 3.  I immediately ret. to the Mach 3.  I have neither time nor patience (right now) for learning safe use of this instrument.  I bought shaving gel from Walmart, but have not had a chance to use it with the Feather.</li>
    <li> This razor is a great single-blade alternative to disposables or multi-blades. It&#x27;s relatively light, stays closed while you&#x27;re using it, and the package serves as a case to carry it. The blades are cheap, widely produced, and come from numerous makers, so you can pick and choose your favorites. Overall a good alternative to what has become commonplace in the states.</li>
    <li> A Great Simple Razor. Made in Japan by a people who by their very nature believe in making a high quality product. Much unlike the many cheap Chinese Razors you see being sold. Mostly plastic except for where it counts it is a light and comfortable razor. Great for beginners who might be scared off by the learning curve and price of some of the other available Brands. BEST BANG!!! for your BUCK. Oh, also Feather makes some of the sharpest blades around. IMO</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far but it&#x27;s a nice one.  Just heavy enough, easy to open for cleaning the blades and glides nicely.  I bought the feather blades too which compliment it perfectly.  Much cheaper than these multi-blade options and blades last much longer since they are easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Its a very good razor. well made. Love the butterfly top. I shave with it every day. Nicked myself a few times as its been years since I have used a safety razor, but thats not the razors fault.</li>
    <li> Best product for the money by far! By-the-way, if you&#x27;re like me, save yourself time and money and just start buying feather razor blades for it, too! They&#x27;re FAR superior to anything else in terms of sharpness and durability. They give me the smoothest shave for the longest time, and even after a week and a half still give a smoother shave than merkur, gillette, or wilkinson.</li>
    <li> Works great..gives a clean, close shave..easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Very good starter razor no cuts yet best pick for the money plan to buy another it needs four words</li>
    <li> Well made Japanese razor blades shipped from Thailand.  Wonderful price.  I wouldn&#x27;t have have them from anywhere else but Feather!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect to see rust in a few weeks. I bought an all metal one for 3 bucks and it works a thousand times better. Poor Quality...</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and thought, for the price, why not. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s not the same razor I used 40 years ago, but as I get older, I don&#x27;t shave every day, so my whiskers have been know to get to long for these new fangled, double and triple edge razors that you cant clean. With this shaver, I can take a few swipes, open it, clean it, and keep going. If I know I was going to live much longer, I would buy another one to have a spare.</li>
    <li> For the price, this shaving razor worked very well, close saves, ez to use and so far no nicks. A good general propose razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to grip and good weight. It&#x27;s not plastic. So far, this works out well. Make sure you wet it often when you shave.</li>
    <li> A light touch is necessary to get the best shave from this lightweight model.  Don&#x27;t plan on digging in like you would with a disposable or even a heavier grade Merkur or Gillette.  If you learn to use the shaver correctly you will get a wonderfully close shave.  That it doesn&#x27;t break the bank is just icing on the cake!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of these razors. It is a great price and good quality.</li>
    <li> I like this razor. I bought it because I thought I was creating more waste than I wanted with the disposable razors. I had been using the Schick Xtreme 3-blade disposable (green color) for years. I&#x27;m surprised this shaves as close as the Schick but with one blade. There are occasional small nicks on my throat, but no more than I had with the Schick Xtreme -- I tend to rush and should probably use a better shaving technique. The same blade has been in it for a week and it is still sharp. The black plastic handle has a nice feel -- kind of like a disposable, I guess. Seems like it will hold up for a while. A good value for what I spent (about $15).</li>
    <li> I decided to try my hand at using a safety razor.  The replacement cartridges for the major razor manufacturers has gotten way too expensive. Haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet!  Great razor at a great price.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot from this Razor-Plastic guide bars and plastic handle-but was I in for a surprise.  Teamed it up with the Personna Stainless Steel Comfort Coated DE Blades and got one hell of a shave, very, very close and no nicks.  The plastic is not the cheap stuff but more like a composite that is really rugged and durable.  Bottom line is you can pay a whole lot more for a DE Safety Razor but it probably won&#x27;t shave any better and Oh Yeah the long handle is a definite plus!!!</li>
    <li> This is a real bargain for the quality of razor for the price.  Toss in a couple of &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand blades and you got a real bargain.  I like this razor far more than a top of the line safety razor I have (Merkur, IIRC).  The Feather is lighter, but just fine after you get a bit used to it.  Having a &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; style opening makes it a snap to change blades and/or rinse out the razor.  The Feather blades are my favorite, far better than Merkur, Derby, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $20.00, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to pull the trigger on getting one of these &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; type of razors just because it is so easy to shave with the newer multi-bladed ones.  I am so glad that I finally went ahead and purchased this one.  I am a little more careful shaving with this razor because it is easy to knick yourself if you just zip around your face, but the amount of money you will save compared to the $20 plus dollars you spend every time you get a few more multi-bladed razor cartridges is incredible and cleaning this one is a breeze.  Not too heavy but seems to be holding up very well so far.</li>
    <li> I am knew to wet shaving so I was a little worried about buying this razor after all the warnings that is not for beginners. It has been a month now and I love this razor. I have never had a shave this close before. It works great !!! Just go slow in the beginning and you will gradually get faster with time. I am very happy with this buy</li>
    <li> This comes with a nice travel case. I didn&#x27;t like the Feather Hi-Stainless blades it came with at all - they&#x27;re not anything like yellow Feathers - but the plastic tuck is reloadable with good blades. The razor is either a little too aggressive or a little too careless. I&#x27;ve tried blades I generally get great shaves with and blades I put on Skid Row for being lousy, and I have not been able to find a blade that I can get a close and comfortable shave with. I can avoid too much irritation by accepting an OK shave, or I can go for the baby butt smooth shave and end up doctoring some pretty good nicks. It&#x27;s a pretty good travel razor, as long as your standards for an on-the-road shave aren&#x27;t too high.</li>
    <li> This a good starter safety razor.  Sure it is plastic and it&#x27;s not going to last forever, but I think it an excellent cost-quality ratio.  Also shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor for very few bucks. It has the precision to give a mild safe shave even with the sharper blades.</li>
    <li> Simple BIC razor works better on my face...handle is also short for my hand so it&#x27;s hard to use</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice feel and easy operation</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, seem made well.  I have a old double edge that was my grandfathers, this one is pretty light comparatively.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it though.  In the future I will be looking for something with a little more weight to it.  Good product, arrived fast and on time.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice shaver;  and actually a very good value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a decent balance to it,  too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from an old-school safety razor (ALL metal),  it took a short while to get accustomed to a hard-plastic underbody.&lt;br /&gt;That said,  I would recommend this to all shavers.</li>
    <li> very nice razor - for a butterfly style. it seats the blade well - little sideways slippage. although it feels light, the handle is easy to grip. surprisingly  nice shave for the money. nicely made, but may not survive too many drops.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this razor as a decent lightweight razor to take traveling. Unfortunately it has a fundamentally flawed design. There are little pieces of plastic at the corners which extend higher than the curved metal part. The result is that these piece scrape against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is intentional in order to guide me to use the correct angle? If so, they should have included some very salient documentation explaining this.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Feather Double Edge Shaver Razor...It is the closest shave ever - I may try it on my legs</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Merkur, but still decent quality. Made in Japan trumps China and Taiwan for sure, but they can&#x27;t make them this cheap without a plastic handle... If it were metal, then 5 stars, but I am totally happy with it. Just BS sure to adjust the blade angle by how tight the locking collar is, it may not need to be all the way down for your face type.</li>
    <li> good sellet, good shippinh, no bull, just boughy a merkur, this seems cheap in comparison. great starter. makes great for carrying</li>
    <li> This was my entry to wetshaving.  After about a week of practice, I was able to get a very close and comfortable shave with it, at least as good as the Gillette Fusion I had been using for years- but at MUCH lower cost (due to cartridge vs blade price difference).&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very easy to use, very easy to keep clean, and cheap enough that anybody can give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I also picked up a vintage Gillette open-comb razor, which is a joy to use, but gives a much milder shave.  The Gillette is less likely to cut me, but so far I just can&#x27;t get as close of shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am EXTREMELY pleased with this Feather.</li>
    <li> The razor is nice, but a little light. After prolonged use butterfly opening gets loose and could allow blades to shift position.</li>
    <li> The feather razor is light weight with very sharp durable blades. It gives a close shave every time and the blades really last.</li>
    <li> Takes a little practice, but I&#x27;m never going back to multiple blade razors. The bade glides effortlessly across my face without any of the tugging I have gotten used to with the five blade Gillette I have been using.</li>
    <li> I have a Feather Safety Razor and use Prorasor Shaving soap or sometimes Old Tayolors Almond shaving soap and hot water.  I love there razors. These to me are equal to quality as Feathers or maybe even alittle better.  These give great shave and last a week shaving everyday. I also tried Shark Chrome razors which are good but not as good as Feather or Astra. WIth any safety razor use a good quality shaving soap like Taylors or Prorasor and use hot water to rise face before lather and during shave to rinse blade.  Very easy to use. Dont let the reviews about how different it is to shave with these types of razors. Shave exactly the same way as your normal razor except use lighter pressure as these are more sharp. Takes only five seconds to put on a new blade and is very easy to do. Tip, spend the money and buy a shaving brush like a badger brush to bush on a good quality shaving soap.(to save time just run brush under hot water and dip ends of brush into the shaving soap and spin the brush around for a few seconds then apply to face. I don&#x27;t have time before work to mix up a bowel or mug or shaving soap.  This simple method works great at least for me.).</li>
    <li> Used once and have developed a rash, I believe was caused by this product, will never use again.</li>
    <li> The razor is great, but unlike other reviewers said, it is NOT made in Pakistan, its made in Japan, even better! The razor is super nice, well made and works like a champ. The Feather blades that come with it are another story, drop by local lumberyard and get some utility knife blades instead, they are sharper!!! The Feather blades SUCK! They barley last one shave and are not very sharp to start with ie the utility blade comment. I bought a huge pack of Astra blades based on another reviewer (THANKS!!!) and couldnt be happier, they last all week and are twice as sharp as Feather, just remember to watch out as they will cut you if you are nto careful, no more rush jobs or its chunks o TP on the face for sure.</li>
    <li> The razor I started with ,it will be  the one I go out on. The weight of the razor gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I love this razor I&#x27;ll never buy a Gillette again! the handle seems to be of a good quality for the cheap price. and then refill blades are cheap to buy. really sharp really smooth face when done, didn&#x27;t feel any pulling.</li>
    <li> Im new to de shaving and didnt know which one to get. Didnt want to get one too expensive or too cheap so decided on this razor. This is a great starter razor, its well constructed light not too heavy, the twist to open head is a nice feature and works well, you can wash the head off nice and easy.It comes with feather blades ,havent used them yet, used it with wilkerson sword blades and astra blades.Theyre both very good !! and give a nice shave! The razor feels very comfortable on the face, Im so glad that i got into de shaving , im saving money and im loving the shave lol! My  skin is sensitive and this razor glides through my face very nice! My suggestion shave right after a hot shower when the hairs are nice and soft, lather then start shaving, slowly and softly led the blade glide on youre face! again i used it with wilkerson sword and astra blades they both did a wonderful job! Again this razor is great and its all i need . wont be spending any money on anything fancier!</li>
    <li> This was my first DE Safety Razor, and I&#x27;ve owned it for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been mostly happy with it. For the price, this was an excellent investment that significantly improved my shaving regime. The plastic handle has not been an issue. It is sturdy, and somehow stays quite clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the plastic &#x27;base&#x27; of the razor head is extremely prone to soap scum and gunk. It&#x27;s mainly a cosmetic issue, but I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems keeping it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different brands of razor blades fit and perform differently in this razor. I now find myself looking for an adjustable razor as a replacement, to get better control on the aggressiveness of the razor. Not a problem with this razor, per se, but you may outgrow what this razor provides.</li>
    <li> I ordered both a Feather Double Edge and the Lord Premium L6.  I have been using both now for a couple weeks.  The Lord although cheaper is a much smoother and safer shave than this Feather.  The Feather is much too aggressive, it nicks no matter how careful, and my face burns after a shave.  The Lord L6 does not give this trouble.  I tried using the Feather blade that this razor comes with and a couple other blades, still the Feather is too aggressive.  Too bad because I really like the design and build of this razor and want to like it.  This will not be my goto razor.  I think there is a different razor for everyone, there are lots to choose from... we all have different face structures, beard thickness, and skin sensitivities..  So, on that this razor may be good for some, just not me.</li>
    <li> Great razor for 18 bucks. It cuts so mild that there is no razor burn at all and I&#x27;m using Feather blades. It falls a little short on the hollow of my neck, just over the jugulars. In those places I use an Edwin Jagger DE89 with Derby blades, that&#x27;s a great mid-aggressive razor and the perfect combo for me. I get a very close shave.</li>
    <li> It is OK. Given that it is a butterfly design, the head is too big for my taste and was a bit difficult for me to keep at the right angle. I prefer the razors with the handle that gets screwed on, they have a lower profile. But that&#x27;s all a personal preference.</li>
    <li> New to de shaving.  Started with a version of that micro touch razor.  Got this because of the longer handle.  Love it.  I always rinse clean and dry it after use and don&#x27;t store the blade in it between shaves.  I can see it lasting a good while.  Would like another for a backup.  Is is mostly plastic though and for that I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> As others have said I was tired of the $25 for a pack of technically superior bladesf modern shaving science. They work and perhaps a bit more forgiving than a safety razor. Take your time and you will learn to save blood free. This is a great razor and you can&#x27;t beat it for the money. I ordered a 30 count pack of replacement blades and have not yet had to open it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you will regret this purchase, just be careful and learn how to hold the razor based on your face and it&#x27;s contours.</li>
    <li> The razor was a good value and works as advertised. However, the handle and base are plastic and the razor feels too light and too short to be comfortable .</li>
    <li> The plastic razor guard is too flexible.  If you use this product to shave your neck area be prepared to donate blood.  The plastic guard flexibility allows the razor to shred your neck.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I used the old single edge safety razors.  Now wow..... I forgot how a great shave the old school method provides!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In new to this old school method go slow and you will love it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice cheap starter and/or travel razor. It has a great feel to it and works very well. The bottom edge is plastic ns slides every easily on your face. I switched to a german all metal one but it does not side as well as this one. I will keep the both and use this one as my traveler!</li>
    <li> This was my first try at a safety razor. It works really well, and there is no &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; really. It works almost the same way you use a standard disposable. The shave is a little less close, so it&#x27;s a bit more akin to a &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; shave, which suites me just fine. I had to check several stores before I found double-edge blades locally, but they are cheap to replace, so this is less expensive than even cheap disposables and it&#x27;s a better shave. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is not adjustable. I&#x27;ve read comments from others saying that their safety razor is adjustable. But this one works great where its fixed. Any closer and it would probably cut you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also works well on longer hair. So, if you&#x27;ve let certain areas go to long, this takes care of that hair quickly.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor and using it with a Feather blade is an excellent combination. This razor seems to be built very well and I like the twist open top.</li>
    <li> OK I was doing research as and discovered I&#x27;m paying over $100 a year for razors . not to mention that I get cut all the time and even though the multi blade razors don&#x27;t cut me as bad they pull hair and hurt. I bought this old style razor with 20 blades to try it out. so for 30 bucks I got a razor and almost two years worth of blades. It came yesterday and I tried it out this morning and I was AMAZED!!!!! It was the closest shave iv ever had and and for the first time ever I did not cut myself. Plus I get dry skin bad and it usually clogges up the multi blade ones bad however this one did not clog at all. I am very happy with it and just wanted to pass it along</li>
    <li> So far, this is all I could ask...the razor feels well made in spite of being mostly plastic, and I am getting wonderfully close shaves after not having wet-shaved in many, many years.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! This is a lite weight double edge razor that gives a nice close shave.It has a four inch handle so it will fit large  hands.The head of the razor that hold the blade is all stainless steel.The other thing that I like is that it comes with a plastic case so when you are done shaving  you have a place to put the razor. I buy just regular blades at Fred Meyers and they work just fine. Buying so called safety razors  and blades is just to costly and does not make good sense.You can&amp;#34;t go wrong with this razor and the price  is right, buy one.</li>
    <li> very good razor the handle is plastic but good quality better than i expected if you are used to using multi-blade razors like i am it will take some time getting used to, but grade to start out with.</li>
    <li> I have looked all over for the old fashioned double edge shaver-cause my guys say that&#x27;s the best shave!!  This razor is cheaper than the one advertised on TV -it&#x27;s like getting 2 for the price of one!!</li>
    <li> My first venture into safety razor shaving.  I am very satisfied.  Just as expected. Well made. Works well.</li>
    <li> Very well built and economical for those learning to shave with a safety razor</li>
    <li> Bought this after trying the all steel Merkur razor. Liked this better as it drags less than the steel. The shave might be slightly less close than the multi-blade razors but you sure can&#x27;t beat the price for the blades.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Only one blade came instead of two.</li>
    <li> I Have an Edwin Jagger de89 and a merkur futur and thought I&#x27;d try this inexpensive razor from feather because I&#x27;m a big fan of there blades.  Unfortunately this gave me the worse shave ever. I mean worse than disposable razors sold at the dollar store.  I gave it a few shots before angrily throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ll buy this again!</li>
    <li> After only two shaves I was impressed.  Great product and fast delivery.  Blades were great too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to add to my travel kit, so that I didnt end up leaving my more expensive Merkur DE razor in a hotel room in Muncie, IN or somewhere else.  However, this razor has become my daily driver.  I&#x27;m several months into shaving with DE razors (if you are a newbie, best piece of advise is to buy a sample pack of different types of blades) and it took me a bit to become comfortable with the Merkur...and to be honest, I can still nick myself on occasion.  This feather razor had no such learning curve.  I can whip this thing around just like a cartridge razor!  You will note that the majority of this razor is plastic, and perhaps be turned off, but don&#x27;t be!  This is a high quality item.  It may not look as cool as an all metal DE, but man it gets the job done perfectly!</li>
    <li> Used a blade, and the next day wanted to use it again, but it just wasn&#x27;t as sharp,and it dragged too much. Turned the blade over in the razor, and it was worse. Followed all the directions and advice fromother people that bought this blade, but no such success. Went back to my old five blade razor.</li>
    <li> I am a newbie to the safety razor. I 38. I decided to step my game up and become a man. I was scared about trying something too expensive as I didnt want to invest in something that I may not follow through with. Behold the 15.99 product I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the lightweight yet, heavy duty feel to this razor. It&#x27;s simple to use and provides a plastic display case that has holes to allow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the real review. The Feather brand razors (2 included) are NO JOKE. These things could take the fur off a gnat&#x27;s butt! If you are like me and believe you have to have some pressure to get a great shave, please be prepared to dial it back. These are simply sharp! Overall, I am completely satisfied with this product. I have also ordered 50 more feather razor refills. Yep, they are that good.</li>
    <li> I started using disposables 30 years ago after I dropped my safety razor on the floor and broke it.  Takes me a while to figure out what I&#x27;m missing, but thought I&#x27;d try this  (reasonable price, good reviews, liked the design) and am glad I did:  much closer shave with less pressure and effort, easier to clean between shaving strokes, and will probably end up being cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor.  Like many looking for alternative to the cost of the current standard razor &amp;#34;Triple diple&amp;#34; market products.  This has worked well, take a little time and the shave is good and not a bloody sacrifice like the market tells you that it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company was good with quick shipping and a quality product.  Have not used any others to compare but happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have done this earlier. Some things don&#x27;t get better with time. Multi-bladed shavers are one of them. So let me state this clearly: With just one blade, my face is SMOOTH.</li>
    <li> I first found out about this online via youtube. I have been shaving with Gilette, Schick and other brands but things have gotten so expensive I figure I go &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and see what&#x27;s it all about, to date this has been the tightest shave. Now I don&#x27;t use a mug and shave lather I use shaving oils instead. It took me awhile to figure out how to shave with it via watching youtube and since it does not have the facial ergonomics of the modern razer blade it may be too retro for some. However, when I shaved with it and then shaved with the modern razer there is a noticeable difference. This is just tighter and I do cut myself nearly every time I shave but I use a ALUM BLOCK - it really works well. I got some Japanese made blades and I am good to go. If your willing to put the time into yourself this is a excellent investment and will go a long way.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting something a little different than what I received. The razor itself is really nice and is just as advertised. It is just not for me.</li>
    <li> It functions very well and was well priced, but I found it a bit light for me. I find a heavier 3 piece&amp;#34; safety razor to work much better and shaves my beard easier.</li>
    <li> The two-sided razor design looks old-fashioned, but ideally suited for shaving.  Most modern razors are overkill, with their over-priced multiple blades which are bad for the skin.  For around two dollars you can buy a pack of around ten straight razors which are often better sharpened then most disposables.  In addition, if your anything like me and put off shaving for any great length of time, the razor&#x27;s housing can be opened to wash out the hair and prevent clogging.  Try that with a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt; Although there is a lot of plastic in its construction, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made.  The long handle gives excellent control, and the contact with the skin is, pardon the pun, “Feather” light.  It is probably true you may not get as close a shave as some might prefer, but I personally like a very close shave.  Use this with a few drops of Shave Secret and you&#x27;ll have the best shave of your life.  Comes in a plastic carrying case and with two free razors.</li>
    <li> Comparing this to my very expensive Merkur Vision 2000, I&#x27;ll take the plastic Feather any day of the week. While I&#x27;d like to be able to afford the all-stainless Feather, the plastic one works perfectly, and I can&#x27;t imagine any razor doing any better. I&#x27;ve used mine with both Feather blades and the generic drugstore blades, and performance is absolutely top-notch. I use Proraso pre/post shave cream and shaving cream. with an Omega bristle brush or a Dovo/Merkur silvertip badger brush. I&#x27;m buying a second to put in my travel kit, and will probably never use the Vision again. I could have bought five of the Feather for what I paid for the Merkur Vision, and given the other three as gifts. I don&#x27;t miss the adjustability of the Vision at all; the Feather is perfect for me, and much easier to handle because of its lighter weight.</li>
    <li> I have not used this type of razor in 40 years. Getting sick of the multi-blade prices and curious about trying one of these old style units again. From the reviews on this, I was looking forward to a good unit even at this low price.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it on and off for 3 weeks I have to say the blades are really sharp but the unit is useless. Before it arrived in the mail I started off a bit worried about cuts but the problem I have is just the opposite. I can vary the angle any which way but the only way it will actually shave me at all is if I press it rather hard against my skin. My beard just plain does not get cut.&lt;br /&gt;I have given up on this unit. I may try an adjustable unit in the future - like the 6 way adjustable I remember from all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I check out the other reviews as I write this I see mention of \\&quot;too mild\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, money down the drain.</li>
    <li> Cheapest brand name handle. I love it. I don&#x27;t have other de razors to compare it to. I have bought a sample pack of blades to try. Seriously, feather is the sharpest by a far margin. I am not sure whether I will go as far as to say they are not usable, but you need technique to use them right. You cannot apply any pressure or you will exfoliate your skin by taking the top layer off. If you want to start using de blades, and you don&#x27;t want to waste money or invest in $30 or $50 or $100+ handles, you will not be disappointed in this handle. I thought I would not like the plastic handle, I thought I wanted a heavy sexy looking metal handle. I was wrong, this looks cool, and it is perfectly balanced and light.</li>
    <li> Finally found the razor for me!! I&#x27;ve been on a quest. When your trying to find the PERFECT razor that you can shave with that gives you no irritation and then you FINALLY find it!! It&#x27;s like NIRVANA!! I know it&#x27;s plastic. A lot of things are plastic. My laptop I&#x27;m using right now is 98% plastic. The plastic does not worry me. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to be tossing it around the bathroom! The important parts are stainless steel. The head that holds the blade. Look into the Feather company and you&#x27;ll find out they make some of the worlds best surgical tools for the operating room. No wonder they can make a awesome razor and the sharpest blade in the world! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. This is a excellent razor!</li>
    <li> The DE shaver is a great one for beginners or forest timers, looking to see if they would like to get more into the hobby or this shaving aspect. It was my first and I am totally hooked. The shave is like none other. I would recommend this, and feather blades are a must as well.</li>
    <li> IF you want the good old days then here it is.  I just wanted to hang onto the way it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Still works well and I still cut myself.</li>
    <li> This was my first Safety Razor that I ever used. And it is well worth the money to get away from the expensive cartridge razors. IT took a little getting use to, don&#x27;t push hard at all! Let it glide across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have this one but I have recently received a valentines day gift from my wife that is a chrome plated razor so I have moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting this to anyone who is thinking about getting into straight razors.</li>
    <li> Slow down your shaving a little and you can&#x27;t beat this razor.  Close shave, blades are inexpensive. What else do you need?</li>
    <li> I paid $20 for my Feather Popular razor and it is a very good quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be mislead by the reviews that say it&#x27;s a good &amp;#34;Starter&amp;#34; razor.&lt;br /&gt;Yes there are more expensive razors out there, but cost doesn&#x27;t always mean quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather is a good long term razor, well made and with quality precision construction.&lt;br /&gt;Yes parts of it are plastic, but not the cheap plastic that comes to mind when someone says the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that might be an issue is that Double Edge Razors and blades are an extremely personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;A Razor and blade that gives one person a  comfortable and a good shave, can be torture for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this  Feather razor it came with Feather DE Blades, and the shave was awful, left my face red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Changed the blade to an Astra and it was a perfectly smooth and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t be discouraged if any Razor you buy (for any price) doesn&#x27;t give you the shave you expected, experiment with different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the price of the Feather Razor, it&#x27;s a quality razor and can give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;For me it will be a long term razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 2016. I bought this to try DE shaving, planning to replace it with something better. But I&#x27;ve now used this Feather razor for 2 years. Still gives a great shave. No need to buy anything else.</li>
    <li> First shave with a wet razor in years, blade alignment looks perfect, opted for this razor because reviews said it wasn&#x27;t too aggressive and not too heavy. I bought the derby blades and Proraso Shaving Soap shaved with very light pressure let the razor do the work, no nicks and a closer shave than my triple blade Gillette.It came with two Feather blades but the reviews about how sharp they are  scared me. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the Derby.</li>
    <li> it is great razor. its my first time using it, i cut myself couple of times, but stlil great! recommended</li>
    <li> It is not a shave you can rush, but it is the closest shave I have ever gotten- bar none.  I am getting quite good at not knicking my scalp as well.  The adams apple is still tricky.  I recommend it unreservedly for anyone who is tired of squandering a fortune on twin/triple blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and this is a great starting razor in my opinion. There was a learning curve but it is short if you have some manual shaving experience to begin with.  The main thing is to not press the razor to your face like the cartridge razors.  Let the razor do the work.</li>
    <li> A Great razor, cheap, worth every penny and then some.  A close shave even on the 2nd and 3rd day.</li>
    <li> This razor will surprise you in many ways. Being inexpensive you would think it would not be well made but think again it&#x27;s made in Japan where they make some of the best tools. It doesn&#x27;t have the heft of some of the higher priced razors but it&#x27;s long handle gives you ample control and shaving with ease.</li>
    <li> -I mainly got this because of the plastic box so I can travel with it. The razor will not move at all in while in the box, and the compartment for a case of blades is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Note: this is a very mild razor. It&#x27;s impossible to acutely nick yourself with this razor. So this produces a tendency to push down harder when shaving since it feels so benign... but this will give you fine cuts and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t worry that some parts of it is made of plastic. It&#x27;s actually a dense, very solid feeling high grade polymer. Also, while this is definitely in the light weight category, the whole razor has got some weight to it that is nice (it won&#x27;t feel like a child&#x27;s happy meal toy made in China in your hand).</li>
    <li> As described. I wanted to get back to wet shaving with a double-edged safety razor and this is right product to start with.</li>
    <li> For the price this razor excited my expectations . Shave very well it is however a little on the light side but over all a very nice razor .</li>
    <li> Got this as my first razor to get into DE shaving. I think this is a great product for anyone looking to get into DE shaving. Yes the handle is made of plastic, and it doesn&#x27;t have that crazy cool knurling, and blah, blah, blah. Its a super affordable and if you don&#x27;t like shaving with it its not like your out 50 bucks. If you take care of this razor and make sure to clean and dry it off after use it will last forever, basically.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I&#x27;m never going back to shaving another way. At first I was incredulous because it&#x27;s plastic- but after getting it, and holding it in my hands- you can feel there&#x27;s a bit of weight to it. It feels substantial in your hands and it balances well during shaving.</li>
    <li> With feather blades this thing is a god-send - thick, fast growing beard hairs and an easy to irritate neck, this thing, along with a brush and some soap has completely changed how I shave. Non irritating, fast and smooth.... I&#x27;ve owned every major brand of conventional razor and I also have top-end foil and rotary razors from Braun and Norelco. Long live the feather DE razor.</li>
    <li> The best double edge razor. I was skeptical at first being that the handle is made from plastic and thought it might feel cheap but for the price I thought I might give it a shot. This was my first double edge razor and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a fancy razor for fear that I wasn&#x27;t going to like shaving with a double edge. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a gillet fusion and the blades were starting to get real expensive and a friend of mine recommend me a double edge razor and said the blades are real inexpensive. Once it arrived the quality felt real good. It didn&#x27;t feel like a cheap plastic razor. Its well built and it opens smooth to add or replace your razor. It comes in a plastic case as well to store it away. Comes with two feather razors. The blades along with the razor gave me a smooth shave. Didn&#x27;t leave any bumps or razor burns. Its shaves awesome. If you want a quality shave and a great razor without spending allot of cash, this is it. The blades are so inexpensive and last quite a bit and are very inexpensive. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed no where near as close a shave as my Gillette disposable. Wish I had my money back.</li>
    <li> I own the much more expensive Feather AS-D2 razor (among many other razors) and love it, but thought this one might be nice for travel.  It seems to be a nice mild razor and decently made for the price.  The TTO works well enough and it&#x27;s a bit light, but shaves nicely enough.  I have a fairly thick beard, but with a sharp blade and several passes this gets the job done nicely.  Not as special as the AS -D2, but for about 1/10th the price it&#x27;s nice enough.</li>
    <li> I got my razor today in the mail I went a week with out shaving to give it a good test this thing is amazing. I been using a Gillette 1962 slim and this 20 dollar feather blows it out of the water has good weight and a quality build.</li>
    <li> This razor is incredibly light and cheap feeling.  Being a Gillette Super Speed user I&#x27;m accustom to allowing the weight of the razor to do the work, but this razor doesn&#x27;t have the heft that the Gillette has.  The shave is no where near the quality of the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep my Gillette and donate this one to the Salvation Army.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> These blades are very good quality. They perform as advertised. I will continue to buy this brand razors.</li>
    <li> Very mild razor. Cant expect much more. Quality build, but its vastly plastic construction. Would spring for the Edwin Jagger if I had to do it all over again.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor after using electric and disposable blades. The first time I used this, I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is light, but appears to be well made. The plastic handle has a nice texture to provide a grip. The cutting head is balanced and holds the blade evenly and securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades themselves are very sharp. I was almost shocked at just how sharp they were. The drawback here seems to be blade life. I got 4 very comfortable, nick-free shave. The 5th was not so good, but I thought it might have been user error. Tried again, and it was even worse. Four shaves seems a like a short blade life, especially given how expensive the Feather blades are compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the combo is a good value if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor and to this day I still reach for it when I&#x27;m in a rush since the butterfly mechanism is so easy to use quickly.  Some people may not care for the plastic handle but it feels just fine to me.  The metal parts seem to be made of surprisingly resilient stainless steel.  I also use a Merkur &amp;#34;1904&amp;#34; (much heavier and much smaller) these days but the feather is a great product to learn DE shaving on and the case is handy for use when traveling.  Be sure to clean it periodically!</li>
    <li> Have an Edwin Jagger to compare this purchase. The Edwin Jagger gives a closer shave and fewer nicks. Used the same blades and shaving cream with both. I would say the Edwin Jagger is worth the extra cost just wish it had the handle length and heft of the Feather.</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality razor, feels heavy and substancial in the hand, after years of using plastic disposible razors. I started shaving with this style razor many years ago, took a few days for the touch to come back.....go slow and look for the sweet spot.The angle where it cuts closest....going too fast is to risk nicks.  Good Service, delivered quicker than promised.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who spends wayyy too much on disposable razors... ok, maybe I&#x27;m just a cheap wife! I saw an ad around Christmas for safety razors as gifts, so I bought this for my husband. This is a great, cheap beginner&#x27;s double edge razor. It is made of mostly plastic, so it is cheap, but it is heavier than most disposables. Most men who try safety razors don&#x27;t return to disposables, except for those few men who prefer a quick 5 minute shave to a close 15 minute shave. But if you are a cheap person like me, or have/are a reallly stubborn guy (boyfriend/husband), it won&#x27;t be a waste of money if he tosses it.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and btw, the razor comes with 2 Feather razor blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price! Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Philips Norelco electric shaver I had bought at a local store and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with. And to be honest with you, this was worth every penny. It arrived a few days ago and I was very happy with the results; by far, the best and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. And for $12 (I had some Amazon points)? This just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect razor for someone who is considering entering the world of wet shaving.  This safety razor does everything that the popular $40 razors do.  Plus, it has a long handle like most people are used to (from cartridge razors), that only a select few models of safety razors feature.  It only includes two blades, but if you do your research, you will find that the Feather Hi Stainless blades are widely considered one of the best (if not the best) and sharpest (if not the sharpest) blades on the market. The razor comes in a two piece box with a clear plastic cover that is hinged on a white plastic back.  I have not invested in a razor stand, largely because this box does a respectable job as a stand.</li>
    <li> This razor has a long plastic handle that is very sturdy while being light weight. The razor does a fine job, just have to learn not to bear down too hard (and no need with a sharp blade). It won&#x27;t skin you but it will make a raw place. Just use light pressure and it shaves really close. Oh and I don&#x27;t think much of the quality of the sample blades so make sure you buy some good blades.</li>
    <li> about what I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female and I use this razor. It&#x27;s nice and gets the job done. My husband has the Merkur which I&#x27;ve tried a few times. I think I prefer that one more. This one seems much lighter, as if you have to put a little more work in it. But it shaves well, the blades that come with it are nice. I&#x27;ve nicked myself maybe once or twice, but nothing serious. This is a nice starter blade, but I plan to move up when I get tired of this one.</li>
    <li> This is the first kind of safety razor I ever owned. I started shaving with this safety razor about a year ago (im 30) and this razor was my gateway to the world of shaving like a real man. No more razor burn or ingrown hairs! I&#x27;ve since moved on to a Edwin Jagger but still take my feather when I work offshore.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. It&#x27;s lovely to have a light weight razor, instead of my heavy chrome/brass based ones. Makes it very easy to handle, especially since you&#x27;re dealing with Feather blades, the sharpest blades you can get!</li>
    <li> If you prefer to shave with a double edge blade, this is the only razor to buy.  Of course, that&#x27;s only my opinion, but I&#x27;ve been shaving since the 1950s and tried most solutions. Feather is very light and has a handle length which is comfortable.  The Japanese blades are exceptional and maintain an edge. The clever use of plastics allows the razor to &#x27;glide&#x27; more readily than most (except for the occasional gold plated razors of the past). I think it&#x27;s best to be a little careful with a double edge razor, but that&#x27;s always been the case.  I&#x27;ve tried the others, but comeback to the older approach.  At the price, try one and see if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.  I&#x27;m confident that you&#x27;ll prefer it.</li>
    <li> Okay so I have waited to write a review.. sometimes a product impresses me but i don&#x27;t take the time to actually write a review.. but this one is worthy of the effort. I am latino.. and i have curly.. so i an prone to getting ingrown hairs.. for YEARS i have conformed to simply accepting the fact that i will always have a mediocre or crappy shave... but i finally decided to research.. and i discovered DE razors.. and i can tell you i have never had a smoother shave and smoother face.. for black men, or anyone who has curly hair and are prone to ingrowns.. this is a must. I have also adopted the use of an alum bar.. it is amazing.. all these products i&#x27;ve never heard of.. are so much cheaper.. and have an amazing result. THe alum bar has eliminated the use of after shave entirely.. i am saving money.. having a better shave.. and using less products. The price of this DE is so cheap.. the quality could be better.. but for the price and the result who can complain? Amazing product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to share a few things that have worked for me: It is ESSENTIAL to exfoliate daily.. once i started to exfoliate, even before DE razors.. the quality of my shaves drastically improved simply because there was less dirt on my face. Also, i use this menthol eucalyptus shaving cream.. it is essential to lather very well.. it allows you to go against the grain and get a better shave. The alum bar.. which i never heard of before.. is so amazing.. it&#x27;s so cheap.. and it will last you so long.. it is the best way to top off your shave.</li>
    <li> Got tired of disposable razors which do not last long. Even though I cut myself more, this is better. Razor refill boxes are available at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Works well, no shipping damage.</li>
    <li> After years of using multi blade disposables in the shower the urge for something better came over me.  My wife had three straight razors left by her grandad and I began to investigate.  What I found was lots of info on straight razors and old double edge Gillette razors that were selling for an arm and a leg and articles and blogs by people who seemed to approach shaving as a ceremony more than a necessity with prices that to me could only be justified as the price to pay for spiritual enlightenment.  No thanks.  My practical side decided to look at Amazon and I settled on the Feather Double-Edge Razor because I did not want to disassemble and reassemble 3 pieces each time I changed the blade and the price was not excessive.  Call me lazy, frugal or both.  Also, my Gillette from many years ago was the same style.  The combination plastic/metal construction concerned me at first but is no concern now after a month of daily use.  The razor is quite easy to adjust to and the plastic handle may even be better as it does not slip when wet.  My daily shave has been removed from the shower to the sink and is better than I have experienced in years.  Another reviewer expressed concerns that the blade did not seat evenly in the razor and exposure was unequal.  I have not noticed that with any of my blades in this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 because of the blades that came with it, not the razor.  The razor is great.  The blades also are excellent, just not suited to my skin.  I found that the Feather Hi-Stainless Blades left my face smooth but burning.  I used the two that came with the razor but have changed to the Wilkinson Sword Classics from Amazon.  There is no burning post shave until the blade is about a week old.  After shave stings a bit toward the end of the week, but nothing excessive.  Sunday is blade change day and if I decide to change twice a week, blades are dirt cheap compared to the multi blades and the shave closer and more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone with a average beard as it does not seem to be overly aggressive.  Those with very heavy beards may want something else but I&#x27;m certainly not the one to speak on that.&lt;br /&gt;Given the choice I will never shave with a multi blade razor again.  I also purchased brush and soap so perhaps I am headed for that ceremonial level.  Nah, but it does feel good.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  February 2013.  After two months using this razor in combination with the Wilkinson Sword blades I can honestly say that the process of shaving has gotten even easier.  I cannot remember when in the past I would look forward to shaving.  That is the case now.  The Feather DE razor is holding up well, easy to clean after each shave and the blades last at least 10 shaves and remain comfortable.  I run my hand across my face at some point in the day and smile at the comfort and smoothness.  I changed the star rating to 5 stars based on the razor/blade combination I am now using, the Feather razor with Wilkinson Sword Stainless blades.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting this thing to be almost totally made of plastic, but leave it to those clever Japanese folks to design something that&#x27;s so damn nice out of a relatively common material that works like a million bucks. Worth every cent, and then double it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for beginners to getting out of mainstream shaving. The amount of money and discomfort saved when jumping over to double edged shaving is astounding.</li>
    <li> U think is cheap but is not is a high quality material it gave me a good shave</li>
    <li> I just had my first shave with a double edge using this razor.  As a rookie I chose this razor, which is reported to be very gentle, and paired with a Derby blade, also reported to be gentle.  I have a fairly heavy beard, and many issues with irritation and bumps.  I did a lot of research on technique, etc.  Anyway, using this combo, some shaving oil, and starting out with a very clean face, I enjoyed the best shave ever.  I went very slow, and was very careful.  And my skin is much smoother than any shave before with no irritation.  No cuts.  I am frankly astonished by this.  Very happy with this razor.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Very nice razor.  Well made considering it&#x27;s made of plastic and metal.  Put a Feather blade in it and it will shave close or closer than many more expensive razors.  Very well designed razor.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to the DE blade, minor nicks here and there, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good weight, easy to clean.  I would recommend this razor</li>
    <li> Im 66 i havent shaved with this type in a lot of years. Worried how it will hold up because of plastic parts but it seems just great so far, opens to put in blades easily. Ill let u know if it dont hold up.</li>
    <li> Just got my first Feather Double Edge Razor today, and it &#x27;s a good razor. Will this be my last Feather Razor? No. Damn good product for the price. will be buying another one real soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to buy a more expensive razor that I might or might not like. I&#x27;m coming from Gillette, Schick, and Dorco razors. I switched to DE razor to save money on blades. The feather blade is too sharp for me and I keep getting small cuts on my neck area. But the razor seems sturdy and I can&#x27;t wait to try different blades on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many others have pointed out, this is a non-aggressive razor, meaning it&#x27;s fairly hard to cut yourself with this razor. But the blade is still damn too sharp for a beginner. I would suggest to others that if this is going to be your first DE razor, I would buy other blades at the same time so that you are not stuck using Feather blades to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with DE shaving. I just wanted to save money, but it turns out to be quite more fun than regular cartridge shaving anyways. It&#x27;s taking me longer than usual to shave now but that&#x27;s because I have to be extra careful with Feather blade. As I get used to DE shaving, I don&#x27;t think time consumption will be much of an issue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 30+ yrs since I used a Double Edge Razor, &amp; I did cut myself a couple of times...but after I got the touch back, this is the way to go.  Yes, the Razor has a plastic handle but for $ 17 bucks, did you expect black Rhino horn?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problem with the head or the butterfly closure coming loose during shaving as some have posted, just seat the blade properly &amp; snug the butterfly up.  I do remove the blade, carefully wipe it dry as well as the razors head.  Just like surgical equipment.  Easy clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy!  Adios to those expensive razors &amp; their out of their mind refill blades!</li>
    <li> Razor works great, its finding good blades I have a problem with..Seems like all I find are dull blades that pull..instead of cutting.</li>
    <li> i got into wet shaving about 9 months ago, as i was tired of spending a load of cash on disposable cartridges. after doing a decent amount of research on amazon, i chose this feather razor, a bulk package of feather hi-stainless blades, after shave lotion, shaving soap, and pre-shave cream from proraso, a brush from tweezerman and a steel brush stand. total investment: about $75. here we are, nearly 9 months later, and i have not spent a dime on any other shaving accessories, creams, etc. i was spending $18 a month on cartridges before. needless to say, i&#x27;m pleased with the cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am also very pleased with the shave quality. after a couple bloody shaving sessions, i started to get the hang of it, and have since developed a very enjoyable and fruitful shaving habit. the inclusion of the feather razor in that habit is a big part of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;being new to wet shaving, i spent some time playing around with the razor. i would twist the butterfly mechanism closed so far that the blade would be completely bent in against the head, which did not provide a very close shave. i would twist it open to the point that the blade lay flat and loose inside the head, and the shave would tear up my rough face. eventually i settled on a position where the blade would be slightly bent, and i get a great shave each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the razor has held up so far just fine. all the parts still function correctly, and i have not had any issues with corrosion or deterioration. all the plastic bits are still fully intact as well. i have noticed that the razor likes to collect soap scum, but with a bit of scrubbing on it once a week or so, it remains pretty clean and doesn&#x27;t suffer from build-up. since this is my first razor, i cannot offer comparisons to others. however, this razor could stand to be a bit heavier. i can see how a heavier razor would offer better balance and smoother operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only real gripe with this razor is in the butterfly mechanism. it is very easy to adjust, to the point where it adjusts too easily. i find myself having to close it back down just a bit every few minutes, because it tends to work its way loose over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said, i still definitely recommend this razor for the budget-conscious consumer. i may upgrade to something a bit heavier and more expensive after a year with this one, but i see no reason that one cannot get by with only this razor from feather. i will keep using this one as my only razor, and will probably keep it as a backup / travel razor if i do decide to upgrade next year.m. it is very easy to adjust, to the point where it adjusts too easily. i find myself having to close it back down just a bit every few minutes, because it tends to work its way loose over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said, i still definitely recommend this razor for the budget-conscious consumer. i may upgrade to something a bit heavier and more expensive after a year with this one, but i see no reason that one cannot get by with only this razor from feather. i will keep using this one as my only razor, and will probably keep it as a backup / travel razor if i do decide to upgrade next year.</li>
    <li> The Feather DE razor is made of some hard Bakelite kind of plastic and some metal. I can&#x27;t attest to how long it will last - although it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made at all - but I can say that it works brilliantly and simply. The butterfly open makes blade cleaning/changing a breeze. There&#x27;s something about the cutting angle of the blade produced by this razor against the skin that makes this razor rock. I have used it with Feather, Wilkinson, and Personna DE blades and it works excellently with any of these blades. Although the razor feels lightweight, it is not necessary to use much pressure against your skin; a good, sharp blade and a good lather will do the job admirably.</li>
    <li> After having used Feather blades for years, I saw this razor for sale and decided to try it along with the blades. Fantastic !&lt;br /&gt;The blades are held in snugly and the shave is very close and smooth. I really like this product</li>
    <li> Perfect razor alignment very smooth shaving polymer construction for better or worse. Solid construction should last forever with careful use.</li>
    <li> I have felt stuck with very expensive 3,4, or 5, blade units. I figured I have nothing to loose trying this one. It&#x27;s great. Easy to clean, load and unload, handle is very comfortable and it does the job very well. Thank You</li>
    <li> Just a couple days ago I came up with the idea I need something better than these modern gillette razors to shave with, so I did a little research, and man am I glad I went with a de razor (ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS THIS ONE RIGHT HERE). I&#x27;m a young gun, 21, and so this is a brand new experience for me to be shaving with de razors. I&#x27;ve read a bunch of reviews and watched youtube videos about the possible nicks and cuts you can cause yourself with a de so I was kind of worried about butchering my face up.   Got this bad boy in the mail today, hopped in the shower, lathered my face up, and went to work. It felt like I had a tool from the heavens in my hand gliding across my face. I seriously did not expect my first shave to go this smooth with a de, and I ended up going against the grain (which I stopped doing a while ago with that useless fusion since all those blades were just pulling way too much), and it came out to be one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever given myself. Cheeks were smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, and the irritation wasn&#x27;t a problem at all. Just threw on a little Brut and some moisturizer and all was good. If a first timer like myself can use this thing without any cuts at all, anybody can. The whole process took a little longer than my usual shave, but it was my first time and I wanted to be extra careful. But the smooth shave is definitely worth the extra time and patience, trust me. Feather blades and this razor make one awesome combination. It&#x27;s just amazing how good this is, and it&#x27;s only my first day...I have much to learn.   If your even thinking about buying this, go ahead and make that purchase, you won&#x27;t regret it for $20 or so out your pocket.</li>
    <li> After a several months of use, parts of the plastic body started to turn white and one of the doors that held the razor began to show wear. It was still perfectly usable and provided a good shave, but I tossed it before its condition got any worse. I replaced it with a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to stay within the &amp;lt;$20 range, try finding a vintage safety razor. The price ranges vary wildly, but you can likely find something like a nice Gillette Super Speed for ~$15.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any other safety razors to compare this too, but compared to the Fusion razors I have been using it is wonderful.  I am using it with a 100 pack of Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades.  I know a lot of people suggest going with a variety pack to find the one that suits your bead, and all, but I am not picky, and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do urge newcomers to safety razors to er on the side of caution though, because on my second day of using the razor I started going a little fast, and cut my upper lip.  Slow, and steady seems to be the way to shave with this, but I knew that before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it has plastic pieces it in no way feels cheap or flimsy.  This razor is solid, and well built.  I have a feeling I will be using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great value if you are looking to give DE shaving a try. Handle is a little long for me, I bought a Weber Bulldog and gave this one to my brother in law to wean him off the &#x27;&#x27;Cartridge money train&#x27;&#x27;. Screw paying $25 for 5 cartridges when you can get 100 Bluebird or Shark blades for $15 and shave for a year.</li>
    <li> Just look at the price and that should tell you this razor is not very good. Only used this razor once-and-done (even used a Feather blade in it).  I would much rather spend my money on a Jagger, Merkur, or Muhle and have a great shave.  Only have one face - gotta take care of it right.</li>
    <li> great quality shaver. highly recommended and company shipped and packaged product early. thank you.</li>
    <li> I only like minimal aggressiveness that will take off your beard.  I think anymore than that will just cause discomfort. The Feather Popular is not that aggressive but it seems to get the job done for me. I didn&#x27;t even try the Feather blade because I was afraid of it. What I used was the Derby blade. I also just lathered up twice. I cut with the grain &amp; sideways. I have been getting ingrown hairs so I would like to clear those up first. So far they are cleared up. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was getting the ingrown hairs from my electric razor. Maybe my cutters were getting to dull. Everybody is different, that&#x27;s why I said how aggressive. The only other thing I can say is I tried the D/E razor from reading the Amazon reviews on shaving problems.    I had to update this product. I have tried other razors after this one &amp; liked some of them. I tried a Parker 22r. This one is angle sensitive. 20 deg. is better than 30 deg. I tried Merkur 25c. To aggressive for me. I tried the Mehaz very good but I had trouble getting the BBS shave after awhile. maybe to mild for my whiskers. Anyway when I would get upset with with my shave I would try something else. I also work on my routine. I have tried many blades soaps creams post aftershaves oils preshave. What works for me with the simplest routine is shower wash my face with Irish spring bar soap rinse wash again leaving it on my face churn up my Vader Hagen. This is a butter cutting shave. After 3 years or so I had to edit this review for this razor. Also I am using Persona reds, Vikings Dorcos. I could go on &amp; on about this razor but I will stop now.</li>
    <li> Better than my Lord (cheap, Egyptian), nowhere near as good as my old Gillette Slim Adjustable.</li>
    <li> This razor has put an end to my \\&quot;Razor Acquisition Disorder\\&quot; (RAD).  It is very light, but very well made.  I get a perfect shave with very little effort and zero irritation.  Don&#x27;t bother spending more on &#x27;higher end&#x27; razors, this one is all you need.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin, like many others.  almost always, I had to replace my Gillette M3 every 2nd shave.  And, the throat area still got irritated nearly every time, no mater what I did.  I have tried nearly all types of razors and shaving creams on the market, with Gillette M3 and Nevia Shaving giving me the best possible comfort for past few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, about a year ago, came across traditional shaving cream with Brush video.  Replaced my Nevia with Proraso Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol and fealt better, still with irritation and changing blade every other shave.  Kept digging on you tube and came across this razor.  Bought it and have used it for over two weeks.  It came with two blades.  Tried using same blade 2nd time and same irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered a box of Personna blades and now use one blade one time only.  No issue of irritation since last few shaves,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, there is definitely a learning curve for these types of razors.  But its worth it from comfort and economical point of view.  I shave on average of 4 times a week, with just the difference in blade cost, that&#x27;s few hundred dollars in savings.</li>
    <li> Decided to try DE way of shaving. So much work...nuh..going back to fusion.</li>
    <li> Works great! Close shave.</li>
    <li> this was a gift and he liked it</li>
    <li> Great razor for a good value.  Best razor for the price!</li>
    <li> Got tired of looking in stores or garage sales for a safety razor. The vendor item is as described.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for maintaining a beard - no more clogged razors.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to rinse and clean but, most importantly, it gives a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Ok as your first double edge razor.</li>
    <li> Very light shaves good, good for beginners you can&#x27;t cut yourself with it used it one time but like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, shaves are superior, well built razor, good price.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  I like it better than the heavy metal razors - I had a Parker and it was a bit hard to use, and the first time it fell, it bent!  This one is nice and light and does a great job shaving!</li>
    <li> Great everyday shaver.</li>
    <li> I decided to make the switch from cartridge shaving to DE shaving back in July, and this is the first razor handle I bought. So far, it&#x27;s the only one that I own, and I can say that it has stood up to the test of time and usage so far. I&#x27;ve used this thing just as much as I&#x27;ve ever used my Mach 3, and while I&#x27;ve changed the blades out several times (you can change blades like 30 times and only then meet the cost of 1 Mach 3 blade) the handle has neither broken nor has the finish faded. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this handle, and if you&#x27;re reading this I definitely recommend that you give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is my first de razor.  I used it for the first time today.  WOW,  what a great shave.  I do not have any reference point for comparison but this is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m using Gillette Silver Blue blades and had a wonderful shaving experience.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m in love with this product it&#x27;s very good easy to use and change the blade. i have sensitive skin and the safety razor made it very easier for me.</li>
    <li> I tried using this for a couple of months and just didn&#x27;t get it.  Using this takes a special touch that I don&#x27;t have.  I went through the whole ritual for preparing you face for shaving as recommended and using a good pre shave oil and shave soap and still cut the heck out of my face on many days. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed but after a couple of shaves I am blown away. People get scared that they will nick themselves with this type of razor but let me tell you that I am not an expert shaver and have yet to draw any kind of blood. It gets as close as you could possibly want. I may never go back to regular disposable razors or the overpriced Schick Hydro 5.</li>
    <li> After buying triple edge refills for years (at over 20 bucks a pop) I decided to try this out, remember my Dad using one like this when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, and a great shave. I also bought [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]] so I&#x27;ll be set for a while, saving money is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Solidly built twist to open (TTO) safety razor. Its mostly plastic, with the head being mostly metal. Make no mistake its finely made. It also comes with a sturdy plastic travel case and two awesome, but not for beginners Feather razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the only peeve I kinda have is the blade exposure; its too mild for my face. I grow stubble throughout the day, and have a full beard in about 4. However, I shave with it nearly everyday so no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Its reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;* The handle is long. ( Big plus in my book)&lt;br /&gt;* Very forgiving razor, will not cut you unless you disrespect it.&lt;br /&gt;* Quality materials and craftsmanship&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with travel case and two Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Blade exposure is too mild for manly beards&lt;br /&gt;- Feather blades are extremely sharp! Do not use the blades it comes with first, learn your technique with another more forging&lt;br /&gt;blade. (i.e. Wilkinson Sword blades in black case)</li>
    <li> Blades are really sharp better than any 3 or 4 or 5 blade razor you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;I had really bad irritation on my upper lip when shaving my mustache stubble.&lt;br /&gt;The multi- blades would tear and cut my skin and break out in hives.&lt;br /&gt;Also using shaving cream on every pass helps to, not just the 1st pass. Aftershave, then moisturizer shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great starter Safety Razor. It uses a single blade. Referred to a double edge blade, meaning an edge on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was it took forever to ship. This particular vendor had free shipping but took a month to come in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m accustomed to and have been generally happy shaving with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. [[ASIN:B003BVINRW Schick Hydro 3 Blade Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;2. [[ASIN:B002O7UI18 C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 147g/5.2oz]]&lt;br /&gt;3. [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, purchasing replacement cartridges has become increasingly expensive, causing me to look into alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching a variety of options, I decided to try the safety razor experience. I considered several entry-level options under $20, as I didn&#x27;t want to invest too heavily before knowing whether I really wanted to commit to this change or not. One of the main reasons I chose the Feather Double Edge was because of its butterfly hinge head and the Feather brand. Other razors in this price range utilize a screw-top assembly. Based on their product reviews, it seems that the threading of that assembly stripped rather easily (within several months), rendering the razor useless. It also appeared to me that the butterfly hinge would facilitate a quicker blade change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived with a plastic box/carrying case, two Feather blades, and a plastic blade dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a summary of my experience with the Feather Double Edge so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: Please take into account that I and my skin are still adjusting to this new style!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;+ Much cheaper than cartridge razors&lt;br /&gt;+ Butterfly hinge top enables quick blade change&lt;br /&gt;+ Overall weight balance seems very good; weight in the head helps achieve the correct angle for shaving&lt;br /&gt;+ Product quality good, given the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Increased likelihood of razor burn in specific places (more likely due to my inexperience with the razor than any fault of the razor itself)&lt;br /&gt;- Shave does not seem to be as consistently close as with the Hydro 3 (again, likely due to inexperience)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am initially quite satisfied. The Feather Double Edge has given me what I feel to be a solid introduction to the world of safety razors and look forward to becoming more skilled in using it and trying out different blades to discover the right combination for me and my skin.</li>
    <li> Smooth finish! Long lasting shave. Easy to load and clean. Good handle length. I am truly happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a couple other all stainless steel DE razors and despite the plastic handle this is by far the most balanced and easiest to hold onto. Does not feel cheap but actually designed for the best use of plastic you will find. Feels like the choice of plastic for the handle was intentional and not done to make it inexpensive. I can hold onto this razor with ease even if I have wet hands! The butterfly action is flawless and so far with about 5 months of service, I feel that it will give me many years more.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, sure beats the new fangled expensive blades.</li>
    <li> No better value in DE shaving than this. The included blades are excellent though I bought 5 coated DE stainless blades at Family Dollar for $1 which are good as the Feathers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace an Edwin Jagger that I accidentally dropped and the handle had sheared off at the head.  The handle on this is made from plastic, as well as the safety guards on either side of the blade housing.  As a result, this razor is extremely light and seems very well made.  I love Feather&#x27;s blades, and have enjoyed using this razor.  It is much more forgiving than the Edwin Jagger that I owned previously, though you can certainly still cut yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I love the opening/closing mechanism for the blade.  It is very quick and simple to replace one, particularly compared to the Jagger.  You can have the blade out and clean it and have it back in place in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li> First off the fith star may be worthy. I shaved my first shave with this razor today. It is my first DE razor in over 10 years, and I only got through one blade with the last one (my stepdad gave it to me about five years before I could grow hair, it got lossed on my first tour on a Navy ship) so needless to say I am not very familiar with the way to do this stuff. I did not have a mirror and I ran out of hot water in about two minutes, so the whole plan broke down pretty fast. For those two minutes I had hot water and four days of growth on my beard, all was painless serinity. I could feel the lack of hair with my hands (again no mirror). I did a lot of research before trying this and disgarded most of it (not that it wasn&#x27;t good, but I wanted to try my \\&quot;shave soap\\&quot; first.) One thing for sure don&#x27;t try this with an agressive razor. I used garnier fructis as my lather (non-agressive razor + sharp blade + thin lather &#x3D; ? ) All was great as long as I could keep things wet and warm, however no mirror and not hot water made my face burn with razor burn on the neck while trying to get to touchably smooth. I would never try to be that smooth with the five blade I normally have used as of late, (also used without a mirror, but with limitless hot water (the darned mirrors alwayse fog at the one place and the heat doesn&#x27;t work correctly at eather so heat is the big issue at both.) Everything that was done before the hot water became cold and I (the bathroom was also very cold no heat and no hot water spigget and fogged up mirror) is amazing. there is one spot on my neck with some major razor rash/burn from drying soap and a sharp razor, with me not wanting to get under the cold water in a cold bathroom, but the rest is AMAZING. As I have said this may warrent the fith star I need to try it with hot water first, and maybe a mirror. Personally with the way most of my face feels I would suggest trying Garnier Fructis shampoo (with this razor and blade combo, but NOT with an aggressive razor, again the idea is world&#x27;s sharpest blade + razor that is mild, such as this one made by Feather the maker fo said blades, plus thin vertually impossible to clogg the razor lubricant + of course hot water such as shower. That is what I figure will make the amazing shave I have on my left (started there) side be my whole face shave. Oh, and ideally have a mirror. Small note about the shipping I payed the 8.99 to have this on a Saturday and it arived in prestine condition and ontime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to wet shaving after exclusive electric (Braun) shaving. The first couple of shaves with this razor were pretty rough with lots of pulling, tugging, and nicks galore. After a couple of weeks practice though, my technique improved substantially and I&#x27;m proud to say I&#x27;m 100% converted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is mostly plastic, but molding seems very precise and looks like it can take a beating. Very easy to find just the right blade angle no matter which part of face you&#x27;re working on. The included Feather blades did not work out for me, and I&#x27;ve since tried Wilkinson Sword and Astra blades - both are very good. For lather, I&#x27;m using the el cheapo Van Der Hagen shaving set (boar brush, ceramic bowl and puck soap from WM for eight buckses) which I&#x27;m perfectly content with.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor and my first DE but after.10 wet shaves I am going back to cartridges and Barbasol. The hair on the neck grows in too many directions and results in awkward, time consuming shave that results in nicks with no better results than Gillette or Personna twin blades. I also purchased an Omega Shave Cream and Brush kit which never seemed to lather very well and produced a mess. I&#x27;ll save traditional shaving for the Barber. However this razor appears to be well made and the plastic case is nice too!</li>
    <li> Good As any , light weigh, simple, comfortable, less expensive.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This is a great starter razor and probably the best razor on the market given the price. However, if you don&#x27;t account for price, this razor is only average when compared to the vast double edge razor market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could do it all over again, I would have probably just invested in a nicer razor from the get go instead of buying this one then upgrading.</li>
    <li> This is my first double edge safety razor, so I did a fair amount of research before purchasing.  I knew I wanted something relatively user friendly and not too expensive--on the off chance that I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and forth on this one, my main concern stemmed from having noticed a lot of people complaining about it being partially plastic.  Though now I have to say, I think that is one of the things I like best about it.  The plastic bits mean that it is not as heavy as the more pricey models, which facilitates a nice transition for someone who is switching from standard disposables or cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think this is a good choice for beginners, as it is not at all difficult to figure out how to use.  My one word of warning would be to make sure the twist mechanism is tightened down snug before every shave.  Not that I am implying that it loosens with use.  It doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m just saying, if you think it&#x27;s tight and it&#x27;s not, the blade will wobble and you absolutely will get cut.  In fact, despite being a newbie to this style of razor, that scenario is the only time I have gotten cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actually shaving goes, ladies, if you are concerned at all about trying this sort of razor, don&#x27;t be.  Just buy one.  Equally suitable for legs, underarms, and bikini area; I can say without any doubt that this provides the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  And most importantly, since I started using this razor I&#x27;ve not had to deal with ANY razor burn or bumps.  Which, for me, is a definite first.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. If your buying into all the multi blade hype and tired of spending all your money on replacement blades try one of these they shave just as well in my opinion and replacement blades are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Very mild razor. Works great with a personna lab blue. I only use it on my head as it is too mild for my face.</li>
    <li> As Described will buy from again A+</li>
    <li> Perfect, just as you expect.</li>
    <li> Incredibly light and causes more skin irritation that it does in taking off hair. Personally, I feel you&#x27;re better off with something that doesn&#x27;t require pushing against your face with the blade.</li>
    <li> Great shaver at a good price. No complaints about it being mild, works great on my sensitive skin. I use Feather blades in it to prevent the shave getting too mild. The blade and the razor are made for each other.</li>
    <li> This razor takes some time to get used to. Lots of nicks first few tries. After a few months my husband has mastered its use.</li>
    <li> After years of shaving with gillette products and wasting thousands of dollars I finally dared wet shaving. I bought this as a starter shave stick and voila.. I was surprised at the closeness of the shave.. I did get a few cuts here and there but that was owing to my lack of experience and technique.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to people who are newly taking up wet shaving..</li>
    <li> I am switching from the Merkur safety razor as it was extremely difficult to shave the area under my nose and twice in the time I have been using the Merkur the screw top of the razor that secures the blade loosened enough that I cut my face due to the blade not being secure. Not blaming this on the device as I should have check that it was tight, but assumed it was secure like the day before. I like the idea of the butterfly opening that will clearly show me if it is lose or open and saw others talk about it being easier, due to the shape of the head, to get to and shave under my nose. Just got it today and tried it out and so far it is far superior in results.</li>
    <li> A good place to start if you&#x27;re curious about wet shaving and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. Feather blades are considered by many as the best/sharpest blades available. If you enjoy this razor but don&#x27;t like plastic for whatever reason I recommend upgrading to the parker 96R. It&#x27;s basically the same razor in all metal. It feels a lot more premium on the face and in hand. Make sure to stick with the feather blades in your mild razors (in my experience anyway)</li>
    <li> Outstanding razor. Nice close shave. Let the razor do the work. Great value.</li>
    <li> razor is well made, but the safety edges (black in picture) keep blade too far from face. I cannot get a close shave with this razor. Very disappointing. The Feather blades that came with it are thin and poorly made. I bought gillette blades which were a higher quality but made no difference in the closeness of shave. I have gone back to the disposable razors I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;  I believe the problem to be with the razor.</li>
    <li> Extremely light - well built&lt;br /&gt;The blade is extreme sharp and been using it for a good month&lt;br /&gt;Much easier to clean than other DE or Disposables due to butterfly design&lt;br /&gt;Wish there is an all metal one since it does look a little cheap&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended nevertheless</li>
    <li> Super nice razor and does an excellent job of shaving. I got tired of purchasing the 5, 3 blade razors that filled up with whiskers as soon as you made a pass on your face. You could spend lots of time trying to wash the soap and whiskers from between the blades. They very quickly got dull and missed half of the whiskers leaving UN-shaven areas on your face. I grew up using one of these and have no idea why I fell for the sales pitch from the razor manufactures. I think purchasing this razor and the giant blade package will last me the rest of my life. I have shaved 4 times with this item using the, same blade and it still is doing a nice job of shaving. This Double Edge razor is by far the best and cheapest way to shave. The quality of this item is excellent. I prefer an all metal razor but it is difficult to find a quality item that is all metal.  There are several here on Amazon.com but the reviews were not of my liking. I believe I have made the right choice in this item as it performs extremely well and is easy to open and clean the whiskers from the blade area.</li>
    <li> The quality price ratio was very attractive. These type of razors are my favorite and are cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> Its still under the tree until sat night, but it was a great buy and he will love it, if he doesn&#x27;t buy that one the Pawn Stars guy keeps hawking on the commercials!</li>
    <li> I jumped into the DE market feet first and went with a heavyweight Chrome plated razor (Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome) that was on back-order. I heard great things about feather razor blades and decided to get this razor in the mean time and for travel. I must say this is a great razor and perfect pairing for the feather blades. When my fancy razor came in I had to switch back to the feather because it was much more forgiving and provided a faster and safer shave for me. In short this is the perfect razor to learn or travel with. I&#x27;m going to eventually try my classic chrome one again but am afraid the feather has spoiled me. Great Japanese engineering and seems to be sturdy enough. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I wanted a cleaner and smother shaved look. Feather offers a great product at a great price. Multiple blade razors are over rated. This is all any man needs to get the clean, smooth look others will notice.</li>
    <li> Quite a newbie to this DE Shaving Malarky. Been at it only 4 weeks. Now I only own 2 DE razors (this and a Weishi/Commoy) , but this this the best. It&#x27;s an Excellent Razor and feels just right in the hand. As recommended I bought a sample pack of razor blades to test out as everyone has their own personal preferences. I was really surprised to find out that its the Astra Platinum and the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock blades that suit my particular mug. I had less success with the Merker blades and the &amp;#34;Everyone Raves About&amp;#34; Feather blades (where the styptic pencil proved handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this will change with better technique and time. From using an Electric and Mach 3 I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t go back to these more costly (but less effective items). Its weird when you go &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; you actually enjoy the shaving experience. :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this as an inexpensive travel razor, but have been very disappointed.  My other razor is a Merkur 180 long handle, and this does not come anywhere close to it.  First, it is mostly plastic, though it is &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; plastic it is still inconsistent in critical dimensions.  Most importantly it does not provide a close shave, and every time I use it I end up nicking and scraping because I try to make up for it by pressing too hard and going over the same spot multiple times.  Spend the extra money and get one that is all metal and quality construction.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides a smooth shave. I used same blades with a different double edge shaver and frequently had nicks and cuts. I highly recommend this double edge shaver.</li>
    <li> A very good razor for the price!  It was good enough to convince me to splurge and buy their fully stainless steel de razor for $200.&lt;br /&gt;This one has been dedicated to my travel kit, and I expect to enjoy it for some time.  If you are new to de razors, it takes a few weeks to get the feel, but when you do the shaves are fantastic, (the 4 o&#x27;clock shadow doesn&#x27;t appear till about 8:30!)</li>
    <li> Great razor Great price after using this for a couple months and comparing it to my Merkur 34C, the Feather is heads and tails above the Merkur in comfort and ease of use. Used both with Feather blades to compare apples to apples. Plan on buying another Feather razor to keep in back up.</li>
    <li> New old school is cool..</li>
    <li> Great razor and easy to use.</li>
    <li> just what I ordered and good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 safety razors in the course of a few months of trying out different combinations of razors and blades (Derby, Feather, and Astra blades are what I&#x27;ve tried). This Feather Razor is the best of all of them - plus the Feather blades are incredibly sharp as everybody had said. I give this combination 5 stars, but I still am going to have to go back to shaving with my Hydro 3 blades or the Dorco blades that are even less expensive. These double-edge razors tear my neck up, and it takes so long to shave with them that I just can&#x27;t use them anymore. This product is the best one of what I have, though, because I like the lighter and longer shaft that lets me put as much pressure on my face as I want to.</li>
    <li> Nice razor! Even though it is mostly plastic it feels very sturdy and provides an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> All plastic construction feels flimsy and wasn&#x27;t up to the challenge. Returned.</li>
    <li> Awesome little razor! It&#x27;s perfect for the newbie to wet shaving, or as a travel razor. It was my first, and is now my travel razor. It is pretty aggressive, so I&#x27;d use a Derby or something along those lines as the blade rather than a feather blade, lest you peel your skin off. I love a good tight shave, but a newbie would draw blood with this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, for the price you&#x27;re crazy not to!</li>
    <li> Product works well . Rinse and dry after use  see no sign of discoloration . Blade is held securely. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> The razor was a present for my husband.  He was really glad to get back to a good razor.  The shave was a lot smoother than he was getting with the disposable razors and he said it was so much easier to clean.  He loved it.</li>
    <li> Very mild shave. If it were metal I think I&#x27;d like it better. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that because this has a plastic handle, it might feel like a cheap Bic disposable or something. Not so. It&#x27;s got a bit of heft and feels solid, like it&#x27;s going to last forever.</li>
    <li> Feather are by far the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. With a good lather, you won&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re actually shaving. It feels like a caress.</li>
    <li> Great razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect razor. I would say the shave is forgiving even with Feather blades. I was blind shaving in the shower after a few days without a single cut. I think I may try Personna blades next though given the cost difference to Feather blades (no I&#x27;m not advertising for them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And BTW, you don&#x27;t need a PhD to use this. I&#x27;m really surprised how many people waste time with YouTube videos and detailed forum discussions. It&#x27;s a razor people. It&#x27;s like trying to make blowing your nose complicated. If you&#x27;ve been shaving for any length of time then it shouldn&#x27;t be a hard transition.</li>
    <li> WHAT I EXPECTED...PRICEY</li>
    <li> good razor ,shaves great.</li>
    <li> took a long time to get it, shipped from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
    <li> No complaints have used different blades and get a closer shave than any multiblade . Has some weight to it well built. Easier to clean than the multiblades</li>
    <li> This razor gives me a very fine shave, but it is very light weight, and has some plastic parts, so I am not sure how durable it is going to be. The light weight can be a benefit for some, when using the ultra sharp  Feather blades, as it makes more noise when cutting, and you can feel the feedback in your hand.  Might need to put some protection around it when travelling, as airlines always try to turn baggage into pulp.  At the price though, if was the perfect razor for me, I&#x27;d probably get several to have as backups. I prefer my heavier Parker razor, still with Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave...but be careful...it&#x27;ll getchya!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for those who would like a great shave and to save money on high priced disposables.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight, good handle length for the long fingered among us, well made and durable. The feather blades with this&lt;br /&gt;make a superb combination. Light to medium beard.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old Gillette, but I cant find a razor that is adjustable for a reasonable price anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves as good as the disposables, and for a much lower &#x27;operating cost&#x27;</li>
    <li> My first safety razor and it does the job well. It is not as heavy as some that I have felt, but you still do not need much pressure. The blades that come with the razor are VERY sharp. They are more forgiving than I expected, but you will get some irritation if your technique is wrong. I recommend some good soap or cream when using the Feather blades. When you finish with the two Feather blades I recommend Van Der Hagen blades. They work well on medium hair and are pretty forgiving about technique. If you have really thick hair then I would stick with the Feather blades. My friend says Van Der Hagen tug too much for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if you are wanting to start using safety razors, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It&#x27;s plenty long for my big man hands and gets the job done. I just wish the edge of the razor stuck out a tiny bit farther, but nonetheless I would buy this again, and I definitely recommend. Shipping was good also.</li>
    <li> simple works well !!! good bang for the buck. nice straight lines , easy to clean ... I don&#x27;t need lots of blades , nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Accurately described on website.  It was delivered ahead of schedule.  Great razor!!</li>
    <li> Amazing razor, it took very little time to get used to using.</li>
    <li> Simple and does the job well.  It&#x27;s just the minimalist razor I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old geezer with small hands and the size and weight of  this razor are perfect for me. Nice balance, nice grip. The Japanese are fastidious when it comes to accuracy and precision in making parts and assembling the final product. (Their Seki Edge hair styling tool is amazing.) Even the box is sturdy, convenient and easy to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing leaves my skin smooth, no sign of stubble. So I don&#x27;t have to shave every day and I feel good about the environmental friendliness of it all. Works well with rich face soap. I haven&#x27;t tried the enclosed Feather blades, my hands are not steady enough for ultra-sharp. Astra is fine for me.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son who wanted to switch to a DE razor.  He is happy with the razor and noted that the handle was a good size for his large hands.  I based my purchase on customer reviews which proved to be a good guide.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving razor! I will never go back to expensive multi razor products.&lt;br /&gt;This razor shaves so well that I cannot wait until next day to shave again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do online shopping for years but never wrote a review in my life. This product made me so happy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a well-made safety razor that I purchased as a replacement for my old Wilkinson Sword. It has good weight and provides a reasonably close shave. The included blades are of excellent quality. I may upgrade to the higher tier Feather razors based on my experience with this model.</li>
    <li> Well made, durable and well-balanced. This is my everyday razor and I even bought a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; in-case the main one gets lost or broken.</li>
    <li> Lightweight so it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t my first razor but I was still surprised by the quality of this product. A great pickup for anyone interested in a close shave and fairly high quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (expensive) razors for years, I have to say I can see myself using this particular razor until I&#x27;m an old man.  Gives a clean shave, easy to clean/use/etc.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say with the exception of I recommend it!</li>
    <li> First, I have very coarse facial hair. I have been using the over-priced Fusion cartridges since they came out, because they worked &amp;#34;the best.&amp;#34; Whoa was I ever wrong. I was not interested in spending money on the &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; safety razors for my first try. This feather Razor gives me the cleanest, most pain-free shave I have experienced. If you are speculative of shaving with a safety razor, don&#x27;t be. Just take your time and don&#x27;t press too hard. Its easy and feels great! My wife even noticed a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I am also now using a brush/soap instead of a canned gel, also a huge improvement in feel and quality of shave!</li>
    <li> This was my boyfriends first experience with a straight razor and he loves it, sharper, smoother, no burn! If you are on the fence about switching to a straight razor, I would do it!</li>
    <li> This razor has a very small aperture (space between the blade and the razor itself) which helps me a lot. I have very sensitive skin and this razor helped me with the razor burn.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my husband. he never really used it. I started using it because I bought extra blades for it and didn&#x27;t want them going to waste. it took a while for me to learn how to shave my legs with it without cutting myself! but I will never switch. I have had this for a year or two and I have only used 3 blades! I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband has been looking for a razor like this for a long time. He uses it often to trim around his beard and mustache. He likes it rather than disposable as there is only one blade.</li>
    <li> but I evidently don&#x27;t know how to shave with this type of razor...I tried a couple of times and went back to my normal razor. I&#x27;m sure my Dad could use this if he was still alive....I was trying to save money on the expensive cartridges but until I learn the trick to not looking like I got in a fight and lost to a fighting rooster, I&#x27;ll have to continue to spend the money for the cartridges. I&#x27;m sure this is a fine razor....but it&#x27;s not for me</li>
    <li> I have 4 double-edge Razors &amp; this one is my overall favorite. The handle texture makes it non-slip &amp; the extra-long handle works well with large hands,</li>
    <li> Let’s start by acknowledging that this is not intended to be, marketed as (or priced) as a first-class razor. It’s advertised as ‘combining affordability with performance’, and that’s probably about right. If you want twice the razor, get yourself a nice Merkur for about twice the price (search for Merkur Double-Edge Razor right here on Amazon.com; you’ll find several nice ones). That said, if you’re just starting out in Double Edged razor shaving and don’t want to spend a lot, or if you’re looking to take your wet-shaving on the road and just want a lightweight DE razor to toss into your travel shave kit, this razor is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, if you use a good blade (I use Feather blades) this razor will give you a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ‘minus‘ to me - and it may not be a negative to everyone - is that this razor holds the blade at a much less aggressive angle than the Merkur razors I use. Look at the pictures of the Merkur razors here on Amazon and you’ll see a pronounced curve to their tops; that curved top closes down on the blade, bending it over to achieve a fairly aggressive cutting angle. That angle seems to give me a closer shave. This Feather razor is flatter at the top, consequently it does not bend the razor blade as much and the cutting angle is not as great. Again, the sharper angle is the one my face prefers; this razor’s angle may feel better to you. (I’ve looked at some of the other reviews since I first wrote this, and indeed other reviewers DO feel that this razor’s angle works better for them. So it really is a matter of personal preference.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing to be aware of is that this is, as advertised, a razor made largely of plastic. That saves weight (again, good for travel), but feels less solid in your hand - because it is. That’s not necessarily bad, it just is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a moderately priced DE razor, and it will give you a moderately good shave. I recommend it for those who may not want to spend a lot on their first DE razor, or for experienced DE shavers who may looking for a lighter razor and are willing to give up a little bit of closeness in their shave in return. I use if for that reason, and it’s not a bad tradeoff.</li>
    <li> Great razor. My tough beard tamed by included Feather blades. If you are new to single blade shaving...you will be pleasantly surprized. Save some cash and some plastic from the landfills.</li>
    <li> Awesome price and quality!  I used this razor the day it arrived and had the best shave in a long time.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> decent razor. I thought it would be great to use with feather blades, but the razor overall is just ok. I prefer the parker 99r</li>
    <li> It is a cheap razor, but well made for the price... maybe adding $20 could get you a better one.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews prior to purchasing.  The Feather razor fits my hands and is easy to use.  The Feather blades are sharp and I was able to shave without any nicks.  I think some of the other reviews about nicks with these blades were by novices who had never shaved before with a DE razor.  I like the fact that I can easily clean the razor and blade is a big plus for me.  I remove the blade after each shave and run hot water over both the blade and open razor head.  No more crud as between the multi-bladed razors.</li>
    <li> The razor was purchased for my husband at his request. He claims that it exceeds all his expectations and is equal to or better than some of his much higher priced razors.</li>
    <li> As my first Double edge razor, well i was uncertain of the results.  Your face may take a week or so to get use to the shave.  After using this item for two months, i will order a second for my son.</li>
    <li> I ordered this is 2012, I still have it and use it daily. This is the best shave ever.  Pros: Low cost Close Shave Low cost replacement blades Blades last longer than disposable razors Light Weight Longer handle  Cons: None  Update: Three years later and I am still using this same razor. The blades last me about a month each so this is considerable cheaper than using disposable razors and the shave is 10x better. I bought another one of these because I thought I lost my original one on a trip to my sister&#x27;s house, but I ended up finding it again so now I have an extra one in case this one ever wears out which I highly doubt it will.</li>
    <li> The Feather brand razors themselves are only good for about 2 or 3 shaves. Also, you cannot use the razor like the newer generation multi-blade ones. You have to relearn how to shave. Slow methodical movements with the right pressure at all times. If not, you will bleed.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good safety razor and found this one. I&#x27;ve had good luck with&lt;br /&gt;products made in japan and this is one of them. Sure its got some plastic to it but&lt;br /&gt;to me thats just less metal thats going to corrode. Be sure to buy good razors with it,&lt;br /&gt;the ones that came with it were super smooth and lasted 3 to 4 shaves for one.</li>
    <li> This is my first de razor. I have been using it for about a month now and Im very happy with it. The construction seems very good easy to clean. First couple times I used it. I got a nick here and there but once you get the hang of it you will wonder why you didnt switch earlier. I dont use the brush soap yet so far I use the shave cream that comes in a tube from Wal-Mart. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was my first razor in the single-blade arena, after years using cartridges. So although I can&#x27;t speak to its finer points versus its competitors, I can say: It shaves smoothly, it shaves comfortably, I don&#x27;t cut myself with it, it was easy to figure out how to use it, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and upon seeing it a friend commented &amp;#34;that&#x27;s a really fancy razor!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do you need?</li>
    <li> Purchased this as an introductory to shaving.works fantastic, lightweight don&#x27;t need as much pressure. Would definitely recommend for a beginning razor.</li>
    <li> I was tired of dropping 10$ plus every time for normal shaving cartridges, so i decided to try the oldschool way of shaving in order to save money. This razor with the feather blades shaves better then any disposable, and just as good as most cartridge razors. The best grooming investment I&#x27;ve made all year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try out shaving with an old school double edge razor, this is great for the price. I totally love its simple twist to open design as well. Brilliant!</li>
    <li> I think the desing of the head of this razor doesn&#x27;t contour well to the face so, it gave me lots of nicks and bad irritation like no other razors I had tried.I use a Lords de razor, it has a different head desing and I got no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m new to wet shaving maybe I need more practice, I&#x27;ll try to keep using it.</li>
    <li> For me this is the first DE razor I have bought after reading a lot of reviews online about various types of DE&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic aspect of this razor was the only hesitation I had at first to purchasing this razor, but after receiving and using the razor, the plastic doesn&#x27;t take away from the quality at all. It feels solid, and opens and closes perfectly for a butterfly razor. You have to keep it clean, but I&#x27;m guessing since I have only had it about a month now, that with decent cleaning this thing will last for years. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another for my travel bag, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about packing it on trips, i.e. have it ready to go! I could buy a different style, but I&#x27;m so confident in this, why spend money and possibly by disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and buy addition blades, since this only comes with 2. I bought more feather blades, as again I have looked a lot and they are the best apparently i.e. the sharpest. My whiskers are like barbed wire sticking out of my face for my daily shave, and need something super sharp to pass through, and since feather is the sharpest, thats what I went with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid and give this DE a shot, buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I was between the $3 chinese double edge or the $32 edwards before I found these. Really glad I went with these. Quality made, locks everything in tight, has a nice buffer, not too hard to use. Recommended for all.</li>
    <li> I really like grooming so I decided to switch from my electric razor in order to add aftershave to my morning routine. Since switching, my relationship has improved, I got a promotion, and my cat sits on my lap more. Also, now I start small talk with strangers about the art of using a safety razor and how it&#x27;s so much better than every other method of shaving. If they mention that they use an electric or quintuple bladed Gillette, I laugh. I laugh in their poorly shaved faces. Buy this razor and join me today.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used a cartridge razor or occasional electric so this is my first safety razor.  Watched a few videos where they talked about it taking 10 minutes to use a safety razor when you get used to it including warming the blade, messing with a bristle brush and foaming up the shaving cream.  I skipped most of that and just used a little gel out of a can.  I shave in the shower at the end.  On the first stroke it wasn&#x27;t clear I was even touching my face as I could hardly feel it.  I just use my cartridge method with the safety razor, first with the grain, then against.  Right side, left side, center. Done.  No nicks, no pull, no chin or Adam&#x27;s apple problem. It took only a few minutes.  Way easier than the youtube videos made it out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have tried this years ago.  The wife thinks it is closer than the cartridge 4 blade razor and orders of magnitude more economical.  I don&#x27;t know anything about less or more aggressive shaves but I cannot imagine much better than this.  I don&#x27;t see any need to pay up for a safety razor more expensive than this.  The 10 blades that came with this are going to last a while.</li>
    <li> I decided to switch back to DE safety razors after about a 20 year hiatus due to the constantly escalating price of my Fusion cartridges. With the \\&quot;fog of time\\&quot;, I actually don&#x27;t remember why I switched to cartridges in the first place; but, boy, am I happy that I switched back! This razor is very lightweight and simple, but does its job really well with zero nicks and cuts with my first two shaves. I used the stock Feather blades that came with the razor and they seem to pair up well together. The blade is angled quite a bit and the razor is very \\&quot;non-aggressive\\&quot;. I found that I can shave much faster than I can with my Fusion razor and I get a closer, smoother shave much quicker. I use the razor both with the grain and against it (yes, I know that it is not recommended) and it seems to work really well both ways. One minor quibble is that the handle feels a bit short in my large mitts and the razor feels slightly top heavy compared to my old metal DE razors whose handles were more heavy, which gave them a bit more balance. However, this did not detract from the use of the razor in any way.    After this experience, I cannot see myself going back to my cartridge razor anytime soon (other than instances where TSA will not allow me to carry DE razor blades in my carry-on luggage!) For the price I paid for this razor, it seems like an absolute steal, with made-in-Japan quality in both the razor and the blades. I intend to keep using the Feather blades going forward since they seem to match up really well with the razor.</li>
    <li> Returned to shaving with double edge safety razors,  puck and brush in May 2013, after 40 years of shaving with disposable blades.  Woke up one day and nostalgia hit me in the center of my forehead.  Did not want to spend a lot of $ on a safety razor not knowing if I could regain the safety razor technique and being unsure how my face and neck would react.  So, the Feather Double Edge Shaving Razor combined with a sampler pack of safety blades were inexpensive choices.  The razor is high on my value to cost scale.  No issues with the razor.  I settled on Wilkinson double edge blades.  My combination yields a close shave while saving me a bunch of bucks over disposables.  Will soon begin experimenting with different brands of pucks.</li>
    <li> My dad love this razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Smooth, easy to handle. Love this thing...and so much cheaper than the throwaway type.</li>
    <li> Lightweight of sufficient build quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Fast shipping. Not a bad safety razor. Definitely a good initial purchase for individuals looking to invest in a good safety razor.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money; KUDOS</li>
    <li> Great Razor for price.  You&#x27;ll find it hard to cut yourself.  I think that is because the razor where the blade fits is curved . Its not an aggressive razor though. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a year or more now and wouldn&#x27;t buy any other except to upgrade to the Feather all stainless steel model when I can get a good deal on one as they are expensive.  I&#x27;ve shaved with all other types of razors and at 65 yrs this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed a razor with a milder shave than some of the more aggressive razors out there. I can get a close shave without the nicks and cuts!</li>
    <li> Simple, but yet refined - works fantastic, much better shave than with the overpriced double, triple, whatever cartridges - especially if you don&#x27;t shave everyday and then have to shave off that longer scruff.</li>
    <li> Very forgiving for a Double Edge razor. Very mild and unlikely to cut you. This is a double edged sword though because it&#x27;s not as effective as something even slightly more aggressive. It does work though and would be a easy transition from multi blade razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a couple of weeks now and cannot complain about the quality of the build. It seems to be adequate and modern plastics can be quite strong. My problem is that the shave is not nearly as close as I get with the Merkur 180 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From reading the reviews, I think my problem may be with not finding the correct blade angle. I have been shaving for 50+ years with both double edge and cartridge razors and may have established a pattern too hard to break as far as blade angle is concerned. I have tried to vary the angle and still do not seem to get a close shave. I have been using the Feather blades that came with the razor. I have medium to medium-light facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving with DE razors around 1960 or so, and moved to cartridge razors when they came out many years later. About a month ago I went in to buy cartridge blades and saw the price of $28.00 for a package of five or six and said \\&quot;This is ridiculous!\\&quot; I decided to go back to DE blades at less than 1/10 of the price. So I ordered the Merkur 180 and the Feather razor from Amazon. Neither razor has cut or nicked me, but I just cannot make the Feather shave as closely as the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if you have very light facial hair or are just starting to learn how to use a DE razor the Feather will work fine for you. For me, however, the blade angle designed into the razor seems so mild that I cannot get it give the really close shave that the Merkur will produce.</li>
    <li> I am actually a woman who was REALLY tired of spending $15 a pop on like four of those mach 3 razors.  Even though I got many multiple shaves from a single cartridge, it was still just way too expensive.  I love my smooth legs, but razors designed for women are COMPLETE TRASH.  They don&#x27;t shave anything well, regardless of hair texture, in my experience.  So, that all said, this razor setup has been great for me.  BUT, I have to knock off a star, because I have had rust inside of this thing.  It isn&#x27;t a lot, and it may be partially the blades, but if you don&#x27;t get this thing completely dry afterwards, yeah.. I&#x27;ve had some rust in it.  It&#x27;s superficial, but it&#x27;s there.  I am using stainless feather blades, so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m using crap blades.  I try not to leave it damp, either, I open it up and pat everything dry with a towel, blade included, both sides.  But it&#x27;s hard to dry out some of the small areas.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Gillette Eveready safety razor for years.  I bought this razor as a travel replacement to keep my good razor at home.  The reviews were why I thought to try this one and I am surprised to find that it is better then the reviews.  This Feather safety razor gives a smooth, close shave that may just be better then my Gillette.  Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Left me with a lot of cuts and nicks, would not recommend this even trying different blades it still was too aggressive.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because it was an inexpensive way to try old fashioned shaving.  The razor appears to be very well made and after using it every day for an entire week, I found I was re-shaving the hard to reach areas (upper lip and just below lower lip) with a simple blue, plastic, throw away razor.  The shave was presentable looking in the mirror but didn&#x27;t feel to touch as close as I would have liked.  My whiskers grow 4 or 5 different directions so maybe that is the reason I didn&#x27;t get a close shave with this razor.  I am rating it 4 stars due to the apparent quality of the product alone but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this razor again.  Sadly, I am waiting on additional blades for it that will arrive mid-month from overseas that I won&#x27;t be needing.</li>
    <li> This is a great plastic/metal razor...it comes in a plastic travel box and 2 blades&lt;br /&gt;The part of the razor that touches your face..the blade guard..is plastic..but smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED&gt;&gt;&gt; After mort shaves, I must admit, the combo of this FEATHER razor&lt;br /&gt;matched with Feather blades, best shave ever...smooth, close and BABY BOTTOM SMOOTH..JUST LIKE JOE FROM QUEENS.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my brother; nicks his skin and caused razor bumps.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very aggressive razor. I would not recommend this razor for beginners or anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This razor is way too small for my large hand, can only use a few fingers, therefore not a good fit nor shave.  Took over a month to arrive.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that I believe ProGlide is outstanding. Best cartridge out there -- and I&#x27;ve tried them all. At the same time, I took a chance on the Feather Double-Edge Razor simply because I was getting tired of plopping down over $17 for a 4-pk of ProGlide cartridges. I&#x27;m glad I did! This Feather produces the closest, best shave I have ever experienced. That good. It took me a couple of shaves to get the right angle down pat. No biggie. I&#x27;m now on shave #6 with the same blade. Great blade. Sharp but I&#x27;m getting no nicks or irritation. That was my biggest worry about going with a double-edge razor. Look, we&#x27;re all different. I can only go by what I&#x27;ve been experiencing. Bottom line: I&#x27;m never going back to the cartridges.</li>
    <li> I ordered this before seeing the Edwin Jagger razor which I also ordered.  This doesn&#x27;t have the weight of the other, and I am actually able to control the other razor better.  Still, it&#x27;s not bad, and I will keep it and use it as a travel razor.  Feather blades were too sharp in this razor, and it did a better job using Shark blades, which also work well with my better razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Shaves nearly flawlessly. A must have for anyone with sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good razor.</li>
    <li> I must confess that the Feather razor was my third choice.  I&#x27;d bypassed it because I felt that the name &#x27;Feather&#x27; wasn&#x27;t appropriate for a man&#x27;s razor.  (Silly reason.)  So I ordered a Weishi (plastic) razor, but when I found it was going to take a month to come all the way from China, I ordered the USRazor, which came in a week or so.  However, there was a problem in that the bar that locates the blade was a bit too thin, so the blade could be exposed unevenly.  The result was a harsh shave using one side, and no shave using the other side of the blade.  And it could be secured at an angle, which was worse.  When the Weishi came I found it too short and seemingly lighter than the old disposables.  I went back to the customer reviews -- mostly because the Feather had won a four-and-a-half star rating -- but it was a comment by K. Cummings in the first customer review that prompted me to try the Feather.  He made a point that the blade seated perfectly in the razor, and he was right!  The razor came in the predicted time and my first shave was both comfortable and close.  Another factor was the favorable comparison to the old Gillette razors mentioned by many reviewers.  I&#x27;ll be turning 77 in May, and have been shaving for over 60 years, and frankly I find it BORING, so trying a double-edged razor was more for the sake of variety than the cost of disposables, but my thanks go to Mr. Cummings for his input.  It was most appreciated.  And this review is as much for his comments as for the excellent razor.</li>
    <li> Husband loves the razor. Easy to handle, long with grooves on it to prevent slipping.&lt;br /&gt;good shave. recommends this razor</li>
    <li> I own several metal razors sold by Merkur, Edwin Jagger, Parker, and Baxter of California.  All of them are high-quality razors, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.  I have used Feather blades and was curious to try this Feather razor to see if a lighter razor might be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor arrives nicely packaged in a clear plastic storage box.  A small pack of Feather blades is included, and the storage box has a nice storage compartment built-in to keep a box of blades handy with the razor if used for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself if made almost entirely of plastic with the head and turning knob the only metal parts.  The plastic does give the razor a cheap look and feel to it, just like plastic disposable razors, but it also makes the razor very lightweight.  The head of the razor has a butterfly mechanism that opens up when the knob at the top of the handle is turned.  This allows very safe and easy cleaning of both the razor and blade after shaving.  There is nothing to disassemble.  The butterfly head stays closed without needing to repeatedly tighten the knob while shaving, which sometimes occurs with other razors I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor with different brands of blades including one of the included Feather blades.  All have yielded a close, comfortable shave with this razor.  The plastic bumper at the edge of the razor seems to add protection against nicks and cuts better than my metal razors.  The razor&#x27;s light weight also makes it a lot more controllable, which I think also lessens the risk for cuts.  I have arthritic hands, and this razor is a lot more comfortable to hold due to its lighter weight.  Those used to shaving with a double-edged blade know that a light touch is needed for comfortable, nick-free shaving.  This Feather razor makes that light touch very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to double-edged blade shaving or are experienced and simply want an inexpensive razor for travel or daily usage, this Feather razor is definitely worth owning.  It is an excellent choice for anyone with arthritic hands.  It may look and feel cheap, but it handles well, provides a close shave just as well as more expensive razors, and is very easy to maintain.  With its included plastic storage case it makes for an ideal travel razor.usage, this Feather razor is definitely worth owning.  It is an excellent choice for anyone with arthritic hands.  It may look and feel cheap, but it handles well, provides a close shave just as well as more expensive razors, and is very easy to maintain.  With its included plastic storage case it makes for an ideal travel razor.</li>
    <li> Finally found my razor. Now the question is why did men quit using these. I have had trouble razor burn with all razors ( electric, multiblade, disposable etc.) tried proglide razor with high quality creams and oils. Finally ordered this DE razor and it gives the best shave I&#x27;ve had. No pull, no irritation. Razor is good quality, tight fitting parts. definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> I have used this type of razor before so I am not new to this. I have shaved with this one twice so I wanted to write my review, so far I like this razor, opens and closes with no problems and it is just the right size for me. I have been using a Schick Extreme but got tired of it clogging up all the time so I decided to go back to this type of razor. No clogging and it is easy to clean. I open it up and remove the blade and use an old toothbrush to clean it with, then leave the razor out to dry. It comes in a plastic case, which can be used for storing the razon on the shelf and two Feather blades, which do a great job of shaving and are sharp. This razor works and does what it was designed to do and you don&#x27;t really need anything better unless you just want to say that you have a $150.00 razor. For $20.00 you can&#x27;t go wrong. I would recommend this to others for now and I will update my review as time goes by. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to add: I use DR.Bronner&#x27;s Magic Shaving Soap Gel or just his Bar Soap to use as a shaving soap.[[ASIN:B0017QPLLO Dr. Bronner - Organic Shikakai Peppermint Shave Gel, 7 fl oz gel]]</li>
    <li> so far it has performed as advertised and as well as I had hoped it would.I am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> It is a solid little shaver.  Holds the blade firm.  I just got tired of paying the big bugs for my Mach 3 cartridges.  Works great on shaving neck hair....if my wife does it carefully.</li>
    <li> Works great, but could be a little cheaper?  Comes with 2 Feather blades which are supposed to be pretty good, and they do feel good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little adjusting to, coming from a disposable razor, because you can&#x27;t always tell it&#x27;s working.  But the shave is really close and smooth!</li>
    <li> Much better than those razor more popular and readily available in supermarkets and other outlets today.  Does not clog like the multi-blades popular today.  I get three times the shaves with this than I did with the current multi-blade models.  Much quicker to shave, as close as modern razors and easier to clean.  As a 66 year old this razor definitely brings back a better shave.  And at a much cheaper price!</li>
    <li> I have many razors and this is my personal choice for shaving. This razor is very forgiving for someone not experianced in the art of shaving with a traditional razor. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this product as a beginner razor that is as good as a high dollar model.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried by the price compared to other DE razors, but I was not disappointed by the functionality.  The included blades were great.  After a couple of months use, construction still seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> This razor was much better. We first got a really cheep one and it was not a good experience so we decided that some times you get what you pay for and in this case it turned out to be very true.  This razor is a good length for both a man and woman&#x27;s hand. This razor also has a plastic safety edge so it does not catch on your skin like the metal one we tried. And last but most defiantly not least you don&#x27;t have to take the whole head off to put in a new blade you just twist the handle and the top opens right up you put the new one, twist the handle  and you are ready to go.</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying $4 a 5-blade cartridge, even though they gave what I thought was a good shave.  I looked into safety razors and double-edged blades as an alternative,  and decided to give them a try.  I settled on the Feather razor,  as it was budget priced,  and from the reviews,  it was not extremely aggressive--meaning that it positions the blade so as to minimize cutting yourself,  at the expense of getting the ultimate close shave.  I felt that as a new-comer to this old-school method,  that this was a prudent trade-off.  I turned out to be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor, paired with the super sharp Feather brand blades have given me a closer shave than I have ever experienced,  and I have not cut myself seriously even once.  I have been very mindful about the possibility of a mishap, but even while using extreme caution,  I am able to get a shave that, 12 hours later, feels as close as the best shave I was able to get out of the cartridge system I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have what I consider a fairly thick, coarse beard,  and I don&#x27;t have a perfect complexion,  but by going first with the grain,  and then re-applying my shaving cream and making a careful pass against the grain,  I have had stellar results.  The blades are sharp enough to glide smoothly no matter the direction,  and the razor is constructed so that I don&#x27;t get cut even when trying to get close under nose,  or shaving in the cleft of my chin.  Initially--for about the first week of every day use--I was getting a little irritation,  but that has subsided.  I do get a few tiny nicks,  but I have had that with every razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have an alum bar but have found it mostly unnecessary, and possibly more aggravating than the shave.  I just rinse with cool water,  then apply a little mild witch hazel skin toner,  and my face is smooth, soft and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a budget razor,  and is mostly plastic,  but given that,  still seems of above average quality.  It is not heavy,  but has a good balance,  and a long handle to accommodate any grip.  I definitely would recommend it to someone starting out with safety-razor shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Low initial cost,  safe and easy shaving,  and great results.</li>
    <li> Been 60 years since I had one of these.  Forgot what a truly great shave they give.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing wrong. I ordered a mug and shave soap and forgot the brush.  :)&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to get another order together to add that.</li>
    <li> I am on my second shave and it is the smoothest I&#x27;ve had since a straight razor shave. I did manage to nick my nose this evening, but in a place I had already nicked with my cartridges. The feather blades worked out great despite my friends all assuring me that I would be left with a mangled face. Looking forward to years of great shaves.</li>
    <li> I received the DE razor on time, I must say that I will never go back to disposables again. This razor is flawless,smooth and gives a close shave. Don&#x27;t listen to the &amp;#34;shaving snobs&amp;#34; complaining its plastic, this is a solid DE safety razor.</li>
    <li> I can speak for my husband, who is pleased with his razor. He said it gives him a smooth shave, and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from him.....:-)</li>
    <li> I have no problems at all with this razor handle. Works perfectly, but $17 was a bit steep. The materials are slightly on the cheap side, I would have been happier paying around $7 or $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is the only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This razor far exceeds any cartridge style razor I have used, especially when the cost of blades is taken into account.  100 razor blades for less than $10 cannot be beat unless your using a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply force to the razor, this will cause irritation and likely leave you with more than a few nicks.</li>
    <li> This is my first razor that is not a Gillette. I have been using it for a month now. It works well. A little harder at first since the head is so big for the corners of your neck. It also does not have as close of a shave as a Gillette but if you are looking for Cherokee this it is.&lt;br /&gt;The razor quality is plastics and tin. Not great but for the person on a budget it works.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this razor.  It is well made for the price.  I gave this as a gift to a newbie and I was impressed how well constructed this is as compared to my $150 razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this just to check it out. I was curious as to how well it would shave compared to my Edwin Jagger DE89. I will admit I was skeptical when I opened up the Feather Razor and held it in my hand, it definitely feels cheap but it actually does a very good job providing a good shave. I like the longer handle compared to my Edwin Jagger. I had to apply more pressure while shaving, I think because the feather razor is much lighter but I did not hack my face off in the process. Over all there is not much to say, it&#x27;s a cool cheap razor that provides a good shave. I personally was able to get as close of a shave as I do with my Edwin but in all fairness it&#x27;s is probably due to operater error. Oh and I love the butterfly opening style of this. It&#x27;s really is much easier than my current three piece set up...I am probably going to buy another heavier razor with the butterfly style opening.</li>
    <li> I love DE shaving. I don&#x27;t get along with feather products. You can tell this razor is quality by holding it; far nicer than most of the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; DE&#x27;s. The razor is far too mild for me, causing me to have to do many passes, causing irritation. Feather blades also cut me, and give me weepers, unlike most others. Hi quality products, just not for me.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like a real shaving experience. This is it. Unlike the new smaller ones this one handles great. Smooth, clean,shave.</li>
    <li> Functionally it&#x27;s easy to load and unload the blade. The handle is a bit too long, maybe I&#x27;m just use to the the Merkur I started with. Also, it is more difficult to use in the tighter spaces due to the thickness of the head.</li>
    <li> I gave a five rating for excellent performance and very afforable cost.I havn&#x27;t used this type razor for over forty years.I just used it and it gave me a close shave.I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Takes time to learn how to use a double edge razor. This Feather razor has a long handle, which allows better control. Easy to change blade with twist open top. Easy to clean. Five Stars.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about this razor because it did not deem to be heavy and therefore durable, that concern was unfounded.  I have had it for a while now and it is holding up just fine.</li>
    <li> very nice shaver light and well balanced best one i have owned .. would recomend it to any one who wants a good shave</li>
    <li> Received product and the razor and blades are very nice,  however the shipping could have and should have been better. The case the razor was in was broken and now I can&#x27;t use the case as a travel case. This will be a serious issue for me because I needed the case intact to take to the gym daily. Tempted to send back and receive a new one, but being in the military I just don&#x27;t have time. Would have given it 5 stars, but the one thing I needed is unusable.</li>
    <li> Its light weight but gives an amazing shave and no razor burn!!! I haven&#x27;t had any problems when opening or closing the razor and the blade stays in place no movement at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this razor did not prevent ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> For a cheap entry into DE shaving this razor setup can&#x27;t be beat. I own a very nice razor but bought this one for travel and to keep at work. Comes with storage case 5 feather razors. TTO works great blade changes are easy. Not as smooth as my Edwin Jagger but awesome for what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Worked well, until the handle separated from the head. This happened at about 10 months of ownership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stick with a safety razor long term, you will want something heavier. But, this is a great, affordable intro blade. After owning it, you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. Might just be my face/beard, but this one shaves wonderfully for mine, while more expensive ones did not. Made me a fan of Feather products and blades.</li>
    <li> I first used a DE razor as an adolescent in the 70&#x27;s but soon the proliferation of disposables and the development of cartridge razors made them obsolete. As the decades went by I went from cartridge blades featuring 2 blades to 3 blades to the ridiculous and over priced 5 blade models, all the while paying ever increasing prices for those designs, up to the tune of $5 a blade. Then I had begun evaluating the expense of these \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; cartridge shavers and decided to try the DE shaving system once again, if not for merely nostalgia then to pay only ~.35 cents a blade versus five bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempts failed miserably. I ended up with a satisfactory shave on the face, but on the throat and below the jaw I found shaving with a DE razor more akin to losing a battle with a sword wielding Ninja. I went back to cartridges for some years after, deciding \\&quot;nostalgia\\&quot; shaving technology was best left in the past where it originated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing a co-worker talk about his satisfaction with DE&#x27;s and more research on the &#x27;net, I decided to attempt this \\&quot;new-old\\&quot; shaving system once more. Realizing my past failures, I knew I needed to do something different. My skin is not super-sensitive, but not sheet leather either. What had I done wrong before? I soon began to find the answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I realized, is that cartridge razors teach you to shave \\&quot;incorrectly\\&quot;. Due to the fact they are essentially a blade or set of blades that are set into a box at a 30-40 degree angle or so (that&#x27;s my guess), you are forced to place the shaving implement flat against your face for them to work. Couple that with their tendency to accumulate junk between the blades and you must increase pressure to maintain sufficient blade-skin contact. They do work adequately when employed as their design dictates, but the technique they force you to use is disastrous if transferred to a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Feather model DE and wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed with it out of the box. Though well made in appearance, it was predominantly plastic. Aren&#x27;t DE razors supposed to be metal and super heavy? The handle of about 4 inches appealed to me though. I knew with use of razors with stubby 3 inch handles I did not have the degree of control (unbalanced to me) I needed. I loaded a brand new Feather DE razor blade in it and vowed the next morning I would shave with it, but in doing so throw out the window everything the cartridge razor system had taught me. I knew I would have to \\&quot;re-learn\\&quot; how to shave to make this system work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, the plastic construction actually works for me much better than the purported benefits of the heavy weight metal models by increasing my control of the unit. What I discovered was that the additional handle length acted less as a gripping surface and more of a counter balance to the weight of the blade bearing head as I held the razor primarily between thumb, index and middle fingers. I decided I preferred the butterfly opening top instead of the removable cap some designs sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a good shave cream. This is as personalized a choice as any, but a good quality shave cream is essential. Quality shave cream is a crucial friction reducer as the blade glides over skin. I prefer a canned cream such as Barbasol Aloe. Avoid the gimmicky, razor clogging gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade angle. I maintained as well as possible a blade-to-skin angle of approximately 40-ish degrees, maybe slightly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO PRESSURE. I repeat, none. Cartridge razors encourage the application of pressure to maintain blade-skin contact and this is a bad habit cartridge blade users often carry over to their first efforts with a DE razor. There is no need to apply pressure with a DE razor. The blade is there, not inset below a box frame, so it does its work without requiring any pressure to efficiently slice your stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short, even strokes. With box cartridge razors I had developed thebad habit of dragging the razor from ear to chin in one continuous stroke. Do not do this with a DE razor. Gradually work your way down (or up) in short, light strokes, maintaining and adjusting your blade angle as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second passes. Never make a second pass (such as against the grain) without re-applying shave cream to that area. Another bad habit I had developed with cartridge razors I found I needed to break in order to succeed with a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever possible, stretch skin flat and taught. When this is more difficult to do (around the throat in particular), make your strokes even MORE light and short. This technique alone will reduce or eliminate the vast majority of nicks and abrasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your time! If you don&#x27;t have the time, wait until you do to practice. Though once you have committed your technique to memory it will become second nature, avoid the initial temptation to treat DE shaving like it&#x27;s a 2 minute and done cartridge razor shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When choosing a DE system, expect to have to buy a few different brands of razors, blades and creams before you hit on the combo that works best for you. I did, and I stopped looking after buying this Feather and the Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now done with cartridge razors. Some may find the transition is easy, others will not, but no doubt when used correctly they are a highly efficient and extremely cost effective alternative to the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; super duper, twisting, rotating, vibrating, pivoting razor marketing gimmicks pitched to shavers around the world at a substantial expense to your shaving budget.ke.

    <li> I decided to go back to the old way of shaving with mixing my own shaving cream with a cake and a brush, and shaving with the type of razor my dad and his dad used.  All of the new high tech razors with their multiple blades and high costs aren&#x27;t worth the money.  This razor works perfectly and provides a better and closer shave than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  It is priced right for someone wanting to get back to the old style (there are others on-line costing much more).  The only thing I would do differently is order addition blades when ordering the razor.  It comes with blades but only two in the package and you&#x27;ll need others on hand.  I&#x27;m still on a learning curve with it all but it seems a week of daily shaves is the life of a blade - the sharper they are, the better the shave.</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff!!!! it was here by the due date and everything! My dad absolutely loved his gift! Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> In this case you get more than what you pay for. I love the long handle, and the precise construction of the head.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to &amp; does it well. I&#x27;ve had it for several months and no issues yet, despite how wary I was of its plastic handle. Easy to use, good grip, awesome price. Comes with 5 Feather Hi-Steel blades that work well, but the Astra Superior Premiums (also available on Amazon) worked better for me, personally (I have pretty sensitive skin). Really the only thing I would change is the case it comes in. Made of cheap plastic &amp; not pretty at all, but still, even after months of constant use, it&#x27;s held up without breaking, so I can&#x27;t really complain, given the price. I will ALWAYS prefer my straight blade over any other razor, but when the scales on my straight razor needed to be replaced, or when I&#x27;m running behind and don&#x27;t have time to shave with a straight razor, this thing does the job. I will NEVER touch my face with another multi-blade piece of crap again!</li>
    <li> I have now used this razor over 6 weeks and I do love it! Nice balance and gives a nice clean shave. Best part is no more expensive disposables to replace and EASY to clean!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply a safety razor. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and nothing else. And I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this about three months ago. &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; from cheaper one. Immediately noticed an improvement. With feather blades I have a clean shave, no razor burn and little to no cuts. I get 5-6 shaves per blade. Also got Proraso menthol cream with nice lather and lasts !! Good value compared to $16 for four multiple blades !</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE, WORKS  GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lady and I use this on my legs, best shave I&#x27;ve ever had! My goodness be careful though if you&#x27;re going to go after your sensitive bits or else you might cut them off, very sharp! Make sure the top is twisted all of the way down to avoid the razor being raised &#x3D; nicks. My boyfriend uses it all the time and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I love these old fashioned razors, they are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and effective. I was worried to try it, but I got a really good shave with only two passes. This is my traveling razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> This razor is great gives a nearly perfect shave every time that I use it. The Feather blades are a tad to aggressive for my face with this razor but with Wilkinson Sword classics or Astra SP perfection.</li>
    <li> Love it. Super sharp. Great economical way to get into DE shaving.  Still trying to get hang of it!</li>
    <li> For the money this is an excellent product. The leading edges are a little thick and make it difficult to get into tight areas, like under the nose, but the blades are excellent. The mechanism for opening and closing works intuitively. Hard to cut yourself with this razor unless you just force it to happen.</li>
    <li> made well and looks really sharp. I threw away the sample blades it came with since I tried one and it cut me even though I took my time shaving. I was cut in 4 different places under the chin and then had to go to work that night!  I use different blades and they are much better!  Great bargin for the razor !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to duplicate other more extensive reviews. A few things you might be interested in: First, the razor feels solid and very well-made. It has a good sturdy feel to it, without feeling heavy at all. Second, the mechanism actually bends the razor blade down at the cutting edges, while it is higher in the middle. This changes the angle of the razor blade where it contacts your skin--it points more toward the handle than you might expect. I&#x27;ve been getting good shaves from this. I think the razors themselves might be a tad too sharp, or aggressive for me. Either because the blade has dulled or because I&#x27;ve gotten better, my third and fourth shaves with the blade have  been the best.</li>
    <li> It works, good razor.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver! Awesomely priced!</li>
    <li> Mostly plastic, inexpensive, non-aggressive shaver.  It&#x27;s a Feather, and that&#x27;s the reason I wanted to try it.  Probably okay for the first time wet shaver, but I prefer a more aggressive rig.  Not a fan of all that plastic.  It feels too light in the hand. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s far superior to the disposable razors and someone thinking of dipping their toe in the double edge pool would get a nice, safe intro to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I used this with the Feather blades that came with it, and got a clean, close, comfortable shave right off the bat. And it&#x27;s easy to clean. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could. Get it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. And you&#x27;ll save a ton in razor blades. The guys selling the multi-blade things are laughing all the way to the bank on your dime. Just say &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; with this. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this razor and uses it with his brush and shave soap, great value for the money. Have had for over 2 years and it still works great.</li>
    <li> It shaved nicely.  No nicks of cuts.  It just feels flimsy.  With all the plastic, the mechanics of the butterfly opener feels like it could break at any moment.</li>
    <li> This razor works but is too light weight. A good razor should be heavy enough so that you don&#x27;t have to push it against your face.</li>
    <li> I shouldnd &#x27;t have used the blades that came with it, they looked old. Not only that, but they made my face all red and full of bumps. The blades, obviously, were not hygienic at all.</li>
    <li> I got fed up buying the expensive type razors that costs a ton of money and ended up buying this razor. first off I just want to say that this razor is well built. they designed it for simplicity and with ease to replace the double sided razor. I shave every day and shaving with these razors makes my skin sensitive afterwards but the shave is closer than any mach 3 or fusion 5 can get. only problem is it takes longer shaving this way than the other razors</li>
    <li> All the other safety razors that I can find on the market currently are about twice the price of this one, which is ridiculous considering the design hasn&#x27;t changed since they were first made a little over a hundred years ago. This one gets my mark of satisfaction for &amp;#34;affordably holding a sharp piece of metal on my face but not actually cutting me.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for a backup / travel razor and I was surprise in what a good shave it gives.  A real bargain for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor to use if you want a perfect shave. This is by far the only razor I have used that prevents accidental knicks and cuts. Cuts real smoothly to a closest shave you have had. I can only rave about this product</li>
    <li> what can I say the thing works if your sick and tierd of spending 30+ dollors on razor heads this is a good buy</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this razor but I stopped after two weeks of numerous nicks and a gash that still hasn&#x27;t fully healed after two weeks. I&#x27;ve gone back to my Merker 180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad one. I tried tightening the head down more and more but it still left the blade too exposed I guess.</li>
    <li> I have this and a Merkur classic. I prefer this razor due to it&#x27;s longer handle.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I needed. You look at comparable razors at art of shaving and they are upwards of 80-100 dollars... there&#x27;s no need. This does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> My only experience with double edged razors was watching my grandpa do it when I was child. I&#x27;ve used disposable or electric razors the past 35 years. Neither product ever really provided what I assumed other people thought of as a &amp;#34;clean shave&amp;#34;.  I nearly always cut myself, left areas of my face rough and with disposables had to go through the shame of buying replacement heads at $15-$20 a pop like some hamster on a manufacturer&#x27;s recurring revenue hamster wheel. So while shopping on Amazon yet again for replacement heads for a disposable razor that I hoped the manufacturer hadn&#x27;t discontinued I came across double edged razors. So I decided to give it a try. I looked up how to use a double edged razor on youtube and then bought this low cost razor from a quality manufacturer figuring if it I didn&#x27;t like it I would only be out $20 for the effort. After a month the results have been impressive. My face is as clean and smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. I&#x27;ve nicked myself a couple of times, but less than when using a disposable razor (styptic pencil on standby). This razor holds the blade solidly, glides smoothly over my craggy face and cleans up well (something that disposables never seem to do without pounding them against the sink until they break). I&#x27;m sure a more expensive double edged razor would be even better, but I&#x27;m satisfied with this razor and will continue to use it until it stops performing as well as it has been. So if you&#x27;re thinking about trying double edged razors but don&#x27;t want to spend $100-$200 to find out you don&#x27;t like it, then this is your product. BTW - I use Remington&#x27;s King of Shaves Alphagel. For my face there is no other gel or cream that even comes close to providing a clean shave like I&#x27;ve described. So even if I go back to disposables, the Aphagel is coming with me.</li>
    <li> This is the worst razor and worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I keep hearing all these amazing things from friends about switching to safety razors and dumping the Gilette over priced garbage.  Well this particular razor and handle is not worth it at all. Find a better one, and a sharper blade.</li>
    <li> good just not as good as one might expect. my face cant handle close shaves or at least with my shaving expiertise. still a nice bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> It sure is better than the expensive multiblade razors sold by the brand name companies.</li>
    <li> First time trying a double edge razor after using cartridge razors over 30 years. I love it. Razor is great quality, not too agressive and is priced right.</li>
    <li> I decided to start using DE razors because I was sick if the cost if multi-blade cartridges that couldn&#x27;t cut a clean edge to my goatee, mustache, and sideburns. I didn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money on a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; razor so I chose this. I get a decent shave with thist using a 4 pass technique. The feather blades are sharp! After a few weeks I&#x27;m looking into a razor upgrade, something with more weight and a more aggressive shaving action. All that being said I feel this is a good razor to see if you like the DE experience.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package I was disappointed until I put a blade in and had my first shave. I&#x27;d been using an old razor that I&#x27;ve had since the 80&#x27;s and this was a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment, and it&#x27;s just a preference, but I like a razor with a little &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34;, but this is my new daily and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE shaver, and I really like it!  Yes, the handle does have a tiny bit of plastic, but the most important parts are metal.  Also the unit might look like some cheap junk in the package picture here, but it does not feel cheap at all.  In fact it feels very high quality to me.  And after using it, I actually like the unit being partially plastic because it helps keep the weight down, which is already pretty hefty as it is.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Most inexpensive items don&#x27;t hold up or just don&#x27;t have the &#x27;fit and finish&#x27; you&#x27;re looking for. My last razor lasted 10 years but it was a $100 razor. For the rather low cost, I really didn&#x27;t expect much. I&#x27;ve been quite impressed! lightweight and the adjustor to open it up and replace blades works smoothly. A great value.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. It is much lighter than my Edwin Jagger. So I pair it up with Feather blades and use it as my travel razor--got the leather case too.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This razor works well, I have noticed that people on you tube have had to run 2 or 3 completed re-shaves when using shaving cream.  Because I use Bump Patrol, which is a clear slimy lubrication, I only have to do one complete shave. This is a good shaving razor.  Hard to get just under my nose though.</li>
    <li> I have one of those beards that is more like a wire brush. I have been known to ruin multi-blades razors with just one use. So I decided to go back to the old double edge razor blade. For the price I was more than pleased I have had one of the cleanest &amp; closes  shave I have had in years. I even used the same blade for the fourth day now with no discomfort. I&#x27;m very pleased and highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is made of plastic and it is too light to provide a comfortable feeling. It is too aggressive, I couldn&#x27;t get any shave without cuts and I ended up throwing it on the garbage. I used the blades in my Merkur razor with good results.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a unique razor.  I would not want to have it as my only razor, but I would really miss it if I didn&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave is exceedingly mild and for me requires PERFECT blade angle in order to get closest shave, especially if my beard is on the long side at the time.  Because of this, I wouldn&#x27;t want it as my only razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - for use as a secondary razor for touch up or polishing at the end of a shave - I love it.  Just buff away and there&#x27;s no skin loss or irritation.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. handle could be a bit larger for older hands.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and after having tried everything to stop razor burn (which for me lasted several painful days after a shave) I decided to make the change from using disposable razors with the various pre-shave/post-shave/supermarket shaving gels to an old fashioned pre-shave, cream applied with a boar brush, and this DE safety razor from Feather.  I IMMEDIATELY noticed MAJOR differences over what I had experienced the past 25 years of my shaving life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while I think using the Proraso pre-shave, cream, and post shave anti-irritation products definitely helped I know it was making the change to this type of razor that made the real difference.  After reading as much info as I could about DE shaving I decided the risk was well worth it and to be honest there really was virtually ZERO risk in making the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feather blades that come with it are incredibly sharp but this is not an aggressive razor.  Held at a 30 degree angle to your face, the razor simply glides through your facial hair.  Any nicks I did get on the initial shave (you do need to RE-LEARN how to shave with this) were small and honestly didn&#x27;t hurt a bit as the razor is so sharp that it literally simply sliced through the imperfection - rather than pulling and grabbing on it like the 3 or 5 blade disposables I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used the razor 6 times and have had ZERO nicks, cuts, burns, ingrown, etc. - which is absolutely remarkable to me.  Please take your time the first time you use it and understand NOT to use your wrist when manipulating the blade - this is what causes cuts.  Lock your wrist, use your shoulder to move it up and down an inch or so at a time and turn it/rinse it frequently.  Some hair will get trapped between the blade and the razor body itself so some extra careful cleaning may be needed to ensure the razors edge is fully accessible to your face.  BUT - it&#x27;s MUCH better than trying to clean hairs from between 3 or 5 blade disposables!  AND new blades cost pennies!  Saving you many dollars over the need to purchase new disposable heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making the change to the old style shave literally changed my life overnight.  Using a pre-shave, good puck shave cream applied with a brush, and a DE razor has been life changing for me.  (I purchased all Proraso stuff for my first go and couldn&#x27;t be happier.)  No more days and days of razor burn!  Save a ton of money shaving the old fashioned way - your face will thank you...I promise!</li>
    <li> wow !  i get a clean shave and this razor is easy to use and to clean after the shave. the price is right to.i recomend this to anyone who wants a great shave.</li>
    <li> Had this style of razor when I was in the Corp and never failed inspections for a straggly hair left behind, don&#x27;t remeber the name of razor or of blade picked up in Okinawa Japan. Lost my little razor I route to Australia and had to use the disposable razors I hated. Well I forgot of my little safety razor and happen to find a little read  when I wanted to learn about a straight razor. This little guy was just the ticket and to be honest g eats used more than my straight. One word of warning take your time don&#x27;t be scared of it and keep blade clean for the perfect shave. The blade I use is Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge. Just watch it with the blades they are very sharp, if it&#x27;s your first time with these razors get yourself the little pack that contains various blades. Try them out make your own decision but I will use nothing other than feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really don&#x27;t need to fancy expensive blades, google them in comparison to single blades less stuff to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shaving cream I use neutrogena crime for sensitive skin or a homemade shaving bar of menthol shop I pick up from a artsy fartsy store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN be careful with the feather blades don&#x27;t worry about razor just take your time.&lt;br /&gt; Make sure the blade in screwed down and losses death grip of the razor. You won&#x27;t kill yourself shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid against the grain for a few times once you get the hang of it enjoy</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described and very well packed. I have been shaving sporadically with this unit until i get the grip,</li>
    <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the blades that come with it don&#x27;t seem to be very sharp. But the razor is very easy to use and works great. Kind of lightweight due to plastic handle but that was expected at purchase.</li>
    <li> TAKES ME BACK TO THE DAYS OF A QUICK AND FAST SHAVE. I NOW GET THREE TIMES THE SHAVES AS WELL......</li>
    <li> This razor is as good as any and for far less cost. The precision stainless steel head is of very high quality and the plastic handle is more than adequate for the job at hand. If a merger of cost and function is what you seek, look no further. This razor is durable (I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months now), provides a close shave and doesn&#x27;t rust. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely well made razor - not surprising, coming from a company that makes surgical supplies. Everything about it seems very precise, and it shaves very cleanly. The only thing missing is some \\&quot;old school\\&quot; appeal - it doesn&#x27;t have quite as much of a retro look as some of the all-metal double-edge razors. And because it has a plastic handle, it is not as heavy as an all-metal razor. But that&#x27;s not a bad thing, particularly if you&#x27;ve become accustomed to lightweight modern razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is not as popular as the Parkers, Jaggers and Merkurs, but I think it&#x27;s probably every bit as good as them, if not better. My analogy would be comparing a Honda Accord to a 70&#x27;s muscle car. Most would admit the Accord is a better-made machine, but the muscle car has more \\&quot;cool\\&quot; appeal. For me, that&#x27;s how it is with the Jatai. It&#x27;s an excellent razor, but I&#x27;ll admit the heavy, shiny all-metal razors in my medicine cabin have more retro appeal to me. (I also own a couple of Parkers, Merkurs, a Jagger, and the ridiculously cheap-but-excellent \\&quot;Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor\\&quot; from uxcell.) I end up rotating between them, because to me, they all shave equally well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re not stuck on having the Harley Davidson appeal of a big chrome shaving implement (and/or you don&#x27;t feel like investing 30+ bucks for a razor), the Jatai is an excellent investment.</li>
    <li> Good quality product, works very well</li>
    <li> great shave works wonders</li>
    <li> got my face wet, used a nice cream. shaved slowly and carefully while shaving i noticed it just wasn&#x27;t clean but the real trouble was when I was done. My whole neck red and bleeding the majority of my face as well. I had to re shave with a modern razor and do damage control on the massive amount of damage that this trash left.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Gives a better shave than the multiple blade razors on the market and is a lot cheaper to replace the blade.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my trusty old Atra single-edge razor because Gillette decided to quit making blades for it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  This shaves every bit as well and costs less than twenty bucks.  I use Wilkinson Sword Classic blades (5 blades for about a buck-fifty) which are as good as any.  Most razors and blades these days are a total rip-off.  Do the math.  Shave more, spend less.</li>
    <li> Want to save money? Buy this razor! Want a close shave? Buy this razor!&lt;br /&gt;I am a girl, and use it religiously with my homemade shave oil. I never have bumps our burns anymore under my arms, though I still manage to nick myself a few times on my legs. Could be me, could be the razor...haven&#x27;t figured that out yet. But the fact that I have smooth underarms now makes one happy gal!</li>
    <li> My razor rusted after three weeks.  It was a relatively inexpensive way to try double edge shaving.  I have moved up to Merkur 34c and wish I would have bought it right away since it is so much better in every way.</li>
    <li> Not used to these. Get a few nicks almost every time. Close shave where the blood is not covering the skin. Maybe a little better than that. Practice makes better.</li>
    <li> Good shaver and as a black man didn&#x27;t bump me up or irritate my skin. I used a derby razor blade with art of shave kit</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift for my boyfriend he loves it and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t compare it to more expensive ones since I haven&#x27;t tried them, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. I got this as a test to see whether the more expensive version would be worthwhile (I&#x27;ve already got a nice DE razor, and even that doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s cheapest offering.) I&#x27;m the type to have baby soft skin, so maybe it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> My hubbie loves this now though he was intimidated at first.  Used to go through expensive razors so quickly with his thick facial hair and sensitive skin.  He has used this with the feather blades and gets long wear with them.  You will probably want to buy a caddy with this as it can easily cut you just laying in a toiletry bag.  The included case is good for gift giving but not toting around.  Only negative is that the raised hump of the razor makes it difficult to get under a stiff nose lol.  He hasn&#x27;t tried any other brands so I&#x27;m not sure if this is specific to this brand of razor.  We tried it bc of the price.  It was sturdy but not overly expensive.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very light....a little flimsy but a good way to start to see if you will like double edge razor shaving.....i am sure it will last but i might decide to upgrade in the future</li>
    <li> Does not like the open mechanism for blade loading. The traditional way (completely removal the top) works better as far as for cleaning aspect.</li>
    <li> I have finally tossed the silly dual, tri-, quad, quint nonsense blades forever!  This simple, elegant and very affordable solution will put a smile on your (well-shaved) face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good, and amazingly affordable, example of what is known as a &#x27;safety razor&#x27;.  I am just the right age that I remember these in my father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s medicine chests but have never seen them for sale in the consumer commodity stores, so I had no idea what I was missing or what a ridiculous and expensive path I was being led down by the mass market shaving industry.  I get, with almost exactly the same amount of effort and time, a much smoother shave.  I also have said goodbye forever to the problem of clearing my razor of shaved hair.  I will never go back!</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor, first one I&#x27;ve tried after making the switch to normal disposables.  I love this razor.</li>
    <li> My first DE safety razor, I found I definitely had to take things more slowly than with cartridge razors, but it was a satisfying experience.  It shaved close and feels like a sturdy product that will last a long while.  Some of the youtube videos I watched about shaving with a DE razor recommended getting the blade warm, and softening the beard with hot water and soap before shaving.  I tried this razor with and without doing that and it definitely makes a big difference.  I&#x27;m not sure I won&#x27;t buy any more cartridge razors, but I love this and plan on using it often.</li>
    <li> Goodbye expensive disposable  razors! This is perfect for the everyday shaver looking to replace your expensive disposables. The first shave was perfect and I still don&#x27;t even know how to properly use it. I had a few nicks but the cuts were so clean they did not bleed much at all. The &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; parts of this razor are a lot higher quality than I expected. This is definitely a keeper. Just remember it&#x27;s not the same process as shaving with a disposable, but it is well worth the excellent shave this gives you and the money saved on disposables.</li>
    <li> Great build, mine still works!</li>
    <li> I just used this product and it works just as advertised. I was a little worried about nicking myself at first however, with very little pressure the blade was able to just glide straight through and finish within a span of about 30 seconds without any hiccups, flaws or blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 2 blades.</li>
    <li> very good shave with feather blade. i will buy again</li>
    <li> great razor for the price</li>
    <li> I thought I would get remarkable shaves after reading all of the literature about these razors. After a few months of experimenting with angles, soaps, and pressures I still dont get as close of a shave with this razor as I do with a cheap disposable. It is a fun ritual, but I have not yet obtained a close shave. I may need to get a straight razor.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this razor for the plastic case, it broke within the first week. The razor itself is well designed, but cheap. Handle is plastic and so is the nut. I don&#x27;t anticipate this lasting very long. The parts should have been metal.</li>
    <li> I was tired of buying disposable razors or paying an arm and leg for name brand refills.  I figured I&#x27;d cut myself to ribbons, not being used to shaving with a double-edged razor, but I&#x27;ve shaved several times with it with nary a nick.</li>
    <li> Excellant razor. This is the first time buying this type of razor. I was tired of paying $16 for cartridges so I decided to try an old school razor. Best shave ever. The handle fits great in my hand and just glides over my face for a comfortable shave.  Definitely worth it</li>
    <li> sorely needed ....love the Old School!</li>
    <li> My first safety razor, it took some getting used to the blade against my face. The razor itself is very lightweight in comparison to all metal safety razors. I really like the butterfly twist open type makes it simple and easy to replace the blades. The safety razor also comes with a useful plastic see through case that also holds five blades.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with an electric shaver/razor and have tried several types of \\&quot;cartridge\\&quot; multi-blade razors, including recent 5 blade contraptions that to me were uncomfortable to shave with. The companies that make these cartridge razors increase the price for every new blade they add. It seems at some point the quality of the shave became less important and the sales of ever more expensive cartridges became the goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are all different, having various parts that snap together that are not compatible(between different razors). Sometimes looking at the cartridges I wondered whether they were designed to fail prematurely, spacing between the blades in some is limited and/or some plastic part would cause hair to become jammed in the crevice between the blades making the cartridge difficult to use, causing discomfort to my skin, and just failing to shave properly - result would be a need to replace the cartridge after a few uses. The price of cartridges did not go down when I used them regularly. I tried both store brand and \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Summer of 2011 I decided to give electric shaving a new try after using a Braun shaver/razor for some time with disappointing results about a decade ago. I bought a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; Norelco 7310XL and used that together with Afta Pre-Electric lotion until recently. It gave good results, but frequently left me with razor burn on my neck(even after using the lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric shaving in my opinion has its strengths. The Norelco shaver/razor uses long lasting blades that are replaced after 6-12 months. This helps reduce waste and cost. The bottles of lotion lasted me several months and are recyclable. If the shaver/razor is well made and lasts a long time overall waste is reduced. That can&#x27;t be said for \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razors that just fill up landfills, cartridge razors are only slightly less wasteful. I was looking for a shaving product that produces low amounts of waste, producesgood results as far as shave quality, and would be relatively cheap(affordable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Double Edge Safety razors a try together with \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving. This was all new to me, my grandfather used to shave this way. My father still has an old DE razor he received as a gift, with an old blade(which is like 20 years old) he virtually never uses. I wanted a newer one with a long handle. I decided to try this Feather razor with a Van Der Hagen brush, bowl, and soap kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial cost was around $30. Which was slightly more than the cost of replacing the blades on the Norelco shaver/razor. I did not want to spend a lot of money for something that I was not sure I would use for a very long time. I really did not want to buy a more expensive Parker, Merkur, or Edwin Jagger (etc.) razor so I went with the more affordable Feather. It likely has a lower price because it has more plastic parts(than other DE razors), which will likely reduce the razor&#x27;s service life. Although the moving parts appear to be made of metal(from the outside).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not really expecting much in shave quality, after all, I thought to myself, this is an \\&quot;older generation\\&quot; of shaving technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather razor arrived packaged with 2 Feather Hi-Stainless blades, which seem to have a reputation for being the \\&quot;sharpest DE blade\\&quot;. Many claim that the Feather blades are almost dangerous for beginners. I did not experience anything life threatening with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; design/type. Meaning the \\&quot;head\\&quot; opens up(into 2 identical metal pieces) through internal machinery, which is moved by a rotating mechanism on the upper part of the handle. The head is not removed like on certain (more basic) 3 piece razor designs. This makes replacing the blade a much simpler task. There is a metal \\&quot;retainer\\&quot;(best way to describe it) that holds the blade in place and divides the head into 2 distinct sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is mostly plastic with a good grip surface which prevents you from dropping the razor. The connection point between the head and handle is also made of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a few practice strokes on the neck with an un-even amount of shaving soap lather. After several shaving sessions I came to the conclusion that the Feather blade just seemed wrong for my skin(dry and easily irritated) and hair type. It left me with mild razor burn that went away after a few minutes, but made shaving my beard area somewhat uncomfortable. On my 3rd or 4th shaving session I tried a Wilkinson Sword blade, this too felt uncomfortable, plus I cut myself more often than I had with the Feather blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I next moved to an Astra blade, which did not cause me as much discomfort around my beard area although I was left with some cuts. After I started using a glycerin based soap the shaving experience improved significantly. I still use the Astra blades(they work well with the glycerin soap, lasting up to 6 shaving sessions per blade), being much cheaper than Feather blades I do expect to run into some \\&quot;bad apples\\&quot; while using them, which I won&#x27;t feel bad about replacing instantly because they are cheaper(especially when compared to cartridges).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed my own shaving regimen for this razor. The neck area receives 3 passes(2 up and 1 down), the sideburns 2 passes(1 up and 1 down), mustache 2.5 passes(1 down, 1 across, and some spots receive half of an upward pass), the most tricky beard area receives 3-5 passes(1 down, several across and up). I rotate the razor to use both sides of the blade. This regimen leaves me with smooth skin for up to a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note. It now takes me about 30 minutes to shave properly. I don&#x27;t do it in the morning, I shave in the evening before going to sleep(it helps to take a shower beforehand to soften the hairs and skin before shaving). This gives me the maximum amount of time to shave, because if you rush with DE razors you are more likely to cut yourself and leave behind some stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of Double Edge razors is that you do not feel like you are forced to conform to some Monopoly. You choose the blade you want to use, you choose the cream or soap you want to use, you choose the razor you want to use. What it could be called is \\&quot;open source\\&quot; shaving, like with computer software. I minimize the waste I produce - all I need to throw away are shaving soap packages(mostly paper) and used blades. I also purchased a Wilkinson Sword DE razor as an auxiliary razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Feather Double Edge razor to beginners, but the Feather blades are not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year. I don&#x27;t use it very heavily since I only shave 2-3 times a week (I don&#x27;t mind the stubble and shaving more often tends to cause people in my family trouble) and it&#x27;s really only for shaving around my beard. That said, every time I use it, I take the blade out and rinse the whole thing and dry it thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stands up really well to that sort of regular rigorous use of the butterfly mechanism and despite the steam from the shower, none of the parts of the razor have rusted. If I didn&#x27;t want to clean and dry it that way so often, I would probably be happier with a screw-together razor but I think this will hold together fine for at least another 2-3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for the blades that came with it and was glad I bought a 100ct. of another brand for about $8 at the same time. The one star comes off because I think it would be better to offer the razor without the \\&quot;freebie\\&quot; blades and at a slightly lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, shaving this way is much nicer and quite a bit cheaper than the new fashioned way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about coming back to double edge shaving after my own experience. I, like most of my male brethren, have been led to the false conclusion by the grooming companies that \\&quot;more blades are better.\\&quot; I am here to tell you that is not the case. I&#x27;ll be 53 at the end of the month and my face is breaking out like it did when I was 14. Recently, I have been using 5 blade cartridges from Rite-Aid/CVS/Safeway that were inexpensive when compared to the big guys (about half price for the same count of cartridges) but that weren&#x27;t as high quality. I started with the Dollar Shave Club six blade (!) alternative last month. The cost for that is $9.00 plus shipping per month for 4 carts. They aren&#x27;t the best either, with a comfort strip that can barely survive 1 or 2 days and a dullness threshold that is shocking. Fortunately, with DSC, they come every month, so you can use them with some impunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face, however, continued to look like the surface of Mars. Last month, I pulled an ingrown hair from my left cheek. Needless to say, that was the last straw. After some searching on ebay and Amazon, I found this Feather double edge handle. One of the reviews here compares this handle favorably to the Gilette G1000 (The Knack). I learned on a Gilette adjustable shortly before converting to the Atra in 1977 and not looking back. I compare the Feather handle to that, except for the fact that the adjustable was not an agressive shave by any measure. I remember only nicking myself a couple of times in the two or three years of use I got out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Feather this morning for the first time, It looks cheap, believe me, it isn&#x27;t. The business end holds the blade perfectly and the butterfly exposes the blade just right. The handle is balanced and it is just heavy enough. If you are coming back to DE shaving, you won&#x27;t have any trouble finding the right angle to shave at. If you are a beginner, watch a couple of Mantic59&#x27;s YouTube videos to get the technique. I had a good first time, I did a two pass shave because when I shave every day, I have a light to moderate growth. Lately, I let myself go on the weekends (it gives my face a chance to recover) so on Monday, I generally have a heavy growth, and I can let you know then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me also comment on the quality of the blades. These guys are sharp, certainly sharper than the Personas you get from CVS. I bought an extra 10 based on reviews ([[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]]) and will report on them in an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also picked up the [[ASIN:B004L4EING Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set]] and it&#x27;s pretty good too. I&#x27;ll have a review of that over there.e technique. I had a good first time, I did a two pass shave because when I shave every day, I have a light to moderate growth.

    <li> I bought this after my Edwin Jagger Razor broke. I figured I could save a few bucks. Despite being mostly made of plastic the build quality of the razor seems good. Replacing a blade is very simple and fast. My big issue with the razor is that it does not shave as well as the Edwin jagger or Merkur razors I have had. I think there are 3 factors causing this: 1. it is much lighter than something like a Merkur and you can&#x27;t really let the weight of the razor do the work. 2. I think the blade angle is different (less aggressive?) 3. It clogs much faster than other razors I have used. I am going to keep it for a travel razor, but I would suggest something more substantial for everyday use.</li>
    <li> A great razor and shave. A bit of nostalgia, but a good razor is a good razor. I was concerned about nicking myself, but have yet to need a styptic pencil. I prefer the shave to a double blade or other multi-bladed razor and it is much less expensive to use than others. Some things from the past deserve to live on. The razor seems well manufactured even with the plastic. I&#x27;ve seen no potential problems with it. It has been a very good investment.</li>
    <li> Although the razor is made of plastic, it is fairly sturdy and well put together.  I have not tried other brands of blades yet, but the Feather blade that came with the razor is really sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the Gillette Mach 3 exclusively, but I got tired of the high cartridge replacement cost.  This should cut my cost by half or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about the learning curve of using a double edge razor, but it really isn&#x27;t much different than using a single blade disposables.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for about 2 weeks now, and so far haven&#x27;t had any cuts or burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is more time consuming to shave with this razor than the Mach 3, and the shave is not as close on the first pass.  If it weren&#x27;t for the cost factor, I would prefer the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One gripe (1 star deduction) I have with the razor is that under both sides of the blade, there is a strip of plastic running perpendicular to the middle of the blade edge.  Those small areas get clogged every time you shave and cannot be cleaned out by rinsing alone.  You have to remove the blade and wipe it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just using regular canned shaving cream/gel at the moment but may try shaving soap with brush in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure how to rate this. I have never owned a single blade razor. It is comfortable, the weight seems to be balanced. The blade is easy to install and remove.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: The feather blades that come with the razor are fair. They last for upto 4 shaves. But after some research on the net, I discovered that Personna are even better. So, I bought a 100 count stash of Personna blades and I am very happy with them. The first one I used lasted 5 and still strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, as expected, I got used to the feel of a safety razor and now my shaves are taking much less time. If you are hesitating about whether you should dispose of the disposable razors forever, hesitate no more. You wont regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my Feather DE Razor today and had my first shave about 15 minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First experience out of the box: It is in a plastic box that looks a bit cheap but fairly practical. It keeps the razor and the spare blades nice and tidy. So, I will keep it. The razor has a solid feel and look to it. I think it would easily survive falls on the bathroom floor from my face level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: It was a breeze. No irritation, no cuts, no nicks. Moreover I had the closest shave in my life. But I must say, it took about twice the time I would spend using a disposable razor. Yet, the shave was so much superior and cut free that I think it is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Feather DE Razor is my first safety razor, and by the looks of it, it will be my only razor for a long time. I was very reluctant to buy this razor because in my 16 years of shaving as an adult, every time I tried a razor other than simple disposable razors, I felt deeply disappointed. But Feather is supremely different. I am so happy that I gave it a chance and it is worth every penny of the price I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review to include information about the durability of the blades that came with it. If they keep shaving like they did just today, I will be a lifetime customer for Feather DE blades.</li>
    <li> Just got this bad boy today and had a nice shave with it. It&#x27;s made of plastic, yes, but it has a very solid weight to it, and doesn&#x27;t feel very cheap. The metal head is durable enough, and the safety bar is comfortable and well-positioned. A great butterfly razor for those who want a reliable shave in their day to day life. I&#x27;ll keep updating this post throughout my use with the razor.</li>
    <li> I started looking into old-school safety razors because of the rapid spike in price of disposable blade cartridges.  Although the handle itself was not recommended to me, the Feather brand (specifically the blades) was.  Since the whole kit cost the same as a 5-pack of my normal blades, I figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is amazing and worth every dollar spent on it.  You know that feeling you get with a fresh blade?  Shaving with this razor feels at least twice that good.  I can barely feel it going across my face when even the newest disposables usually snag a little.  It delivers a smooth, consistent shave, and as long as I&#x27;m careful to approach my chin from all angles it doesn&#x27;t leave any stubble.  The handle has enough weight to make you appreciate what you&#x27;re using, but it&#x27;s light enough to be easily maneuvered, and although it&#x27;s double-edged I find myself consistently using just one side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the razor for its next use is relatively simple as well.  I find it works best if I gently wipe down the blade under running water (using the same motion one would use with a knife), rinse the handle, and then dry both with a hand towel instead of letting them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that it does not shave as closely as a multi-blade disposable does, but for me that&#x27;s a good thing.  My hair, including my beard, is very curly, so razors that &#x27;cut below the skin&#x27; leave me with a lot of bumps and general irritation.  That&#x27;s not a problem here; the shave I get with this razor is just close enough to look and feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, as the subject says, this is the Samurai sword of razors; light, sharp, and remarkably effective.  You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding a better shave at anywhere near the same price-point.</li>
    <li> Great product for those new to a DE safety razor. The packaging doesn&#x27;t look like it has changed since the 1960s and that&#x27;s a telling statement about it&#x27;s success. Some have complained about the primarily plastic construction (butterfly mechanism is all metal). If there&#x27;s such a s thing as premium plastic, this razor is made out of it. You could drop this off of a multi story building, use it for 40 years and then pass it on to your grandchildren. It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it comes with two Feather blades in the case. These things are sharp... too sharp to use for your first couple weeks of learned how to wet shave. Don&#x27;t make the mistake that I did and try to use them on your first attempt. There&#x27;s an art to shaving with a DE safety razor and the learning curve is steep. Save the Feather blades and use them later once you get proficient.</li>
    <li> Very close shave and easy to use.</li>
    <li> great shave, way better than spending so much money on double blade refills</li>
    <li> This razor with personna platinum chrome blades make a great team, for me. Close shave no blood. It&#x27;s very handy that I don&#x27;t have to take it apart to change blades. Cleans easily. One reviewer said his rusted. I&#x27;ve had this one over a year with no rust yet, I shave rinse it that&#x27;s it, no rust. I also have the wilkenson sword razor that I like, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close and I hafta take it apart to change blades.</li>
    <li> Good value that gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> The Feather Popular gives a fine shave.  It is very mild.  I like that it comes in a travel case.  The razor is too light making it feel cheap.  The handle is too long and too thin making it uncomfortable to hold.  I bought it for a travel razor.  I probably should have bought a Weishi instead as I find my old Gillette Super Speed a much better size and weight but don&#x27;t want to travel with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate. Easy to clean. Much cheaper than multi blade razors, and cheaper too. Definitely recommend swtiching from the overpriced Gillette products.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s a nice razor I went back to double edge disposables.</li>
    <li> Bought this to try out the Feather blades it came with before ordering a whole mess of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my back up razor to my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C.  Also comes with a nice hard plastic case so you could use this as your travel razor if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this one too, long than the Merkur 34C, light and comfortable.  I use it probably 2 x a week and the Merkur the rest of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This screws from underneath the head and opens up, drop blade in, and twist back the other way to close down on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to test out the feather blades and at the same time get a nice razor to go along with it, I would pick this up.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something a little more solid than what it is. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be all plastic. It is good as a backup shaver if I strip the threads on my primary metal shaver.</li>
    <li> For my first razor of this type it works well.  Keeps my face nice and tidy.</li>
    <li> Pretty mild razor, works best with feather blades. Light weight allows me to shave pretty fast. If you don&#x27;t throw it around it won&#x27;t break on you even though it&#x27;s plastic. If it cuts you it&#x27;s the technique, not the razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first Safety razor. I chose from a reputable name in the shaving industry. The handle is heavy black plastic with grip. Butterfly style open and close insert point. and comes with 2 Feather Blades.&lt;br /&gt;It may take some time to get used to this product or any for that matter if it is your first safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first try, I had a heavy set 1 week old beard. this bad boy took it off the first pass. Great product for the price. would recommend to first timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Well made and well priced. If you&#x27;re thinking about going DE buy this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather brand blades are amazing for the price. Much cheaper than Gilette/Shick/BIC etc. My original blade has lasted about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you .. This is a great razor of High quality seems like it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This was the second DE safety razor I purchased. Not an expert,  Im in that experimental mode to see what I like.  Figured this would be a great backup to my Edwin Jagger 89 that I could use for travel.  I like the Feather blades, and took the gamble on this razor.  It was a good bet.  I like the geometry of this razor. Getting the right blade angle to my skin is 2nd nature with this razors&#x27;s head. I have long thin fingers and find the handle more comfortable than the Edwin Jagger.  This razor does not feel cheap, but feels practical and functional. The blade locks in tight and square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this razor shines when there is only light beard growth to contend with as it is light weight. With heavier beard growth, the additional weight of an all metal razor head gives me slightly better control and smoother results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a great razor worthy of consideration.</li>
    <li> The razor handle and part of the body is made of plastics, but feels very solid and well-made.  Have confidence that it will last!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and I initially only tried it to see if it would help with ingrown facial hairs. This razor helped sell me on the whole experience. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure would work, but I also didn&#x27;t want to buy a cheap unbranded metal safety razor. I&#x27;d rather buy a mostly plastic item that is made in Japan by a surgical instrument company, than an unknown quality metal razor from China or the Middle East. As another reviewer mentioned, plastics and polymers are used with great success in high stress applications like guns, so I&#x27;m pretty sure they will do fine in a razor. I&#x27;ve been using disposable single blade bic razors for a while now, so this one actually felt quite substantial to me. The twist to open mechanism worked perfectly, and the lockup of the blade seemed solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Astra super platinum blades for this razor. The Feather blades are known to be the sharpest available, and are not recommended for beginners. The razor and blades came before the other shaving equipment, so my first shave was with Barbesol. It was noticeably better than the shaves I&#x27;d been getting with Bic razors. The razor felt smoother and more comfortable, and I got a closer shave with a single pass. I was surprised to see that the razor did a MUCH better job of cutting the whiskers just below my nose. I was worried that the large head would make that problem area even harder to shave, but the angle you use with the safety razor puts the blade right up against the bottom of your nose. I&#x27;d been nicking my nostrils trying to get to that spot with the disposables, but with a safety razor there&#x27;s no need to start your stroke that high in order to get a good cut there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my proraso and brush arrived I was able to whip up some proper shaving cream. The shave you get with real cream applied by a brush and a quality double edged razor blade is so much more comfortable than canned cream and disposable razors that I don&#x27;t even care if it helps with ingrown hairs. This is my new routine. I picked up a styptic pen at Wal Mart, but despite my concerns I haven&#x27;t gotten a single nick or &amp;#34;weeper.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the reviews you&#x27;ll see consecutive 1 star ratings because this razor is &amp;#34;too mild,&amp;#34; and then &amp;#34;too aggressive.&amp;#34; I found it to be very mild, but shaving experiences are subjective. Perhaps the one who called it too aggressive was using the included Feather blades. Within a few days I started hunting vintage razors at local antique and thrift stores. I ended up finding a great condition 1958 Gillette Superspeed at a local shop for $18. If there&#x27;s any reason not to buy this Feather razor, its if you find a vintage Superpeeisin good+ condition first at a comparable price. The Superspeed is a little slicker/smoother, just as comfortable, and shaves just a bit closer on the first pass. It is significantly heavier and much better looking than the Feather, but the Feather&#x27;s long handle feels better in my big hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing that I&#x27;ll add is that if I had it to do over again I&#x27;d buy a $17 premium boar hair brush instead of an $11 economy badger hair. I came across a vintage badger hair brush at an antique store for $6. It outperforms the new $11 one by a significant margin.</li>
    <li> Tired of exorbitant prices of cartridge systems, this was my foray into safety razors. Excellent, effortless shave since first shave :-)</li>
    <li> Coming from 2 all metal Merkur and Edwin Jagger which broke form a screw corrosion this Feather is like the cheap plastic disposable razor feel version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of those throw away razors, but since I had lots of razors left over I wanted to try something in the butterfly opening versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism is made from thin thin stainless, everything you see that is black is plastic.  The lightweight actually seems to give me more feedback when rushing a shave during the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its the kind you don&#x27;t mind bringing on a trip incase you loose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather blades that it comes with are very sharp not bad, but works well with Derby blades too.</li>
    <li> I know that this razor isn&#x27;t for everyone, but I really enjoy this one!  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I was a little concerned about the weight at first, but the head of the razor is heavy enough that it only needs light pressure for removing hair.  I have a pack of the Personna double-edge razors which are pretty good with this device.  I haven&#x27;t any nicks or cuts, save on where I went over an ingrown hair by accident.  (My fault.)  I use this razor with really hot water, an ordinary shave soap and Shave Secret shave oil and I consistently get a good shave every time. The two things I really like about the razor aside from the shave; the plastic handle and the loose tolerance for the locking mechanism ensures that it won&#x27;t freeze shut over time.  That is what happened to my last razor which was a Micro Touch Safety Razor.  I liked that one two, but after almost a year, it refused to open.  I don&#x27;t see that happening with this one!</li>
    <li> This razor gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had outside a barber shop bar none. No razor burn or face irritation whatsoever. I&#x27;m not very careful when I shave because I shave fast and no cuts. I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t cut yourself but you&#x27;ll have to try pretty hard. I can&#x27;t say enough about how well it shaves. I just wish they made it in an all metal model. Don&#x27;t get me wrong because there is absolutely nothing wrong with it as it is but I wonder if it will pass the test of time being made of plastic. Oh well, at 14 bucks I can just buy me some spares. As a matter of fact, that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m going to do. Do your face a big favor and get one.</li>
    <li> I will never ever go back to expensive 3-5 blade razors these are the best shave you will get.  You need to go a little slower but once you get the hang of it the time difference is less than 1 min longer than my old expensive razors. Just a word of caution, if you have any moles skin tags or just bumps this will fix that quick and painfully, so watch it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a D/E shaver since I was 18 (45 years ago).  The Feather razor is an excellent way to get reacquainted with a more retro shaving experience.  The price was right and the razor seems to be solidly built.  There may be benefits to using the &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34;, more expensive razors, but for now I love the Feather product.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Shipment received within a few days.</li>
    <li> Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tbone</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor.  It has a nice textured grip, and the black color looks nice.  The shave head part is smooth.  The mechanism works well.  It comes in a plastic case that can be used for travel.</li>
    <li> For almost $20 you get something that is almost all plastic except for the butterfly doors and the blade.  I say spend just a few dollars more for a Parker, at least it has some weight and will last.  I thought I would try this one because I like feather blades so maybe there would by some senergy, there wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave wise, it does perform pretty well, I find it a little aggressive.  I guess it&#x27;s ok if you are just starting out and want to see if safety razors are your thing.  If you are new, it is aggressive and will nick and razor burn you, procede with caution.  I guess once you get use to this one, I imagine you will have no problems with any other razor.</li>
    <li> I made the switch from disposable razors to a double edge razor. The Amazon reviews help me decide on this brand. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, and it&#x27;s not flashy, but it does perform as I was hoping. It is durable and dependable. I&#x27;m glad I made the switch, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this razor.</li>
    <li> This is a very good entry level razor. The components are economical (plastic parts) but the moving parts work well with no binding.  The razor blade fits nicely and is held firmly in place when closed.  The 5 star review is based on the fact that it is an economical razor.  The price was really good.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a newbie into the world of wet-shaving, I would recommend the Edwin Jagger De89lbl since I learned to shave better with a heavier razor.  This thing is so light as a feather that you will use extra pressure which you&#x27;re not suppose to, and you&#x27;ll cry when you slap that alcohol aftershave on your face.  Once I learned the proper techniques to use this cheapo device, my shaving experience became alot easier to deal with and cuts up my hairs like a ninja.  Kind of like playing fruit ninja on my android, but without the irritation.  The only con is that it looks like a cheap plastic kiddie toy...I probably mentioned that earlier.</li>
    <li> Definitely &#x27;on the mild side,&#x27; but I knew when I bought it. It can be tricky to get a close shave out of this one, especially as your blade dulls, but fortunately, it comes with 5 light, sharp, and durable blades.  UPDATE: This might not be the longest-lived handle out there, but that&#x27;s the price one pays to pack light I suppose.  A very &#x27;safe&#x27; razor: I&#x27;ve only cut myself twice in several weeks, and that was because I didn&#x27;t change the blade when I knew I should&#x27;ve.  The razor handle itself is light and strong; I tend to expect plastics to discolor, feel &#x27;cheap,&#x27; or start to crack, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it thus far. It&#x27;s excellent for travel; the plastic box it comes with is a little bulky, but a good place to store and pack it.</li>
    <li> This is a very mild shave that I use for sensitive areas. This is the cheapest razor you can buy that will cause the least irritation, but you should use another more aggressive razor in conjunction with this for a perfect shave. Construction is good and still has some heft to it even though a lot of it is made out of plastic. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time DE user and it was a pinch using this razor. You may have to shave twice to get your face smooth so this method of shaving isn&#x27;t for the person in a rush. I&#x27;m glad that I bought this razor and started shaving this way.</li>
    <li> This is what is known as a great value - above average quality for the price paid (less than $12).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction appears to be outstanding (very few things made in Japan are of poor quality, I think) and it functions well.  This razor is much lighter weight than the normal all-metal DE (double edge) razors because of the plastic handle and guard.  The enclosed Feather-brand blades work flawlessly and the lightweight plastic case will work well for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have smaller than average man hands (glove size 8) and the only improvement that I would suggest in the design of this razor is to make the standard-sized handle an inch longer.  However, this does not detract from the value of this razor.  While I have only owned this razor for a few days, I predict that it will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note, the butterfly-opening top is a much easier design for cleaning than the design where the top comes apart.  I remove the blade and wipe it with the corner of a hand towel after rinsing it off (after shaving) as well as rinsing off the razor itself.  I then lay the blade back in the open butterfly-style top for drying until I use it next.  I have a coffee mug on my bathroom vanity where I place it so it stands upright to dry (and leans slightly to one side like a pencil in a coffee mug).  I also use &amp;#34;Shave Secret&amp;#34; shaving oil (MUCH better than creams, gels, or soaps, in my opinion) so cleaning it after each use keep the excess shaving oil off of it as well.  (I purchase the Shave Secret shaving oil at my local Walmart for $3.82 plus sales tax - that&#x27;s cheaper than any online price including Amazon.)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a spare for my Merkur, to be used while traveling.  I like it better than the Merkur!  Plastic, but not cheap.  This is a great value.</li>
    <li> Plastic. Sturdy, cuts good but its plastic.</li>
    <li> What a piece of %$#@ and no refund available. Guess I got taken on this one.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Nice razor for a good price. Highly recommend for someone looking for value at a low price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plastic, yet this is the razor I shave with the most hands down. I wish there was another option other than the $200 all stainless feather razor. Love the long handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve figured out why they don&#x27;t really sell these anymore...newer disposable razor cartridges just do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the modern multi-blade disposable shaving cartridge is right up there with inkjet printer cartridges (is it a &amp;#34;cartridge&amp;#34; thing...) as some of the MOST OVER PRICED items we purchase on a regular basis.  When I saw that I can buy a 100 razors for this shaver for under $10 I though, &amp;#34;What the heck, give it a try!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m 51 and have been using a shaving brush and mug soap for years and wanted to go &amp;#34;Mad Men&amp;#34; with my razor and see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plane &amp; simple, the newer multi-blade razors just work better for me.  I tried the Feather Razor for two-weeks and while it did an OK job, my Schick Quattro blades did a much better job with none of the nicks and cuts.  After the first few tries with my Feather razor my neck looked like a war zone with numerous small cuts.  After awhile I figured out the best angle to use the razor &amp; how much pressure to apply to get a semi-close shave but reduce the cuts.  I think this is where the modern multi-blades shine.  The pivoting head keeps the blades at the correct angle and you can pretty much push as hard as you want (within reason) and still not cut your face.  My goodness I sound like a TV commercial...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this razor seems good and I really liked how clean the blade stayed.  The only thing that I dislike about the modern multi-blade cartridge (except the price) is how clogged the blades get with hairs &amp; soap.  You just can&#x27;t clean that stuff out of there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using it every now &amp; then to see if my skills improve.  I think this is a solid model at a nice, &amp;#34;Give it a try&amp;#34; price.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Maybe the best choice that straddles the ground between a disposable and a double edged razor. Light weight, light price.</li>
    <li> I agree with most of the reviews here that this is basically an excellent razor for the money, but I have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I am the only one who has trouble gripping the razor but I often find the glossy plastic handle difficult to grip making fine control of the razor problematic. Perhaps it&#x27;s just not a good match for those of us with a light touch. It is my only complaint with this specific razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I use it mostly on weekends. During the week I just want to get the job done and don&#x27;t want to spend the extra time and care that double-edge razor shaving can require and so I often revert to more modern multi-blade shaving. I&#x27;ll give it some more time to see if double-edge shaving is for me.</li>
    <li> With the cost of my cartridge razor refills running $2.50 to $3 each, I decided to try a DE razor, but I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank on my first one.  The price is right on this one and after three weeks I can say this is a really great razor that is worth more than I paid for it.  I only shave every two to three days and for me, shaving is all about just getting the scruff off my face; Comfort is my next priority, with closeness a distant third.  This razor produces a comfortable shave even for a first-timer like me, without cutting up my face like my fancy Mach64 wonder-razor.  I&#x27;ve got less razor burn and less discomfort after my shave.  Since I don&#x27;t care too much about a close shave it doesn&#x27;t much matter to me that it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my cartridge razor.  If you&#x27;re willing to spend more time on your shave than I do it would likely shave just as close as you want it to.  My only complaint - it&#x27;s minor, considering I gave it five stars - is the material.  I love plastic and it doesn&#x27;t bother me that this razor is made of it, but it sure doesn&#x27;t weigh much.  Researching DE shaving before taking the plunge, I read a lot about \\&quot;letting the weight of the razor do the work\\&quot; and not putting pressure on the razor.  Since this thing weighs next to nothing, there isn&#x27;t much weight to do the work for me.  I handle the razor with my fingertips and put very light pressure on the head while I shave.  That works fine; it weighs and handles just about the same as my cartridge razor.  Just be aware that it&#x27;s very light and will handle differently than a metal razor.  The Feather blades that come with it are excellent.  Since I&#x27;ll be paying about $.20 per blade, instead of 2 or 3 bucks, this razor will probably pay for itself, too.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Gave this item as a gift for a girl I was dating to stop her from using my Merkur. She loved it. I also gave her an assortment of blades from a sample pack I purchased. This way she can see which works best for legs.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and as I get used to using it I&#x27;m more happy with the shave. I get anywhere between 5-10 shaves per blade. Which is pretty good considering my very coarse hair.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected but it works very well.  Just have to get used to it instead of using the expensive cartridges for the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Okay first off, people saying &amp;#34;oh so much better then a Mach 3&amp;#34; duh lol... that&#x27;s a given. These type of products are far better then razors the big companies put out. Of course they want you to pay absurd amounts of money for cartridge refills.. They have Big houses, fancy cars, and lavish vacations to go on. Yes its under a Jackson and is made of plastic...Your car is also made of plastic and I&#x27;m sure it runs fine. If you want a heavy metal double edge go buy a Merkur for much more and stop complaining. It works great and gets the job done, the shave is a mild angle for vets out their but overall fantastic. Smile after your done with all the money you save.</li>
    <li> My friends told me to go old school.  I was pretty aggravated with the cost of razor blades and was motivated to try something else.  I got some Proraso cream in a tube and this razor.  I have to say it&#x27;s a pleasurable experience and an invigorating very close shave.  Since this was my first effort I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much in case it wasn&#x27;t for me.  At this point, I am completely happy with this razor and glad I tried it out.  I guess they say the Feather is the sharpest blade, I took it slow, no cuts or any irritation.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> First time Double-Edge safety razor user here.  I wanted to stop paying the exorbitant &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razor prices, so decided to go old school.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t do this years ago.  I get a very nice clean shave. I looked at the Merkur razors first, but thought I should try something less expensive first just to make sure I was ready to take the leap. This is a very capable, good quality razor that is easy to load and use. My hair stylist swears by Feather products, and I can see why.  For the money, it&#x27;s hard to beat.  Comes in a plastic see-through case with two razor blades.  If you are a first time user to this style razor, check out the many independent &amp;#34;How to use&amp;#34; videos on youtube. There is one that actually features this razor.  Bye bye big razor prices!!</li>
    <li> Caveat: this was is my first razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has been quite good.  I think blades/soap are more important, and so far that has been the case (experience will may change this).  That said, the locking mechanism loosens randomly.  Not sure if more expensive models do this as well.</li>
    <li> unsuitable for my face/beard</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a Gillette, Merkur or EJ but it&#x27;s a very decent razor in a pinch. I keep mine in my locker at work for that off occasion. A bit on the aggressive side but better than a cartridge any day.</li>
    <li> I have had my razor now for almost two years and let me tell you this razor is awsome and with feather blades it&#x27;s super awsome I got this razor when I was just starting de shaving and I had already had a couple of razor I now have 12 de razors all together and this is the one I use every day I would and have recommended this product to my father and he loves this razor as well</li>
    <li> I used to shave with a Gillette adjustable double edge razor when I learned to shave (sorry I ditched the razor a long time ago).  The Feather Double-Edge Razor is as I stated in the review title: Low cost and simply elegant.  It gives me a close, clean shave, with little irritation. It is not adjustable but gives a great shave that stays smooth all day. I could not say that with the new multi-blade razors made by Gillette, et al.  I looked at some other razors in the same price range that I could view first hand in stores, but there was no comparison to the fit and finish of the Feather.</li>
    <li> Paired with a sharp blade (my choice is the Giillette Silver Blue or 7 O&#x27;clock Black) and you&#x27;ll wonder why you waited so long to switch! The razor is easy to clean and I sit in in a slot of my toothbrush holder to dry. The simple pleasures are the best.</li>
    <li> As much as he can love shaving, this razor really does the job.  The blade has lasted and lasted through many shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first safety razor after long using Gillette Fusion Proglide razors.  It isn&#x27;t as fast shaving with this but it gets a better shave in my opinion.  I have since upgraded to Merker adjustable but this still works greats.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. My review will change when this product breaks (and I feel it will in time) to represent the value over time I received from it. But, it is holding up strong for now, and the value is solid until it fails. Down the line, I want a 100% stainless safety razor but they cost a few hundred dollars. So, until then, I am one of the unwashed (but not unshaved) masses who has to make due.</li>
    <li> Being new to double-edge shaving, I’ve been reading for a few years all these rave reviews about how smooth &amp; easy a shave you can get with these razors.  With this Feather DE Razor, I have found this to be absolutely true, and I’m having the easiest &amp; closest shaves I’ve ever had. I have a moderate to heavy beard and, with the Feather razor, I don’t have to push hard or repeat strokes to get a good shave.  The extra-long handle balances nicely in the hand.  And for all the talk about the plastic in the handle, the weight &amp; feel suggests to me that the plastic covers a metal core of the handle.  Anyway, it feels very solid. The razor comes with 2 Feather blades.  Yes, the blades are very sharp, but also very smooth.  Some of the reviews here talk about the Feather blades being “unforgiving” or prone to unexpected cutting.  All I can say is that I’ve never cut myself with this razor. One more note about double-edge blades:  I’ve found that if I thoroughly rinse the blade after every use, fully open the cutting head to let both razor &amp; blade completely dry, and flip the blade over every time I shave—I can get a double-edge blade to last two months or longer! Anyway, this is a great razor, and super-economical to boot!</li>
    <li> I feel really, really bad for using those cheep throw-away razors for so long....waking up to the indignity of trying to get a close shave those cheap products.  The countless nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I got fed up and bought the Feather Double Edge Razor.  I am in absolute heaven.  Not only is the shave close, the blades are good and stay sharp for 2-6 shaves.  No more of trying to rinse the blade clean with that sticky glue the Gillette engineers use in the throw away blades. The shave is so close and with few cuts, my chin feels like a new born baby and I feel like a brand new man.  I would recommend any man not to hesitate.  Get rid of throw-aways.  This takes shaving to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also want to order extra replacement blades, so as to not run out.  I ordered 50 for a reasonable price, which should last me 6 months.</li>
