      <li>What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
      <li>Plus my kids love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to avoid cavities.</li>

      <li>The three pack makes it a better value than what you find in the store.</li>
      <li>I would like my toothpaste to smell more minty.</li>
      <li>Way to many people use products improperly and then complain about having issues with said products.</li>
      <li>To many people do that</li>
      <li>Make sure and rinse your mouth out thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many of the organic toothpastes out there contain salt.</li>
      <li>This Crest Toothpaste is an easily usable product that I was very satisfied with the economical pricing.</li>
      <li>I find this kind by far the most refreshing and satisfying brand.</li>
      <li>This bundle is an especially great purchase due to the price.</li>
      <li>that will make this product more consumer friendly</li>
      <li>(we bought other brand before, the tube already out of the package, toothpaste  created mess...but not this time, really happy with it!)</li>
      <li>Still, for me, that is fine.</li>
      <li>Little foam - it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>A fantastic value.</li>
      <li>You couldn&#x27;t get this price in a store, unless there was a fabulous sale and you had a coupon.</li>
      <li>This is a great value pack for the whole family or for your self this whole year.</li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>Studied more than just about any other toothpaste, and more effective at preventing cavities than $20 tubes with all the bells and whistles.  </li>
      <li>It makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed every time I brush my teeth.</li>
      <li>adn keep them clean.</li>
      <li>We got this at a special price.</li>
      <li>Simple, inexpensive, good toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Great as I am not supposed to use whitening toothpaste due to a tooth with a receding gum.</li>
      <li>Rinses well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to replace another super whitening toothpaste - that toothpaste caused the mucosa of my mouth to peel every night after using the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for offering us such a great deal.</li>
      <li>So just because it says &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; does NOT mean it is better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The value pack was very reasonable and the toothpaste gives a clean feeling and works well for us both on manual and electronic toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Although there&#x27;s only me, I sure won&#x27;t run out any time soon!</li>
      <li>This one is just right.  </li>
      <li>Plus with Subscribe And Save out comes right to my front door.</li>
      <li>it when on sale, so the price was right too.</li>
      <li>The content of the product is full and is as good as usual.</li>
      <li>Tubes are sure big though so the price was right.</li>
      <li>I tried Crest for the first time since it was on sale at Amazon (triple pack).  </li>
      <li>Sort of a bulk purchase without being way too much and still saved money (and time!)</li>
      <li>A three pack can cost only 5.00 and you save even more with the five percent off when you use subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many of the variations that the level of increasing nastiness chased me back to the one with which I started.</li>
      <li>In order to buy this cheap had to bundle it with a higher price item so they could ship it free with other item.</li>
      <li>My husband love it, used that brand for long time, fast handling, packed really well</li>
      <li>Singing praises to a good toothpaste is a hard task.</li>
      <li>Really like toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Bought these ones on the recommendation of the very helpful Amazon reviewers, also the price was not too shabby considering they arrived at my doorstop, no driving time on my part.</li>
      <li>I save so much money this way.</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied with this product.  </li>
      <li>Very profitable.</li>
      <li>may not be the cheapest way to get it, but due to fragrance sensitivity, I love the convenience of buying things online instead of putting up with all the smells in the discount stores.)</li>
      <li>After brushing I have to use mouthwash everytime to feel clean enough.</li>
      <li>Because if you want whitening power, then you might have to forego extra scope for clean breath, or who knows?</li>
      <li>Regular flavor - no too sweet, not too savory.</li>
      <li>As soon I started using my newly bought crest toothpaste, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth don&#x27;t hurt as much and probably will save on going to the dentist.</li>
      <li>I think I let advertisers convince me that I needed more or maybe less in my toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Classic Crest.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If I had my choice I would use the optics whitening tooth paste, but that&#x27;s just an added bonus. The Crest were a great deal and it&#x27;s toothpaste that works. If you take care of your teeth, they take care of you. Don&#x27;t forget to floss!</li>
    <li> Good buy, Great product.  I like getting good buys and this is one.  If this product is not on sale where we live I will have to pay around $6.00 a box.  Good buy.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say, works as expected, just want to rate it with stars and move on to something else.  So...</li>
    <li> I always prefer to buy a bundled package of a product that is used every day anyway.  Although there&#x27;s only me, I sure won&#x27;t run out any time soon!</li>
    <li> I love this smell and taste to crest. The price is great and so is the product. This is a great value for the size you are receiving. I have purchased this product numerous time through amazon.</li>
    <li> I have started to order all my staple items monthly. I save so much money this way. The three in a pack is excellent value. No running out any more</li>
    <li> I hate going to the grocery store just to get toothpaste and I always seem to forget so its awesome i can get a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a toothpaste without flouride for a while (because apparently flouride is poison if u swallow it), and I noticed my dental health has deterioated. As soon I started using my newly bought crest toothpaste, I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth don&#x27;t hurt as much and probably will save on going to the dentist.</li>
    <li> My wife has always had a hard time finding a toothpaste she likes and would complain about not being able to find the, &amp;#34;just plain Crest&amp;#34; that she used growing up. While we couldn&#x27;t find it in any store, I finally found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was ecstatic and she loves this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> The flavor is just not strong enough for me. After brushing I have to use mouthwash everytime to feel clean enough.</li>
    <li> quality as expected for crest, just like from other stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought it when on sale, so the price was right too.</li>
    <li> Great as I am not supposed to use whitening toothpaste due to a tooth with a receding gum. Nice flavor.</li>
    <li> best price , excellent tooth paste .</li>
    <li> The value pack was very reasonable and the toothpaste gives a clean feeling and works well for us both on manual and electronic toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I like to have extra&#x27;s when I shop and this value was a good deal.  This toothpaste worked great for me.  I go to the dentist every 6months and with very limited flossing and this toothpaste twice a day I had 0 tarter build up and 0 cavities.</li>
    <li> I use this and for the 3/ 6.4 oz package Amazon cannot be beaten for the price. A three pack can cost only 5.00 and you save even more with the five percent off when you use subscribe and save. This price beats your neighborhood store anytime.</li>
    <li> this is your basic Crest from 30 years ago.  I prefer a little more freshening to go along with my cavity protection.</li>
    <li> It is great product. I recommend to all people. Try one time and it like to me. I am very happy</li>
    <li> Singing praises to a good toothpaste is a hard task. There are so many out there! Bought these ones on the recommendation of the very helpful Amazon reviewers, also the price was not too shabby considering they arrived at my doorstop, no driving time on my part. I had the name brands over the years, back and forth, Colgate, Crest, AquaFresh, Pepsodent, etc. This product does the job, I did not find anything exceptional besides the well known facts that this toothpaste provides so many forms of protection. Because as we all well know, some provide these ones with the check marks, other have other properties, and hopefully, as a consumer I always with, one would provide all the checkmarks. Because if you want whitening power, then you might have to forego extra scope for clean breath, or who knows?, maybe have to let go of cavities protection. A little complicated, so the one with the most checkmarks ends up in the cart. 3.5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I would like my toothpaste to smell more minty. However, as always Crest gets the job done with the Cavity Protection. Good Product.</li>
    <li> Husband uses this as he does not mind the taste.  Cleans good enough but not the best. Tubes are sure big though so the price was right.</li>
    <li> Simple, inexpensive, good toothpaste. I use it with my SonicCare toothbrush - works great. Cleans well. Not overly minty, so I can tolerate it - I prefer not too minty toothpaste. Rinses well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to replace another super whitening toothpaste - that toothpaste caused the mucosa of my mouth to peel every night after using the toothpaste. Yuck! This one (to my relief) doesn&#x27;t do that, so I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> Yes it has fluoride, and yes fluoride is toxic if swallowed. However this stuff really does protect your teeth from tooth decay, and slows down that decay drastically. If you&#x27;re worried about the fluoride, then I&#x27;d suggest a few common sense things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Only use a small pea sized amount on your toothbrush. Don&#x27;t flood the toothbrush with paste. To many people do that and it causes problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Do NOT swallow toothpaste. Make sure and rinse your mouth out thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. For kids, I&#x27;d recommend a non-fluoride toothpaste like Tom&#x27;s Of Maine or just use plain ordinary Baking soda to brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Be careful if you buy &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; toothpaste. Many of the organic toothpastes out there contain salt. Salt will eat into your tooth enamel and make your teeth worse then if you just use ordinary fluoride toothpaste. So just because it says &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; does NOT mean it is better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Always, always, ALWAYS, follow the directions as written on the product. Way to many people use products improperly and then complain about having issues with said products. Those directions are not just for show folks, they are there for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Brushing</li>
    <li> Crest Cavity Protection Toothpaste is a good one. you get 3 at a good price. They should have variants in the pack of 3. that will make this product more consumer friendly</li>
    <li> Yip its toothpaste not a whole lot to add about that and it does seem to do what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Really like Crest brand of toothpaste - it tastes good and it does a great job of keeping teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband. He has been a &amp;#34;Crest- only&amp;#34; person since he was in junior high. You know it&#x27;s good when somebody has more brand loyalty for toothpaste than for anything he eats or drinks.&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It may not be the cheapest way to get it, but due to fragrance sensitivity, I love the convenience of buying things online instead of putting up with all the smells in the discount stores.)</li>
    <li> great bargain, cheaper than walmart, tasted ok, quality was ok, did not have any expired feeling issues. i wish i could still order it at the same price again.</li>
    <li> To preface, I should state I normally use colgate.  I tried Crest for the first time since it was on sale at Amazon (triple pack).  After trying it out for a few days I finally just threw it all away.  The crest tooth paste did not feel like it was cleaning my teeth like the colgate toothpaste.  I could rub a tooth pick on my teeth after brushing with crest and come up with a bunch of plack gunk that wouldnt be there if I used Colgate.  I am not affiliated with Colgate in any form but I definately prefer Colgate to Crest.</li>
    <li> This is the toothpaste I&#x27;ve always used an I have no reason to switch.  My wife tells me I have wonderful breath and I&#x27;ve been able to avoid cavities.</li>
    <li> This Crest Toothpaste is an easily usable product that I was very satisfied with the economical pricing. I keep coming back to this product.</li>
    <li> We got this at a special price. Could not buy it local for near the rice we got this. In order to buy this cheap had to bundle it with a higher price item so they could ship it free with other item.</li>
    <li> Before switching, I had been using all different kinds of teeth-whitening, breath-protecting, 4D-or-what-not toothpaste. I find this kind by far the most refreshing and satisfying brand. It makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed every time I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Plus my kids love it. The three pack makes it a better value than what you find in the store. Plus with Subscribe And Save out comes right to my front door. What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
    <li> Nothing beats old school Crest! It has worked all these years for me, so why would I change a good thing?</li>
    <li> This is a great value pack for the whole family or for your self this whole year. Toothpaste that you know of. Nothing fancy, no frills for trusted brands for generations. Save a few bucks for something else bigger.</li>
    <li> My husband love it, used that brand for long time, fast handling, packed really well (we bought other brand before, the tube already out of the package, toothpaste  created mess...but not this time, really happy with it!)</li>
    <li> Classic Crest. Studied more than just about any other toothpaste, and more effective at preventing cavities than $20 tubes with all the bells and whistles.  At $1.50 per tube, stock up!</li>
    <li> Very unsatisfied with this product.  Nothing to do with prize or Amazon, just not a toothpaste I would like to use again.  Very watery and taste really bad.</li>
    <li> It is a very good price for the pack of three toothpaste. I can split the price with my friends and it saves me trouble going out to buy them.</li>
    <li> I think I let advertisers convince me that I needed more or maybe less in my toothpaste. I have tried so many of the variations that the level of increasing nastiness chased me back to the one with which I started. Sort of. This is not the white paste I but the upgraded gel. Still, for me, that is fine.</li>
    <li> Really like toothpaste. Refreshes and cleans. Little foam - it&#x27;s great! Very profitable. Long enough to pack. The price is very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with this. I find most toothpaste brands to be nauseatingly minty. This one is just right.  It&#x27;s definitely toothpaste, gets the job done. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending much more than $5 on the 3-pack though.</li>
    <li> The fresh taste of this toothpaste is great, it will make you brush more than once a day. It&#x27;s also fighting cavities.</li>
    <li> i brought this when it is on sale, and it is a very suitable prize for this product. so far so good</li>
    <li> Toothpastes are so damn expensive! This pack saves money and doesn&#x27;t disappoint either. Priced well on Amazon and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> A fantastic value. Yes, you will get 3 toothpastes. Cavity protection is the key feature here. If you are not looking for some fancy extras like colors or whitening, this toothpast will do its job, protect your teeth adn keep them clean.</li>
    <li> Came in tubes. Kept my teeth cavity-free. Regular flavor - no too sweet, not too savory. Not mint, either. Just regular.</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with Crest? Its ADA approved, tastes great (and not weirdly fruity) and does the job. This bundle is an especially great purchase due to the price. You couldn&#x27;t get this price in a store, unless there was a fabulous sale and you had a coupon. Stock up and save! I should have ordered two bundles!</li>
    <li> The content of the product is full and is as good as usual. Especially, the 3-pack toothpaste can save you more money than product each one individually. Recommended products for future shopping. Thanks Amazon for offering us such a great deal. 5-star service rated.</li>
    <li> Good but pricey. Thought it was a 6 pack before ordering.</li>
    <li> works like it should, its convenient from amazon, great value for this pack. I&#x27;m a young college student learning independency and amazon (prime I guess) really helps me like a dear, dear friend lol so yeah if you need toothpaste for a great value, here ya go</li>
    <li> I hate to run out of things so this works great! Sort of a bulk purchase without being way too much and still saved money (and time!) over going to the store for it!</li>
    <li> There is no reason not to buy toothpaste in bulk like this. Standard toothpaste with the standard nozzle. Good price.</li>
    <li> I got this when it was on sale, really good price, and I have no doubt with Crest toothpaste&#x27;s quality.</li>
