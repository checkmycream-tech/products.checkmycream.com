      <li>; goes smoothly and stays all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a universal color in my opinion, and looks great on all skin tones.  </li>
      <li>However, the new Bare Skin serum foundation is wonderful and gives me an even, satin finish that wears well all day.  </li>
      <li>Good to know that I can get it on Amazon and for about the same price as in the store.  </li>

      <li>blue based so it suits warm and cool skin tones as well as neutral ones like mine.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is a little pricey, but great quality.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re definitely worth every penny.</li>
      <li>goes on easy, so natural looking and stays on all day.  </li>
      <li>Here in Texas where is hot and humid</li>
      <li>It takes a very small amount of this powder to get a great result so the container lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>I always feel like I end up with too much blush and my cheeks end up pinker than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
      <li>Very affordable.</li>
      <li>The container is also very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I really like that you can tap out</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t wear it every day, I do use it very often and it only takes a little bit to give a nice flush.  </li>

      <li>I really like the BM blush brushes and I have collected several over the years.  </li>
      <li>This color can be used for any skin tone, between a pink and rose , very pretty, Of course if you don&#x27;t like loose powder blush, its not for you, but knowing it is natural and won&#x27;t have a negative effect on skin is enough for me.</li>

    <li> Works great on my skin type which is very sensitive.  A wonderful coverup and lasts a decent length of time until refill needed.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.; goes smoothly and stays all day. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Never been much of a blush person, but I&#x27;m glad I took the leap. This stuff is a little pricey, but great quality. I also purchased a cheaper, lighter cream-based blush at the same time to compare and it doesn&#x27;t even come close. I got this in the colour &#x27;Beauty&#x27;, and it does indeed work beautifully against my pale skin. It only takes the tiniest bit to produce a nice, smooth, natural-looking colour. Blends easily. I imagine this container will last me quite a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the same product that I had purchased at a local store which later went out of business. Glad that I could find it online. I have blonde hair and fair skin, and this is a good blush color for me.</li>
    <li> I really like that you can tap out exactly how much powder you are going to use and then lock it back up.  I hate it when lush spills everywhere.  I have been using this blush for a few weeks and I find that it stays on my face all day.  The container is also very sturdy.  I will buy this blush again.</li>

    <li> Good price, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this make up for years and I love it. It&#x27;s weightless and washes off so easily. Doesn&#x27;t stain your washcloths if you rinse well too. Very affordable. If you&#x27;ve not tried this then go with one of those offers that gets you several basic start up products in one set. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular make up.</li>
    <li> good color pigment, but still natural looking and easy to apply with good brush.  Easy to adjust level of color.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals what else is there to comment on! Love the brand, I confess i have slept in the makeup and it never causes a break out and it is not on your pillow in the morning</li>
    <li> Very wonderful and beautiful blush.  Makes your cheek orgasmic glowing pink.  This is the only blush i have found to look good on me.</li>
    <li> I really like the color of Bare Minerals Blush in Beauty, but the color is a bit darker than what I normally wear. Beauty is a very bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this blush is a loose powder, but I guess I&#x27;m not good enough at getting just a little bit on my brush.

    <li> I have had my Beauty blush for years and have yet to use it up.  While I don&#x27;t wear it every day, I do use it very often and it only takes a little bit to give a nice flush.  I have light skin (but not fair) and I think that Beauty is a color that anyone can wear.  It&#x27;s pink but not blue based so it suits warm and cool skin tones as well as neutral ones like mine.  I&#x27;m not sure that Bare Minerals even makes Beauty anymore.  I was recently in Sephora and I don&#x27;t think I saw it as one of the options.  Good to know that I can get it on Amazon and for about the same price as in the store.  BM blushes last all day with hardly a touch up and the color doesn&#x27;t change, even though I have oily skin.  The finish is matte but not flat and it gives my skin a luminous healthy glow.  Beauty is the perfect everyday shade because it suits so many skin tones.  It takes a very small amount of this powder to get a great result so the container lasts forever.
