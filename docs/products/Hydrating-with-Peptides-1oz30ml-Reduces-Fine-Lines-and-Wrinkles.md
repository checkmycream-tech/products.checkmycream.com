      <li>Sometimes you get what you pay for and you pay dearly to get it, which is better, I suppose, than paying a bundle for a product that delivers no discernible results.</li>

      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>You cannot beat this price when comparing it to beauty counter pricing which aren&#x27;t any better.  </li>

      <li>and I have a more even complexion.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal!!!!</li>
      <li>Good ingredients although the first is water, which may explain its thinness.</li>
      <li>Nice light-weight texture, absorbs quickly -</li>

      <li>It went on smooth, non-greasy, and let luminous, toned, supple, and baby-soft skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer, including oil free, and I still broke out.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice under make up moisturizer; not greasy or oily and dries fast.  </li>

      <li>Spreads easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>The product did not provide any significant benefits or changes.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>WISH I COULD POST A MORE POSITIVE REVIEW.</li>
      <li>but nothing special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather skip that additive and get more of the real product.  </li>
      <li>and it never burns, smells WONDERFUL and a small amount is all it takes - even for my abnormally thirsty skin!</li>
      <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY MORE COSTLY FACIAL PRODUCTS.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This arrived quickly and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>This serum absorbs quickly and works well with my moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
      <li>As a result, I need to keep hip and young looking myself - as a cool queen would do!!  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that reacts with burning and itching to many skin care products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well I didn´t find any difference with other creams.  Does not do a better or worse job.  I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Since I have a combination skin, this serum makes me breaks out, and keep my face hydrates.  I let my husband used it as he has dry skin, and i have seen significant improvement on his wrinkles</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for almost a year and have had improvements in the lines on my face. I&#x27;m very pleased with the price, it also moisturizes.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now. It does everything it claims to at a fraction of the cost to many other products. After doing some research I found that the main ingredients in some of the top rated products are the same type of peptides used in Excel. Upon using it for the first time you will see an instant tightening of the skin. For me it works best 10 minutes after I exfoliate.</li>
    <li> Very good price for peptides skincare! I maybe switching entirely to this peptides complex away from my current one.  Good combination of ingredients. Easy to apply over face and light.</li>
    <li> I decided it was about time to do something about the lines wrinkles, and dullness in my complexion.  I have normal to combination skin and after having used this serum for the first week, it has recharged my skin and brought life back to it!  It looks like it subtracted a few years off the look of my skin.  I am very satisfied with how well the peptides firm and keep my skin moisturized. My lines and wrinkles are more smooth, and less of them.  This serum absorbs quickly and works well with my moisturizer and sunscreen. You cannot beat this price when comparing it to beauty counter pricing which aren&#x27;t any better.  It has definitely benefited the looks of my skin and I am going to continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that reacts with burning and itching to many skin care products. Hydrating with peptides not only doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction, it actually soothes my skin when it is inflamed. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy and leaves my skin smooth and moist. I highly recommend it to anyone with skin issues or anyone seeking a light but effective moisturizer. Great product guys!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find all of these ingredients anywhere else for less and definitely you can find alot of overpriced department store brands that will sell it to you for more.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  Best of all - NO PARABENS.  The \\&quot;big\\&quot; name brands all seem to put it in.  How long are they keeping it on the shelf that they have to add parabens to preserve it?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find products that work AND don&#x27;t burn my skin.  I have VERY dry, VERY sensitive skin with Rosasea.  It typically takes numerous coats of moisturizer to even begin to hydrate my skin enough to keep it from flaking by noon.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this because I&#x27;ve been using Hyraulic acid and Matrixyl 3000 and it&#x27;s helped LOTS!&lt;br /&gt;Since this is such a thin serum, I apply this first after cleansing.  For me, it takes 2 or 3 applications of small amounts.  It absorbs quickly and it&#x27;s very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like how it makes my skin feel.  The price is GREAT especially given the big $$$ products with these ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a skin care junkie like me and like to try lots of products in search of the holy grail, this is a very affordable \\&quot;test drive.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This arrived quickly and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Just any FYI for any other folks out there with uber-sensitive, ultra dry skin, Korres Thyme and Honey moisturizer is DIVINE!  I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years now and it never burns, smells WONDERFUL and a small amount is all it takes - even for my abnormally thirsty skin!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review about a product before but I have been using this product for about a year now and in spite of trying many others, it is the one I keep coming back to.  I am 50+ and while I suffer the usual signs of aging, I still also suffer from oily sensitive skin.  This product is light and hydrating without being greasy and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  It is one of the few products that agree with my skin.  The reasonable price is also a win!</li>
    <li> I waited til I&#x27;d been using this product awhile before creating a review so I could be honest about results.  And the fact is, there ARE results with this product.  My skin is brighter, firmer and plumper when I use this daily.  It seems to be keeping the lines and crepeing at bay on my neck as well.  I have purchased twice and will keep purchasing and using.  This has all the same ingredients as serums over $100 but without the high price tag and the parabens.  I AND my wallet are SO relieved to have found it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has dramatically improved my complexion!!!</li>
    <li> I use it under my foundation, which then goes on more smoothly and evenly.  Good ingredients although the first is water, which may explain its thinness. I bought it in a bundle with the B6 serum.  Not sure if I&#x27;d pay the stand alone price.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent value.  I tried more expensive products and did not get the results I received from this product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily, followed by sunscreen. Doesn&#x27;t take much - about pea-sized squirt - for entire face. Spreads easily and absorbs quickly. I use it in the under eye area too even though the product directions say not to. Not really sure if this product has had any effect on lessening wrinkles, but it does help hydrate.  Of the three products by Excel, I like Hydrating with Peptides best.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change.  Okay but nothing special.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003T2V3FW Hydrating with Peptides - A Renewal Complex - 1oz/30ml - A Professionally Formulated Combination of Unique Patented Peptides ArgirelineTM, Matrixyl® 3000, and Syn®-coll, Synergistically Work to Reduce Fine Lines and Wrinkles]]Relatively low cost product works well especially with fine lines. Does reduce larger ones though and worth trying before spending lots more on equivalent products.</li>
    <li> I’ve used the brand of skincare product that you have to go to the mall to buy for YEARS. A friend of mine switched to this product about a year ago, and every weekend when we meet for lunch, her skin has looked a little bit brighter, a little bit firmer, etc. Finally, I bit the bullet and asked her what she had used – We are in our late 40’s, so wrinkles are showing up every day – and she told me she switched from the brand she had been using for years to something new. Excel-Skincare. She told me she started out with just a few of their products, and recently switched to their entire line. She encouraged me to try out just a few at a time, and see how I liked them. I started with this cream, and I LOVE it! My face just soaks it up! I’ve become a total convert – I swear by this stuff now!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the only serums I&#x27;ve found to keep my flaky skin under control when I&#x27;m using Retin-A. My skin does this peely/flaky thing when I&#x27;m on Retin-A and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get liquid foundation/concealer/powder to look good when you&#x27;re shedding have flakes of skin. This serum moisturizes so well and tacks those flakes down so I can put makeup on w/o it looking weird.</li>
    <li> This serum greatly moisturized my skin and smoothed out fine lines and wrinkles.  It went on smooth, non-greasy, and let luminous, toned, supple, and baby-soft skin.  This is very high-end moisturizer and a great buy too.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin smoother. It is a little early to say, if I look younger now, but I have noticed that my skin look a little lifted and my brown spots are fading a little.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is an essential part of my total skin care regime.  I am in my sixties and use of this product softens fine and deeper lines and keeps my face supple and smooth without greasiness.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old, and I deeply regret not taking care of my skin until now. Sun exposure, picking at acne, and not moisturizing have all taken their toll. I started looking into wrinkle reducing products. My combination skin is highly sensitive, and breaks out from EVERYTHING! I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer, including oil free, and I still broke out. Going to a dermatologist can get expensive, so I started researching like crazy to find something that would help me, and was affordable. I came across this product, and it sounded too good to be true. Excellent ingredients, great price, good reviews....I was skeptical, but gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly, was packaged nicely, and was perfectly sealed. The pump dispenser is nice. You can tap it half way to get just a tiny amount at once, or give it a full push for a full dose. I&#x27;ve read complaints about the pump being cheaply made. I disagree. The product is a thin, clear serum, and has no scent. It glides on easily, and absorbs very quickly. There&#x27;s no sticky residue, or tightness after applying, as I&#x27;ve found with other serums. I loved the way it felt on my skin. It was moisturizing, felt clean, smooth, and like nothing was on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum for five months now, and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t break me out, and that was just the first happy surprise. My skin is smoother, doesn&#x27;t break out with acne anymore, and never gets flakey, as it did whenever the seasons changed. The skin around my eyes has dramatically improved. It&#x27;s less crepey, and my eye makeup looks smoother. I&#x27;m very happy with the results, but I&#x27;m a realist. No cream or serum will erase wrinkles, the fine ones, or the deep ones. I know that nothing short of injections and cosmetic surgery will make me look twenty five again, but this product is definitely helping me keep them at bay, and improving the overall appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and will keep using it. Thank you good people at ExcelSkincare for making my annoying skin happy.....at last!</li>
    <li> The product did not provide any significant benefits or changes.  Texture is satisfactory, results leave a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product with a consistent formulation that gives result.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping logistic is fine for the Brazil and foreign countries.&lt;br /&gt;Ships with no problem, they know how to do this.&lt;br /&gt;I have noted good progress in my tone skin with this and all products,so far the formulation works with desired product concentration.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> Received on time but I am waiting to run out of what I am currently using first.  It is by the same company and I&lt;br /&gt;really like the results.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and some said don&#x27;t buy but I did anyway. Should have listened. I don&#x27;t mind that this product is a little thin but it does not work period.</li>
    <li> I  like this product because it soaks in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  I use this along with other products to keep my skin hydrated, soft and smooth.  It keeps the wrinkles at bay, suggesting a younger skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything outstanding about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two or three weeks and don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  VERY HYDRATING  I HAVE TRIED MANY MORE COSTLY FACIAL PRODUCTS.  THIS IS THE BEST ONE. I do put a moisture cream over it as well. Cheers</li>
    <li> its too soon to tell if this is makign a diferance for me, but I do like it. I will update as time goes by.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice under make up moisturizer; not greasy or oily and dries fast.  It&#x27;ll make your skin soft.  However, i see no difference in my wrinkles.  I apply this 2x a day and have for the past 2 weeks.  No difference.  Doubt I&#x27;ll but it again, as other moisturizers work just as well.  The &#x27;peptides&#x27; claim is what sold me -- but so far -- they do nothing.</li>
    <li> I KNOW THE DERMATOLOGISTS CARRY THIS LINE BUT I PERSONALLY SAW NI IMPROVEMENT IN SKIN TEXTURE OR FIRMNESS YET I HAVE WITH OTHER CREAMS WISH I COULD POST A MORE POSITIVE REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I use it every morning. I love how absorbent it is and it makes my skin feel fresh.</li>
    <li> This serum aborb pretty fast after applying and you don&#x27;t feel oily at all. I haven&#x27;t tried it for a long time but I think it makes your skin smooth and feel well. I buy this product together with the Dark Circle Under-eye Serum - 1.0oz/30ml - Contains EyelissTM...  Customer service is good, so don&#x27;t worry. They have registered delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not finish the product since it stinks after a while. It smells like the smell of damps clothes that is not dried for a few days. I don&#x27;t see any change to my skin after using it. I think it contains mostly water. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful very effective product &amp; the price is great too. The ingredients speak for themselves. For those that do not like fragrance, you will like this product. zero fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have never had a facial serum work as quickly and without irritation as this one, within one week I began to see results with twice a day application, within 2 weeks, my smile lines actually were filling in !  Wonderful product, would recommend to anyone.  Extremely difficult to find a product that actually does what it says it will do.  Plan on ordering another so I have one on hand, don&#x27;t want to go without.  Thanks Excel-Skincare !  This one is a keeper !</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I try a serum instead of a lotion during the day. I have tried many serums (high-priced big brands) and all of them felt sticky or oily and didn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my skin. Since using this product, my skin isn&#x27;t dry and I am even seeing my wrinkles lessening. I am already on my second bottle and am looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
    <li> the product contains the most advanced peptides needed to have tighter,smoother, wrinkle free skin. for the price its a win win product in my book most big companies like lancome  will charge you an arm and a leg you know what iam say!  its a good prices try it and you will like it always look out for glycerine in you dont want oily looking skin and if you have oily skin never use anything with glycerine will make things worse. just a tip.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and have seen a marked improvement in my skin tone and in fine lines. It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.  I saw results the first month of using it and won&#x27;t ever stop.  I put it on immediately after washing my face, and before my regular moisturizer.  I love it and can&#x27;t be without it~</li>
    <li> Lines are diminishing and skin is firming up nicely.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a skin tune-up at home.</li>
    <li> I have purchase this item at least 3 or 4 times... every time I am pleased!  great must have item!</li>
    <li> I am a car and motorcycle artist and as such hang out with a pretty hip crowd and have also been called \\&quot;the chrome queen\\&quot; in the press.  As a result, I need to keep hip and young looking myself - as a cool queen would do!!  I have been using this product for years and people are continually astounded by how young I look.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Nice light-weight texture, absorbs quickly - I feel my skin drink it right in. No scent, and that&#x27;s good - I&#x27;d rather skip that additive and get more of the real product.  I am very pleased with this, and I do recommend it.  Shipment arrived on time, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of the Hydrating with Peptides, A Renewal Complex and i absolutely love it.My face looks and feels firmer, brighter and has a glow to it. There is no scent which is a good thing and it absorbs right away and does not leave my skin looking greasy. Shipment was pretty quick . Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the Hydrating with Peptides - A Renewal Complex. I absolutely love it! My face looks and feels firmer, brighter and I have a more even complexion. It is lightweight and non-greasy. I use it morning and night. No need for a moisturizer after although you can if you wish. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and I try a lot of products. Usually I am disappointed, but not with this. This is the real deal!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I live in a very hot, humid state where I cannot wear heavy products due to excessive oily skin and this product works great.  Not heavy but very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Excel Skincare does everything they say about fine lines and wrinkles, I love the moisture it provides to your skin.</li>
    <li> The liquid goes on silky smooth.  It is extremely hydrating.  I use this in addition to another product, and I use it for it&#x27;s hydrating effects as well as the peptides.  Of course the proof in a product is the results after long term use (8 weeks or longer).  I&#x27;ll use this regularly thru the entire bottle then judge.  My immediate impression is NICE!</li>
    <li> I like the Excel Hydrating with Peptides as a little goes a long ways and the ingredient&#x27;s are what I was looking for without adding many toxic ingredient&#x27;s that so many of the anti aging creams are doing. You can feel the tightening effects from this product shortly after applying it. I also like the Excel Dark Circle Under Eye Serum.</li>
    <li> My objective is to avoid breaking out while giving my face a light moisture boost and improving skin tone and texture around my eyes.  Often, heavier products leave my eyes puffy the next morning.  This Excel product helps minimize puffy eyes, improve overall skin tone and texture, and does not make me break out.  It is affordably priced and worth it to try this for yourself.</li>
    <li> I wear this under my makeup and it really works to soften my skin and lessen the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving and trying this, I&#x27;m happy to confirm that it does work as described. I landed here after trying a bunch of expensive solutions that barely even worked, but Excel has really shown there colors with this peptide solution. No irritation, firmed and tightened my skin almost instantly, and the price is just right. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Like most us here, I&#x27;ve tried countless different remedies to rid myself of the wrinkles that I hate so badly. None of them ever did their job right and a lot of them actually burned my skin. Why would anybody pay to irritate their own skin?! This here however, works with my sensitive skin, and after a few weeks of use, the difference is night and day. You&#x27;ve done a really good job Excel, keep it up.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you get what you pay for and you pay dearly to get it, which is better, I suppose, than paying a bundle for a product that delivers no discernible results. But occasionally you stumble upon \\&quot;the real deal\\&quot; (i.e. a product whose list of skincare ingredients are those proven beneficial to anti-aging) at a price so reasonable it borders on being a steal! Such is the case in my experience with this Hydrating Renewal Peptide Complex from Excel Skin Care. The Complex is light weight (non-greasy), absorbs readily, and brings about a noticeable improvement to the skin&#x27;s tone and texture. And after two-months of continuous use (morning and night) I&#x27;m starting to notice what may just be a cumulative benefit. Time will tell whether or not using the Complex will result in something that comes close to a reversal of the signs of skin aging, but regardless, this product is a pleasure to use and I&#x27;ll continue to do so based upon the results I&#x27;ve experienced thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars and not 5 you may be thinking? My quibble is not with the Complex within the container but with the container itself, specifically, the pump. In both instances of purchase the pump has clogged after a couple of uses. It&#x27;s highly annoying to have to remove the top to unclog the container which inevitably results in some wasted product.  Note to Excel Skin Care:  Your product deserves better!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better serums I have tried! Results are fairly quick and it gives the skin a pleasant glow and feel. Fairly &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; without too many chemical preservatives. I would recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I have never been without this product since I first tried it. I have very dry skin and use Retin-A. This is the only serum that hydrates my skin, and I have tried them all. The price is so reasonable; buying this product is a no brainer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This has effective amounts of proven ingredients in it. The peptides in it have been proven to work in controlled studies to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and help firm the skin. I have used it for two weeks now, discontinuing my retinol at the same time I started using this.  My 53 y/o face still looks great, if not better with this, after stopping the retinol. I will be interested to see the cumulative effects after using it for a couple of months. It doesn&#x27;t take much product, about 4 pumps or less, for face and neck. I have encountered no side effects from its use. I would recommend it to others.  The price is amazing compared to similar popular brands. Will update my results in about 6 more weeks.  Customer service was fast!</li>
