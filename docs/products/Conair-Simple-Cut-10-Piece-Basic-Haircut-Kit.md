      <li>It seems you are better off just spending more money and getting a good pair that has replacement blades</li>

      <li>came with some nice scissors :)</li>
      <li>So far, we have two happy haircuts!</li>

      <li>The first one worked great for about 7 years and then it wore out, as bi-weekly haircuts will do.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I need to spend around 70-$100 to get a true good working clippers.</li>

      <li>Gets the job done and still saved me $ :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love these clippers.</li>
      <li>The quality is awesome, especially for the price!</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34;... (get it  :)</li>
      <li>Maybe it works well, but how would I know if it won&#x27;t stay on for more than 2 minutes?</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t beat the price; it has already more than paid for itself after just over a month of use.</li>
      <li>It has many equipment.</li>
      <li>1 too many, let alone 2 of them.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I tried these.</li>
      <li>Go for it without more thoughts, you would like it ...</li>
      <li>The equipment is more than satisfactory.  </li>
      <li>I like being able to touch up my haircut without having to go to the professionals.  </li>
      <li>I got this to shave the fuzz off my Sphynx cat :)</li>
      <li>You will love the ease of the blades that they do not tug at the hair.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t one of the top of the line cutters but it does the job, just don&#x27;t expect this to do something you would from a chop quality pair.</li>
      <li>We returned it and will be looking for a device with more power.</li>
      <li>Myself I need 2 more attachments for my hairstyle.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>

      <li>and it still runs as good as it did the first time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Materials are good, scissors are good, only complain its that this didnt came with the oil...</li>
      <li>Right here, the price is more than paid for!  </li>
      <li>This cheap model is just that -- cheap!  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for something cheap and efficient then this is it. :)</li>
      <li>machine is a lot lighter than the old one, which I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
      <li>This thing though right out of the box was junk JUNK JUNK JUNK OWE WITCH!!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know how much i did need a new kit, and i&#x27;m very happy -</li>
      <li>My hair have never been this perfect before by other people.</li>
      <li>It did a great job, especially for the price, but I do wish it had come with more guards.</li>
      <li>Product is easy to use, hair cut I had</li>
      <li>I find it lightweight and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The sides and the front were easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It should easily snap in place.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Well, simply solid, works great, gets the job done and is really cheap, you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>and it still cuts fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, precise scissors and trimmer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works Really Good For Price,Great Buy</li>
    <li> We had a Conair haircut machine that lasted nearly 10 years. It was cheap, purchased for about $10 at the drug store. It started wearing out and not cutting properly, so I got this one to replace it. I have 2 boys and they have simple haircuts, so a simple machine is all we needed. This has everything I need to cut their hair. One gets a size 2 cut and the other gets size 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is a lot lighter than the old one, which I&#x27;m happy with. And it&#x27;s a little less noisy, but maybe because it&#x27;s still new. My younger son is really sensitive to loud noises and he hated how long the old one got. He had a much better experience with the new machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t adjusted the screw, since it&#x27;s working fine as is. It had a difficult time cutting through my boys&#x27; hair which had gotten really long since I last cut their hair. I had to go through smaller sections or else the machine would pull too much. I think next time, when their hair isn&#x27;t as long, it will be fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this set of clippers because of the price. It&#x27;s cheap and had decent reviews. And since all I do is stick a short guard on and shave my whole head, and it cost over $10 to go somewhere to have this done, I figured that if I got 1 use out of it, it would pay for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did work, although not great. My previous set of clippers was a Wahl set that I&#x27;ve had for 10 years. These are not as wide as the Wahl&#x27;s, and do not cut near as well, but it gets the job done. There were many spots that these clippers wanted to bog down and pull the hair and I had to back off and try again. This is a big con for me since my hair is short, and new clippers should have to trouble cutting. They are smaller and a lot cheaper feeling that the Wahl&#x27;s (to be expected), but not so much that I felt it was going to break. It does have a set screw for the power which is nice, but I miss having the adjustable blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think I will hang onto these as a backup, and try to take my Wahl apart to clean it real good and sharpen it. For someone who is only going to be trimming their own hair occasionally, I guess I would recommend this. One or two uses makes your money back, so for a lot of people, it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> Can these clippers shave me bald.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and convenient. It has many equipment. And my family and I like it vey much. But the oil is not enough.</li>
    <li> It is well worth the money I paid for this kit.  Even one time use pays for the entire purchase in savings from going to the barber shop.  Besides, I am sure this kit will lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I was spending $23 every two weeks to get my hair cut.  Short.  With clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the very first time I used these clippers, they had already paid for themselves multiple times over.  I could buy a new one, use it, throw it away, and order a new one the next week, and I&#x27;d be getting a haircut twice as often and for less money.  Obviously, I haven&#x27;t had to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just gave myself my second haircut with these, and I love them.  I don&#x27;t have to leave my house, I don&#x27;t have to pay someone and tip them, I don&#x27;t have to coordinate schedules, I just walk into the bathroom and get my haircut with zero hassle.  I had always been hesitant to cut my own hair, but I&#x27;m really glad I finally got over it.  I recommend it for anyone who, like me, just likes his (or her) hair really short.  I just put on the #1 comb and go over my entire head.  Looks exactly like how it did when I was paying $23 for it, with a lot less hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a cleaning brush, lubricating oil, and multiple guides of varying lengths-- everything you need.  Just buy it.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t one of the top of the line cutters but it does the job, just don&#x27;t expect this to do something you would from a chop quality pair.</li>
    <li> lighter than previous one had. This one makes noise as well I tried wrapping some thick tape around it to reduce vibration. I keep it oiled and tried adjusting the power screw on the side. Perhaps I need to spend around 70-$100 to get a true good working clippers.</li>
    <li> it was ok for like 2 uses now its dull and just pulls hair</li>
    <li> Using it, I can do my hair perfectly by myself. My hair have never been this perfect before by other people.</li>
    <li> I got this set when I decided to do some basic grooming at home. Its a cool little set and have 4 different blades. The set is good for starters with all basic things are available like, comb, brush and oil bottle. Overall I would rate it best value for money.</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought this because my groomer raised his price by $30. Well to make a long story short I bought this clipper cut my dog&#x27;s hair and both my dog and myself are happy :-)</li>
    <li> Soon as I got it, I oiled it up, put the #2 clippers in and BAM, gave myself a buzz-cut in less than 5 minutes. If you&#x27;re like me and would rather save $15 every 6 weeks for a haircut and would rather keep the money and do it yourself, these are the clippers to use! SMOOTH, SHARP AND AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with my barber at all, but I thought I would save me some money and buy the Conair Simple Cut Haircut Kit, 10-piece. Model HC90CS. It comes with the 6 1/2\\&quot; hand-held electric clipper, bottle of lubricating oil, little cleaning brush, attachable glide combs: 3/8\\&quot; (9.5mm), 1/2\\&quot; (13mm), 1/4\\&quot; (6mm), 1/8\\&quot; (3mm), barber comb and barber scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Instructions on one sheet are printed in English and Spanish. With order form for replacements of blade, guide combs, neck brush, lubricating oil and more.&lt;br /&gt;  Please read the instructions before using the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Make sure the screw on the side of your clipper is at the proper tightness and the two screws of the blades are tight.&lt;br /&gt; You must put some lubricating oil (includes mineral oil) on the metal blades before you use your clippers. A little across the top and on the sides. Snap on the guide comb for the haircut of your choice. A 1/4 is a nice round buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt; Hold the glide comb in the cup of your hand. The teeth of the black guide comb will fit over the metal blades. The tag goes between the two metal screws. It should easily snap in place.&lt;br /&gt;  If you don&#x27;t use any guide comb, you will get a good bald, military hair cut with some skin flakes taken as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I started with the back of my hair, myself bent over the bathroom sink. A long body mirror to my side. using the 1/4 guide comb, it was so smooth, it didn&#x27;t feel like the hair was cutting at all. The sides and the front were easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Remember to clean your metal blades afterwards. Use your little brush to clean out the hair. I put everything back in the box for proper storage. These clippers should last you a long time with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By using my Amazon.com gift e-card balance, I received this product in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you, Amazon.com, for offering this at a low price.</li>
    <li> I spent ten bucks for this. The cheapest buzz cut around here is eleven.    I got my kit and gave myself my first haircut. Looks great.    As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> the quality of the shaver was good&lt;br /&gt;you have to adjust the power setting before using it the first time&lt;br /&gt;the hair size attachments were small&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice, once on me and once on my brother&lt;br /&gt;nothing was wrong with it&lt;br /&gt;you have to oil the blades before using it each time&lt;br /&gt;also came with some nice scissors :)&lt;br /&gt;great buy for its price but i&#x27;d suggest buying some longer attachments</li>
    <li> I am sick and tired of going to the barber everytime I want a buzz. Also, why should I dish out a whopping $15 (that includes the tip) just for a one-time hair job? This kit is very easy to use, all you gotta do is oil the tip with three drops, turn it on, then let the oil settle for a little. Then, (you can turn it off now!) you pick a clip on, and begin to buzz! Not only was my hair in need of a haircut, but my dad also got a nice portion of this as well. So far, we have two happy haircuts!</li>
    <li> shaves good. and in good condition</li>
    <li> Bought a Conair Haircut kit.  It worked for 20 minutes then nothing; dead as a doornail.  Looked for a warranty, found none.  Cheap Chinese-made product.  If you wish to purchase this product, I will sell you mine.</li>
    <li> Good product, great price.  Oil the blades and you&#x27;ll be fine. Also make sure you adjust it to max power. It has an adjustable screw to help deal w/ weak power in some other countries.</li>
    <li> Ok for travel and just-in-case backup but far from a quality clipper. I missed hair as i was using a #1 guard and did not do well for the hair line at all.</li>
    <li> This is the loudest haircut device I have ever used. You will wake up your entire house, I mean neighborhood, if you use it early in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product may be inexpensive, but it is also inferior.  It fails to cut most of the hair passing through the blades. I threw it away after a single usage and retrieved my old one out of the trash. I am now looking for a better hair clipper at a higher price.</li>
    <li> The cheap product does not work. Instructions say to adjust power screw but it did not change a thing. Defective</li>
    <li> this is not a small trimmer full size with all the attachments you need plus scissors! Definately a great buy!</li>
    <li> this trimmer broke on first use would never buy one again, it would cost more to return it so the best thing to do is throw it away</li>
    <li> I usually just do a buzz cut on my head no&#x27;s 2 or 3, so this item sure as hell saves me alot of money going to the barber,&lt;br /&gt;best investment yet ha!</li>
    <li> I bought it to trim my chest.  It&#x27;s so easy to use I&#x27;m cutting my own head now and putting off going to the barber.  Those visits are $20 a pop.  Cha-ching.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic kit, with only 4 clips, 1 guard, oil, scissors and comb.  It is adequate for one person&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> If my son&#x27;s hair is already longer than 1/2&#x27;&#x27;, these clippers can&#x27;t get through it with the guards attached. He just has straight hair, so it should be easy. The other Conair clippers we had prior to this worked well. This is like torture as I rake through his hair over and over and over to trim it thin enough for the clippers to finally take effect and cut to the length set on the guide. Horrible. Couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
    <li> Simple clippers for basic cutting. This is my 2nd pair. I use this for balding cutting purposes.</li>
    <li> For the price it gets the job done. Myself I need 2 more attachments for my hairstyle. To big of a jump between each attachment.</li>
    <li> Worked for 4 times perfectly, was a little drag on the 5th time. So basically I used it for 5 times and disposed it. It cost only 10 dollars, so got more than my money&#x27;s worth. No complains.</li>
    <li> I have tried buying these cheap cutters a few times. Everytime it&#x27;s the same result. It cuts ok the first time you use it. By the second time all it will do is pull your hair and not cut. The blades are dull. Then when you try to buy replacement blades, they don&#x27;t sell any. The company doesn&#x27;t even make replacement blades. For $12 I could have just paid for a hair cut. Products like these just end up causing our land fills to fill up and is a waste of plastic. It seems you are better off just spending more money and getting a good pair that has replacement blades and it should last for many years.</li>
    <li> I used these to groom my dog. I used the 1/2&amp;#34; comb all around to give him the &amp;#34;puppy cut&amp;#34;. It turned out pretty good and it wasn&#x27;t too loud and scary. They&#x27;re probably best for cutting fine hair. Over all these were a good deal for $7. If you&#x27;re just looking for something cheap and efficient then this is it. :)</li>
    <li> If you told me this was a $40 razor I would believe you.  Very happy with this buy</li>
    <li> fats shipping, great purchase</li>
    <li> I have never cut hair and was kind of forced into it because my husband is home from a nursing home and I have been taking care of him since the end of Dec. 2014.  I won&#x27;t go into all the details of his illness except to say he has cancer and cannot do much for himself anymore and caring for him is a lot of work.  Anyway I wanted a basic kit and this fits the bill quite well.  Following the directions is important and  makes it pretty simple to use.  My one complaint is that it gets pretty warm if let run too long and I turn it off to cool down a little.  Overall for the price it was a good buy if you are just looking for a basic cut.</li>
    <li> Product is as described and a great price. Great product top of the line.  I would reccomend this item to others.</li>
    <li> VERY SATISFIED ........... EXCELLENT VERY GOOD QUALITY GOOD OPTION FOR THE PRICE AND RECOMMEND ... MUYBUEN BUY QUALITY, EXCELLENT  HAPPY VERY HAPY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better clippers on the market, but these are a good value.   My husband uses them occasionally to shave his neck and trim his hair between trips to the barber.  Definitely reduces his trips to the barber, and that really saves money.</li>
    <li> I would prefer not to give this only one star, as I&#x27;m sure for certain hair-types, and certain situations these clippers are a good, low-cost option. Unfortunately for me, I got these clippers for one purpose, and they cannot do the job whatsoever. I got these clippers solely to buzz my hair down after every week or two of growth. These clippers cannot buzz through my hair, which is very thick. They can cut for about a quarter inch at a time before they jam up and I have to clear them and start again.&lt;br /&gt;I buzzed my head once completely with these clippers and it took me close to a half hour to do so, which is absurd. I was able to buzz my head with my beard trimmer, which is a third the size, in under 10 minutes. I&#x27;m assuming it is simply the thickness of my hair, but with only one weeks worth of growth, I assumed a cheap pair of clippers would suffice. I was obviously, mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr These clippers MIGHT work for less thick hair, but for mine, they barely work at all.</li>
    <li> Low quality, obviously made to be the cheapest one on the market  A few weeks later I bought a Wahll 79300-400</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m picky about who i allow to cut my hair, so putting weekly touch ups in my own hands is perfect. i&#x27;ve used it weekly since the day i received it, and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed. the attachments are particularly useful. easy to adjust, easy to use, low maintenance. can&#x27;t beat the price; it has already more than paid for itself after just over a month of use.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Excellent service. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Vendor</li>
    <li> i purchase this item s after went through several haircuts but this is the one i could fund for the lowest price and still it&#x27;s working perfect.</li>
    <li> have only used it once on my son and it did a great smooth job</li>
    <li> Barely can cut through my beard. If you have course hair I&#x27;d suggest getting a higher quality trimmer. This one doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34;... (get it  :)</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They came in the post just as expected. They quality is without compromise and the full set has all the tools you could want to cut hair.</li>
    <li> this machine does what it promises. I liked it a lot and recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;can buy quietly.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for 30 years. This is my second Conair kit, the first one lasting more than 20 years. Easy to use, precise scissors and trimmer.</li>
    <li> A very nice little unit! My wife still uses it on family members each month! A good deal for the price!</li>
    <li> These are great basic clippers, an excellent value. Mine finally gave out after 10 years. The wiring near the base of the clippers must have finally given out &amp; the clippers would only get power if I held the cord at just the right angle. Keep in mind I would just wrap the cord up and toss the clippers in a plastic bag under my sink after each use. The stress of having the cord bent must have finally worn out the inner wiring near the base. This is after 10+ years of use with minimal maintenance and over 300+ uses. I started shaving my head about 10 years ago after realizing I didn&#x27;t need to pay someone else to just &amp;#34;shave it all off.&amp;#34; Initially, I would oil and clean the clippers after each use, but over the last several years I would just use the included brush to clean out the shavings and then toss them back under the sink, no oiling. I used to shave my head every other week, but as my hairline has receded (currently Jason Statham hairline), I&#x27;ve taken to shaving my head very week. I initially started out using the guards, but am now down to using no guard. This has been for the last 6 years or so. So figure 52 weeks in a year, multiplied by 6 years and that&#x27;s over 300 uses. That&#x27;s not including the first 4 years. I&#x27;d say the number is closer to 500, average 7-8 minutes each use. I also use these clippers to give my armpit hairs the occasional trim as well as shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most of the negative feedback on these is from users not knowing about adjusting the power via the screw on the side. During my early days with these clippers I had issues with them snagging hairs or cutting intermittent hairs, but then realized I just had to adjust the screw; there were times when the clippers would seize up and I almost threw them out. Occasionally the blades would stick together, but a tiny drop of oil will loosen them right up. Sometimes I&#x27;ll even just just move the blades around to un-stick them and they work just fine, no oil needed. I used up the included oil long ago, but a tiny drop of machine oil or even olive oil will do the trick as well. I did have issues initially trying to cut wet hair, but have since learned to dry my hair off (I swear profusely) before each cut. Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t tried cutting wet hair for a few years now so I can&#x27;t really speak from experience. I will say though that this was before I discovered the adjustment screw. :( For the money (~$10) these are an excellent value. Having never owned professional clippers I would say these can&#x27;t be beat for the average person just wanting to cut their own hair. These clippers have saved me hundreds, probably thousands of dollars. It&#x27;s hard getting a decent haircut for less than $15 in NYC. I can&#x27;t remember how much I originally paid for these, definitely no more than $15. At their current price of $7.99, these are a steal. They basically pay for themselves after 1 use! It would be crazy not to give them a try!</li>
    <li> I got this to shave the fuzz off my Sphynx cat :) She has grown fuzz on her back and sides and it looks funny so I decided to shave it off and its very soft and fine like a Persians hair and this little thing is perfect, it does the job for me but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a cat with fur all over. Get something something more powerful but for trimming cats or dogs like paws or butts it is good enough and for $8 bucks it&#x27;s an amazing deal, very happy with it!</li>
    <li> they went dull after about 4 hair cuts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had Conair clippers, ALWAYS, until I bought this \\&quot;basic\\&quot; haircut kit.    My parents bought a Conair clipper set about 10 years ago to replace 2 NEW Wahl DUDS and it worked exponentially better than any of the Wahl clippers we owned for about 1/2 the price. Needless to say I&#x27;ve owned 2 Conair clippers over the last 8 years. The first one worked great for about 7 years and then it wore out, as bi-weekly haircuts will do. However, the second one I bought, this Basic Haircut Kit, only lasted about 4 months, if that, and worked poorly from the get-go. The combs I used kept breaking, it took about an hour to cut from the 1/4\\&quot; my hair had grown to down to the 1/8\\&quot; #1, and because it took so long I was having to stop and re-oil and it got blazing hot in my hands.    At the 9$ I spent on it you probably could buy 2 new ones for the price of 1 barber haircut, except I have NEVER paid for a haircut in my life AND it would be a waste of money. 1 of these clippers is 1 too many, let alone 2 of them. There&#x27;s no blade adjuster, the motor is seriously underpowered, and heats up instantly (and I only used it to cut my already short hair shorter). Take my word for it, if you&#x27;re serious about actually cutting your hair and saving some money use the 13 dollars you would&#x27;ve spent on this clipper and put it down on a 20$ Wahl clipper.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but who should complain for the price.. Caution: DO NOT USE TO CLIP YOUR HEAD TO ZERO. Other than that, this is more like a trimmer than a real clipper. It does bite and bites bad. It does get hot after certain amount of usage.</li>
    <li> The quality is awesome, especially for the price! I paid half the price of any store bought hair kit!! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for months, and I&#x27;ve got several haircuts with it. My only complaint would be my stylist (girlfriend), who&#x27;s still learning how to use it properly, but it does its job fairly well. I recommend it for that kind of use, never for professionals because it overheats after a while.</li>
    <li> This cheap thing actually isn&#x27;t bad. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months and it&#x27;s still cutting well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been giving my sons short hair cuts for many years and we have gone through a few hair cutting kits.  This cheap model is just that -- cheap!  It only survived 1 haircut.  We returned it and will be looking for a device with more power.</li>
    <li> Bought it to shave off DH&#x27;s hair every two weeks. Have been using it for about a year and still working.</li>
    <li> A little noisy and vibrating, but does the job pretty well for the price.</li>
    <li> Everything you need and pretty rugged quality too.  I would definitely recommend it for the price for anyone looking for a similar thing.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and the cost was well within reason. Would certainly purchase again as the need arises. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 haircuts, and it still works fine. So at $15 a haircut I&#x27;m already $45 - $7.50 &#x3D; $37.50 ahead! Make no mistake, its not super high quality, and it really is barebones, but it does what you need it to do. Nothing has broken yet.</li>
    <li> Why I haven&#x27;t purchased a kit like this before astounds me.  The equipment is more than satisfactory.  I like being able to touch up my haircut without having to go to the professionals.  We&#x27;ll see how durable the kit is, but it seems just fine.</li>
    <li> For $7.xx shipped it was a great deal. Noise wise its comparable to other clippers i&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s weight is light-ish but not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; light...I&#x27;m used to heavier units and it was nice to have a lighter one. Others have also said it gets hot, it actually runs cooler than my good pair. It cuts good n&#x27; even and I have zero complaints as of now. Some of the early failures i&#x27;ve read could&#x27;ve been due to not oiling the blades when it was \\&quot;Out of the box\\&quot; (Dry) or not oiling them every so often as most if not all clippers need. Lube and set the power adjustment correctly per the instructions and there shouldn&#x27;t be any problems. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months later and it&#x27;s still working great. I use it every week to shave my entire head,it&#x27;s ran for 15~ minutes per cut and it has yet to cause any issues. I only use the smaller adapter and it has held up the entire time. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands hair (what&#x27;s left of it). Adequate job cutting. However, the vibrations really made it uncomfortable. My hand was still shaking when I finished. For $8 - you live, you learn.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of clippers the head is some smaller than the standard clipper, but it dose the job.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just what my husband wanted, and needed, he loves it.</li>
    <li> If I go for a Hair cuttery like Super-cuts or so, then it would cost me $16 to 18 for just 1 hair cut. Instead, I paid for this, and had 2 hair cuts so far. Right here, the price is more than paid for!  Product is easy to use, hair cut I had was quite decent, so can&#x27;t complain.  Go for it without more thoughts, you would like it ... Thanks to Amazon for bringing such products to us at cheap price!!</li>
    <li> This product makes cutting hair a pleasure and a breeze.  Quality products for the price. You will love the ease of the blades that they do not tug at the hair.</li>
    <li> Technically it&#x27;s a functional product, but it was painful to use. I expected it to be light and cheaply made (and it is), but I didn&#x27;t expect each pass to pluck and pull and tear up a few hairs by the roots. Either it needs sharpening or the blade needs to move faster. Either way, bad product and cannot recommend, regardless of price.</li>
    <li> Does a great job- I use it for simple buzz cut . You can&#x27;t beat the price.  It has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> already trimmed my beard, and hair a few times. Gets the job done and still saved me $ :)</li>
    <li> I know you get what you pay for but a low price is no excuse for a product to literally rip the hair out of your head. PULL YANK OWE!!  I returned this junk and don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not some Hair Cut Pro but I always buy cheaper clippers use them a few months throw them away and buy another set. This thing though right out of the box was junk JUNK JUNK JUNK OWE WITCH!!</li>
    <li> just what i wanted. Very good price and value. the service was very fast. I would recommend this product for its value.</li>
    <li> WoW these things are worth their weight in gold . Nice and sharp . Not able to get a smooth shave but excellent for my head . cheap enough to give as a gift . just notice all my hair cutting machines are Conair ...hhhmmm Oh and they are easy to apart and clean , I recommend a light machine oil as a lubricant , use an old toothbrush rather than the very small brush that was included</li>
    <li> This is a great pair of hair clippers, or at least it has been for me. I have owned mine now for almost a year and a half and it still cuts fine. After becoming unemployed I had to give up my hairdresser and my layered look and started cutting my own hair, giving myself a buzz cut when the urge strikes. This item gave me the opportunity to pay less than $15 for all the haircuts I&#x27;ve given myself in that span of time with no issues or complaints. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinking of starting to cut their own family&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted a basic package, just what this promised. Didn&#x27;t know how much i did need a new kit, and i&#x27;m very happy - as is my husband who needed the haircut.!</li>
    <li> its good and cheap like it thank u soo much for this proudect my hasband like it too its useful</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, it works for what I need, but it&#x27;s defiantly not hardy, although I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and it still does the job</li>
    <li> The product is very easy to use, I gave a hair cut yesterday and it performed well. I will say anyone could use this product.</li>
    <li> I only use this to buzz cut my hair. You will have to adjust the power. Otherwise the cutter will cut out when your hair gets jammed. It&#x27;s by no means a professional cutter, but if you just want to keep it buzzed like me then you&#x27;ll get what you need.</li>
    <li> Good, does the work, now i can trim myself and skip barber for at least 1 month more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials are good, scissors are good, only complain its that this didnt came with the oil... just noticed the pic and check the box and the oil isnt there, bad thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the rest its really good for this haircut kit</li>
    <li> I use this clipper for touch up on puppies. They are quiet enough to keep them calm and cut well. I am glad that I tried these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far, so good. Conair makes good products from my experience and will keep using their stuff until I&#x27;m proven wrong.</li>
    <li> This product came in the mail right away. We have had it about 8 months and it still runs as good as it did the first time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was a great price, and had decent reviews.  My only concern with the product is that in the first second that I turn it on, there is an electric spark between the blades that startle me each time.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal, or if it&#x27;s just the particular one I got?  I find myself worried to use it in case it shocks me!!</li>
    <li> So far, I have given three military haircuts to family members with this Kit.  The kit only cost me $8, so it paid for itself on the first haircut.  It did a great job!</li>
    <li> A lot less expensive than those in the stores and good quality.  I  like the extras that came with it.</li>
    <li> great clippers that have worked like a charm for me for over a year! I would recommend them to anybody!</li>
    <li> My wife got me this for Christmas. It only comes with 4 guards, and they&#x27;re not very close to the scalp. So, I doubt it&#x27;s for people who want styling options.</li>
    <li> As advertised this is a simple basic haircut kit. The clippers are at a fixed height. Not adjustable. They clip hair well but not great. It is a basic kit as stated.</li>
    <li> I have a baby boy, so decided to buy this to save on haircuts.  I finally used it when he was a little over a year old.  It missed some hair, but I think that is more due to my inexperience than the clippers.  When he gets older (by the time he goes to kindergarten) I will probably take him somewhere to get his hair cut, but this pays for it self after just a couple of cuts, so will use it for the first five years and be thankful for the savings.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!  I bought it FORTY YEARS AGO.  It still works perfectly, although I have very little hair left.  I think I paid $9.99 at K-Mart.  I ran out of oil, but baby oil works great.  I think that is 25 cents a year.  How can you beat it?  It has to be the best deal ever.</li>
    <li> Good price and it arrived on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I have used that a few times and It worked without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;It is not clear in the instructions, but I think is a good idea to oil the blades before first use. After I oiled the blades for the first time the product worked much better.&lt;br /&gt;It vibrates a lot, but not to a point to bother me.&lt;br /&gt;You regulate the power turning a screw and for me that is a little awkward.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance because he was in need of a new one after 6 years and I thought it was a great deal...but I guess you get what you pay for.  He said compared to his old one, it was a complete piece of crap.</li>
    <li> This item is working very well.  It has all that is needed for a good haircut.  I find it lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> el equipo cumple contodas las especificaciones que se establecen en el articulo, muy buen equipo, recomendado a los usuarios de los mismos</li>
    <li> Blade was dull. Yanked hair not cut it.&lt;br /&gt;Worst thing ever.</li>
    <li> The unit vibrates a lot while using it. However, it does not heat up as much as my previous one (that was pretty old anyway) and it does its job. It was a good purchase for its price so far, although you can tell it is not top of the line.</li>
    <li> To tell you the truth, i was reluctant to buy this because of the price; it was about 8.99 when i bought it. I thought like someone once said, if you buy cheap, that&#x27;s what you get; especially after seeing the prices of similar products. But after reading the other reviews and my own personal research, i gave this product a shot, and i&#x27;m glad i did. Since this was my first time buying electric hair clippers, i have no other product to compare it to, but i feel these work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason i bought these was i felt it would be a great way to save some cash. Around here, it costs about ten dollars at a barber for a male haircut, even for a buzz cut, plus whatever tip i could afford (i figure you have to tip well ones with sharp objects near your eyes and head haha). It took a little practice, just at first, but i was able to give myself a nice buzz cut in front of a mirror (actually, i did get a little help to trim the back of my neck) and the clippers worked very well and i&#x27;m satisfied with the results. Please don&#x27;t let the price fool you! This is a great product and works excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little tip though: I would reccomend you read all the instructions, especailly about the part of it&#x27;s simple tips about power level adjustment, among others. Many of the problems i read that others have stated in their reviews about this, i&#x27;ve found can be fixed by following the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend this :)</li>
    <li> Well, simply solid, works great, gets the job done and is really cheap, you can&#x27;t ask for more. It&#x27;s perfect for us guys saving some haircut money.</li>
    <li> We bought this to start cutting my husbands hair at home. It did a great job, especially for the price, but I do wish it had come with more guards. However, I was fully aware when I bought it that it only came with four.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few years ago and it still works great.  I just use it for lining up my hair and ears though, so I couldn&#x27;t really speak from the buzz perspective if it gives you a smooth cut.</li>
    <li> For the amount of money this cost it will do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper than going to the hair salon.</li>
    <li> Not even useable.  There is 2 minutes of battery.  Maybe it works well, but how would I know if it won&#x27;t stay on for more than 2 minutes?</li>
    <li> Due to the thinning hair atop my head I have given in and gone to the buzz cut so common among men of a certain age, heavy sigh!  This is a great little trimmer cutter that allows me to cut my own hair.  I start with the guard for a very close cut and go around my ears and the low back of my head near my neck.  Then put on a bit bigger guard and come up the sides and back a little higher.  Then a bit bigger guard and finish the job.  My wife says she cannot tell the difference between my cut and the barber.  I hold back the fifth star only because the precision, fit and finish is not five star but the performance is.</li>
    <li> I bought a pair of Conair clippers a year ago and they work very well. Very good for the money. Shipping was on time packaging was good. Overall I get a 5 star rating...</li>
