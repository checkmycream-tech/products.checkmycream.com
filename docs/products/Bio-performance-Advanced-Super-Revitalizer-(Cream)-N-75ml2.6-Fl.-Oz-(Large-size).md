      <li>IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE FOR THE RECIPIENT WHO IS A PERSON OF EXCELLENT TASTE AND EXPERIENCE IN SUCH MATTERS.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day if I can&#x27;t afford anything else but my cream, I&#x27;m happy. :)</li>
      <li>thought about contacting the seller, however after seeing that she did not get a very supportive response I decided against it and to just write a review.  </li>
      <li>Without this amazing moisurizer, I would look my age.  </li>
      <li>My skin was amazing with the cream</li>
      <li>I use the Bio Performance at night and during the day with a good quality sunscreen on top of the Bio Rerformance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face moisturizers and this is by far the best!</li>
      <li>My skin has never been so soft and the best thing is that the moisure lasts all day--no more dried-out skin by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Been using it for more than 25 years....</li>
      <li>i would recommend this cream to anyone who is looking for a hydrating luxury cream for day and night use. :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Best facial cream I have ever, ever had.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the most hydrating creams on the market.</li>
      <li>&amp; i love it.  </li>
      <li>Better price on amazon than at the store.  </li>
      <li>This stuff feels so smooth and luxurious going on my face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The bigger size is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Received this cream sealed on its original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this cream the last 7mos, so far great!</li>
      <li>big bottle is good to use.</li>
      <li>Well heck that&#x27;s true of just about anything.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Shiseido line of skin care for the last 10 years, this is the best facial cream I have ever, ever had.</li>
      <li>I love how it works on my skin and how soft it feels.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price.</li>
      <li>This cream is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It is still pricey, but you use a tiny amount, rubbing the cream between your warm fingers to emulsify the oils and daub it onto your skin.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I DON&#x27;T have crows feet or those lines above the lip.</li>
      <li>My skin looks radiant, and the product soaks right into my skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so soft, and I&#x27;ve noticed that it has diminished some of my fine lines and my dryness.</li>
      <li>Should have known earlier that this is much better price than dptment store.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin, and this moisturizer makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth,</li>
      <li>(And the large size is definitely more cost efficient, don&#x27;t bother with a smaller size once you&#x27;ve decided it works for you.)</li>
      <li>First the one appropriate for my young oily skin and now the bio-performance revitalize creme for my 68 yr old skin.</li>
      <li>Wife only uses Shiseido products for as long as I have known her, she is a beautiful 70 years old with skin like silk.</li>
      <li>but it is used very quickly, I wonder whether because it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
      <li>This is not the real product.</li>
      <li>I think it moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>This product from Amazon is not the real one.</li>
      <li>The scent is light of the cream and the improvement of my skin condition is obvious.</li>
      <li>after reading a review here about it not being the real shiseido cream, this time i ordered it from shiseido itself.</li>
      <li>Very band purchase.</li>
      <li>The product itself is amazing as always but the new container -slightly</li>
      <li>And also, I recently found you can find better deals at Amazon compared with the local department stores.</li>
      <li>my skin is very soft and gentle when i use this product.</li>
      <li>When they stopped making prescriptives, this is eventually what I switched to because nothing else was as high quality.  </li>
      <li>This product was highly recommended, so I gave it a try.  </li>
      <li>Shiseido will tell you to use the teeniest amount, the size of your pinky nail bed, but I use a little more than that.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is definitely on the pricy side, but as others have mentioned, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>i have tried soo many other creams that just feel good when u put it on, but after about half hour or so, my skin would go back to feeling dry again.</li>
      <li>This is definitely not the real product!</li>
      <li>It does not leave an oily film on your face, but leaves a soft and dewy complexion.</li>
      <li>This cream here is definitely not the real cream.</li>
      <li>so far i like it.</li>
      <li>When I did open the box to use it and put it on my face, I first noticed that the smell was very different from what I was used to.  </li>
      <li>I am 47 years old with normal to dry skin.</li>
      <li>The texture feels very different and there are major differences in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin overall and on my face I have dry AND oily spots.</li>

<li> I have very sensitive skin overall and on my face I have dry AND oily spots.</li>
<li> I have been purchasing it from Nordstrom in the past for a much high price.</li>
<li> taller and more broad at the base than last year - makes getting the last remnants of cream out of the jar cumbersome.</li>
<li> This IS expensive, but it goes a long way - totally worth the splurge!</li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> This is the only lotion that keeps me moisturized during the harsh winter in IL.</li>
<li> For reasons unknown, another product was in the bio-performance jar i received this time.&lt;br /</li>
<li> I think I won&#x27;t change to use other product.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
<li> This new packaging was unnecessary.</li>
<li> I love Amazon &amp; have bought everything from them since they began and never experienced anything vaguely like this.&lt;br /</li>
<li> I have been using Shiseido a very long time..at least 20 years.  </li>
<li> Being picky, the cream is a little oily when I use it at day time.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy nor greasy</li>
<li> I have used this product for 30 plus years everyday</li>
<li> I suppose that in the summer months when your face is not as dry, you could use the less expensive Bio cream.</li>
<li> I have tried several creams, including that ultra- expensive brand that celebrities use.</li>
<li> &amp; It&#x27;s not as expensive as Estee, &amp; I have the same results.</li>
<li> without the greasy feeling some other moisturizers leave behind.</li>
<li> Serious business.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a shame that someone would sell a fake product, but I guess that&#x27;s the way the cookie crumbles.  </li>
<li> For my skin, it&#x27;s just too oily, sadly.  </li>

    <li> I use this product every day after my shower, and it is wonderful. My skin looks radiant, and the product soaks right into my skin. I used to use LaMer, but this product at a fraction of the prices does a wonderful job, and comes in an very attractive jar.</li>
    <li> When they stopped making prescriptives, this is eventually what I switched to because nothing else was as high quality.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shiseido line of skin care for the last 6 years or so. I have very sensitive skin overall and on my face I have dry AND oily spots. This IS expensive, but it goes a long way - totally worth the splurge! Shiseido will tell you to use the teeniest amount, the size of your pinky nail bed, but I use a little more than that. In nicer weather, this lasts me 3 - 4 months, using every night and some days. In the winter, when I use night and day, it lasts 2 - 3 months. (And the large size is definitely more cost efficient, don&#x27;t bother with a smaller size once you&#x27;ve decided it works for you.)</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended, so I gave it a try.  For my skin, it&#x27;s just too oily, sadly.  I ended up using it as [very expensive] body lotion, but would not repurchase for any use.</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd pot of this cream. I have been purchasing it from Nordstrom in the past for a much high price. This is one of the most hydrating creams on the market. i have tried soo many other creams that just feel good when u put it on, but after about half hour or so, my skin would go back to feeling dry again. If you are looking for a hydrating day and night cream, this is the one! the bottom of the container is detachable, so it makes it lighter to travel with. i would recommend this cream to anyone who is looking for a hydrating luxury cream for day and night use. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Shiseido a very long time..at least 20 years.  At the end of the day if I can&#x27;t afford anything else but my cream, I&#x27;m happy. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been useing these Shisedo products for over 30 yrs. First the one appropriate for my young oily skin and now the bio-performance revitalize creme for my 68 yr old skin. I can honestly say I DON&#x27;T have crows feet or those lines above the lip. I love how it works on my skin and how soft it feels.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 10 years. It is great, that is all I can say. And also, I recently found you can find better deals at Amazon compared with the local department stores.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is definitely on the pricy side, but as others have mentioned, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I have oily skin, and this moisturizer makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth, without the greasy feeling some other moisturizers leave behind. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product a couple months ago even though I was still had some on hand just because I thought it was a great deal.  When I did open the box to use it and put it on my face, I first noticed that the smell was very different from what I was used to.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years so I know what it smells like and this was very different.  The texture feels very different and there are major differences in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about contacting the seller, however after seeing that she did not get a very supportive response I decided against it and to just write a review.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shiseido line of skin care for the last 10 years, this is the best facial cream I have ever, ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, in fact, decades.  It is the only thing that moisturizes my skin. I can feel the difference over night. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> my skin is very soft and gentle when i use this product. I think I won&#x27;t change to use other product.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy nor greasy, a few dabs will provide you with a whole face coverage.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using it for more than 25 years....from the oldest cosmetic company in the world.</li>
    <li> I am 47 years old with normal to dry skin. I have tried several creams, including that ultra- expensive brand that celebrities use. I use the Bio Performance at night and during the day with a good quality sunscreen on top of the Bio Rerformance. My skin has never been so soft and the best thing is that the moisure lasts all day--no more dried-out skin by the end of the day. It is still pricey, but you use a tiny amount, rubbing the cream between your warm fingers to emulsify the oils and daub it onto your skin. I suppose that in the summer months when your face is not as dry, you could use the less expensive Bio cream. It does not leave an oily film on your face, but leaves a soft and dewy complexion. This cream is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> big bottle is good to use. but it is used very quickly, I wonder whether because it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
    <li> This is not the real product. I used it and it ruined my skin. I also purchased an actual one from Macy&#x27;s and compared them. Packaging, information on the jar, color, and texture is different. Very band purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels so smooth and luxurious going on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years.  I think it moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> I am Asian. I have been searching a good cream for my face and I found it. The scent is light of the cream and the improvement of my skin condition is obvious. Being picky, the cream is a little oily when I use it at day time. But it&#x27;s a prefect night cream. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Without this amazing moisurizer, I would look my age.  Everyone thinks I am mid- thirties.  No joke.  I am mid- fifties.  Mom uses it too.  She is mid- eighties.  She looks 65 if a day.  Serious business. Dewy, no pores, hydrated, just a touch will do the trick.  Lasts forever, so the cost balances out.  Better price on amazon than at the store.  Well heck that&#x27;s true of just about anything.  I don&#x27;t have time to shop, so Amazon rocks, especially with the prime.  My skin was amazing with the cream but I still would get irritations and sometimes look too oily..</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream the last 7mos, so far great! &amp; It&#x27;s not as expensive as Estee, &amp; I have the same results. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 30 plus years everyday &amp; i love it.  For reasons unknown, another product was in the bio-performance jar i received this time.&lt;br /&gt;  After complaining to the seller, would have dropped the entire matter were it not for the very nasty emails this seller sent me impugning my allegations and me &amp; assuming i was a crank &amp; didn&#x27;t know what i was talking about.&lt;br /&gt; I love Amazon &amp; have bought everything from them since they began and never experienced anything vaguely like this.&lt;br /&gt;  Fair warning to all.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this product makes it feel like silk all day without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this cream sealed on its original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger size is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face moisturizers and this is by far the best! My mom and my sisters swear by it, so I finally tried it. It makes my skin feel so soft, and I&#x27;ve noticed that it has diminished some of my fine lines and my dryness. Would recommend it to everyone, truly a great product!!!</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing as always but the new container -slightly taller and more broad at the base than last year - makes getting the last remnants of cream out of the jar cumbersome. A tiny scoop has been provided but good luck finding that when it&#x27;s needed. This new packaging was unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews when I bought this and I was concerned about Acne but I think if you have a good cleaner that won&#x27;t happen to you it really is a good product</li>
    <li> IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE FOR THE RECIPIENT WHO IS A PERSON OF EXCELLENT TASTE AND EXPERIENCE IN SUCH MATTERS.</li>
    <li> sheiseido is good stuff. i did not order it through a specific seller here, so I cannot relate how shipping was.</li>
    <li> Wife only uses Shiseido products for as long as I have known her, she is a beautiful 70 years old with skin like silk.</li>
    <li> Best facial cream I have ever, ever had.  I have worn this for 40 years now I think.  It keeps my face so moist-wear it day and night</li>
    <li> after reading a review here about it not being the real shiseido cream, this time i ordered it from shiseido itself. This cream here is definitely not the real cream. The color, texture, smell is completely different. The packaging, size and color of d jar and even the information and name of the cream printed on it is different! This is definitely not the real product!</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that keeps me moisturized during the harsh winter in IL. Should have known earlier that this is much better price than dptment store.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before purchased from Macy&#x27;s. This product from Amazon is not the real one. The package, the texture, the smell and the result are totally different than the one I bought from the department. I suggest that you should not buy it.</li>
    <li> so far i like it. cant tell if it is working or not. it still too soon. give it time.</li>
</ol>
