    <li> Works great. I am not filling my kegs, carboys buckets with large amounts water but I use a 1L spray bottle instead with the properly scaled down amount of Star San. I just spray all my equipment which needs to be sanitized. This dramatically reduces the amount of water and sanitizer needed.&lt;br /&gt;After almost 3 years of brewing I still have more than half a bottle of Star San left.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I will use to sanitize my beer brewing equipment. I have never had beer go bad after using this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and fast delivery.</li>
