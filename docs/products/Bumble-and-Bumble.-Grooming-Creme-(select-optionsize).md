      <li>She said she never had a better cream for her hair.</li>
      <li>You will love it.</li>
      <li>Not any better than putting skin cream in your hair.</li>
      <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, so you can re-shape it when you need to, and it won&#x27;t get gross.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>the price, I haven&#x27;t found anything better since I switched to this product.</li>
      <li>I love Bumble and Bumble Grooming Cream.    </li>
      <li>My hair is straight and it keeps from having any fly aways.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair so healthy</li>
      <li>I also work full time, so I really need products that work overtime with great results</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if you keep it near the ends only, it works great and gives you good hold and managability.</li>
      <li>You may need to try a few to find what works best.</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t use this when I get out of the shower my hair feels really light and a bit frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Good hold - not heavy on the hair.</li>
      <li>Quick service, and superb holding power without the slick :)</li>
      <li>Very economical.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy with short hair and this is a very nice styling cream.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth it!</li>
      <li>I get very smooth, frizz free straight hair.</li>
      <li>But whats great is that it also works to reduce frizz when I let it air dry for wavy hair.    </li>
      <li>Follow the simple steps for a good look:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Condition&lt;br /&gt;Apply cream</li>
      <li>I love product and consider this a must have w/o too much frill</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently trying silky dirt, which I&#x27;m guessing will be a good sub for this groom creme.</li>
      <li>That makes the price much more reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, but the price is HIGH.</li>
      <li>Works great, easy to use just a small amount to style the hair.</li>
      <li>May not be ideal for straight hair as does weight it down a bit.  </li>
      <li>ALL DAY on a hot humid summer day!</li>
      <li>This styling cream leaves my ultra thick, relaxed hair looking funky (in a VERY GOOD way) and feeling fresh.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t actually receive this product when I ordered it, but that&#x27;s no fault of Amazon nor whomever I bought it through, and Amazon kindly refunded my money.</li>
      <li>good for thick hair that you don&#x27;t want to style every day :)</li>
      <li>I bought my first tube under the express warranty that if I didn&#x27;t like this stuff, I could return it for a full refund.</li>
      <li>They assured me it would be worth it...and they were right.    </li>
      <li>Grooming Creme really smoothes my hair out and cuts my drying time significantly.</li>
      <li>It has just the right formula for calming hair to the style you want, while making it feel and look like you don&#x27;t have anything in your hair at all.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I both like it very much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending a lot for a product that requires little effort on my part to use correctly and look good.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that I purchased it from amazon.  </li>
      <li>Tried many different options over the years until i discovered this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more similar to an aerosol wax.</li>
      <li>I am inspired to write this review to let you know this product works and does exactly what it says it will.</li>
      <li>I am not much of a &#x27;hair guy&#x27; but when my wife booked me an appointment at a nice salon</li>
      <li>First off I&#x27;m a guy.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>I love this mostly because my hands don&#x27;t feel icky after using.  </li>
      <li>SMOKES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, frizzy hair with some natural wave and odd curls; this is the 1st product EVER to leave my hair straight, full of body, frizz free,</li>
      <li>Easily remold-able, using moist hands, hours later.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great tool for managing messy hair without having to re-style: just rub some in your hands (a little goes a long way) and smooth it through your hair for a tousled, sexy look.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s costly, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the trick.  </li>
      <li>I ran to the downstairs bathroom to get ready so that she could use the \\&quot;good\\&quot; bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I have also noticed that (for me) you can&#x27;t really use too much of this stuff.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t want to use too much</li>
      <li>Feel it would be better for those that are looking to keep hair in place and don&#x27;t mind the weighted down look.</li>

    <li> GOOD SELLER--GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> good for thick hair that you don&#x27;t want to style every day :)</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Tried many different options over the years until i discovered this. For me it provides the best mix of support + lightness that leaves my hair moisturized without the nasty greasy feel you get from other products</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble Grooming Creme is perfect for fine hair.  It give you sleekness where you want it or volume where you want it, and does not weigh your hair down.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love Bumble and Bumble Grooming Cream.    I have wavy hair that is prone to frizz. This product is so great, it smooths my hair and reduces frizz like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before.    When I blow-dry and hot-iron my hair I get very smooth, frizz free straight hair. But whats great is that it also works to reduce frizz when I let it air dry for wavy hair.    It is kind of pricey but you only need to use a very small amount so it lasts a long time. I have hair that is past shoulder length and only need a pea sized amount. You don&#x27;t want to use too much or you&#x27;ll end up with heavy, dull hair that looks dirty.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical about why 5oz of a \\&quot;creme\\&quot; was so expensive, but after I received a free sample I understand completely. This product is amazing. You can use it on wet hair (and blow- or air-dry) to give subtle hold and definition, or you can use it on dry hair to give separation, natural hold, and style. I have curly hair and love to use this on my dry, styled hair whenever it gets messy (or over Bb&#x27;s Surf Spray) to give it a loosely-controlled, finished look. It&#x27;s a great tool for managing messy hair without having to re-style: just rub some in your hands (a little goes a long way) and smooth it through your hair for a tousled, sexy look. Bumble and Bumble does it again!</li>
    <li> Not any better than putting skin cream in your hair. It still takes lots of work to brush through tangled and damaged ends, even with generous amounts. Overpriced, over-hyped.</li>
    <li> I had a near empty tube my sister gave me about a year ago sitting on my shelf.  Well, today I forgot I had my daughter&#x27;s school orientation and woke up with only 20 minutes to get ready!  I ran to the downstairs bathroom to get ready so that she could use the \\&quot;good\\&quot; bathroom.  I of course had all my hair styling products upstairs so I grabbed the only thing downstairs wich was the Bumble and Bumble...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY SMOKES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, frizzy hair with some natural wave and odd curls; this is the 1st product EVER to leave my hair straight, full of body, frizz free, ALL DAY on a hot humid summer day! NO JOKE!  And my hair was still slightly damp when we ran out the door.  Amazing stuff, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This styling creme gets your hair to do that piece-y thing or runway kind of bedhead. My hair is fine in texture and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down - makes it shape-able without feeling sticky. Only takes less than a dime size to get my hair to behave. This is also great for smooth styles to keep flyaways at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t change a thing except make it less expensive - one of those rare perfect products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble products are great. This grooming cream goes on nicely. My hair is straight and it keeps from having any fly aways.  May not be ideal for straight hair as does weight it down a bit.  Feel it would be better for those that are looking to keep hair in place and don&#x27;t mind the weighted down look.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sister who has extremely curly, thick hair.  She has ALWAYS had trouble with her hair having knots and being terribly frizzy.  She tried every product she could think of and they did nothing for her hair.  She has been using this product for 3 days and has already had complements from perfect strangers about how good her hair looks.  The frizz is gone and she says that she can actually get her fingers though her hair without running into knots and her hair is very soft now.  She is also using the shampoo and conditioner.    While it is a bit expensive, I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both like it very much. It is not too sticky and holds well.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I have really short hair and I use this product every day. Its not greasy or smelly.  I highly recommend the use of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams and this is the best for my type hair. Follow the simple steps for a good look:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Condition&lt;br /&gt;Apply cream</li>
    <li> I have used countless hair products to give me my desired look or effect and almost none do what they say. I am inspired to write this review to let you know this product works and does exactly what it says it will. It leaves my hair so healthy w/shine and gives my hair the ability to do what i want it to do. If I leave it curly it creates the most perfect glossy curls, If I straighten it w/ my flat iron It leaves my hair looking like If I woke up with my hair looking this perfect and naturally straight. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday to style my hair. Works great, easy to use just a small amount to style the hair. Lasts all day without making your hair sticky or crusty. Love it!</li>
    <li> Just really great stuff. B&amp;B makes great products. You may need to try a few to find what works best. Top Quality ingredients too.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in product for curly hair. It helps to control the frizziness. I just wash my hair, turn my head down, apply to the base of my hair, stand up, apply to the top of my hair, twist my long hair into ringlets, let dry, gently seperate the ringlets, and walla, a great look. You will love it. Works even in the humidity of Texas and Florida.</li>
    <li> One big problem. My wife loves this cream also. She said she never had a better cream for her hair. Ever! I think it is great also.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing for the product only and have not purchased this from Amazon/this seller. I&#x27;m unsure why this is $39 as it&#x27;s $15 less expensive at any salon. I love product and consider this a must have w/o too much frill--it has a great hold, isn&#x27;t greasy or too potent smelling, no buildup, great for versatile looks (smooth/relaxed/refined or textured/piecey/spikey). I use it for my short, textured (male) hair. My sister also uses it on her long, straightened hair. IMHO there are zero cons to this product. I also find it superior to Sumotech and the Styling Creme (in the orange/white container). The latter (styling creme) I find to be JUNK! Use this as a daily product and add some (Jonathon) Dirt when you need some extra hold/spike. (Note: I&#x27;m currently trying silky dirt, which I&#x27;m guessing will be a good sub for this groom creme. Will update after some use)</li>
    <li> B&amp;B&#x27;s styling cream is great.  It has just the right formula for calming hair to the style you want, while making it feel and look like you don&#x27;t have anything in your hair at all.  It&#x27;s versatile and concentrated.  It took me over a year to use one tube.</li>
    <li> Great product, great brand. I love this stuff, but the price is HIGH. This product tames my hair. I have a \\&quot;pixie\\&quot; cut, and this grooming cream just keeps it choppy without looking like I am \\&quot;overdone\\&quot;, and that I took forever on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am not much of a &#x27;hair guy&#x27; but when my wife booked me an appointment at a nice salon I asked that they recommend something for me.  They rang this up and I almost had a heart attack when I saw the price (about $30 at the salon).  They assured me it would be worth it...and they were right.    First of all, you really only have to use the slightest amount, so a tube goes a long way.  That makes the price much more reasonable.  Second, it&#x27;s the only stuff I can find that doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff, greasy, sticky or otherwise disgusting.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but this stuff is magical.  I can&#x27;t recommend it strongly enough.</li>
    <li> rocks my curls without frizz...</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick, wavy, super healthy  hair. What does this mean for the product?  Coarse: The grooming cream makes it shiny and soft.  Thick: Usually, I have to use a lot of product. With this grooming cream, I use less than a dime size each day. One tube lasted me from May until September before needing to be replaced.  Wavy: I need a product that keeps the waves together and not frizzy, which this cream does.  Healthy hair: I don&#x27;t use any heat on my hair and wash it every other day. This cream helps give my hair a \\&quot;style\\&quot; without heat and, with reapplication the next day, helps me go longer between washes.  I&#x27;m a low-high maintenance girl. I don&#x27;t mind spending a lot for a product that requires little effort on my part to use correctly and look good.</li>
    <li> i have thick, wavy asian hair that&#x27;s layered.  i can just wash, air-dry and go w/ a little dab and it provides natural control and style that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  effortless.  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually receive this product when I ordered it, but that&#x27;s no fault of Amazon nor whomever I bought it through, and Amazon kindly refunded my money. I&#x27;ve used this for a couple years, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works well for men with short to mid-length hair. Smell is unoffensive. The product isn&#x27;t the gel you owned when you doused yourself with Brut and Drakkar Noir before going to a middle-school dance. It&#x27;s a more subtle hold on the hair while still allowing for styling. It&#x27;s more similar to an aerosol wax. Product itself lasts for several months, using sparingly and with shorter hair. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, does not leave sticky residue and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a lengthy period of time. It really helps to style my otherwise very stiff short hair. I really love this product, however I wish it would cost less.</li>
    <li> no mess no fuss. best gel on the market. can be a bit pricy most places - thought this was a great deal.</li>
    <li> Grooming Creme really smoothes my hair out and cuts my drying time significantly. My blow out is smooth with a lot less work.</li>
    <li> This cream has a terrific balance of hold and hydration for a frizz head like me.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this by a friend. All you have to do is try it once. Pricey, but worth it! A quality product.</li>
    <li> Have to work it into hair after it dries otherwise just looks like gel.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty expensive for the amount you&#x27;re actually buying.  It makes me feel like one of the people buying the soap from Fight Club.  My friend who used to cut my hair turned me onto this probably 6 or 7 years ago.  I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  My hair has been shoulder length or longer for about ten years now.  This is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that gives my hair the look you see in commercials.  If I don&#x27;t use this when I get out of the shower my hair feels really light and a bit frizzy.  With just a small application of this stuff, probably enough to cover the tip of my thumb, my hair feels like it has a little more weight/body to it.  This also doesn&#x27;t leave a really sticky or globby mess like hairspray or gels would.  Make sure to apply this when your hair is damp, not wet or dry, otherwise it will not work properly.  I take a shower in the evenings and I&#x27;ll apply this after about 10-15 minutes of air drying time.  After application it usually takes about another hour or so for my hair to fully dry.  After I sleep on it for an evening, I wake up to my hair being in the ideal condition.  If I take a shower in the morning and go on with my hair throughout the day, it doesn&#x27;t feel as natural as it would if I would have slept on it.  That&#x27;s my experience at least.  I do highly recommend this product.  Once I hear that it&#x27;s not being manufactured anymore, I&#x27;m buying boxes of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Both my hairdresser and I put this on my hair when it is wet before styling, and again at the end if still a little frizzy. A little goes a long way. It does not feel greasy at all!</li>
    <li> While I have enjoyed this styling creme, I&#x27;ve found it tends to be a bit heavy if you put it too near your roots (at least if your hair is fine and you are aiming to add body). Otherwise, if you keep it near the ends only, it works great and gives you good hold and managability.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for all of us that really hate putting effort into our hair, but still want to look like a million bucks!  I am a wife and mother of two kids, ages 2 and 10 months. I also work full time, so I really need products that work overtime with great results--this falls into that category.  This styling cream leaves my ultra thick, relaxed hair looking funky (in a VERY GOOD way) and feeling fresh.  Just a dab will do ya, so ignore the price and buy it now!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I use it everytime I blowdry my hair and it gives me that \\&quot;just stepped out of a salon\\&quot; look!  My hair is always very soft and shiny.  A must buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, it&#x27;s a wonderful hair cream and Keeps my hear&lt;br /&gt;neat at all times.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised for natural separation &amp; subtle hold. I&#x27;ve been using this product for around 5 years, &amp; while I still cringe @ the price, I haven&#x27;t found anything better since I switched to this product.</li>
    <li> Quick service, and superb holding power without the slick :)</li>
    <li> I love this mostly because my hands don&#x27;t feel icky after using.  It&#x27;s also pretty lightweight with great hold.</li>
    <li> Good hold - not heavy on the hair.</li>
    <li> Tip: use this instead of the (admittedly luxurious) thickening cream. You get an entire bottle of this for the same price as a tiny jar, and it basically does the same thing. This product is slightly thinner.</li>
    <li> My husband hates product but I dragged him to my stylist for a cut instead of the old cheap-clips and she used this to help tame loose hairs, shape some areas ever so slightly, and discourage poofiness. Well, he loves it and I use it too on my heavy bangs for  a sleek and straight look without any weight or stiffness. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well, but too expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good. I am on my second tube. When applied my hair is not sticky nor is it stiff. Just natural. Lasts all day long. I am a guy with shoulder length, slightly curling hair. This product gives my hair an all day long natural look. Sometimes on the second day, I just dampen my hair and the Bumble is back. I bought my first tube under the express warranty that if I didn&#x27;t like this stuff, I could return it for a full refund. Didn&#x27;t have to do that. Came back later for a second tube.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews on here and had to give it a try. What is all e hype about?!?!?! It&#x27;s not a good product. I have used many products in my hair and this is by far the worst. I don&#x27;t think it does anything. Try something else.</li>
    <li> Soft, non-greasy hold that goes on wet or dry. Lasts all day without stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;One tube will last six months with daily use. Very economical. I&#x27;ve used it for&lt;br /&gt;12 years and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  This is the first time that I purchased it from amazon.  It arrived on time with amazon prime shipping and keeps my hair looking nice without looking like I use any product.</li>
    <li> I always put it on when hairs are damp. heat blowing hairs dry can actually activate it. I think it protects my hairs from drying and spilting. Good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for around 5 years now. I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of toiletries that I use every day other than toothpaste, but this is the one thing that I can&#x27;t be without. I have textured medium length hair that girls like to compare to Twilight. Anyway, the texture gets poofy if I don&#x27;t use product, but I hate &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; like I have products in my hair. I also touch my hair a lot throughout the day, so I don&#x27;t like anything that&#x27;s sticky or slimy bc I don&#x27;t want it getting all over my hands. So this stuff is perfect, it tames my poofiness and gives it some separation and texture creates the &amp;#34;perpetual bed-head&amp;#34; look that I like to have. I have also noticed that (for me) you can&#x27;t really use too much of this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or stiff if I use too much.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me her half empty tube when I needed a styling product, and it&#x27;s amazing!  I want more!  Yes, it&#x27;s costly, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the trick.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff or gunky which is very important to me. It&#x27;s a really great product!</li>
    <li> Great product! I mix it with some oil and put it on the ends of my hair that frizz. Frizz be gone!</li>
    <li> This stuff gets you laid, 100% guaranteed.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m a guy.  2nd, my hair is wavy and just past my shoulders.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 3 years now and no complaints.  Keeps my hair at bay, but not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> The best hair gel I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. A little goes a long way. I have short spiked hair and use this for shine and separation without the stiffness. My wife can touch my hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a bucket of straws. Easily remold-able, using moist hands, hours later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short hair and this is a very nice styling cream. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, so you can re-shape it when you need to, and it won&#x27;t get gross. I buy this all the time.</li>
