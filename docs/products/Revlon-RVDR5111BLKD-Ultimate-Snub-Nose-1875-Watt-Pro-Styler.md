      <li>Okay, maybe they do.</li>
      <li>I guess this calls for more practice using</li>
      <li>More resigned.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Spend the money and get a better dryer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;She had been happy with most of her older models until she got this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She had been happy with most of her older models until she got this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The light weight of the Revlon is most welcome but it does raise a question: the much heavier Remington comes with a four-year warranty</li>
      <li>The warm setting seems adequate for my shortish hair.  </li>
      <li>So now, due to have two of them, she is a very happy lady!</li>
      <li>So now, due to have two of them, she is a very happy lady!</li>
      <li>Both attachments function well and are easy on/easy off.</li>
      <li>in good, a decent product.</li>
      <li>has two heat settings: warm and hot.</li>
      <li>I have wavy, fine hair, and I have to have a hairdryer that doesn&#x27;t blow the curls out.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a great little dryer, nice and light, and</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s hard to find too many faults.  </li>
      <li>The diffuser is the size of a saucer and snaps on fairly securely.</li>
      <li>I own a travel hairdryer whose power is much stronger than this Revlon model.</li>
      <li>A great, affordably priced dryer for daily use.</li>
      <li>Warm is very warm--be prepared if you&#x27;re expecting a lukewarm breeze.</li>
      <li>These days, with any product like this, if you want it to be successful you should post how-to videos for all the features, and make those tutorials obvious and easy to access.</li>
      <li>The REVLON ULTIMATE SNUB NOSE STYLER is light-weight, so she can take care of some of the drying duties herself, which is very nice for mom.  </li>
      <li>morning she found that the warm (the lower of the two) heat setting and the high speed</li>
      <li>Warm and high speed work quite well for my length.  </li>
      <li>And most of their stuff is pretty high-quality and worth the money.</li>
      <li>There are two temperature setting, two speed settings, and a cool button.  </li>
      <li>: There was a strong burning plastic smell when the dryer was first used</li>
      <li>We had to quickly find a store and buy another one (which was whatever they had in stock and not what she wanted).</li>
      <li>This dryer dries my hair fast, which is very important to me when I am getting ready in the morning!</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight, almost feels too lightweight and easy to break.  </li>
      <li>This dries very quickly and very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this dryer on my wee one&#x27;s curly, but fine hair several times now, and I must say that I am quite pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure many will be driven crazy by the button placement because it means you have got to sort of maneuver to get them off and on but for me it is a joy.</li>
      <li>This weight difference is immediately apparent and is very important to her.</li>
      <li>This is a lightweight but pretty effective hair dryer with standard features, like temperature and speed settings.  </li>
      <li>Despite the marketing spin, this is really nothing special.</li>
      <li>I love this Revlon Hair Dryer, and I love how it gets my hair dry in a decent amount of time, but the attachments are of no use to me.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the attachments much, but honestly, a fast hair dryer is good enough for my needs.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle, lightweight, and has a huge attachment for those who have long hair.</li>
      <li>setting dried her hair very quickly and left it very nice</li>
      <li>Love it, works good and quite.&lt;br /&gt;Buttons are on the back side makes it little off to do on and off.</li>
      <li>There is a hot and warm setting as well as high and low.  </li>
      <li>She has been using it constantly since September 2013 and it has become her favorite.</li>
      <li>I would have preferred a smaller handle or better grip.  </li>
      <li>She has been using it constantly since September 2013 and it has become her favorite.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight which means slinging it around is not a bother at all - and is a real pleasure to use!</li>
      <li>, the nano blah blah high tech yada yada doesn&#x27;t dry hair as well as a good solid dryer with a good heat element, and the old-style ones get the job done quietly.  </li>
      <li>I usually like my blow dryers to have a cool button (in addition to warm and hot) but here the setting itself is not missed by me.</li>
      <li>I have mid length thick hair and was very happy to receive this hair dryer for review via the Vine program.</li>
      <li>I had no static and my hair looks really good - not flyaway or frizzy at all.</li>
      <li>but of course we do not know this for certain.</li>
      <li>I admit to having a problem using the diffuser (the large attachment)</li>
      <li>Otherwise,  The REVLON ULTIMATE SNUB NOSE STYLER works just fine.</li>
      <li>Its a pretty decent dryer.</li>
      <li>Nor are we certain if this will make any difference in real world longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While it remains to be seen whether it will hold up as well in the long run as the Remington models have done, based upon her use this morning, which went very well especially due to the light weight of this hair dryer but also, most importantly, for the way her hair came out, she (and I) give this dryer our highest recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would happily pay Revlon a few extra dollars for that feature.  </li>
      <li>the Revlon dryer really shines is that it makes my hair really shiny and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use any fancy shampoos or styling products, so I can really see the results of the dryer on my hair.</li>
      <li>very conveniently.&lt;br</li>
      <li>wife likes this hair dryer so much that today she had me order another one as a &#x27;spare.&#x27;</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty much like most average hair dryers out there.</li>
      <li>The hot level is quite hot, akin to the old Conair that died.  </li>
      <li>If you are not careful you could easily change the heating setting or power the thing off completely.</li>
      <li>It seems to me it would have been more convenient if the switches  were located on the other side of the handle instead of under the palm of the hand.</li>
      <li>You can twist off the back to clean the filter.  </li>
      <li>lessons: leave it unplugged and clean out that back end of the dryer.</li>
      <li>My only criticism is that most driers these days come with a retractable cord, which definitely makes storing and traveling much neater.  </li>
      <li>long lasting and durable would definitely recommend great for wet dry short long hair perfect for styling with</li>
      <li>Its clever design keeps the cap attached permanently.</li>
      <li>She said that most probably the low speed setting would have done just as well, though she did not actually try</li>
      <li>Nothing particularly fancy, but it works well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine as a backup hair dryer if my travel one ever breaks down, but I really prefer some power in my hair dryer to really concentrate the air flow.</li>
      <li>I think the high wattage is what allows this.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even want to keep this as an inexpensive back-up to my Elchim dryer, which is worth the extra money just to preserve</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a lightweight but pretty effective hair dryer with standard features, like temperature and speed settings.  It also includes an attachment to focus the airflow, and another for diffusing the air flow (to protect curls, etc.).  Nothing particularly fancy, but it works well and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Revlon has positioned itself as a leader in products for taking care of your hair. And most of their stuff is pretty high-quality and worth the money. While this hair dryer isn&#x27;t expensive, I can&#x27;t help but comment about the promotion of the ridiculous \\&quot;Nano Diamond Tourmaline\\&quot; technology as a means for choosing this product. I call balderdash on this one! Do they really think people are THAT stupid to fall for something like this? Okay, maybe they do. But at the end of the day, this is just a regular hair dryer that blows hot air to dry your hair. It&#x27;s nothing fancy. Don&#x27;t fall prey to the marketing. It&#x27;s a blow dryer...that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Arrived sooner than expected. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> That warning always \\&quot;duh&#x27;s\\&quot; me out but I guess they have to cover all bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems hair-dryer manufacturers are working overtime to come up with fancy descriptions.  \\&quot;nano diamond tourmaline ceramic \\&quot; ?  Nano usually means billionth , we know what diamond means. Tourmaline is crystal boron silicate mineral or trigonal borosilicate  gemstone, October birthstone and 8th wedding anniversary  stone. Uuuuuuuh? must be something good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have thoroughly confused you I&#x27;ll tell you the hairdryer works as a hair dryer. Nothing earth-shaking. There is a hot and warm setting as well as high and low.  It seems to me it would have been more convenient if the switches  were located on the other side of the handle instead of under the palm of the hand. The \\&quot;cold\\&quot; button is on the other side and you just hold it down for cool air.  The concentrator works well for just drying a small section of hair, say maybe your bangs. The diffuser is the size of a saucer and snaps on fairly securely. A cap on the back end snaps off for cleaning. There is a hanging loop because you shouldn&#x27;t wrap the cord around the dryer. Sort of noisy . Test and reset buttons on the plug. Two year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: There was a strong burning plastic smell when the dryer was first used but it went away so maybe no problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure many will be driven crazy by the button placement because it means you have got to sort of maneuver to get them off and on but for me it is a joy. My last two blow dryer&#x27;s have had buttons on the front and I have shut them off in the middle of drying my hair so frequently I failed to even get irritated after a while. More resigned. I usually like my blow dryers to have a cool button (in addition to warm and hot) but here the setting itself is not missed by me. This dries very quickly and very well. I had no static and my hair looks really good - not flyaway or frizzy at all. At the same time it does not \\&quot;dry\\&quot; out my hair and leave it crackly. Both attachments function well and are easy on/easy off. It is lightweight which means slinging it around is not a bother at all - and is a real pleasure to use! For the price this is a great value!</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my hair-- it does what it is supposed to do. I don&#x27;t notice any difference with these attachments. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not a stylist and I haven&#x27;t had the training to use them. These days, with any product like this, if you want it to be successful you should post how-to videos for all the features, and make those tutorials obvious and easy to access. Otherwise extra features and attachments are just a waste of time and material. I doubt if I will ever get the attachments out of the box again. The controls are easy to figure out, and it delivers good heat if that&#x27;s what you want. This is an affordable, average hair dryer that will get the job done, but won&#x27;t wow you.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, fine hair, and I have to have a hairdryer that doesn&#x27;t blow the curls out.  This isn&#x27;t the hairdryer for that.  It blows really hard, so if you want to minimize that, you have to use the diffuser attachment.  The diffuser attachment works awesome!  It just applies heat to my hair, without the gale force wind.  I have been looking for a hairdryer with a nice diffuser attachment, and haven&#x27;t found one until this hairdryer.  The heat settings are low and high, and you also have low or high air.  Even on low air, this dryer blows really hard.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, fairly small and is consistent.  You can twist off the back to clean the filter.  My old hairdryer is a Revlon, and I have had it for about 8 years.  I love it, because it doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as this one, but my old dryer doesn&#x27;t have a diffuser attachment like this.  8 years for an inexpensive hairdryer is quality in my eyes.  Hopefully this hairdryer will stand the test of time as well.</li>
    <li> This is a rather insubstantial feeling blow dryer.  And while it dried my hair, it was such an unpleasant experience I didn&#x27;t even want to keep this as an inexpensive back-up to my Elchim dryer, which is worth the extra money just to preserve my hearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the nano blah blah high tech yada yada doesn&#x27;t dry hair as well as a good solid dryer with a good heat element, and the old-style ones get the job done quietly.  Plus an Elchim will last over a decade.  This one felt like it might die at any minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it came with a diffuser and a directional attachement, so there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell, I am seriously unenthused about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the money and get a better dryer.  You&#x27;ll ears will thank you.</li>
    <li> There is not a whole lot to review about a hair dryer.  There are only two settings for temperature and speed.  The warm setting is VERY warm.  I found that it did dry my hair quickly, in particular when using the small attachment.  For styling, though, you&#x27;ll want to not have anything attached.  I admit to having a problem using the diffuser (the large attachment) but I think that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s unfamiliar to me.  It felt awkward to hold with the diffuser attached.  The dryer works well, and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an average blow dryer.  It works.  I would have preferred a smaller handle or better grip.  It feels a little awkward to hold.  I also would have preferred something just a touch lighter and smaller.</li>
    <li> I have mid length thick hair and was very happy to receive this hair dryer for review via the Vine program. On the plus side the dryer is very light and compact. That initially concerned me since I wondered if the lack of weight to the dryer would mean that it didn&#x27;t dry well. Wrong -- this light dryer dried my hair more quickly on the high/warm setting than any previous dryer I&#x27;ve had. The results are well styled and shiny, which is once of the promises the dryer&#x27;s name implies. I don&#x27;t use any fancy shampoos or styling products, so I can really see the results of the dryer on my hair. My only \\&quot;wish list\\&quot; would be a retractable cord. I travel frequently and would like to carry the dryer with me, but may not due to the cord. A great, affordably priced dryer for daily use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I got the chance to pick this in the latest Vine newsletter. Every time I go get my hair cut, the stylist always uses the flat attachment to straighten out my hair. When I saw that this dryer had one, I had to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall design is compact and lightweight. I like that it has not only the flat attachment, but a diffuser as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has two heat settings: warm and hot. Warm is very warm--be prepared if you&#x27;re expecting a lukewarm breeze. The air comes out in a rush and it sounds a little like the blow dryers hotels have in their rooms. One major perk: it dries your hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the attachments, maybe I&#x27;m not using them correctly, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference to my hair. It&#x27;s naturally wavy, and it didn&#x27;t come out very straight when I used the flat attachment. I guess this calls for more practice using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in good, a decent product.</li>
    <li> I love this Revlon Hair Dryer, and I love how it gets my hair dry in a decent amount of time, but the attachments are of no use to me.  The diffuser doesn&#x27;t put out enough heat to dry my hair, and the concentrator makes me feel as if I&#x27;m barbecuing parts of my head when I try to use it.  Also, there weren&#x27;t any instructions on how to use it, other than the standard warnings that come with such a product, and it seems to be a bit cumbersome for travel use.  All in all, it&#x27;s an okay hair dryer, but unless the user is a hair stylist, I&#x27;d avoid the attachments.</li>
    <li> First off, this dries my neck-length hair in less than five minutes, about the same time as my other hairdryer, the [[ASIN:B006BNFXHU MANGROOMER 1680XL-6 Professional Ionic Hair Dryer for Men]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the Revlon dryer really shines is that it makes my hair really shiny and manageable.  A lot more than the Mangroomer.  I also like that this isn&#x27;t too heavy for me to lift while I&#x27;m drying my hair.  As someone with disc problems in her neck, this is a big plus for me.  Also, it has the Cold Shot setting, which sets my hair style, after it&#x27;s dry.  This makes my hair look much fuller than it usually does, it even without hair spray, it stays looking full throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle, lightweight, and has a huge attachment for those who have long hair. However, the power is just not there. I own a travel hairdryer whose power is much stronger than this Revlon model. It too has a cooling element, though not the attachments. But with short hair, I really don&#x27;t need them. It&#x27;s fine as a backup hair dryer if my travel one ever breaks down, but I really prefer some power in my hair dryer to really concentrate the air flow. Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty much like most average hair dryers out there.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has two heat levels.  The warm setting seems adequate for my shortish hair.  Warm and high speed work quite well for my length.  The low speed is quite gentle.  The hot level is quite hot, akin to the old Conair that died.  The warm setting on this one does not toast my scalp.  Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser is quite big, 5.5\\&quot; across. It was too awkward for me to use, but that may be my skill level.&lt;br /&gt;The best safety feature is the removable end piece.  As I have barely used it, I have not yet cleaned it.  But I will.  The debris in the end is what will catch on fire if you have any electrical faults.&lt;br /&gt;I used to leave my hair dryer plugged in.  One day I smelled burning hair.  Even though the outlet plug theoretically was not on a live circuit (my bathroom switch works the lights and the plug), my hair dryer was hot and smoking.&lt;br /&gt;Two lessons: leave it unplugged and clean out that back end of the dryer.</li>
    <li> Its a pretty decent dryer. My hair drying time was probably half of what it usually takes with my previous blow dryers. My only dislike is the operation buttons are on the back side of the handle. If you are not careful you could easily change the heating setting or power the thing off completely.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my hair fast, which is very important to me when I am getting ready in the morning! I think the high wattage is what allows this. Plus, besides just the dryer, it does come with the two tools for either focusing the air flow (for use with a brush) and also a diffuser for keeping my curls from blowing out.  I think this is a great little dryer, nice and light, and the best thing about it is the price. You can&#x27;t beat it and I am going to get a couple more as Christmas presents, because it is that good of a deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old Babyliss is getting a bit tired and the nozzle tip falls off. I can&#x27;t say that this one dries my hair faster, though. It does seem shinier than usual, which is one of the claims made by this product. (Then again, it&#x27;s also a claim made by my Living Proof hair product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think the design is very attractive. The plastic looks kind of cheap. Also I think the cord ought to be at least a foot longer.</li>
    <li> Great product, Revlon never disappoints!!  With the added &#x27;cooling&#x27; setting my hair style is super long lasting!</li>
    <li> I ordered this [[ASIN:B00BV5EW8Y Revlon RVDR5111BLKD Ultimate Snub Nose 1875 Watt Pro Styler]] for my wife. It arrived yesterday and she used it this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is very pleased with it. She has been using Remington hair dryers of which she has three different models; the model she likes best of the three is this [[ASIN:B007E0FR84 Remington D8410 Keratin Therapy Dryer]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Revlon model is smaller than her Remingtons and much lighter in weight. This weight difference is immediately apparent and is very important to her. It&#x27;s not as though that the Remington is inordinately heavy, but lighter weight does make for an easier-to-use hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Revlon model has one fewer heat setting than the Remington. The Remington has three heat and two speed settings; the Revlon has two heat settings and two speed settings. Both have a cold-shot button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the settings offered on this Revlon are all one needs, according to my wife. Like that Remington, the Revlon has rocker-type switches which are arranged very conveniently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Revlon model also comes with a concentrator attachment as well as a diffuser attachment, both packed in the box. The Remington comes with a concentrator and does offer a free diffuser attachment but, oddly, you must order it separately, rather an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the filter is not nearly as convenient on the Revlon as it is on the Remington. On that model, you cannot lose the cap. Its clever design keeps the cap attached permanently. Not so on this Revlon; its snap-on/off cap could be dropped or lost, but, really, only if you are very careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are fairly quiet, as these things go, but she always uses ear plugs when drying her hair, something she recommends to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning she found that the warm (the lower of the two) heat setting and the high speed setting dried her hair very quickly and left it very nice (she has baby-fine hair). She said that most probably the low speed setting would have done just as well, though she did not actually try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light weight of the Revlon is most welcome but it does raise a question: the much heavier Remington comes with a four-year warranty but this Revlon has only a two-year warranty. We suspect that the extra weight may be a result of the sturdiness of the Remington&#x27;s motor but of course we do not know this for certain. Nor are we certain if this will make any difference in real world longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However one thing is definitely certain: this new Revlon model costs just a little more than half of what that Remington sells for! Thus this Revlon hair dryer offers very good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my wife is very happy with her new Revlon hair dryer. While it remains to be seen whether it will hold up as well in the long run as the Remington models have done, based upon her use this morning, which went very well especially due to the light weight of this hair dryer but also, most importantly, for the way her hair came out, she (and I) give this dryer our highest recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: March 19, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes this hair dryer so much that today she had me order another one as a &#x27;spare.&#x27; We recently returned from a trip. She states that it dries her hair noticeably faster than any other dryer she has previously used which is why she took it along on our trip. As she always takes a &#x27;spare&#x27; when we travel, she wanted another one of these to take along rather than one of her other older models which she had brought on this trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time when we were traveling, her hair dryer broke. ***Horrors!!!*** We had to quickly find a store and buy another one (which was whatever they had in stock and not what she wanted). So now she always takes two hair dryers with us which is why she wanted another one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had been happy with most of her older models until she got this one. She has been using it constantly since September 2013 and it has become her favorite. So now, due to have two of them, she is a very happy lady! (She also says that its current price here on Amazon is a bargain.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continue to give it our highest recommendation.k and not what she wanted).

    <li> Very good mid-priced blow dryer. It is fairly compact and easy to hold. It does what is supposed to do and feels like it will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer on my wee one&#x27;s curly, but fine hair several times now, and I must say that I am quite pleased with the results.  The REVLON ULTIMATE SNUB NOSE STYLER dries her hair quickly, gives it extra fullness, and does not blow out her curls.  The REVLON ULTIMATE SNUB NOSE STYLER leave her hair soft, smooth, and with fewer tangles than other driers we have tried.  The REVLON ULTIMATE SNUB NOSE STYLER is light-weight, so she can take care of some of the drying duties herself, which is very nice for mom.  My only criticism is that most driers these days come with a retractable cord, which definitely makes storing and traveling much neater.  I would happily pay Revlon a few extra dollars for that feature.  Otherwise,  The REVLON ULTIMATE SNUB NOSE STYLER works just fine.</li>
    <li> long lasting and durable would definitely recommend great for wet dry short long hair perfect for styling with</li>
    <li> Love it, works good and quite.&lt;br /&gt;Buttons are on the back side makes it little off to do on and off.</li>
    <li> About a year ago I went with a hairstyle that involved a hair dryer every morning.  Since then I&#x27;ve gone through three of them, trying to find the perfect one.  This one isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s hard to find too many faults.  It does dry your hair, but it not really any faster than a normal, less expensive model.  There are two temperature setting, two speed settings, and a cool button.  It is very lightweight, almost feels too lightweight and easy to break.  Overall, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the higher price, I would just go with a basic model.  Despite the marketing spin, this is really nothing special.</li>
    <li> This dries my hair fast and is extremely lightweight. I don&#x27;t use the attachments much, but honestly, a fast hair dryer is good enough for my needs. I&#x27;m not one to leave myself time for styling, even if I do wince when I get to work and glance at a mirror.</li>
