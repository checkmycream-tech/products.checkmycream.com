      <li>My husband loves it, and the scent hangs on for a longer than most.</li>
      <li>I will be looking t add the cream, lotion or body oil - the best way for the scent to last all day</li>
      <li>Many impostors out there.  </li>
      <li>the only problem was a visible scratch on the bottle of the perfume and everything else was absolutely perfect!</li>
      <li>What a great price- and super fast shipping even on Labor ay weekend!  </li>
      <li>been wearing this perfume since 1993 when i first discovered it during a trip to France &#x3D;) amazing as always</li>

      <li>This is genuine product.</li>
      <li>This is the genuine Angel.</li>
      <li>I so love this mild sweet scent.  </li>
      <li>It came in a vacume packed original wrapping.</li>
      <li>it is the most gentle smelling cologne, tnat everyone walks up and asks me what im wearing...</li>
      <li>Based on some of the reviews I was expecting to get something with a serious problem, BUT I am very happy with what I got.</li>
      <li>The last bottle I got was perfect, I have not opened this one yet, but I hope it&#x27;s the same.</li>
      <li>have angel on\\&quot; only because they love it or love someone who wears it.  </li>
      <li>something doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
      <li>So, after waiting a week this comes in and right off the bat</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Angel for many years in fact that is the only parfume that I wear.  </li>
      <li>- then I don&#x27;t use too much of the eau de perfume!  </li>
      <li>but I am ok with the big bottle spray</li>
      <li>My wife has used Angel for years and in worked in cosmetics for several years and is very familiar with this product.</li>
      <li>but I do love the smell and how long it stays with me.</li>
      <li>Lowest price and the real stuff.  </li>
      <li>Then she took a bottle of the real stuff</li>
      <li>Hands down, my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>NOT purchase this from Amazon thinking that you are getting a new, unopened box of Angel!  </li>
      <li>well mine went into shipping status and was shipped right away and instead of shipping it 2 day like a normal Prime item they sent it the slowest shipping speed possible shame on you amazon!</li>
      <li>Then on video I open it up to discover like the other reviewer noticed someone cut out the unique serial number!</li>
      <li>and I got her the refill for her old one</li>
      <li>To make matters worse, when you access the Amazon account to find out about returns, it shows this product as non-returnable because it&#x27;s hazardous or flammable.</li>
      <li>it was delivered and the light blue fragrance was almost black in colour.</li>
      <li>There is no other scent to come close to it.</li>
      <li>I have been a big fan of this scent for as long as I can remember and they no longer sell it at large department</li>
      <li>My mom put a drop of the mystery perfume on a piece of paper and you could barely smell anything.</li>
      <li>I was suspicious because of other reviewers but my dad really wanted me to order this for my mother.</li>

<li> Did not have problems like some of the other reviewers.</li>

<li> Little bit of Pacholi and a lot of chocolate and vanilla.</li>
<li> A little Pricey though.</li>
<li> In the past, I had to hunt down Angel at the mall.  </li>
<li> Use a small amount and the fragrance is with me all day.</li>
<li> We were concerned with some of the negative review.</li>
<li> My husband purchased &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; for me at least 10 years ago.  </li>
<li> It lasts, it&#x27;s subtle, but I get compliments from everyone - it&#x27;s not overpowering -</li>
<li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  </li>
<li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with Angel.</li>
<li> and it was fake!</li>
<li> Too bad it took a week to get here on prime</li>
<li> awful!</li>

    <li> Anyone who has ever smelled this scent knows it.  I have people tell me \\&quot;You have angel on\\&quot; only because they love it or love someone who wears it.  There is no other scent to come close to it. People who have never smelled it stop me and ask what am I wearing.  It will always be my signature scent. It truely is heavenly!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and it is one I use most often, so when I saw this great deal last year I jumped on it! The last bottle I got was perfect, I have not opened this one yet, but I hope it&#x27;s the same.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. The last time I ordered it was a spray bottle and the fragrance seem to be stronger.  I have a refill bottle but there was no indication how I ordered just the refill for future use.</li>

    <li> This perfume is the best I have ever worn - and I have worn it for years.  It lasts, it&#x27;s subtle, but I get compliments from everyone - it&#x27;s not overpowering - just beautiful.  The price was excellent and I am able to refill 2 of my .8 oz Angel Stars with this one bottle.  What a great price- and super fast shipping even on Labor ay weekend!  Love it and will order from them again!  I will be looking t add the cream, lotion or body oil - the best way for the scent to last all day is to layer it - then I don&#x27;t use too much of the eau de perfume!  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> In the past, I had to hunt down Angel at the mall.  Being able to purchase it on Amazon was fantastic!  My wife loves Angel and I do too!</li>
    <li> been wearing this perfume since 1993 when i first discovered it during a trip to France &#x3D;) amazing as always</li>
    <li> Wish it was spray but I do love the smell and how long it stays with me.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume and was thrilled when she got it for her birthday.</li>
    <li> Based on some of the reviews I was expecting to get something with a serious problem, BUT I am very happy with what I got. the only problem was a visible scratch on the bottle of the perfume and everything else was absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> Looove it!  It&#x27;s MY fragrance!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this perfume for many years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Hands down, my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> My Wife Loves this and it Does Smell good! A little Pricey though.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1W5W8 Angel By Thierry Mugler For Women. Eau De Parfum Refill 3.4 Ounces]]Do NOT purchase this from Amazon thinking that you are getting a new, unopened box of Angel!  The refill box that I paid over $90 for had no cellophane wrapper, and the code number was excised from inside the box! To make matters worse, when you access the Amazon account to find out about returns, it shows this product as non-returnable because it&#x27;s hazardous or flammable. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever. Like wearing christmas!</li>
    <li> This is a $92 dollar bottle of blue food coloring and water. I was suspicious because of other reviewers but my dad really wanted me to order this for my mother. This was an anniversary present for there 40th! Too bad it took a week to get here on prime and it was fake! It takes an extra 2-3 days to *process* well mine went into shipping status and was shipped right away and instead of shipping it 2 day like a normal Prime item they sent it the slowest shipping speed possible shame on you amazon! So, after waiting a week this comes in and right off the bat something doesn&#x27;t look right. The wrapping is loose and the side looks as if it was sealed by hand with a heat gun there are marks in the box and the wrapper like someone fooled around with it. Then on video I open it up to discover like the other reviewer noticed someone cut out the unique serial number! My mom put a drop of the mystery perfume on a piece of paper and you could barely smell anything. Then she took a bottle of the real stuff and you could instantly smell it across the room! AMAZON I HOPE YOU READ THIS! This is counterfeit merchandise, I will be contacting you on this so nobody else gets scammed. I hope whatever is in it is not harmful.</li>
    <li> Smell great my wife loves it.  This is her 2nd bottle and I got her the refill for her old one</li>
    <li> Great perfume great price.</li>
    <li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>
    <li> Wow one little whiff and now I am hooked on this scent.  Very sweet and delicious scent.  Little bit of Pacholi and a lot of chocolate and vanilla.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; perfume for years - still receive compliments.  I happen to wear this fragrance all year long, works well in all climates...</li>
    <li> Great just love the price and the service God bless amazon and its venders another christmas miracle got here for christmas</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Angel for many years in fact that is the only parfume that I wear.  Amazon is the best place to get the best prices and that is why I only purchase it from them.  Department stores are all over priced when it comes to Angel parfume</li>
    <li> I researched this before I bought it and this is a great bargain. I get so many compliments on this fragrance I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> Fake&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy......</li>
    <li> it was delivered and the light blue fragrance was almost black in colour. awful! had to return</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of this scent for as long as I can remember and they no longer sell it at large department stores.&lt;br /&gt;love that Amazon carries it now. will be buying again. packaged immaculately. no damage or leaking.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Valentines Day gift. My wife has used Angel for years and in worked in cosmetics for several years and is very familiar with this product. We were concerned with some of the negative review. Our package arrived on time and in tact. This is genuine product. No slits in the plastic wrap and the serial number was still present. We will definitely purchase this product again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is only one of two perfumes that every time I wear it someone asks me what the scent is.  My husband loves it, and the scent hangs on for a longer than most.</li>
    <li> Love Angel! I always get compliments. Use a small amount and the fragrance is with me all day. Go to perfume for over  15 years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  I thought I could refill my smaller decanter but I am ok with the big bottle spray</li>
</ol>
