<li> She bought this as a last resort and for the 1st two weeks we thought it had been a waste of our money, in fact it seemed as though her face had broken out more than before she had started using the product</li>
<li> so I am not sure if this is a case where things get worse before they get better</li>
<li> The pimples were no longer on the surface and it seemed as though no new ones were appearing.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
<li> The third week we started to see slight improvement, by the 5th week she was amazed!</li>
<li> Typically a spot treatment is supossed to minimize the pimple</li>
<li> It was a waste of money and it is not worth a penny.  </li>
<li> I had dark spots on my face that looked like bruises!  </li>
<li> I decided to use it as an over night spot treatment on a few blemishes and in the morning when I washed it off</li>
<li> Bought for my daughter, she was not happy with it.  </li>
<li> I am not impressed with this product.  </li>
<li> This is the worst product I have ever boughten</li>

    <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who has been trying several different things, not all at once but at different times. She bought this as a last resort and for the 1st two weeks we thought it had been a waste of our money, in fact it seemed as though her face had broken out more than before she had started using the product so I am not sure if this is a case where things get worse before they get better but she decided to continue to use it just to finish the course. The third week we started to see slight improvement, by the 5th week she was amazed! The pimples were no longer on the surface and it seemed as though no new ones were appearing.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had taken a before picture now to show the transformation and all her friends at school have been asking her what she has been using because they notice the difference as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, quality product and seems to be working well for my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> my son used the regular proactive for a while and it worked great but he didn&#x27;t like all of the extra steps involved.  We tried the X out and it seemed to work just as well as the regular but without the extra steps.  The price is a bit steep and I question whether or not it works great enough to pay that price again.</li>
    <li> Great. Wish I had purchased a large bottle as well</li>
    <li> It does not work like it claims and I should get a refund.</li>
    <li> My son LOVE IT. It WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> My son swears by this product</li>
    <li> do not buy any xout product  save your money</li>
    <li> It would be better if the kid used the stuff!</li>
    <li> Works good for my daughter 👍</li>
    <li> Got this product for the kids- they LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My teenager loves it! It works.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter, she was not happy with it.  Did not work as well as regular proactiv</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this product.  I expected more for a product that cost fifty dollars.</li>
    <li> This is a 30 day supply which you can get from the company with a free product for only 19.99. This is a bit high.</li>
    <li> i bought a 3 month bottle and paid $70-80.  That night I took out the bottle, read the directions and used it as a scrub.  It seemed fine, didn&#x27;t really have that burning feeling (thats how I know it&#x27;s actually working) but I didn&#x27;t care much.  I decided to use it as an over night spot treatment on a few blemishes and in the morning when I washed it off I had dark spots on my face that looked like bruises!  And on top of looking like a Dalmatian, the acne was still there!  Typically a spot treatment is supossed to minimize the pimple but this did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  I am furious with this product!  It was a waste of money and it is not worth a penny.  I decided to still use it as a scrub but not a spot treatment anymore and I didn&#x27;t notice anything at all so I stopped and went back to my old routine.  This is the worst product I have ever boughten</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as the advertising leads us to believe. Plus, I cancelled this product twice and I am still getting this product coming to my door and being billed. Very unprofessional</li>
    <li> does absoultey nothing for your skin.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s acne.</li>
