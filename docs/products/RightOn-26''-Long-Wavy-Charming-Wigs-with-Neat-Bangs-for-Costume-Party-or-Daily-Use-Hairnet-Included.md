      <li>This should have been described as more of a higher priced Halloween wig.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed for the price to be honest. After reading reviews I was expecting the worst but, it doesn&#x27;t look super fake and it fits pretty comfortably.</li>
    <li> Hair was too thin and it has no comb in the front to secure wig, looks way thicker in the picture and bang was not cut properly.</li>
    <li> Not same color I hated it and it wasn&#x27;t the same as the picture when I order it ! Never will order hair from here again</li>
    <li> It is thin. Everyone else likes it but I like my wigs full.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my Halloween costume and it was the first time I have ordered a wig online- so I was pretty nervous about quality and if it was going to look like the picture.  I was blown away and soo happy with the product!!  I had a ton of compliments on it and many people thought it was my real hair!!  It was the first time I had a wig that had adjustable/tighteners and that was perfect to keep it on my head all night with dancing and bar hopping in the wind!  I am pretty sure I will be wearing this out on a random night for fun!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I brought it for my mom and she loves it she called me screaming I just love it to death I&#x27;m only going to wear,it on special days oh I love it thank you so much noone will touch this</li>
    <li> This did not worth buying,It tangles easily, I only got to use it once after that it was no good.</li>
    <li> I wore this wig for a photo shoot and on stage.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely long and mermaid-ish, so I cut it to make it look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;No one suspected that it was a wig.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s synthetic, but it looks beautiful on.&lt;br /&gt;The color is great - very funky yet classy.</li>
    <li> Fits well and look good.</li>
    <li> Nice wig, but it tangles really easily. I don&#x27;t know if I would but this wig again.  It&#x27;s really only good for 4 wears and then its time to toss in the trash.</li>
    <li> This should have been described as more of a higher priced Halloween wig. It tangled IMMEDIATELY. I managed to make it work and was able to wear it two times. None of my wigs sprays or wig brushes could help. I kept it on a wig stand. There was nothing more I could do. I only gave it two stars because I will say it was very pretty.  It was a shame it was so poorly made.</li>
    <li> the delivery of the wig was really slow but I was happy I got it though in the 4 week and the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was when they didn&#x27;t notify where was my package was :/ oh well but other than that im happy that I bought this product I maybe ordering from here again</li>
    <li> CUTE WHEN YOU WEAR IT</li>
    <li> Really thin wig, not the same color as posted and cap was super small. Will not buy another of this kind.</li>
    <li> The came early so that was a good thing. BUT! let me warn you, this wig does NOT last long. Maybe two to three days before you can&#x27;t comb it anymore. It&#x27;s really shinny and cheap looking. But over all it&#x27;s better than I thought it would be. Won&#x27;t buy again tho.</li>
    <li> The color show is not a burgundy, its lighter ! The bangs arent as long as they are shown ! It looks like a costume wig ! Something you could pick up at a grocery store with halloween costumes ! Feels like it too !</li>
    <li> I ordered a wine color an I did not get that color an I&#x27;m not satisfied with that at all</li>
    <li> Its cute. I am kinda bummed that the lace in the front is kinda thin so you can do much to style your bangs with out revealing the hair cap ( what the hair is attached to)</li>
    <li> They sold me a red wig when the sales thing said clearly as shown in picture. I was almost gonna STOP purchasing from Amazon ALL together because when I contacted the seller? They did nothing about their messup. I DON&#x27;T recommend anyone buying a wig from them. They take your money and don&#x27;t sell you what you ordered. I wouldn&#x27;t even have given them any  stars period point blank. But it seems that&#x27;s the only way to get to write this review.</li>
    <li> I got this wig in burgundy red its super pretty and long. Thats what im for long flowy lock. I can rock this wig on any occassions from bad days. I am just giving my hones opinion on this wig. I am very satisfied with this wig. But one problem it matts up so I have to run a wig brush and spray it to make it look good. I am definitly ordering another wig.</li>
    <li> This is a decent wig but i think it wasn&#x27;t quite right for me. The bangs are a bit short and the shade of red wasn&#x27;t quite as deep as i expected. Also the loops used to adjust the wig cap size had a line of stitching through them on one side making the cap impossible to adjust. Luckily my head is big so its not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is nice but not great. It doesn&#x27;t feel like real hair but it falls well and its not super shiny and fake looking. I gave mine a good brushing with a wig brush and it didn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> Will be used for my cosplay where I have to have the hair under the hood. It&#x27;s pretty thin but that&#x27;s what you get for the price. I suspect that once i&#x27;m finished with this con I will either not use or not be able to use this wig. I think it will tangle easily.&lt;br /&gt;Color is good, might trim the bangs, length is good.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig! It arrived wayy before the estimated delivery date (about 3 weeks early).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a wig cap that is more of a mesh sock for your head but nonetheless it works. I like that it was packaged and held together in a net to keep it from tangling during shipping. The wig looks sleek and shiny and feels like normal synthetic fibers, but it doesnt look fake like most synthetic wigs (which for $6 is a major plus). I purchased this wig for no real purpose other than to see if i can still pull off long hair (I&#x27;ve had an asymmetrical pixie cut for a few years) and although im happy with how it looks on me, nothing beats my short hair ^.^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheds a tad, but thats to be expected. Highly recommend this wig! Especially looks good paired with a hat or tied to the side :)</li>
    <li> I love this wig a lot. Before my wig comes i thought it will come red as rewiews say. So i wanted to return . Seller was nice and he replied me quickly. But it came in black . I think it is pretty . Just it is not thick . But that&#x27;s okay .</li>
    <li> i am sure that it is a beautiful wig. i cant wait to wear it when it comes!! i love the style and the length, very versital!!! will purchase again in the future!!!</li>
    <li> Wig arrived today and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. The cap itself is smaller than others I have bought in the past which is great for me as I usually have to take them in because they are too big. The wig is a lovely color and thick at the base to the cap close to the scalp. I need to trim the bangs, however I have to do that worn every wig I buy. I would definitely buy this again.  It also arrived way ahead of schedule!</li>
    <li> I received the order and the wig was a red wig instead of a black wig. Wig is EXTREMELY THIN. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I waited 3 weeks for this wig.the picture looks nothing like the wig. The color it was received in was Bright red not the color as in picture  as promised very thin wig.hair from the wig just started falling out like it was not properly sown  in.The reason i choose the rating i did.It was not the product I was led too believe it was.  liked nothing disliked all.I would not recommend this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> I was sent a crazy clown red instead of the dark brownish red so i think it would look better had it been more natural..</li>
    <li> Would give zero stars if I could. Not quality at all!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!! I didn&#x27;t receive my order until about three weeks after I ordered it in which I had to contact the seller after a week to ask if he/she had even shipped it yet! when I received the wig it was NOTHING like the photo or description! it is very thin and no where near the length and its NOT black (as clearly pictured) its a reddish color! this was a waste of my time and money! I will NOT ever order from this seller again! They get two thumbs down from me!</li>
    <li> This being my first wig, I loved the quality of it and it came wonderfully packaged and on time. The colour is as shown but the length of the bangs are a bit longer than in the picture. Overall, great style, great colour, great product :)</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t decide between two or three stars. First day of wearing it, it was nice. It&#x27;s super cute and for me, I didn&#x27;t have to cut the bangs. They were fine the way they were with just a little styling. After approx. 2 days, so tangled. Even gently combing it or finger combing it, chunks of hair coming out. The color was a great color of black, I was looking for a wig that matched my hair color which this succeeded in doing but the quality of this, eh. I&#x27;ve had by far better for the same price. As everyone says though, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Came in toooo thin.&lt;br /&gt;Look very fake.</li>
    <li> Love the wig! It has a great texture but the hair does fall out easily. The color is beautiful. Shipping was okay.</li>
    <li> I love it. The wig cap is a bit small but it can fit  and the hair is gorgeous. Looks real as my own hair. I cant wait to wear it out</li>
    <li> nope wasn&#x27;t even cook; but i think bc of price i didn&#x27;t write a letter&lt;br /&gt;but thanks for trying</li>
    <li> I am a wig wearer just because I  like them. I got tired of fixing my hair every day so decided I&#x27;d try a wig. Holy cow, it was so easy and fun. I can change style every day, and nearly always do, and most of the colors are the same so most people don&#x27;t even know I wear them. I decided to be daring and get this one as I wanted it for a special occasion I have coming up. I want to look different and am guessing I will!! It is much nicer than I actually expected. It has a lovely sheen and looks very real.  It would not be detected as a wig I don&#x27;t think. It really looks real and for the price, that&#x27;s unusual. The only negative issue I have is trying to get it to fit and stay in place. The method of making it smaller leaves something to be desired and if that could be fixed, it would be a really good buy for a wig wearer, or someone who would like to try one just for fun. No everyone is willing to make a change as drastic as wearing a wig, but for those who are, give this one a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to adventurous friends.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t understand how some ppl like this wig,i mean did we not alll get the same wig or did they jus gave me a bad wig,as soon as i got this unit i took it out and it was tangled the bang was so short and choppy. it is nothing like picture.</li>
    <li> Soft, looks like human hair. The bang was thick which I liked very much. Order your own and you will look in the mirror and smile.</li>
    <li> I bought this item expecting it to fit my head but the size was too small for the average adult head.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made but stilllooks good as costume wig. The color is a little darker then shown but it&#x27;s still a cute wig</li>
    <li> Not pictured, very thin, bad stitches.  I had to buy extra hair to fix it.  Not a very good quality wig.</li>
    <li> Curls are perfect! They&#x27;re easy to comb and I can put it in different styles without having to do much. I have about a month with it and is still looking good.</li>
    <li> I got this wig today, this wig look nothing like the picture its ugly its not even the same color not even as long as the picture doent have curls like the picture the curls are loose not as full as the picture the wig they sent me isn&#x27;t the wig in the picture !!!</li>
    <li> This wig didn&#x27;t look good on me it was too big and heavy it just wasnt cute didnt work out</li>
    <li> I expected the color to be black and did I receive!? A plum reddish cherry looking color that is too bright for my complextion definitely a big super NO!</li>
    <li> Loved this wig the 1st day I wore it, but the curls are very hard to comb.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig, sadly i had to  cancel my order. (nothing to do with gooaction or their products) they were very prompt in replying to my emails and were very kind. I will be buying products from gooaction (without having to cancel) in the future. :)</li>
    <li> Thanks for everything hope it makes someone very happy, thanks again. I would recommend it to all of my friends</li>
    <li> Great wig - and for the price you just can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> So nice and thick came in a box with a wig comb and directions on how to wash your wig, simply put I still have the box and adore this wig looks so real</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by this picture, it is not what you will receive. Keep your money, repeat keep your money</li>
    <li> so i got this and it was red not black, very nice material but the curls became nappy after 3weeks so i cut it, looks better now and still cute even if its shoulder length</li>
    <li> expected it to be black, but was red. still very nice.</li>
    <li> This did not come in black and was very thin. I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few months ago, I contacted them a bit after the day it was supposed to come. Said they&#x27;d send another, that one didn&#x27;t come either. :p I ordered a different wig from them previously, and I like it. It&#x27;s too thin to be my ideal wig, but it&#x27;s great for the price which was around 8 dollars.</li>
    <li> I was excited, but yet let down again.. The bangs were so off.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wig and it took it almost a month to get here and then they sent it in a completely different color then the one i ordered...i recommend to not buy this wig</li>
    <li> I love it! I was a little skeptical from other reviews about it being too thin and not the same as the picture, but mine came just as its shown and personally for me this isn&#x27;t too thin. It sheds a little, but for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything amazing. It&#x27;s perfect for the purpose I&#x27;ll be using it for. The length is just under my chest and the bangs are cut nicely. Definitely recommend to use just for fun.</li>
    <li> This Hair sheds all over!! It&#x27;s a reasonable deal but I would like for it to stay on the wig not on the floor.</li>
    <li> Why does this say it is \\&quot;human hair\\&quot; when it&#x27;s not? False advertising. You can&#x27;t buy a Human hair wig anywhere for $7.00.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see &amp;#34;Oblique&amp;#34; until after I received my item and I checked. I received it and saw it was &#x27;red&#x27; aka &#x27;oblique&#x27; which was unexpected. But I guess its my fault for just relying on the provided pictures to lead me to believe this wig was going to be black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just make sure you read the item name/description carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the item quality goes, its a bit tight after a few uses so I just stretch out the straps and its okay. After a few uses though the &#x27;hair&#x27; starts getting frizzy and its kind of hard to comb it without ruining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily sense I don&#x27;t have much use for a &#x27;red-head&#x27; look, I won&#x27;t be using that much. But if it were black, like I thought it would have been, it wouldn&#x27;t have lasted that long.</li>
    <li> Very nice my sister love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig thinking it was cute and something i could wear out. In the picture it looks black with deep burgundy highlights but what i got was an Orange Red wig that was so tangled that I couldn&#x27;t wear it! Contacted seller waiting for a response... I would never purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Not black was light brown almost blonde, that did not matter. I wore it for a week then had to throw it away, the shedding was out of this world terrible!</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig Jan 26th and it got here Feb 13th. Right out of the package it&#x27;s amazing. The hair isn&#x27;t too think and it&#x27;s a bit on the shiny side but I can fix that. It sheds a little bit so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s only 4 stars. So far, I love it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised the wig came with a hair net thing, I already had one but it&#x27;s coo to have extras. The item took a few weeks to arrive(it came from overseas) but it still came within the estimated frame. The very first time I took it out of the bag, it was gorgeous, but a little tangled.AND THE COLOUR WAS A DARK BROWN, NOT BLACK. On a hair colour-number chart, it&#x27;d be about a 4. I attempted to comb it (using a wide-toothed comb to accommodate the curls) and found the task nearly impossible. I immediately decided to straighten it. Whenever I passed the flat iron on it, it gave off this nauseating fume. I can&#x27;t place it but it gave me a headache. When I finally finished, there was hair everywhere-THE WIG SHEDS LIKE CRAZY. I was being gentle too! The wig isn&#x27;t as pretty now without the curls, but at least I can comb it so it doesn&#x27;t look like a ratty mess. LOVE the length, by the way. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7\\&quot; with a 32-D chest, and the hair still came to my waist when straightened. When curly, it comes to just under my bust line. :) The wig is a little thin, but I&#x27;m wearing the wig because I&#x27;m too lazy to deal with my own hair, so it isn&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
    <li> Exactly what is in the picture, beautiful long wig, easy to brush, though a little thin compared to others I&#x27;ve had. Still, I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Not a daily wig to wear.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to I get it I love it</li>
    <li> The wig is cute. I thought that the long length made it look sort of thin, like how fine hair looks bad long, so I cut about 3-4 inches off and it was perfect. I also cut the bangs Bettie Page style because the bangs are pretty long. I think with a wig like this you&#x27;re meant to trim them to your specifications. Unlike another reviewer, my wig was black, not a level 4. Yes, it tangles a little, but not any more or less than any other wig I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m inlove&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a well packaged and made item&lt;br /&gt;I will be placing more orders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just now ordered 2 more</li>
    <li> This is my second review. My Husband bought me three more! LOVIN IT!!! You need a looped wig brush with this wig to keep it nice. Revitalizing Leave in conditioner for synthetic hair will bring your wig back to life. ANY synthetic hair worn consistently will look worn, so by three or more rotate and spray your wig. Invest in a inexpensive Styrofoam mannequin head if you wear her daily. Keep net on when storing. I have rocked this wig for 2 weeks STRONG! Its the BOMB.COM :)</li>
    <li> Okay so the wigs beatuiful nice color and the price is awesome (it was 5buccs when I purchased it) BUT IT TANGLES AS SOON AS YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THE BAG..THIS ISN&#x27;T HUMAN HAIR It feels almost like it... I never put a comb to it only finger comb... after one day the hair on the nap will need to be trimmed...shipping took awhile but it was expected.. it also came with a weaving cap sooo I guess but remeber nothings free u always get what you pay for. I have a video posted on youtube for this hair everyone loves it on me.. youtube name melony23mj&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;6 MONTH REVIEW I loveeee the way this hair ages... its super versital and heat resistant check out my newest video on how to revive the wig... [...]</li>
    <li> It was a nice product that arrived quicker than I expected and was not 100% as advertised in the ad.  But over-all I liked the purchase and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Hair in the picture is so different then what they send to me. The hair they send different red suck look like cheap doll hair. Don&#x27;t buy, I just give it to someone waist of money.smh never again</li>
    <li> Good to wear for photos but a bit of styling is required.</li>
    <li> OMG, worhtless! Costume wig of poor quality. Do not watste your money.</li>
    <li> I put the wig on. Put it back in the bag. I put it on the next day and it was frizzy on the ends. I thought this was an expensive wig. A waste of my money. I don&#x27;t recommend it to people who wear wigs everyday.</li>
    <li> for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> I love my wig,i cannot believe it was a human hair,the wig was wonderful And the prize I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a human,when I received my hair I tested it with my curler.and it didn&#x27;t Melt off,I love my wig,for that price it great.and am the Queen of wig.love itttttttt.</li>
