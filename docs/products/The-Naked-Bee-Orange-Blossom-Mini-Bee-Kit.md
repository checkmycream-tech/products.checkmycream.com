      <li>The Hand sanitizer smells nice but is WAY to runny -</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and is perfect for small bags.</li>
      <li>teachers/employees - great products - lip balm quickly becomes everyones favorite, (still won&#x27;t replace my cherry chapstick though) and the lotion is really nice -</li>
      <li>I love this mini kit.</li>
      <li>When I twist off the top it gets all over because it is so runny.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I love the smell of these products.  </li>

      <li>I love naked bee products they are wonderful.</li>

      <li>My office is scent free</li>
      <li>I love the lip balm and moisturizes my lips, great protection for the winter season, sans the harsh petroleum based ingredients like the leading brands.</li>
      <li>I had no idea how much I would love it, so i rely on Amazon for getting it now.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and was wrapped.</li>
      <li>I used this little kit for stocking stuffers and plan to order more for my own use for travel and purse.  </li>
      <li>and I manage to sneak it in because it smells like peeling fresh oranges.</li>
      <li>but if you are not a lover of waxy-ish lip texture give it away because this is worth buying for the lotion and sanitizer.</li>
      <li>Although on the small size (as it says in the listing) this is a great way to introduce someone into the &amp;#34;Naked Bee&amp;#34; product world.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, will definitely buy again</li>
      <li>For  the price,  I was better off buying the regular sized lotions.</li>
      <li>I love Naked Bee, but this product volume was sparse.</li>
      <li>This is a gift for my boss - if she likes it, for her birthday i&#x27;ll be getting a large pump bottle of the lotion for her.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I am familiar with naked bee having purchased the lip balm elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I first saw The Naked Bee in Bandon, Oregon and purchased the Orange Blossom Honey lotion for a friend and I.</li>

<li> I am familiar with naked bee having purchased the lip balm elsewhere.</li>
<li> I first saw The Naked Bee in Bandon, Oregon and purchased the Orange Blossom Honey lotion for a friend and I.</li>
<li> The hand cream and sanitizer has a subtle and fresh smelling orange blossom scent.</li>
<li> The reason for only three stars is because the antibacterial gel is super thin.</li>
<li> I expected much larger sizes.</li>
<li> Also,the hand sanitizer oozes out too fast which can be quite messy.</li>
<li> I purchased this set because I like to try the lip balm and the scent of the orange blossom and have tried the hand salve in the past and protected my sensitive skin (suffer from eczema).</li>
<li> Vegas is a dry place!</li>
<li> The lotion is thin enough to spread quickly and absorb without being too thick or greasy.  </li>
<li> Love product hate it&#x27;s price</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is the trial sizes are really small.</li>
<li> you unscrew the little lid and it pours out like water</li>
<li> Nice...a little too small for my needs.</li>
<li> Reallllllly small.</li>
<li> Ridiculously small.  </li>
<li> I am picky on chapstick and I am just not loving the feel of it.</li>
<li> Disappointed in that as I do not want to carry that in my purse and have it leak.</li>

    <li> Yummmmy smell.  I love the smell of these products.  The lotion is thin enough to spread quickly and absorb without being too thick or greasy.  The lip balm is nice and doesn&#x27;t have any funky taste.  I bought this to try because I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on the larger sizes until I tried it.  I will be buying the larger lotion now.  The only complaint I have is the trial sizes are really small.</li>
    <li> Loved the way the product softens the skin and would purchase again.  However, I would look for an unscented as it fairly strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously small.  I expected much larger sizes.</li>
    <li> Reallllllly small. I got it as a gift for someone.</li>
    <li> Love product hate it&#x27;s price but it&#x27;s just so awesome.</li>
    <li> I love naked bee products they are wonderful. The scents are amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I help out in a kindergarten class and the kids swarm me asking for some lotion when I use it. We all absolutely LOVE the scent!!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas as a stocking stuffer to see if she liked the products. The sizes were great for her to carry in her son&#x27;s diaper bag when she was on the go.</li>

    <li> I love Naked Bee, but this product volume was sparse. It could have been greater in ounces.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with naked bee having purchased the lip balm elsewhere. This trio is going to be a gift for two of my friends. I also purchased one for me!  Arrived quickly and was wrapped. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Nice...a little too small for my needs.</li>
    <li> I buy these as gifts for Daycare providers/teachers/employees - great products - lip balm quickly becomes everyones favorite, (still won&#x27;t replace my cherry chapstick though) and the lotion is really nice - it smells good and absorbs nicely. The Hand sanitizer smells nice but is WAY to runny - you unscrew the little lid and it pours out like water so know that in advance.</li>
    <li> When they said MINI they meant it!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect purse sizes of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> For  the price,  I was better off buying the regular sized lotions. Also,the hand sanitizer oozes out too fast which can be quite messy.</li>

    <li> Perfect little set for purse or pocket and to take on trips. Beautiful scent and makes skin your skin feel great!!</li>

    <li> Love this stuff.  Works great and smells delish.  I bought this as a teacher&#x27;s gift and it was a big hit.</li>

    <li> Love the clean smell, buy it for all my grandchildren.</li>
    <li> I love this product but I had an issue with the chapstick. I am picky on chapstick and I am just not loving the feel of it. Maybe its just me but if you are not a lover of waxy-ish lip texture give it away because this is worth buying for the lotion and sanitizer. All of it smells amazing, in my point of view.</li>
    <li> Although on the small size (as it says in the listing) this is a great way to introduce someone into the &amp;#34;Naked Bee&amp;#34; product world. I first saw The Naked Bee in Bandon, Oregon and purchased the Orange Blossom Honey lotion for a friend and I. I had no idea how much I would love it, so i rely on Amazon for getting it now. I had no idea that honey was so moisturizing and antibacterial. This is a gift for my boss - if she likes it, for her birthday i&#x27;ll be getting a large pump bottle of the lotion for her. Vegas is a dry place! Highly recommend! Ü&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve attached a picture for a visual of just how big it is)</li>
    <li> love love love  theses products!!!</li>
