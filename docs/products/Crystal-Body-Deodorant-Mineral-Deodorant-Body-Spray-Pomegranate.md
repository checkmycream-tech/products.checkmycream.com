      <li>won&#x27;t regret purchasing this Fabulous product.</li>
      <li>but this is a great second!</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s important</li>
      <li>I love this stuff because it really works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the roll-on and the stone versions of Crystal and was excited to find a scented version.</li>
      <li>then using roll-on on a wiped clean underarm doesn&#x27;t keep the odor away all day.</li>
      <li>So I figured waxing my under arms would help clean everything out.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something sweet and fruity</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet, fruity, and feminine.</li>
      <li>AND it&#x27;s great for any other areas that tend to get sweaty and smelly and aren&#x27;t &#x27;roll-on&#x27; shaped.</li>
      <li>:) I am very impressed with this product and sad that it is no longer sold in stores in my area.</li>
      <li>Both my mother and grandmother had breast cancer and luckily survived it.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy with Crystal deodorants, because unlike other natural ones, these seemed to work.  </li>
      <li>definetly worth a try</li>
      <li>and I rarely smell.</li>
      <li>I like these products, because I\\&quot;m sensitive to many deodorants and these work well for me.</li>
      <li>Remember to use this spray right after you have showered.</li>
      <li>Crystal deodorant sticks work much better at keeping you dry and odor free</li>
      <li>I got rid of my deodorants and went back to searching for a good natural one.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if you are aware, but All deodorants crystals, crystal deodorant roll-ons, and crystal deodorant sprays contain either:</li>
      <li>and i love their different scents</li>
      <li>I no longer have to feel self-conscious in hot weather.</li>
      <li>and this is my first Pomegranate one.</li>
      <li>My arms are completely odor free.</li>
      <li>I had tried so many different things to stop my underarm odor</li>
      <li>A quick rinse under hot water helps but it doesn&#x27;t spray out like it did when it was new.  </li>
      <li>You spray it on yourself, but more importantly, in those little areas where you can develop an odor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not realistic to stop perspiration,,, Crystal Essence keeps me smelling nice without perfume, I have sensitive skin and no problems there</li>
      <li>Better than any other I&#x27;ve tried from the chemical laden to the naturals.</li>
      <li>The key, spray it on clean skin before bacteria sets in or it won&#x27;t work if you already have an odor.</li>
      <li>I usually use the roll-on, but I find that if you&#x27;re not a shower every day kind of person</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend it</li>
      <li>Other than that I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s Calm Fresh Scent and Deodorizing properties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I first use some of the spray right after I shower, let it dry a bit and then put some of the roll-on deodorant.</li>
      <li>but i wish the deisgn of the spray tube and nozzle were a little more accomodating for the thicker consistency of the liquid.</li>
      <li>They state that salts are too big to be absorbed.  </li>
      <li>All of the scents for this body spray smell strong only for the second you spray them</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obviously marketed as a healthy alternative to aluminum deodorants and is found in a ton of health food stores, but this apparently HAS aluminum in it, just under a different name.</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona today&#x27;s temp is 108 and it will get hotter as summer passes.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive underarms</li>
      <li>I am a biochemist and have taken many chemistry classes, but that&#x27;s not even necessary to understand that salts dissolve with water or other solvents, so you are actually applying ions (tiny and easily absorbed) to your skin.  </li>
      <li>As far as the scent...</li>
      <li>After my mom&#x27;s diagnosis we started to make lifestyle changes to lower our risk; switching to a natural deodorant was one of the changes.  </li>
      <li>The deodorant action does actually work but the lack of antiperspirant takes some getting used to!</li>
      <li>only drawback is that the spray nozzle and tube frequently becomes clogged.  </li>
      <li>Such an inexpensive item it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble of returning.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Body Deodorant for a long time now</li>
<li> I could smell this all day long</li>
<li> I was told that antiperspirants take a long time to get out of your system</li>
<li> It does take a while to dry</li>
<li> Just takes a while to dry off but all in all</li>
<li> then I add baby powder (cornstach) and that helps, some, to keep me dry.</li>
<li> The deodorant is a great product but not sure how the spray is :(</li>
<li> I prefer the spray application to the roll-on only because it doesn&#x27;t go on as heavily</li>
<li> I actually waxed my under arms a few times to pull the hair follicles out.  </li>
<li> So with that and the false labeling, it&#x27;s going straight in the trash...</li>
<li> Unlike the other reviewer, I don&#x27;t use this under my arms.</li>
<li> I used it twice anyway and found it really messy to apply, as soon as you spray it, it starts running down your arms, and takes a while to dry,</li>
<li> I got my husband a less feminine scent</li>
<li> AND sometimes it funks up my roll-on bottle so that it permanently works less well.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not really a sweet smell like I was hoping for.</li>
<li> I did notice that after wearing antiperspirant for years it did take a little while for my body to get used to switching over.</li>
<li> Uhh, I feel a little duped w/ this...</li>
<li> what I do (to get around this annoyance) is open the bottle and poor a little of the product on a cotton ball and apply it to the body . . .</li>
<li> Crystal deodorants are no better for you than antiperspirants containing aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
<li> I always thought underarms smell in the past.</li>
<li> I note that I don&#x27;t suffer from excessive sweating.</li>
<li> I had to use antiperspirant at least two times a day.</li>
<li> but unfortunately, this has a bit of a sour scent.</li>
<li> Not terribly pleasant.</li>
<li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave disgusting, crusty, white residues on your clothing like other deodorants do.</li>
<li> and unfortunately I cannot use any anti-persperant because I am allergic to the aluminum.  </li>
<li> It has nothing artificial and it allows your body to sweat without smelling.</li>

    <li> I live in Arizona today&#x27;s temp is 108 and it will get hotter as summer passes.  It&#x27;s not realistic to stop perspiration,,, Crystal Essence keeps me smelling nice without perfume, I have sensitive skin and no problems there I love this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this from the grocery store and do not like it at all. Crystal deodorant sticks work much better at keeping you dry and odor free but my store stopped carrying it. This spray does nothing to stop wetness.</li>
    <li> Unlike the other reviewer, I don&#x27;t use this under my arms. I use the thai stick which is awesome. This spray is lightly scented, a good replacement for body sprays and perfumes. You spray it on yourself, but more importantly, in those little areas where you can develop an odor. Spraying this on after a bath or shower. It stops the bacteria that causes odor from forming and it works really great. The key, spray it on clean skin before bacteria sets in or it won&#x27;t work if you already have an odor.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff around!</li>
    <li> Uhh, I feel a little duped w/ this... It&#x27;s obviously marketed as a healthy alternative to aluminum deodorants and is found in a ton of health food stores, but this apparently HAS aluminum in it, just under a different name. Didn&#x27;t realize that til I brought it home. I used it twice anyway and found it really messy to apply, as soon as you spray it, it starts running down your arms, and takes a while to dry, just gross. Smells like some kind of super sweet perfume I would have bought at age 13 too. So with that and the false labeling, it&#x27;s going straight in the trash...</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Body Deodorant for a long time now and this is my first Pomegranate one. It smells good but strong at first and then it subsides. All of the scents for this body spray smell strong only for the second you spray them and then it goes away. I like that it has no chemicals in it, nor parabens, etc. I use this for any part of my body that needs refreshing! Underarms, Feet, and even private parts. It lasts for about 8 hours and then reapply it if needed. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product... I use it as a deodorant as well as a body spray and to freshen up clothing that I have worn all day. This is my favorite scent out of all of their scents. It&#x27;s sweet, fruity, and feminine. This product doesn&#x27;t leave disgusting, crusty, white residues on your clothing like other deodorants do. And it&#x27;s cancer-free. :) I am very impressed with this product and sad that it is no longer sold in stores in my area. Thank Jesus for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered the spray, and received the roll-on....still a great product but would have much rather have had the spray. Such an inexpensive item it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble of returning.</li>
    <li> The deodorant is a great product but not sure how the spray is :( I was sent a deodorant but will keep it and order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the roll-on and the stone versions of Crystal and was excited to find a scented version. I was hoping for something sweet and fruity but unfortunately, this has a bit of a sour scent. Not terribly pleasant. Now I wish I&#x27;d tried a different scent! The deodorant action does actually work but the lack of antiperspirant takes some getting used to!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! It has nothing artificial and it allows your body to sweat without smelling. The toxins come out as they should but you don&#x27;t smell. I did notice that after wearing antiperspirant for years it did take a little while for my body to get used to switching over. I actually waxed my under arms a few times to pull the hair follicles out.  I was told that antiperspirants take a long time to get out of your system So I figured waxing my under arms would help clean everything out. Just a thought..  I always thought underarms smell in the past. I had to use antiperspirant at least two times a day. Now I only use this once a day and I rarely smell. I am so grateful for this product</li>
    <li> I bought this and the smell was okay. It&#x27;s not really a sweet smell like I was hoping for. I used it for a week and my friend told me I smelled like b.o.! I smelled closely and it just smelled like the deodorant but with a hint of b.o.! I trashed this product and bought the salt crystal again. I&#x27;d rather smell like nothing than body odor!</li>
    <li> it does´t work for me. Smells good, really liquid, non viscose texture. I expect to be more astringent, but almost don´t feel it.</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELLS YUMMY AND NO WHITE ON SHIRTS AND NO CHEMICALS SAFE GREAT PRODUCT WOULD BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN.  TERRIFIC</li>
    <li> This smells great. It is strong and can be used as a body scent because you cannot use this and then use your parfume unless they mix. I could smell this all day long</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if you are aware, but All deodorants crystals, crystal deodorant roll-ons, and crystal deodorant sprays contain either: Ammonium Alum, also known as ammonium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate or Potassium Alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate. Both potassium and ammonium alum have the same potential toxicity as Aluminum Chlorohydrate there for its an Aluminum salt just like aluminum chlorohydrate. Crystal deodorants are no better for you than antiperspirants containing aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
    <li> I have sampled plenty of deodorants in my short stay on this earth BUT this one Beats them all!&lt;br /&gt;However, I will say that I gave this four (4) stars only not for the deodorant itself (which would get TEN [10] Stars if It were possible) BUT for the spraying mechanism. The mister can clog up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;So what I do (to get around this annoyance) is open the bottle and poor a little of the product on a cotton ball and apply it to the body . . . No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to write the Company about this issue. Other than that I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s Calm Fresh Scent and Deodorizing properties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> Because it is not an anti-persperent it doesn&#x27;t stop wetness, but it does stop odor.  So, I wait till it dries then I add baby powder (cornstach) and that helps, some, to keep me dry.</li>
    <li> good deodorant, i prefer the one from desert essence but this is a great second! definetly worth a try and i love their different scents</li>
    <li> I like these products, because I\\&quot;m sensitive to many deodorants and these work well for me. I usually use the roll-on, but I find that if you&#x27;re not a shower every day kind of person (I&#x27;m not) then using roll-on on a wiped clean underarm doesn&#x27;t keep the odor away all day. AND sometimes it funks up my roll-on bottle so that it permanently works less well. This spray does the trick on non-shower days, keeping odor gone for the workday (I reapply when I get home). AND it&#x27;s great for any other areas that tend to get sweaty and smelly and aren&#x27;t &#x27;roll-on&#x27; shaped.</li>
    <li> Both my mother and grandmother had breast cancer and luckily survived it.  After my mom&#x27;s diagnosis we started to make lifestyle changes to lower our risk; switching to a natural deodorant was one of the changes.  I was very happy with Crystal deodorants, because unlike other natural ones, these seemed to work.  I used them for about 3 years (the spray and roll-on versions) on a daily basis UNTIL one day, I was reading the list of ingredients and saw: Potassium Alum.  I started searching for information about the safety of aluminum salts and came across the Crystal website.  They state that salts are too big to be absorbed.  I am a biochemist and have taken many chemistry classes, but that&#x27;s not even necessary to understand that salts dissolve with water or other solvents, so you are actually applying ions (tiny and easily absorbed) to your skin.  I got rid of my deodorants and went back to searching for a good natural one.  This site provides helpful info about alum salts in Crystal deodorant: http://chemicaloftheday.squarespace.com/most-controversial/2010/3/8/exposing-more-truths-about-alum.html</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive underarms and unfortunately I cannot use any anti-persperant because I am allergic to the aluminum.  The Crystal Essence Deodorant Spray in Pomegranate does what it says, it stops you from smelling bad.  Please note that this product is DEODORANT, not anti-persperant!  Knowing this, I had no expectation that it would prevent sweating, it is not made to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice and fruity, not too overpowering.  I use it every morning after I shower and I remain bad-smell-free until bedtime.  It does take a while to dry but it is not sticky and does not stain my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the spray nozzle and tube frequently becomes clogged.  A quick rinse under hot water helps but it doesn&#x27;t spray out like it did when it was new.  I prefer the spray application to the roll-on only because it doesn&#x27;t go on as heavily but i wish the deisgn of the spray tube and nozzle were a little more accomodating for the thicker consistency of the liquid.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I am compelled to comment on deodorant but this stuff is the best. It keeps the stink away all day. I got my husband a less feminine scent and it works for him too. Better than any other I&#x27;ve tried from the chemical laden to the naturals.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it definately takes care of armpit odor.  Just takes a while to dry off but all in all i would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because it really works! I had tried so many different things to stop my underarm odor but nothing seemed to work. I tried different clinical strength deodorants and even tried rubbing lemon under my arms to stop the odor created by bacteria. Nothing worked until I bought this in conjunction with the roll-on deodorant. I first use some of the spray right after I shower, let it dry a bit and then put some of the roll-on deodorant. It seems to have done the trick. I no longer have to feel self-conscious in hot weather. My arms are completely odor free. This is a miracle product for me and I will not use anything else again. As far as the scent... it just ok. I would like for them to try to make one with a strawberry scent or even peach. Also it&#x27;s important I note that I don&#x27;t suffer from excessive sweating. So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will help with that then this is not it. But it will definitely work to prevent underarm odor. Remember to use this spray right after you have showered. I have not tried it on it&#x27;s own rather in conjunction with the roll-on deodorant so I am unsure if that may make a difference on it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
