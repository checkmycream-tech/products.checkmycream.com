      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>i love it!</li>
      <li>It also smells nice.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice, and took away that \\&quot;perm smell\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>And it has a nice scent too.</li>
      <li>Like many others have said in reviews I&#x27;ve read, I have tried a whole lot of curly hair products, and Curls Rock Curl Amplifier is the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Holds curls and easy to work with!  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to experiment with the amount that you use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying it, and i will probably put a video review if i see the results keep on for longer time.</li>
      <li>Love this porduct for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>In fact my hair seems to have even more curl now</li>
      <li>The curls rock amplifier is the 1st product that I&#x27;ve found that actually holds my curls all day perfectly with no frizz.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work okay at keeping the frizz away.</li>
      <li>if I need more control (like on humid days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read that this product may be discontinued, so I went ahead and ordered four more bottles.</li>
      <li>Curls hold and hair feels healthy, not \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Always a pleasure to work with this company - I have bought from them many times.  </li>
      <li>It was totally awesome, ordered it and next day was at my house</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products and I must say this is one I love and have stuck with.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more of a cream</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off not using any product than using this one.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and the one I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
      <li>This works best for me when my hair is damp but not soaking wet.</li>
      <li>Another great thing is that it does not dry it out!   : )</li>
      <li>The one good comment I can make about this is that it smells amazing, but other than that, I can&#x27;t say anything nice.</li>
      <li>You will have to experiment with how much to put on, but when you get the right amount it works great.  </li>
      <li>Rest in peace, old amazing formula!</li>
      <li>A problem I have with most products is that my hair can very easily look greasy if I use the littlest bit too much, and this doesn&#x27;t ever seem to happen with Curls Rock.</li>
      <li>I think this product is great; it is one of the only things that works on my hair.</li>
      <li>It was my experience that it is best to limit brushing the curls after the hair is dried because they become unwound, unlike a moose product.</li>
      <li>dry looks great.</li>
      <li>Also, if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair every morning, I seem to be able to just spritz my hair with water and smooth it, and it dries just the same as if it&#x27;s freshly done :)</li>
      <li>After trying many different products for curly hair, this has been my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair that is not extremely curly on its own</li>
      <li>When using the right amount not too much or too less, it makes your hair seem like the perfect curl.</li>
      <li>On rainy days, I might put more product in my hair to keep it from getting frizzy, and on dry days, I focus on the length of the hair more than the roots.     </li>
      <li>Love this product because it is simple and easy.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair curly all day and often it still looks nice into the next day!  </li>
      <li>I have been using Curls Rock for a few years now, and it really is one of the best for naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair that I can style straight or curly, but I definitely need product to control frizz - which this product does a GREAT job of doing.</li>
      <li>You can even use a diffuser after the application if you need your hair to dry more quickly.</li>
      <li>I just got my first perm ever, and have never had to deal with frizz.</li>
      <li>Most people should only need 1 or 2 pumps of product to take care of all their hair.</li>
      <li>Curls Rock was recommended to me when I first started getting my hair permed, almost five years ago.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - it&#x27;s the only thing that holds my curl and gives it definition and controls the frizz.  </li>
      <li>Much better results with Mixed Chicks brand.</li>
      <li>This product has been working magic on my curly hair for several years now.</li>
      <li>Great product, works well with humid weather, it defines my curls really well, and last the entire day.</li>
      <li>It makes my curs so nice and defined and really in no time.</li>
      <li>I have pretty long hair and just need one pump of Curls Rock on wet hair to make my wavy curls look great all day.  </li>
      <li>Many gel products feel like they dry your hair out, but this product is creamy and almost seems to condition your hair.</li>
      <li>I love trying new hair products, but I always end up coming back to Catwalk Curls Rock curl amplifier.  </li>
      <li>Also I used to have to wet my hair down everyday in order for it to look good, but now the curls still look great in the morning.  </li>
      <li>If you really want to stick with TIGI, then I recommend the Split End mender for taming frizz.</li>
      <li>If you use too much, your hair will be sticky and it will flake.</li>
      <li>I really, really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>Item arrived really fast and the way it was described, thank you.</li>
      <li>and I do not like it as much.  </li>
      <li>My 2 problems are that my hair gets very frizzy and by the end of the day my curls begin to flatten or fall out.  </li>
      <li>It really must depend on your hair type.</li>
      <li>Really succesful transaction</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much, though.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind so much because I have a lot of hair, so</li>
      <li>I pretty much can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair super soft to the touch looks completely natural, but miraculously the curls do not separate into frizz.  </li>
      <li>this product keeps my hair in place and frizz free all day long.</li>
      <li>but I think I&#x27;m actually for the 1st time seeing what my true curls look like.  </li>
      <li>It makes curls much more defined and less frizzy.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product thinking it was the classic, Catwalk Curls Rock amplifier and got the \\&quot;Curlesque\\&quot; formula instead.</li>
      <li>Until now the only stuff I&#x27;ve found able to keep the curls under control makes it really obvious</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It seems to work okay at keeping the frizz away. I just got my first perm ever, and have never had to deal with frizz. It seems I am not really dealing with frizz now, so it must be working. It does make my hair a little crispy because I can&#x27;t evenly distribute it through my hair, but it basically just looks wet. It smells really nice, and took away that \\&quot;perm smell\\&quot;. I used this on my hair the day after washing it, all I did was wet it down and it looks like I just washed it.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to trying new hair products.  I have wavy hair that is not extremely curly on its own so I have to use a product to make it curly.  I have been using Curls Rock for over 5 years now and have found nothing that even compares.  It keeps my hair curly all day and often it still looks nice into the next day!  It also smells great!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly long hair that tends to get a little on the frizzy side. After washing and conditioning hair, I put a little on my palm, rub my hands together and put all through my hair. I let my hair dry natural and the curls in my hair after it&#x27;s dry looks great.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like this product. I chose it based upon the reviews on Amazon. I have naturally wavy/curly coarse, frizzy hair and was looking for a new product to help tame it. Sadly, this didn&#x27;t work. It seems to weigh my hair down, straightening it and giving it a \\&quot;crisp\\&quot; feel no matter how little I put in. In addition, the product seems to flake off of my hair. I find that my hair actually looks frizzier when I use this, like the product dries out my hair. The one good comment I can make about this is that it smells amazing, but other than that, I can&#x27;t say anything nice. I decided to go back to my old product - Matrix Curl.life contouring cream. This was a big let down (and I&#x27;ve never disliked a TIGI product before!) If you really want to stick with TIGI, then I recommend the Split End mender for taming frizz. You&#x27;re better off not using any product than using this one.</li>
    <li> although i have wavy hair i like to wear it straight and slicked back in a low pony tail. this product keeps my hair in place and frizz free all day long. i love it!</li>
    <li> I received several compliments at work the first time I used this product. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It makes curls much more defined and less frizzy. I read that this product may be discontinued, so I went ahead and ordered four more bottles. I do not think it is overpriced, as it works great and only a very small amount (I use one pump) is needed each day, so one bottle will go a long way. The two pack is a great value compared to what this costs at the store. Like many others have said in reviews I&#x27;ve read, I have tried a whole lot of curly hair products, and Curls Rock Curl Amplifier is the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My friend turned me on to this product.  I love it.  Be sure to experiment with the amount that you use.  I have pretty long hair and just need one pump of Curls Rock on wet hair to make my wavy curls look great all day.  You can even use a diffuser after the application if you need your hair to dry more quickly.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great; it is one of the only things that works on my hair. I have curly frizzy hair and this product controls that and keeps my hair in place and looking good. Another great thing is that it does not dry it out!   : )</li>
    <li> This is the best product for curly hair that I&#x27;ve found! My daughter and I had been using the Biolage Gelee for years but this feels so much better in our hair and a little goes a long way. Curls hold and hair feels healthy, not \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; like some gels make hair feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and it works great with curly hair.  Just put it on after a shower and it keeps the friz down with out looking like a helmet.  You will have to experiment with how much to put on, but when you get the right amount it works great.  My 9 year old daughter has curly hair and she is using it now too, it make a big difference for her.</li>
    <li> I love trying new hair products, but I always end up coming back to Catwalk Curls Rock curl amplifier.  It holds my curls together without being too stiff.  A little goes a long way.  And it has a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curls Rock for 4 years and haven&#x27;t found anything else that is as good with my 2C curly hair.  Great product, works well with humid weather, it defines my curls really well, and last the entire day.</li>
    <li> I hope they never get rid of this product because it is the only one that gives my hair curl without frizz.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products and I must say this is one I love and have stuck with. When using the right amount not too much or too less, it makes your hair seem like the perfect curl. Not too crispy like moose can do but not frizzy either. The thing I like about it as well is you don&#x27;t use a lot of product to get the desired effect. Great Stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This product has been working magic on my curly hair for several years now. It brings out the individual curls in my hair without any crunchiness/stiffness. I still have not tried TIGI&#x27;s new formula for Curls Rock, but I wish that they didn&#x27;t change something that already worked so well.</li>
    <li> I have really curly and thick dark hair. Over the years I have tried a multitude of products and I have happily used Curls Rock for years. You must be careful with product application--too much can definitely leave hair feeling crunchy. However if you apply the right amount you get perfect curl control without the crunchiness. Others mentioned this product leaving a residue in their hair. My hair is dark brown and I have never had this problem. And yes, the product is sticky but it is water soluble so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I love Curls Rock!</li>
    <li> This product is great! The stores here in TN have stopped stocking it. I am so glad I found it on Amazon! It helps manage my curls without weighing them down! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I pretty much can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Several years ago I asked a stylist in Back Bay, Boston what she would recommend to use on curly hair; I was looking for a suggestion for a product to buy and bring home. This is what she sent me home with, and I have been using it faithfully ever since.    This works best for me when my hair is damp but not soaking wet. Most people should only need 1 or 2 pumps of product to take care of all their hair. I never have to worry about frizz or out-of-control hair with this. As other reviewers have commented, if you use too much, you can get that crunchy feeling. It doesn&#x27;t take long to get a sense for how much product is right for you. I&#x27;ll also note that some people complain of needing to wash their hands afterward... that only happens to me when my hair is too dry during application. I usually put a few drops of water on my palm and that is good enough to help me rub the rest of it through.    This stuff works great and also smells very nice -- I have gotten a lot of comments on it!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair, and this is the only product that gives the curls a nice hold without being too sticky. Many gel products feel like they dry your hair out, but this product is creamy and almost seems to condition your hair. After trying many different products for curly hair, this has been my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to enhance my curly hair for some time and finally found this!  This provides hold and frizz protection all day without weighing down my curls.  To address others&#x27; comments: yes, it&#x27;s sticky on your hands.  Just wash your hands. It&#x27;s not sticky once it&#x27;s on your hair.  Yes, it can leave your hair very stiff if you use too much.  I have long hair (well past my shoulders) and just use one pump.  Try using less and see how that works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the one I can&#x27;t live without! It makes my curs so nice and defined and really in no time. I go between staight and curly hair and when I don&#x27;t have the time for the iron, after I wash my hair I just put Catwalk and scrunch my hair, and its done. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product off of amazon and have been using it for the last 2 days. I have naturally wavy hair that I can style straight or curly, but I definitely need product to control frizz - which this product does a GREAT job of doing. I normally have just used gel in my hair, but it can still get a little frizzy if I missed an area (especially around my part since I don&#x27;t normally put gel that high). One pump of this stuff on damp hair and my frizz is gone! So if frizz is one of your main problems, try this product.    The description says that it will also add volume to your curls. This is not the case for me - in fact, my hair actually seems more limp and flat.  I don&#x27;t mind so much because I have a lot of hair, so volume has never been an issue for me. But if you&#x27;re looking for volume, I don&#x27;t recommend this product. And actually, if you&#x27;re looking for tighter, boucier curls then skip this. In addition to less volume, I find that this product actually straightens out my curls a bit. Might be a different result for people who have more naturally curly (as opposed to wavy) hair, but other products I&#x27;ve used result in a more curly, less wavy look, for me.</li>
    <li> I have just used this product for about a week and i must say i&#x27;m very happy about the results. Whichever product i used (gel, mousse or cream or the 3 of them together) would last only for a couple of hours and by the end of the day i would have again the frizz all over me, while this product lasts all day long.   I also notice i dont have the need to wash my hair daily or dry it with a dryer. I just let it dry alone, and whenever i want to improve it, i add a little water to my hair and fix it with my hands.   I&#x27;m really enjoying it, and i will probably put a video review if i see the results keep on for longer time.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this product on my daughters soft, fine, thick, very curly hair. It left a sticky white residue and left her curls limp and lifeless. Even with a small amount this was the effect. It really must depend on your hair type. Much better results with Mixed Chicks brand.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that I have to put some sort of product in otherwise it&#x27;s frizzy looking. Gels are too heavy so that&#x27;s why I like Curls Rock, it&#x27;s more of a cream and you only need one pump. Since this is a subscribe and save item I get it delivered to my house every other month and it&#x27;s cheaper than at any store.</li>
    <li> It was totally awesome, ordered it and next day was at my house and I was washing my hair With my new shampoo.. Really succesful transaction</li>
    <li> Curls Rock was recommended to me when I first started getting my hair permed, almost five years ago. My hair is naturally wavy, frizzy, and hard to manage. I&#x27;ve tried other curly hair products since then (Fructis, Biolage, Suave, Aquage, and others) but I&#x27;ve never found anything that outperforms Curls Rock.  I found I don&#x27;t even need to invest in the other components of the Curls Rock styling system. I just work 2-3 pumps of the Amplifier into my hair (towel-dried just enough so it doesn&#x27;t drip, and either combed with a wide-toothed comb or not combed at all) and dry it with a diffuser (standing up until it&#x27;s mostly dried, and then also bending over for body) or let it air dry. Depending on the amount I use and the way I dry it, my hair will either end up with a natural look and feel or harder, crunchy, very-defined curls. I like both styles.     A problem I have with most products is that my hair can very easily look greasy if I use the littlest bit too much, and this doesn&#x27;t ever seem to happen with Curls Rock. On rainy days, I might put more product in my hair to keep it from getting frizzy, and on dry days, I focus on the length of the hair more than the roots.     One last thing: it doesn&#x27;t build up in my hair like other products do, so I don&#x27;t have to use any special clarifying shampoos to strip the crud off my hair. Because it doesn&#x27;t build up, the product keeps working every time I style it, whereas it used to seem that my hair &#x27;got used to&#x27; other products and stopped responding to them after a while. I can reliably use this product day in and day out and know it&#x27;ll work just like it did years ago.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - it&#x27;s the only thing that holds my curl and gives it definition and controls the frizz.  I put it in wet hair and use my dryer with a diffuser attachment.  No need for extra hair spray - keeps my curl set all day!  I can&#x27;t be without this stuff.  (PS:  A little goes a long way)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that I&#x27;m disappointed by this product. It curls the hair but tends to be sticky at times and it leaves a really bad white dandruff-like residue on the hair that is really noticeable, hard to get off and embarrassing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair for a while now and its the only curl enhancer that doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and crispy! Its the best!</li>
    <li> I never even knew about this until a few weeks ago when it was recommended to me by a friend, but I am SO glad I tried it; this is the best goo I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair!  I have naturally super thick, frizzy, crazy hair.  Until now the only stuff I&#x27;ve found able to keep the curls under control makes it really obvious there&#x27;s product in my hair so that it&#x27;s wet looking or crunchy feeling.  This makes my hair super soft to the touch looks completely natural, but miraculously the curls do not separate into frizz.  After I started wearing this, everyone I knew that saw me asked if I curled my hair.  Nope, just wasn&#x27;t afraid to wear it down for more than ten minutes!  Also, if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair every morning, I seem to be able to just spritz my hair with water and smooth it, and it dries just the same as if it&#x27;s freshly done :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product for curly hair and the fact that it comes in a duo is even better!!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products to help tame my curls.  My 2 problems are that my hair gets very frizzy and by the end of the day my curls begin to flatten or fall out.  The curls rock amplifier is the 1st product that I&#x27;ve found that actually holds my curls all day perfectly with no frizz.  In fact my hair seems to have even more curl now but I think I&#x27;m actually for the 1st time seeing what my true curls look like.  Also I used to have to wet my hair down everyday in order for it to look good, but now the curls still look great in the morning.  I&#x27;m floored by how well this product works and would highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair.  Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> There are many products for curly hair on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried many of them) but this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used! I noticed the difference as soon as I put the product in my hair. It felt softer and silkier. It doesn&#x27;t dry stiff like some other products. It makes my curls appear shinier and smoother with much less frizz! It also smells nice. I sometimes combine this product with a firm holding gel like [[ASIN:B000QW5PWK Biolage Gelee ]] if I need more control (like on humid days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can find this product locally for about $14.99 + tax per bottle. The 2-pack price here of $20 (with no tax or shipping) is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using Curls Rock for a few years now, and it really is one of the best for naturally curly hair.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, about two pumps, if your hair is shoulder length or longer.  I find that it keeps the frizz down and defines my curls well.  The trick is to put it on while your hair is wet.  Once your hair starts to dry, it&#x27;s a lost cause.</li>
    <li> Has a weird smell and consistency!</li>
    <li> The item pictured is not the item sent.  Please be aware that this company is sending the &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; which is not the same as the old curls rock formula.  It does not work the same in my hair and I do not like it as much.  When I contacted the seller to return, they have continually tried to tell me it&#x27;s the same formula.  I have both bottles and the ingredients are different.  Do not buy from them!</li>
    <li> Love this product because it is simple and easy.  It keeps my hair frizz away without drying my hair out and creates natural curls instead of crunchy ones (like a gel does).</li>
    <li> Product is geat.  provides control for curly hair while defining the curls.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Every time I get my hair cut at a salon that doesn&#x27;t have Curls Rock, they say that they have a mixture of products that do \\&quot;almost\\&quot; the same thing. Every time, I leave with frizzy hair. In a family of curly-haired women, we all agree that this is the best product available for great curls without frizz. Don&#x27;t use too much, though. It&#x27;s not gel. One pump (maximum two) is enough for mid-back length curls. If you use too much, your hair will be sticky and it will flake. One pump, coat your hands (even add a bit of water), then work through wet hair from ends to roots.</li>
    <li> Item arrived really fast and the way it was described, thank you. I will definitely use this seller again. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Watch out! I ordered this product thinking it was the classic, Catwalk Curls Rock amplifier and got the \\&quot;Curlesque\\&quot; formula instead. From what I&#x27;ve heard and read, the new formula is drastically different and awful. Luckily, Amazon&#x27;s customer service is amazing, so they&#x27;ll take care of you if you get the wrong thing. Rest in peace, old amazing formula!</li>
    <li> Always a pleasure to work with this company - I have bought from them many times.  I suggest you do the same.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for scent and style.  It was my experience that it is best to limit brushing the curls after the hair is dried because they become unwound, unlike a moose product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I love it with curly hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this porduct for curly hair.  Holds curls and easy to work with!  This is a great price also. Love it!</li>
