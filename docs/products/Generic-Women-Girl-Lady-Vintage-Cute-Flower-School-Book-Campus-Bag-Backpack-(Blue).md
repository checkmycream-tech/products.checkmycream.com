      <li>made very cheaply broke after first couple weeks of school.</li>
      <li>First the strap buckle broke and in examining the plastic buckle, I discovered it was coming apart where the strap meets the top of the backpack.</li>
      <li>This bag looked cute and my teenage daughter liked it</li>
      <li>It is good for leight weight/one laptop only.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold too much weight, my daughters binders and books were mostly what they carried in it.</li>
      <li>Very cute,  this will be the third year that my Daughter has used this backpack.  </li>
      <li>So overall it was really nice</li>
      <li>The straps fell right off after using it a day.</li>
      <li>My daughter is in 7th grade, the straps broke the first day she used it, it fell off as she was walking off the bus....</li>
      <li>I only carried at the most three pounds in the bag.</li>
      <li>This product fell apart the first week my daughter used it.</li>
      <li>Everybody is saying the same thing: it ripped very quickly.</li>
      <li>My girls Love the colors and the back pack, but in a couple of months the strap broke on both of the back packs.</li>
      <li>it is a waste of money and cheaply made!</li>
      <li>Overall it looks cheaply made and does not last long enough to even merit the cheap price it is sold for.</li>
      <li>the bag was made Poorly do not waste your money buying this</li>
      <li>I did receive this item before the expected delivery date, however i only got to use it a total of three times carrying a fairly lightweight amount of things, i.e. a small laptop, notebooks and some pencils.</li>
      <li>The bag really is not made to hold school books, and when my daughter put too much weight in it, the strap broke away from the fabric.</li>
      <li>but if you are buying it for the middle and high school kids to carry their books  and binders in, it will not last too long.</li>
      <li>By the third day of use, one of the straps tore completely off at the top stitching, making the bag useless now.</li>

<li> very poor quality use the money to buy something better.</li>
<li> So unless you are carrying about twelve feathers in it, don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
<li> The straps are a cheap fabric that looks and feels suspiciously like a plastic by-product, and the material of the bag itself is very thin.</li>
<li> The bag I ordered took two weeks to arrive and after about two and a half weeks of being used the left strap&#x27;s thread came undone.</li>
<li> I would recommend it if you only put small things in it.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t put lots of books in it; the straps have broken off with only a few weeks of use.</li>
<li> the arm strap broke on it within 3 days and its really small.</li>
<li> This was a HUGE disappointment!!</li>
<li> It sucks, the straps ripped off after two weeks!!!</li>
<li> but they were very difficult about it.</li>

    <li> It sucks, the straps ripped off after two weeks!!! Do not buy this item it is a waste of money and cheaply made!</li>
    <li> This product fell apart the first week my daughter used it. I would not recommend this product to anyone its just not well made</li>
    <li> I did receive this item before the expected delivery date, however i only got to use it a total of three times carrying a fairly lightweight amount of things, i.e. a small laptop, notebooks and some pencils. By the third day of use, one of the straps tore completely off at the top stitching, making the bag useless now. The build quality is horrendous on this bag. The straps are a cheap fabric that looks and feels suspiciously like a plastic by-product, and the material of the bag itself is very thin. Overall it looks cheaply made and does not last long enough to even merit the cheap price it is sold for. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> The product was beautiful and we received many compliments on it. First the strap buckle broke and in examining the plastic buckle, I discovered it was coming apart where the strap meets the top of the backpack. The zipper was of low quality and I do not think it would have lasted long.&lt;br /&gt;I did not carry books in this book bag, but used it as a purse, so it was not the reason it was falling apart. I also do not like the vinyl straps, I do not think this is a quality product. Beautiful but cheap.</li>
    <li> This product broke the fries day I had it the bag was made Poorly do not waste your money buying this</li>
    <li> This was a HUGE disappointment!! My daughter is in 7th grade, the straps broke the first day she used it, it fell off as she was walking off the bus.... Very cheaply made, I would never purchase this again or recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> This bag looked cute and my teenage daughter liked it but it did fall apart on the 2nd wearing and had to be resewn.  You get what you pay for, make sure you know a seamstress if you buy this.</li>
    <li> I love it, it goes with my outfits :)</li>
    <li> Everybody is saying the same thing: it ripped very quickly.</li>
    <li> The booksack tore up in one day &amp; I would like my money back .</li>
    <li> The straps broke after I used it twice. It&#x27;s made with very cheap material.  I tried to return it but they were very difficult about it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my birthday and I loved the color. You can&#x27;t put lots of books in it; the straps have broken off with only a few weeks of use. I would recommend it if you only put small things in it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love ny bacpack.. school starts tuesday... will do another review 💯</li>
    <li> As seen on add. It is good for leight weight/one laptop only.</li>
    <li> Very cute,  this will be the third year that my Daughter has used this backpack.  And you will Not find it for a better price.  I have seen the same one in department stores for $45.00 and up.  Good size. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The bag I ordered took two weeks to arrive and after about two and a half weeks of being used the left strap&#x27;s thread came undone. I only carried at the most three pounds in the bag. So unless you are carrying about twelve feathers in it, don&#x27;t expect it to last long. I could&#x27;ve saved my twenty bucks to spend on something else, but the physical appearance of the bag just made me want it. DON&#x27;T FALL FOR IT AS I DID! Or please take this off the market.</li>
    <li> the arm strap broke on it within 3 days and its really small. its not as durable as it should be.</li>
    <li> I bought two in different colors. My girls Love the colors and the back pack, but in a couple of months the strap broke on both of the back packs. It doesn&#x27;t hold too much weight, my daughters binders and books were mostly what they carried in it. So overall it was really nice but if you are buying it for the middle and high school kids to carry their books  and binders in, it will not last too long.</li>
    <li> My daughter used it twice abd the strap broke.</li>
    <li> Cute but impractical.  The bag really is not made to hold school books, and when my daughter put too much weight in it, the strap broke away from the fabric.</li>
