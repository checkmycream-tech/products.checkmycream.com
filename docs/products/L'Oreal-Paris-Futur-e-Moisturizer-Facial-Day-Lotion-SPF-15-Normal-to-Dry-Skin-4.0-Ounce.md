      <li>With the spf, it&#x27;s a great foundation for your makeup.</li>
      <li>I t is a good product.</li>
      <li>my wife uses this product works good</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good if your face tends to be on the oily side.</li>
      <li>All that said, it is a light moisturizer, best for normal/combination/slightly oily skin as a day cream.  </li>
      <li>Been using this cream for 4 years now, and always loved it.</li>
      <li>It works great.&lt;br /&gt;You are good</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this lotion.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for many years and it works great.</li>
      <li>and she was amazing</li>
      <li>This company always has fast shipping and excellent packaging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and nice under make up.  </li>
      <li>and i noticed how nice her skin was.</li>
      <li>made my face look nice.</li>
      <li>A great light moisturizer with a nice clean scent.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I would save the money and purchase a moisturizer from another brand with better ingredients, better packaging, no irritants and sufficient UVA protection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and leaves no greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a light but effective moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I fell in love.</li>
      <li>As always, great and fast shipping with Amazon prime.</li>
      <li>This goes on smooth and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>their were so smooth.</li>
      <li>I like the sun protection and the way it softens my skin as I prepare my skin for my light makeup.  </li>
      <li>Rarely have I loved skin product as much as this one.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I can find the original.</li>
      <li>This lotion is super light.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is light and well absorbed as you apply it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light and makes make-up go on very easy...used it for years...</li>
      <li>In fact, it actually leaves a natural satin-matte finish on my skin (not shiny like a lot of moisturizers), which is great for wearing alone or under makeup.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a nice moisturizer as a daily treatment to soften and protect their skin.</li>
      <li>so it must be doing something right to my skin.</li>
      <li>Goes great with French Toast or French Fries...!</li>
      <li>the moisturizer is most likely not at the right</li>
      <li>Just the right weight, not too thick, feels great, has SPF.  </li>
      <li>I like this moisturizer very much.  </li>
      <li>My overall skin texture is softer and more even.</li>
      <li>I just wish the SPF was higher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I put on my face when I get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>and when I went to get more, they only had the product with the SPF-15,</li>
      <li>The push pump provides the exact amount you need as you apply it to each area of your face and neck.  </li>
      <li>Even if I&#x27;m a guy, it works pretty dang</li>
      <li>The spf15 is very stable, and feels light as air - no heavy or sticky &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; feel.</li>
      <li>I believe the Vitamin E is helping with the fine lines and general skin softness, and the Beta Hydroxy Acid is helping with pores and skin texture.</li>
      <li>It goes on pretty dry and doesn&#x27;t spread that easily</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a redhead so very prone to sunburn.</li>
      <li>and She absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>The packaging is also really bulky.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed my fine lines are much softer and less apparent, and my pores are much more refined.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, having oily skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers that had a more liquidy consistency and didn&#x27;t make me too oily</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and not oily or dry, more of a mix.</li>
      <li>I have an oily t-zone, dry cheeks and eye area, and fine lines, so finding a moisturizer that can handle all that PLUS has spf is a tall order.</li>
      <li>I bought it because there was an older woman i worked with</li>
      <li>I have very little dry skin and this one works great for me.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin, oily on nose &amp; cheeks.  </li>
      <li>She has normal to sensitive skin</li>
      <li>my skin break out less, made my skin all smooth,</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m told all the time how young I look.</li>
      <li>This is a lightweight lotion that delivers enough hydration and softness for my dry areas, yet is light enough for my t-zone.</li>
      <li>I ordered for the first time on Amazon because it was about $2 less than WalMart.</li>
      <li>Be aware that the two active ingredients listed only protect against UVB rays, NOT UVA.</li>
      <li>I also have a huge scar from the corner of my eye to mid cheek that is hardly noticeable -</li>
      <li>The container looked a little bit different than the real one I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>

    <li> It goes on pretty dry and doesn&#x27;t spread that easily but it&#x27;s good if your face tends to be on the oily side. I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers that had a more liquidy consistency and didn&#x27;t make me too oily so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d try this again.</li>
    <li> Besty face lotion ever! Been using this for about 14 years and I&#x27;m told all the time how young I look.</li>
    <li> Have used this product since my 20&#x27;s. Love it. I&#x27;m 61 now.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for many years and it works great. Tried to switch to other products (L&#x27;Oreal and other brands) inbetween but did not like them. Skin feels smoother and the cream isnot greasy at all. I have very little dry skin and this one works great for me. As always, great and fast shipping with Amazon prime.</li>
    <li> I have an oily t-zone, dry cheeks and eye area, and fine lines, so finding a moisturizer that can handle all that PLUS has spf is a tall order. I think this Futur-E lotion does it, and does it well. This is a lightweight lotion that delivers enough hydration and softness for my dry areas, yet is light enough for my t-zone. In fact, it actually leaves a natural satin-matte finish on my skin (not shiny like a lot of moisturizers), which is great for wearing alone or under makeup. It has also improved my skin over time ... I have noticed my fine lines are much softer and less apparent, and my pores are much more refined. My overall skin texture is softer and more even. I believe the Vitamin E is helping with the fine lines and general skin softness, and the Beta Hydroxy Acid is helping with pores and skin texture. I am very pleased with this lotion. The spf15 is very stable, and feels light as air - no heavy or sticky &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; feel. Also, it&#x27;s oil-free. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does not contain sufficient UVA protection.  The sunscreen ingredients used only protect against UVB rays. (Source: Paula Begoun&#x27;s Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary)and the moisturizer is most likely not at the right pH that the BHAs need to work.  There is also the issue of the fragrance used.  Fragrance in anything is irritating to the skin, even if you can&#x27;t see it.  The packaging is also really bulky.  It is sufficiently airtight, just too slim and too wide.  All that said, it is a light moisturizer, best for normal/combination/slightly oily skin as a day cream.  You will need to do at least three pumps of this to cover your face, though.  All in all, I would save the money and purchase a moisturizer from another brand with better ingredients, better packaging, no irritants and sufficient UVA protection.</li>

    <li> My Wife starting using L&#x27;Oreal Paris for her feet and she was amazing their were so smooth. She loves it.</li>
    <li> A great light moisturizer with a nice clean scent.  I have been using this for years and I use it every day.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and nice under make up.  My sister got me hooked on it.</li>
    <li> my wife uses this product works good</li>
    <li> Just the right weight, not too thick, feels great, has SPF.  I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and had a facial gal (person who gives facials) tell me that &amp;#34;whatever you are doing, just keep doing it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Applying this on my face each day, gives me a feel of being in Paris, with it&#x27;s wine and culture. Goes great with French Toast or French Fries...!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  Everytime I drift off to a different moisturizer I am always disappointed and return to L&#x27;Oreal Futur-e.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years now as a moisturizer to wear under makeup.  It&#x27;s the first thing I put on my face when I get out of the shower.  It&#x27;s nice and light and leaves no greasy feeling. I use a heavier moisturizer before I go to bed.  I ordered for the first time on Amazon because it was about $2 less than WalMart.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer very much.  I have normal skin, oily on nose &amp; cheeks.  This does not clog my pores.</li>
    <li> The container looked a little bit different than the real one I&#x27;ve used for years.  There is also a slight perfume smell and the main reason I like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Futur-e is due to not having an annoying smell.  Hopefully I can find the original.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.....no longer can find it in stores.  Love this product.  So.glad to.have found it here.</li>
    <li> It works great.&lt;br /&gt;You are good job!&lt;br /&gt;Made my skin break out less, made my skin all smooth, made my face look nice. Even if I&#x27;m a guy, it works pretty dang well!!</li>
    <li> I order this for my Mom and She absolutely loves it. She has normal to sensitive skin and she always looks radiant.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for 4 years now, and always loved it. non greasy, you can wear under your makeup (it wont mess it)! I also love the loreal eye defense in combination and thats all I need; And its also veery affordable!!!</li>
    <li> As per my expectation, I have got it.</li>
    <li> Be aware that the two active ingredients listed only protect against UVB rays, NOT UVA. This is not broad spectrum.</li>
    <li> Rarely have I loved skin product as much as this one. And it&#x27;s affordable. So what did L&#x27;Oreal do? Took it off the market in all local drugstores (meaning, in all of California). Now I have to order it online, which I will do as long as Amazon and other sites manage to carry it. It isn&#x27;t greasy, isn&#x27;t smelly, and dispenses and works great. So of course they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 20 years and i have awesome skin. I bought it because there was an older woman i worked with and i noticed how nice her skin was. She told me what she used and I had to get it. I&#x27;m a redhead so very prone to sunburn. I am outside all the time in all elements and I have no wrinkles yet (I&#x27;ll be 40 next year)- so it must be doing something right to my skin. I also have a huge scar from the corner of my eye to mid cheek that is hardly noticeable - i think it is due to this moisturizer. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, having oily skin - it&#x27;s a light but effective moisturizer. I received it in great condition and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Been using product since 2000.  Reasonably priced. Gives youthful&lt;br /&gt;Glow year round for any age.  Smells&lt;br /&gt;good while keeping skin sun protected&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is finding product.  Often not available.</li>
    <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this at Walgreens I found I could order from Amazon....it&#x27;s light and makes make-up go on very easy...used it for years...it&#x27;s back in stores too.</li>
    <li> I t is a good product. I will recommend it for face cream and I like the bottle shape and size.</li>
    <li> I used the future-e moisturizer without the SPF-15 and when I went to get more, they only had the product with the SPF-15, so I bought that.  I could have saved $5 shipping as I found the product in the store for the same price without the shipping cost.  If I had realized this too had the SPF-15, I would have bought it at the store.</li>
    <li> Vitamin e and SPF, great combo for skin care!</li>
