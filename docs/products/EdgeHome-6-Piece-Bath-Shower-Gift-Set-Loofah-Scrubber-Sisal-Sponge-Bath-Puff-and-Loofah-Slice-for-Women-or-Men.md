      <li>Product is nice packed in a bag.</li>
      <li>It also comes packaged in a nice, zip-up bag to keep everything together.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was impressed to see this large variety of sponges in a zippered clear pouch, perfect for giving as a gift or just keeping everything together!</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with everything you need in a nice bag to keep them stored in.</li>

      <li>Very Nice, Thanks!</li>
      <li>this set is just okay</li>
      <li>I love the loofah;</li>
      <li>South Korea&#x27;s itay taol seems much better.</li>
      <li>I love it and use almost everything every day in the shower.</li>
      <li>Love the bath set.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>Everything works well and it makes shower time much better.</li>
      <li>Not a bad set for the price!  </li>
      <li>Everything else was not made as strong as I wished it did.</li>
      <li>I was a little upset because I thought it was the best one I tested..  </li>
      <li>Overall a very well made and well put together set with a nice color scheme and great value.</li>
      <li>This bath set is fabulous.</li>
      <li>This 6-piece bath set from EdgeHome has really helped me make the most of every precious moment in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did receive these sponges at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how clean I am, nor does it effect my review.</li>
      <li>The nail brush is sturdy and helps me get every speck out from underneath my nails, and the loofah is great for rough knees and elbows.</li>
      <li>This pack was cool for what you get vs the price.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, not a bad pouch.</li>
      <li>My husband really enjoyed the large sisal sponge since it fits best into his hand, and my youngest has taken the bath puff for himself since it&#x27;s a little smaller than the one he had previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It exfoliates your entire body, from head to toe, in the privacy of your own home without having to go to the spa and pay those jacked-up prices.</li>
      <li>It is not so useful.</li>
      <li>With six pieces, there is something for everyone to use for every part of their body, and most other sets don&#x27;t come with that many.</li>
      <li>the quality is decent but nothing special</li>
      <li>I love the different scrubbers you can choose from and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what some of these are used for, but I sure am glad that I have them now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not all skin is created equally, and certain parts require more work than others.</li>
      <li>Overall, several good options that you can use to take care of yourself in the bathtub.  </li>
      <li>It has a wonderful facial exfoliator with a soft side to polish the delicate skin on my face.</li>
      <li>haha get it.</li>
      <li>More than what I was looking for or expected for the price!</li>
      <li>With a house full of kids and pets, sometimes the only time I can get for myself is in the shower.</li>
      <li>The bath set feels of decent quality and after using for awhile, I have not had to worry about any of the products falling apart.  </li>
      <li>was expecting it to be a little more luxurious</li>
      <li>I love the small pad for my face</li>
      <li>These actually exfoliate very well.</li>
      <li>Buying others were too late to see better.</li>
      <li>The only item I really use is the two loofa&#x27;s in the middle.</li>

    <li> With a house full of kids and pets, sometimes the only time I can get for myself is in the shower. This 6-piece bath set from EdgeHome has really helped me make the most of every precious moment in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all skin is created equally, and certain parts require more work than others. This kit includes everything from a pumice stone for smoothing rough feet to a soft facial scrubber! The nail brush is sturdy and helps me get every speck out from underneath my nails, and the loofah is great for rough knees and elbows. My husband really enjoyed the large sisal sponge since it fits best into his hand, and my youngest has taken the bath puff for himself since it&#x27;s a little smaller than the one he had previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed to see this large variety of sponges in a zippered clear pouch, perfect for giving as a gift or just keeping everything together!

    <li> This set is great! It has everything I need for my families grooming needs. It could also be used in a gift basket.Very Nice, Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bath scrub set. I love the different scrubbers you can choose from and the color scheme is very nice and they are of very good quality.

    <li> The only item I really use is the two loofa&#x27;s in the middle. Everything else was not made as strong as I wished it did. The rectangle sponge broke within 1 shower use.. I was a little upset because I thought it was the best one I tested..  **I purchased this at a discounted price**</li>
    <li> this set is just okay&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting it to be a little more luxurious but it is very basic&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes in a plastic bag to keep everything together but would not give this as a gift as it doesn&#x27;t look very expensive&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it should be half the price&lt;br /&gt;again the quality is decent but nothing special&lt;br /&gt;received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>

    <li> very nice bath set has everything you need for a bath but soap</li>
    <li> This bath set is fabulous. I love that it comes with everything you need in a nice bag to keep them stored in. If you buy this set you won&#x27;t have to go out and look for the items separately. It definitely makes a great gift set and the products in there are really nice! Everything works well and it makes shower time much better. I received this product at a discount price for my honest review and I recommend this set!</li>
    <li> I love this 6 piece bath set! It exfoliates your entire body, from head to toe, in the privacy of your own home without having to go to the spa and pay those jacked-up prices. It has a wonderful facial exfoliator with a soft side to polish the delicate skin on my face. I love the loofah; perfect size. Also a bath puff, pumice and wooden nail brush. Even my hubby likes this set; he borrows the nail brush from time to time. I love it and use almost everything every day in the shower. I love feeling pampered! This set comes in a cute gift bag so it would make an awesome gift! I absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a small bathroom set like this as an addition to a Christmas gift. This was a great price for the quality and quantity that I received! More than what I was looking for or expected for the price!</li>
