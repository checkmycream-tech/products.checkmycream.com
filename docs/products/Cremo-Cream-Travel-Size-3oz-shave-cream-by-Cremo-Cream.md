      <li>Great stuff.  </li>
      <li>GREAT product.</li>
      <li>I get great shaves and my wife LOVES how this stuff smells.  </li>
      <li>Great shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Provides great protection.</li>
      <li>The lubricating properties of this cream are still great.</li>
      <li>but this stuff is good.</li>
      <li>Do not agree with others on amount of cream needed to have a good lather.  </li>
      <li>Seems that i needed a good amount.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is definitely good for your skin...</li>
      <li>I got a better shave with hair conditioner!</li>
      <li>But if I use this more than two days in a row, my skin pays the price.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
      <li>ever\\&quot; because usage and results vary from beard to beard, I&#x27;m sure, and the type of razor, but I cannot think of a shaving cream I have found any better than Cremo Cream.</li>
      <li>post shave feels much better.</li>
      <li>and you WILL get an outstanding outcome.</li>
      <li>I think your best bet, though, is to squirt some of the Cremo into a smaller TSA-approved container.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it is OK for carry-on travel.  </li>
      <li>It will produce the closet shave I have ever been able to achieve.</li>
      <li>Cremo Cream (shaving cream) is possibly the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I originally received this as a gift over a decade ago and absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I wish it washed off my razor&#x27;s blade more easily though</li>
      <li>Love love love the product in the tube (5 star worthy) but wish their \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; was just that.</li>
      <li>Use with lots of hot water, does allow nice shave.</li>
      <li>Just make sure that the water is very hot - as on the instructions.</li>
      <li>It smells AMAZING, works into a great lather very easily, and is sooooooo much cheaper here than on other sites.</li>
      <li>the citrus like fragrance smell could be a little more authentic but happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>After reading the great reviews I expected to be completely pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>This shaving cream simply works great...</li>
      <li>This is a great combo, especially when I shave in the shower, using my Cassani - Fogless Shower Mirror.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found it useful to work in more water while applying.  </li>
      <li>available.</li>
      <li>Please make a smaller travel tube (which would also serve as great stocking-stuffer sizes to get folks hooked on your product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can not tell you that this product is great often enough.</li>
      <li>(Cremo doesn&#x27;t foam or expand after leaving the original container.)</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this stuff based on the reviews.</li>
      <li>SInce I switched to this produce I have had a significant reduction in them.</li>
      <li>I love that she loves it because it keeps her close enough to smell me :)!  </li>
      <li>I got a clean shave in one stroke.  </li>
      <li>Great slick stuff that makes shaving a better experience</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much</li>
      <li>I use this as my travel shave cream, but it would work just as well as my full time shave cream.</li>
      <li>I use this with a Semogue 1305 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush, an Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor, and Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and Cremo never causes any problem for me on my face, unlike most travel shaving products.</li>
      <li>and this is FAR better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Second, while it seems effective, the cream smells a bit rancid with a tinge of citrus to try and hide the stink.  </li>
      <li>This is worth the money</li>
      <li>Try to use as little as possible but use lots of water for the best results.</li>
      <li>I use the larger tube at home, so it&#x27;s great to have a smaller tube for travels.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t spread very easily if your face isn&#x27;t wet</li>
      <li>Yes, it will fit into your 1 quart TSA-mandated plastic bag, but just barely.</li>
      <li>Since that&#x27;s an easy fix, I&#x27;m not penalizing the product in my overall rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not much lather, no exotic scent, but with Cremo Cream I&#x27;ve had the fewest nicks and no post-shave &amp;#34;burn.&amp;#34; Both unexciting and awesome.</li>
      <li>Smooth and little friction Fits nicely in my travel bag and is TSA carry on compliant; much better than the small fcans of shaing foam.</li>
      <li>- I find i have to really swish it around in the hot water in my sink basin, more so than with other shaving creams</li>
      <li>you get a very goood shave and dont need any aftershave creame etc when you are done.</li>
      <li>Not inexpensive but worth every penny as far as I am concerned.</li>
      <li>and you are ready to shave.</li>
      <li>It is truly concentrated, so just a bit, spread around well, is enough for my comparatively light beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There won&#x27;t be any foam, no matter how much Cremo you use.</li>
      <li>There is just too much cream here when traveling.</li>
      <li>I have VERY curly hair.</li>
      <li>Only available from Cremo (cremocompany.com) at the moment; let&#x27;s hope Amazon suppliers pick it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A 6-oz tube is a 90+ day supply, so do I really need a 3-oz tube for travel?</li>
      <li>standard creams like taylor of old bond street are also much better.</li>
      <li>Very easy way to travel with this item beats those big or travel shaving foams plus they are not a likely to leak or pop in you baggage in heat !</li>
      <li>i like other alternatives like tiger eye much better.  </li>
      <li>Takes only a small amount for a great shave.  </li>
      <li>However, this travel size smells less much \\&quot;ciitrus like\\&quot; and more \\&quot;medicine like\\&quot; than the fiirst tube I bought, which sort of bums me out.</li>
      <li>it seems to prevent nicks and cuts way better than regular shaving foam/gel like Right Guard, and yet it&#x27;s not nearly the price of those fancy products like Taylor of Old Bond Street or Truefit &amp; Hill.  </li>
      <li>Its really a decent sized bottle.  </li>
      <li>The quality for shaving is decent.  </li>
      <li>Very close shave, no skin irritation (I have VERY sensitive skin), no nicks, cuts, chaffing, or anything.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you try.  </li>
      <li>Continues to lubricate for additional passes if you splash a little more water on your beard.</li>
      <li>When you apply it for the first time (you barely need any)</li>
      <li>NIce thick shave cream.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so believe me when I say that this product is much, much better than the typical shaving gels that foam up.</li>
      <li>one redeeming quality here is that the travel size is very convenient for trips, as it takes up less room than an aerosol can, the tube holds a lot, and you always know how much is left inside the container.</li>
      <li>My favorite so far is Dead Sea Minerals Shaving Gel for Men</li>
      <li>Other reviews have mentioned that a 1 oz product is available directly from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>This is a huge step down from Gilette or Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product is OK when compared to drugstore foams or gels but is a big step down from Proraso shaving cream.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best shave cream ever! I have been shaving for over 35 years and I have only found one product that was even close. It was a heated shave cream. I can not tell you that this product is great often enough. You should try it. I have VERY curly hair. Like men black men I get ingrown hairs when I shave with a blade. SInce I switched to this produce I have had a significant reduction in them. I have had maybe two in the last 3 months. I use a single bladed Bic disposable for sensitive skin. When I want a closer shave. I simple repeat the shave bu adding water to my skin and re-lathering the cream. The product says to use a small amount. Try to use as little as possible but use lots of water for the best results. Of course shave after showering so the hair is softer.</li>
    <li> It is slippery stuff..  What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it does not lather up very well, and if you do multiple passes you will have to reapply often as it goes away with each pass, even seems to disappear within a pass!  I have tried using this as a base with shaving soap on top - OK, but no better than using shave oil.</li>
    <li> Cremo Cream (shaving cream) is possibly the best I have ever used.  It is truly concentrated, so just a bit, spread around well, is enough for my comparatively light beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My practice is not to say something is the \\&quot;best ever\\&quot; because usage and results vary from beard to beard, I&#x27;m sure, and the type of razor, but I cannot think of a shaving cream I have found any better than Cremo Cream.</li>
    <li> I use the larger tube at home, so it&#x27;s great to have a smaller tube for travels.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Provides great protection.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this stuff based on the reviews. Unfortunately, it has proved to be a great disappointment. Despite following directions carefully, warming my skin with hot water then applying the cream to moist skin, Cremo cream is just not lubricating enough; I end up with a rough shave and profoundly irritated skin every time. This is a huge step down from Gilette or Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one redeeming quality here is that the travel size is very convenient for trips, as it takes up less room than an aerosol can, the tube holds a lot, and you always know how much is left inside the container. But if I use this more than two days in a row, my skin pays the price. No thank you!</li>
    <li> Great slick stuff that makes shaving a better experience no what razor you use.  Why use foam that&#x27;s 90% air that&#x27;s not even on your face.  Creamo is slick stuff that rinses off your blade and doesn&#x27;t get gunky.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  It creates a slick surface.  Just make sure that the water is very hot - as on the instructions.</li>
    <li> Takes only a small amount for a great shave.  Continues to lubricate for additional passes if you splash a little more water on your beard. I was very happy to find the travel size.  Cremo is the only shaving cream I&#x27;ve used at home for over 5 years.  I travel a lot and none of the other travel-sized shaving creams work nearly as well for me as Cremo.</li>
    <li> Do not agree with others on amount of cream needed to have a good lather.  Seems that i needed a good amount.  also did not care for the consistency of the cream/lather.  i like other alternatives like tiger eye much better.  standard creams like taylor of old bond street are also much better.</li>
    <li> First off, its not a very convenient travel size.  Its really a decent sized bottle.  Second, while it seems effective, the cream smells a bit rancid with a tinge of citrus to try and hide the stink.  I see no reason to ever purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I give the shaving experience 5 stars. It truly delivers on its claim of a close, non-irritating, longer-lasting shave. I have sensitive skin, so believe me when I say that this product is much, much better than the typical shaving gels that foam up. Shaves -- and blades -- do indeed last longer, and my skin isn&#x27;t irritated at all. It takes a bit more than a &amp;#34;nickel size&amp;#34; amount for a shave, but I&#x27;m still using the 3 oz. tube that I bought in March, 2 months later, with over half left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the tube size only 3 stars. Yes, it will fit into your 1 quart TSA-mandated plastic bag, but just barely. Other reviews have mentioned that a 1 oz product is available directly from the manufacturer. I think your best bet, though, is to squirt some of the Cremo into a smaller TSA-approved container. (Cremo doesn&#x27;t foam or expand after leaving the original container.) Since that&#x27;s an easy fix, I&#x27;m not penalizing the product in my overall rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have given this product low ratings, and seem to have applied an unnecessarily thick coating, or expected a thick foam to develop. It doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to get a close shave -- wet your face and then apply a thin coating. It won&#x27;t spread very easily if your face isn&#x27;t wet and I&#x27;ve found it useful to work in more water while applying.  There won&#x27;t be any foam, no matter how much Cremo you use. It might take some getting used to, if, like me, you&#x27;ve been using a gel that turns into a thick foam after leaving the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product without any reservations.</li>
    <li> Use with lots of hot water, does allow nice shave.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sample of this in the mail.  I gave it to my husband to try and he has been a customer ever since then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to assume you readers already know the product.  This is the perfect size for your travel bag.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> This is the slickest shave cream or preparation that you are going to find.  It will produce the closet shave I have ever been able to achieve.</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews I expected to be completely pleased with this product.  After trying it several times, however, I threw the rest of the tube away - just didn&#x27;t work.  I got a better shave with hair conditioner!</li>
    <li> This stuff is definitely good for your skin... it seems to prevent nicks and cuts way better than regular shaving foam/gel like Right Guard, and yet it&#x27;s not nearly the price of those fancy products like Taylor of Old Bond Street or Truefit &amp; Hill.  I wish it washed off my razor&#x27;s blade more easily though - I find i have to really swish it around in the hot water in my sink basin, more so than with other shaving creams/gels i&#x27;ve tried.  My favorite so far is Dead Sea Minerals Shaving Gel for Men but this stuff is good.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as nice of a shave as I get with Aveeno shaving cream, but convenient for having something travel-size to take on trips.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should work (the volume you need to shave your face is really small), but it works so well. I use this as my travel shave cream, but it would work just as well as my full time shave cream. I have sensitive skin, and Cremo never causes any problem for me on my face, unlike most travel shaving products.</li>
    <li> The quality for shaving is decent.  I purchased it as the size is small enough as it is ok to get through TSA.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> A terrific shave cream in a TSA-compliant container. Not inexpensive but worth every penny as far as I am concerned. However, this travel size smells less much \\&quot;ciitrus like\\&quot; and more \\&quot;medicine like\\&quot; than the fiirst tube I bought, which sort of bums me out.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best shaving cream-- well that&#x27;s the point, it&#x27;s different than shaving cream-- available. I have used proraso, art of shaving, etc. and this is FAR better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried. Very close shave, no skin irritation (I have VERY sensitive skin), no nicks, cuts, chaffing, or anything. When you apply it for the first time (you barely need any) it&#x27;s hard to believe it is going to work... and then you begin to shave and it is unbelievable. I am buying some for my Dad&#x27;s birthday and this will definitely be a gift for male friends in the future. Highly recommend-- you will NOT be disappointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cremo Cream is awesome!!!  I get great shaves and my wife LOVES how this stuff smells.  I love that she loves it because it keeps her close enough to smell me :)!  I use this with a Semogue 1305 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush, an Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor, and Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades.  This is a great combo, especially when I shave in the shower, using my Cassani - Fogless Shower Mirror.</li>
    <li> Smoothing and soothing.</li>
    <li> you get a very goood shave and dont need any aftershave creame etc when you are done. the citrus like fragrance smell could be a little more authentic but happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  I am wondering if the formula has been altered a bit as it seems to lose moisture after applying - had not noticed that before..  The lubricating properties of this cream are still great.</li>
    <li> I originally received this as a gift over a decade ago and absolutely love it! It smells AMAZING, works into a great lather very easily, and is sooooooo much cheaper here than on other sites. This is worth the money and I&#x27;ll never go back to another shaving cream. Never. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> A++++  With out a doubt the best shaving cream I have ever used (in 50 years).  It only takes a small dab, just enough to cover your face.  I got a clean shave in one stroke.  I usually have to go over my chin and neck several times to get it smooth.  Not with this cream, one time and all the whiskers are gone.  I will never use anything else again.  Very impressed!</li>
    <li> NIce thick shave cream.  Best stuff I have ever used.  I highly recommend you try.  Thank you for the travel size!</li>
    <li> This is my goto cream when traveling. It requires very little for a complete shave and that is where the size problem comes into play. There is just too much cream here when traveling. I would estimate this as a few months worth of shaving every other day.</li>
    <li> Very easy way to travel with this item beats those big or travel shaving foams plus they are not a likely to leak or pop in you baggage in heat !</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim and will NEVER go back to foams or gels.  It makes for an EXCELLENT double-edge shave.  Follow the directions and you WILL get an outstanding outcome.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream simply works great... Not much lather, no exotic scent, but with Cremo Cream I&#x27;ve had the fewest nicks and no post-shave &amp;#34;burn.&amp;#34; Both unexciting and awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much I actually bought it as a stocking stuffer for every male on my xmas list.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll love it.  Big step up from the drugstore foams and gels.</li>
    <li> this is my go to for travel. prefer over jack black beard lube. post shave feels much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is OK for carry-on travel.  I use Proraso at home.  The product is OK when compared to drugstore foams or gels but is a big step down from Proraso shaving cream.  The cream doesn&#x27;t lather well and there was a big difference in final shave.  I took this on an eight day trip and threw it in the garbage when unpacking.  Nothing wrong with the product just not very good.</li>
    <li> Best shave product ever</li>
    <li> Love love love the product in the tube (5 star worthy) but wish their \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; was just that. A 6-oz tube is a 90+ day supply, so do I really need a 3-oz tube for travel? Takes up a lot of room in your TSA-approved 1-qt bag. Please make a smaller travel tube (which would also serve as great stocking-stuffer sizes to get folks hooked on your product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I sent this message to the folks at Cremo, and got a response (within 2 days!) that they have just introduced a 1-oz trial size that should be perfect for travel (or stocking stuffers). Only available from Cremo (cremocompany.com) at the moment; let&#x27;s hope Amazon suppliers pick it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving them another star for effort (but I still don&#x27;t think of THIS product as a travel size).</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shave cream I have ever tried. I will NEVER use another brand. 5 + STARS!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. Very thick. A couple of dabs and you are ready to shave. Smooth and little friction Fits nicely in my travel bag and is TSA carry on compliant; much better than the small fcans of shaing foam.</li>
