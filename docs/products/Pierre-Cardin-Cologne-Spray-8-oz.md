      <li>This thing is HUGE.</li>

      <li>While using the same packaging, the product itself is greatly inferior.</li>
      <li>This is a nice size bottle at a reasonable price.  </li>

      <li>Something must be right about it!</li>

      <li>I had to laugh when I received this.</li>
      <li>beware it is a powerful cologne though</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for lovers of this extraordinary men&#x27;s cologne!</li>
      <li>right under both of my ears</li>
      <li>8 ounces is a big bottle and is more than worth the price I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>The fake is more like old-fashioned Gulf fly spray.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect to be able to get my money back so this is going in the garbage.</li>
      <li>this was my first order when i received it</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered and my husband loves it.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it creates such a fresh illusion of awareness that men, women, childrens &amp; pets could only love!</li>
      <li>I cannot find Pierre Cardin locally in a large bottle.  </li>
      <li>It would have been nicer if this were really Pierre Cardin cologne instead of a \\&quot;smell-alike\\</li>
      <li>is a lot more than I expected.</li>
      <li>I received four more of the same colonge I received earlier.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised by the size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Buyer beware, this is not even close to the original, other than the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>It did not look like fresh new merchandise I expected.  </li>
      <li>An old stand-by yet to be beat.  </li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize was how big 8ozs of liquid really is.</li>
      <li>maybe was too old  and lost the essence</li>
      <li>The first hint that this was fake was with the price, much too cheap to believe for such a large bottle, but I decided it could have been a mark-down.  </li>
      <li>have never seen a bottle of this so big,my husband said that was a super deal,he said this would last a very long time</li>
      <li>, i put Beyoncie heat rush on my hair &amp; beard, i spray PE 360 on the back of my neck, spray PM new musks (mens) on the front of my neck &amp; spray</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great Buy for the price! Smells Great!</li>
    <li> A great fragrance. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> I came quickly and it is a great product. A product I have been using for many years. Also the price of the product was great.</li>
    <li> its a wonderfull product, my husband is happinness using this product. I so very happy. I love it.  100% recomended</li>
    <li> I cannot find Pierre Cardin locally in a large bottle.  I transfer it to smaller bottles before using it, however.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and am very familiar with how it should be received. The interior packaging was beat up, the chrome cap of the product itself was scratched. I suspect this was a resent shipment. It did not look like fresh new merchandise I expected.  BG</li>
    <li> The smell in this bottle is very weak.  Not potent like other bottles of Pierre Cardin I have used in the past.  Almost like it is a fake - Who knows.</li>
    <li> If this was the only cologne i would wear, i would stop anybody from getting this so i can stock up! Truth be told, this is the s***! I am a Hebrew &amp; I am Human &amp; down to earth! My current cologne stack: Aficionado aftershave for facial spray, i put Beyoncie heat rush on my hair &amp; beard, i spray PE 360 on the back of my neck, spray PM new musks (mens) on the front of my neck &amp; spray This Stuff (PC) right under both of my ears &amp; it creates such a fresh illusion of awareness that men, women, childrens &amp; pets could only love! because u once smell this stuff when u wasn&#x27;t wearing it!</li>
    <li> The first hint that this was fake was with the price, much too cheap to believe for such a large bottle, but I decided it could have been a mark-down.  When it arrived, I noticed there was no PC logo on the cap.  Then I opened it and smelled it, and I thought to myself, this is not PC.  I have a small bottle of the real stuff with a little left in it so I opened it and compared the two.  The fake is nowhere near the scent of the original.  The fake is more like old-fashioned Gulf fly spray.  Customers should be informed that what they are buying in an imitation.</li>
    <li> I used before this product and the product is good but this bottle has no essence maybe was too old  and lost the essence</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery,  will be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> Like it but the 8oz. can&#x27;t be opened to pour smaller amounts in a smaller container. That&#x27;s a rip-off !</li>
    <li> this was my first order when i received it i went back online and ordered more price was great for the size</li>
    <li> PC has been one of my favorites for years. I always get compliments when I wear it, the ladies seem to love it.</li>
    <li> great smell i wear it all the time i get many complements on it. beware it is a powerful cologne though</li>
    <li> An old scent that just smells great lots of compliments from the gals on how good it smells</li>
    <li> I been using Pierre Cardin for the past ten years. Something must be right about it!</li>
    <li> Degraded quality, this product smells only half an hour</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance that I&#x27;ve used for years.  This is a nice size bottle at a reasonable price.  The fact that it&#x27;s a spray bottle it saves waste by not having to put it on your hands and slap it onto your face. Two or three squirts emit a very fine spray which goes directly and evenly onto your face.  Very little waste.  It should last me a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I have used Pierre Cardin for years and like it a lot...thus the reason for buying it for so long. Although, I was a little surprised when I received THIS product. I knew I wanted to get a larger size so i didn&#x27;t have to replace it for a while. What I didn&#x27;t realize was how big 8ozs of liquid really is. This thing is HUGE. I wasn&#x27;t angry about because it actually made me laugh. I wanted more and I got MORE. I should be happy for quite a while.</li>
    <li> have never seen a bottle of this so big,my husband said that was a super deal,he said this would last a very long time</li>
    <li> My husband has always liked Pierre Cardin and when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores I ordered it from Amazon.I was very surprised by the size of the bottle.It should last him for a long time. The smell is the same as he remembered. If you don&#x27;t want to be using it daily I would suggest a smaller bottle because 8oz. is a lot more than I expected.</li>
    <li> Oversized at a fantastic price! Highly recommended for lovers of this extraordinary men&#x27;s cologne! Great gift for college students and dads...</li>
    <li> Using this brand for many years beginning with a trip to Fraance; recommend this&lt;br /&gt;after shave to every one.</li>
    <li> I ordered Pierre Cardin after shave.  I searched for this item and ordered the serch result.  I received the colonge.  I called your return number and explained what happened even calling out the search results to the lady I talked to in returns.  She was very nice and explained to me I couldn&#x27;t return this product because it is considered hazardous.  She assured me she had found the after shave and would ship the correct product to me.  I received four more of the same colonge I received earlier.</li>
    <li> I would not again purchase this product. While using the same packaging, the product itself is greatly inferior. Is this licensed and approved by the originator? I am astounded at how they can sell such an authentically packaged product that bears so little resemblance - other than visual - to product I&#x27;ve been using for twenty years or more. If it isn&#x27;t authorized by the creator/manufacturer, Amazon should label it as such. And I will be very wary of purchasing such things through amazon in the future. Probably won&#x27;t ever take the chance again!</li>
    <li> I had to laugh when I received this. It was the biggest bottle of Pierre I&#x27;d ever seen. I&#x27;ve been buying this scent for my husband ever since I met him 35 yrs. ago &amp; I had never seen an 8 oz. I thought it would be horribly expensive but I was wrong. This will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; seller from now on. Shipment came in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years.  Will not use any other.  Best price so far especiallyfor large size.  We love ordering from Amazon!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It would have been nicer if this were really Pierre Cardin cologne instead of a \\&quot;smell-alike\\&quot; knock off. Of course at this price for 8 ounces, it&#x27;s almost obvious it won&#x27;t be, but the packaging and text on the site is misleading...</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this Pierre Cardin for over twenty years. I always got nice compliment from friends. Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My order was for two non spray colognes! The shipment did not match the order, not a big deal.  Attention to details!</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of not looking at the reviews from other purchasers. I started wearing PC in 1980 and this stuff is not even close to the original.  Wearing this stuff gives me a headache and it smells terrible. The markings on the bottle do not match the authentic PC product. I don&#x27;t expect to be able to get my money back so this is going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  An old stand-by yet to be beat.  Bigger bottle has a great value proposition.</li>
    <li> Silly I know, but I recall this from the 70&#x27;s as a kid. The bottle is HUGE! I do like it though. Good memories.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and my husband loves it.  8 ounces is a big bottle and is more than worth the price I paid for it.  Came very quickly even though I  ordered it right before Christmas.</li>
    <li> Love The Smell&amp;#34;&amp;#34; You Should Get It&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; 8 Ounces Of Pure Fragance&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i have used this for years. No one else I have found uses it and i get many comments on how nice the scent is</li>
    <li> best price and exactly what I love.</li>
    <li> these bottles I purchase made the people I gave them too got sick by skin breakouts&lt;br /&gt;and had too stop using the product, seems they are &amp;#34;knock offs&amp;#34; or very bad all together&lt;br /&gt;sorry I purchase the product.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, this is not even close to the original, other than the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;You only get what you pay for as the product has no fragrence after it is applied to your face.&lt;br /&gt;If original, the discounted cost would have been around $160.00 not $20.00 for an 8oz bottle.</li>
