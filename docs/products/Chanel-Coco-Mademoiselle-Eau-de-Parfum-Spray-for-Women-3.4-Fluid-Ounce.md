      <li>it&#x27;s the only good thing I can say.</li>

      <li>I was susprise to get it this quick</li>
      <li>Getting and Chanel Eau DE Parfum for less than a $100 is a great deal.</li>
      <li>Even cap was not closed well, and most importantly, even the smell of perfume is not sustainable.</li>
      <li>and I noticed I could not smell it at all even when I put my nose right up to it</li>
      <li>I want a full refund or the real stuff sent to me ASAP.</li>
      <li>I am very upset about this purchase!</li>
      <li>At first I used it as I always had by spraying onto cotton batton and putting in my bra and also putting onto my pulse points on arms.</li>
      <li>I ordered the perfume and it was exactly what it was described as.  </li>
      <li>So I never sprayed it after the first time.</li>
      <li>I will not buy this now, but wish Amazon would remove the product, since it&#x27;s the FIRST option offered.</li>
      <li>but this is most definitely a dupe!!!!!  </li>
      <li>I would most certainly do business with her again and rate her personally with 5 stars.</li>
      <li>The perfume arrived on time and the purchasing transaction was good, however, this was a product that we previously used and this recently purchased perfume did not smell anything like the one purchased originally, in fact it smelt fowl.</li>
      <li>The box was happily very well packaged.</li>
      <li>very helpful comments</li>
      <li>I could not believe how fast it got to me.  </li>
      <li>and it is the real thing at a cheaper price.</li>
      <li>shipping was fast and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>This product wasnt for me, so all that i tell about this gift is that its was okay as i expected</li>
      <li>It looked like the real thing.  </li>
      <li>I was very upset to find this out after spending so much money on it.</li>
      <li>This is the real stuff, not a knock off.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was fast</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite in the whole wide world.</li>
      <li>A COMPLETE FRAUD!!!  </li>
      <li>This white coco is more girly, more soft and less warm, less strong like the black coco.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This white coco is more girly, more soft and less warm, less strong like the black coco.</li>
      <li>These two were friends that had always liked my smell in past when I had it from buying it at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>white smells like citrus fruit, floral and fresh.</li>
      <li>so I put on more and then during the next hour I noticed a small smell of my favorite parfum except I had to put my nose actually onto my arm.</li>
      <li>The perfume arrived early and completely sealed.</li>
      <li>I was in a hurry and almost didn&#x27;t bother reading them, since I&#x27;m busy</li>
      <li>maybe i&#x27;m going to completely stop buying from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;im</li>
      <li>These perfumes are bogus amd Amazon should cut them out completely.</li>
      <li>Okay, this stuff is expensive, but it is worth it, and quite honesly, it was cheaper here than in the stores...</li>
      <li>Also, The product was wrapped very carefully, so as not to break in shipping.  </li>
      <li>Looked like the real bottle but imitation scent.</li>
      <li>solidly packed, pink styrofoam is very tasteful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Or at least the content (perfume) was not in the original Chanel bottle whose bottom is always engraved with &#x27;made in France&#x27; whereas on this one no such engraving but just a plastic sticker with the words.</li>
      <li>but I also think it must be a knockoff and really is cologne or watered down version of Coco Mademoiselle eau de parfum</li>
      <li>But it was very watered down.  </li>
      <li>I have had it a very sort  time and have used almost a half bottle</li>

    <li> Unfortunately I believe the product was not original. Or at least the content (perfume) was not in the original Chanel bottle whose bottom is always engraved with &#x27;made in France&#x27; whereas on this one no such engraving but just a plastic sticker with the words. A further evidence of this is that the sprayer did not work properly and the bottle cap was loose which is a problem for a perfume since if it&#x27;s dropped and the bottle broken, imagine the consequence.&lt;br /&gt;However, the Amazon service was impeccable.  When I requested the return and refund, the response was quasi immediate. An excellent company!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item in Nordstrom several times.  I think this is a knock off.  It is lighter in color and the scent seems watered down.</li>
    <li> I agree with this review that this perfume is a fake, when I looked at the bottle, immediately obvious that it was false. Even cap was not closed well, and most importantly, even the smell of perfume is not sustainable.</li>
    <li> very helpful comments, i was going to order one for my wife but after reading all this bad reviews i&#x27;m not anymore&lt;br /&gt;and maybe i&#x27;m going to completely stop buying from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;im just going to buy it from the store&lt;br /&gt;thanks folks</li>
    <li> Package came with no wraping.The carton smelled like smoke.When opened did not smell like the perfume I love.It has an old smell to it ,and when I put it on it smelled worse!!! My husband asked me to not wear it EVERY!!!.So disapointed&lt;br /&gt;Tryed to return it and the company of course would not give me a refund.what suprise.</li>
    <li> I paid good money for a bottle of junk this was a gift for my wife I want a full refund or the real stuff sent to me ASAP.</li>
    <li> I was incensed upon discovering the perfume I purchased was a fake, and gave her a negative rating because of it. However when I reported it to her she was as upset as i was and not only refunded my money plus shipping, she gave me a $5 dollar good will gift as well. I would most certainly do business with her again and rate her personally with 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a knock off, do not buy.  You can smell it for about 2 seconds.  Not. Kidding.  I should have know by the price.  Don&#x27;t. Waste. Your. Money.</li>
    <li> I have worn Chanel Coco Mademoiselle eau de parfum for a long time now and have loved it and got many people wanting to smell it. When I ran out I waited a couple of months and then ordered from you. Because it was coming from an Amazon picked site, I felt secure in knowing it would be the best....... well, it is NOT.... I think that it does have a smell of coco mademoiselle but I also think it must be a knockoff and really is cologne or watered down version of Coco Mademoiselle eau de parfum At first I used it as I always had by spraying onto cotton batton and putting in my bra and also putting onto my pulse points on arms. I went on to my 1 project of day and I noticed I could not smell it at all even when I put my nose right up to it so I put on more and then during the next hour I noticed a small smell of my favorite parfum except I had to put my nose actually onto my arm. The next day I layered it with my Velvet Body oil of coco mademoiselle and had not better luck... As days went on I tried everything I knew of but yesterday when I thought I must have over done the parfum I had two of my close friends smell my arms.... One could smell a faint smell... she liked the smell but it was so faint.... the other said sorry, I can not smell it at all. These two were friends that had always liked my smell in past when I had it from buying it at Macy&#x27;s. If you could have vendor explain to me what is wrong. I have had it a very sort  time and have used almost a half bottle and I am not a happy camper.</li>
    <li> No smell anything not original, is lost money ,  do not get under.  im furious , i want my money ..yeah</li>
    <li> I could not believe that I found this perfume at this price  Not may stores have it and the ones that do are very expensive</li>
    <li> its a knock off smells bad never shld of ordered it frm here for $10 more I cld of got the real thing at macys very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived on time and the purchasing transaction was good, however, this was a product that we previously used and this recently purchased perfume did not smell anything like the one purchased originally, in fact it smelt fowl. The package was packed for reshipment and was refused by the post office because we had no license to ship perfume. On attempting to reach UPS, the product exploded in the package and had to be discarded. I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> The 1st scent layer is completely different to the black coco. This white coco is more girly, more soft and less warm, less strong like the black coco.</li>
    <li> I love this, everyone loves how it smells. I also like Coco Chanel, but haven&#x27;t seen it here lately.  :/</li>
    <li> This was not the fragrance I purchased! It smells completely different! I tried calling the company but never got a hold of them! I am very upset about this purchase!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it people. There is alot of spam going on out there. These perfumes are bogus amd Amazon should cut them out completely.</li>
    <li> I Just can&#x27;t stop like this perfume, I love all the singles notes of it. The wood and spicy make a give it a nice and sophisticated smell tho this perfume........I am very happy with my order! Every time I weart it at work I receive compliments for my colleagues(men/women).&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This was the worst purchase every on amazon.  Perfume did not smell anything like what you buy in stores.  I threw it in the trash after one use.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this perfume. Looked like the real bottle but imitation scent. Feel like I was taken for $80. Waiting for full refund.</li>
    <li> I have been to paris and got Chanel #5 there. After trying it at a department store i liked it and ordered it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It looked like the real thing.  But it was very watered down.  Disappointed!  The delivery was fast it&#x27;s the only good thing I can say.</li>
    <li> Perfume is a fake. The front of the bottle was scuffed up, and the contents had obviously been watered down.</li>
    <li> was a replica of the authentic product I been use Coco for years and I know what is the original</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived early and completely sealed. i could not be happier with the product, this saved my butt for valentines day!</li>
    <li> This product wasnt for me, so all that i tell about this gift is that its was okay as i expected</li>
    <li> this is not the &amp;#34;Chanel&amp;#34; brand perfume.  scent wears off within an hour and smells nothing like the original sample bottle I had.</li>
    <li> Thankfully, the perfume arrived the day before Christmas. Perfect timing ! The box was happily very well packaged. no problems.</li>
    <li> A beautiful fragrance when I have used it before but this is most definitely a dupe!!!!!  It is a watered down imitation of the real product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for myself and opened it recently after looking at the bad reviews.  WHAT I RECEIVED IS COLORED WATER!!! It was packaged in a Chanel bottle, box, shrink wrapped, though the bottle cap did not quite fit.  I&#x27;ve had a chemical analysis of the contents made at a local college and the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; is distilled water with some type of fragrance and color.  A COMPLETE FRAUD!!!  Though the return policy through the re-seller has expired, Amazon needs to wake up to their website being used to sell fraudulent merchandise.  MACY&#x27;s has graciously put me in contact with Chanel representatives; they are extremely aggressive on trademark infringement so hopefully others won&#x27;t be robbed as I was. All of my documentation and product will be turned over to them.</li>
    <li> I have always worn this perfume, it is also one of my favorites.  I have not opened it as yet, but I know the scent smell.  I love this scent.</li>
    <li> Okay, this stuff is expensive, but it is worth it, and quite honesly, it was cheaper here than in the stores...</li>
    <li> I had the best experience buying this through Amazon.  I ordered the perfume and it was exactly what it was described as.  Also, The product was wrapped very carefully, so as not to break in shipping.  The best part was I received the perfume right away!  I could not believe how fast it got to me.  I had a great experience and would recommend this to anyone in a minute.</li>
    <li> I was susprise to get it this quick and it is the real thing at a cheaper price. So macy bye</li>
    <li> This not the original!!!  Maybe it has water! Even the bottle is different! It is a fake, can anybody do something to stop them?</li>
    <li> I had bought this perfume in a mistake. What i like is the black Chanel coco (coco for women).&lt;br /&gt;But this perfume is quite good. Its 2nd scent layer is very similar to the black coco.&lt;br /&gt;The 1st scent layer is completely different to the black coco. This white coco is more girly, more soft and less warm, less strong like the black coco.&lt;br /&gt;This white smells like citrus fruit, floral and fresh. But they are all about it. It does have the UNIQUE, what is  the $-factor of Chanel perfume, like its sibling.</li>
    <li> I received a leaking bottle that had a strong chemical smell. It was definitely not what I ordered. Luckily I was able to return it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like it is supposed to. It is very weak. It smells different than it did at the department store.</li>
    <li> ok did not realize i needed to write a review. smells good my sis wanted it for christmas. merry christmas sis</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it is not real.  I was very upset to find this out after spending so much money on it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the one that I purchase at the store. So I never sprayed it after the first time.</li>
    <li> Thank you all for writing your reviews. I was in a hurry and almost didn&#x27;t bother reading them, since I&#x27;m busy and it&#x27;s Christmas and all. THANK GOODNESS I read your posts. I will not buy this now, but wish Amazon would remove the product, since it&#x27;s the FIRST option offered. Many thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this scent so far I need to wear it some more to say that I love it. So far I think its great</li>
    <li> This is a lovely perfume. Great for daily wear to feel great every day! Wears well the entire day and night.</li>
    <li> I use this product when i go to my job. Every day&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good. I love it</li>
    <li> Well, I absolutely LOVE this fragrance. It&#x27;s my favorite in the whole wide world. I ordered it for a very reasonable price, but unfortunately, it was never shipped to me. I sent an inquiry as to had it been sent, or if it going to be sent, but I never got a reply.</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff, not a knock off.  Getting and Chanel Eau DE Parfum for less than a $100 is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing and never stops making my wife want me all the time! Thank you coco for your wonderful perfume!</li>
    <li> I will never ever going to buy from Amazon ever again.. This is definitely fake perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another one and i garantee that this&lt;br /&gt;Is fake, it is not the same smell at all and it never lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put 82$ plus shipping for this and i got fake perfume.</li>
    <li> Today I received a package. Thank you. Everything&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Very solidly packed, pink styrofoam is very tasteful.&lt;br /&gt;Perfume, as always, very good.</li>
