### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have never been so impressed with a nail polish.</li>
      <li>But, the product is excellent and is all plus more that they say it will do!</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>CND vinylux is great for no chip manicures.  </li>
      <li>also great variety of colors are availab le</li>
      <li>2 coats provides good coverage.</li>
      <li>I think that this is a good product.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love all of the colors that vinylux has created!  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite colors!</li>
      <li>keeps nails strong and no damage!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; color...not too garish and just enough</li>
      <li>For the most part I give Vinylux a 5 star rating.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love the color.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.  </li>
      <li>I love the color, and I bought it to match a gel color I have.  </li>
      <li>Love the Vinylux Polish.</li>
      <li>Excellent long wearing nail polish.  </li>
      <li>It went on easily and seems to keep it&#x27;s shine.</li>
      <li>Good product and strong polish finish - dries the nails out if left on over a week, tho.</li>
      <li>Vinylux is the first thing that has ever held on for more than a day.</li>
      <li>stains nails upon removal a bit, but worth it!</li>
      <li>Will certainly buy more of these.</li>
      <li>I wash my hands constantly so this was good for me</li>
      <li>love the color, really works for a week.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to using Sally Hanson diamond Polish, and it always lasts a full week.</li>
      <li>I expect someone with normal nails will get even more use out of it.</li>
      <li>Good product; as long as you do not need to do nail strengthen.  </li>
      <li>love this polish dries fast and very durable</li>
      <li>It is inexpensive and worth trying.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the color, it&#x27;s more red than scarlet.  </li>
      <li>Great and long lasting polishes!</li>
      <li>Like a polish that last more than the regulars.</li>
      <li>I ordered several colors and top coat.</li>
      <li>And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  </li>
      <li>love this classic red color.</li>
      <li>I have used the top coat on top of other polishes and it definitely lasts and stays shiny.</li>
      <li>This is a very dramatic purple/red color and is great for a night out on the town!</li>
      <li>Dark red very nice color for the fall and winter.  </li>
      <li>This polish chipped just as fast as any drug store polish would.</li>
      <li>WIth no base coat, the red polish stains more than any of the other colors, however, the Vinylux brand is my go to brand for nail polish.</li>
      <li>If you get it on skin accidentally, it comes off very quickly with normal handwashing, so even if it looks messy from your poor handiwork, it will look perfect the next day.</li>
      <li>I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  </li>
      <li>I really like the product because it is long lasting and doesn&#x27;t chip too easily....</li>
      <li>Finally, a polish similar to Shellac that is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Lastly, it comes off right away w/ nail polish remover, unlike gels and acrylics, and your nail will not be ruined.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy,</li>
      <li>I have now ordered about 7 different colors because I like it so much!</li>
      <li>Dont notice anything special than any other nail polish.</li>
      <li>It does dry fast with the Vinylux top coat, so if you just want polish for a few days or you change your polish color often then I would recommend this polish.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t really last much longer than any other quality nail polish.</li>

<li> last a long time without chipping.</li>
<li> It does last as long as it says though.</li>
<li> This nail polish is like thick vinyl, it feels too thick on my nails and doesn&#x27;t stay shiny even with a top coat.  </li>
<li> I have had it on for as long as two weeks!  </li>
<li> For some reason the reds seem to be a bit harder on my nails.  </li>
<li> Add to that, it dries solid in about 5-10 minutes so no more divots or dings.</li>
<li> I was hoping to get at least a week out of a manicure but this starting chipping on day 2.  </li>
<li> It is not worth the price</li>
<li> I wore this for a week, wore a different color and my nails got weak and broke, would like to return product.</li>
<li> But I do find that it lasts longer than other polishes!!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also hard to remove.</li>
<li> So sorry I wasted all that money!</li>
<li> no matter how thin you try to get it,</li>
<li> and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.  </li>
<li> I have very thin, shiny nails and NOTHING</li>
<li> I am disappointed with the polish.</li>
<li> It stains your nails even with the base coat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t wear as well as Lilac Longing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the color.  Lasts about a week.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with the polish. I ordered several colors and top coat. Each polish chips by the end of the day. I thought it was supposed to last 4+ days.</li>
    <li> This polish did not even last three days before it started chipping.  It is not worth the price and I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, shiny nails and NOTHING stays on them, not acrylics, not gels, not nail polish. Vinylux is the first thing that has ever held on for more than a day. I get about 4-5 days out of it, which is a miracle product for me. I expect someone with normal nails will get even more use out of it. Add to that, it dries solid in about 5-10 minutes so no more divots or dings. If you get it on skin accidentally, it comes off very quickly with normal handwashing, so even if it looks messy from your poor handiwork, it will look perfect the next day. Lastly, it comes off right away w/ nail polish remover, unlike gels and acrylics, and your nail will not be ruined. I have never been so impressed with a nail polish. Thank you, Vinylux!</li>
    <li> Excellent long wearing nail polish.  I love it!</li>
    <li> love the color, really works for a week. stains nails upon removal a bit, but worth it! keeps nails strong and no damage!</li>
    <li> Like a polish that last more than the regulars. However, not too shining. Would prefer another hue. Will certainly buy more of these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using Sally Hanson diamond Polish, and it always lasts a full week. At a recent pedicure, the stylist recommended the Vinylux. It&#x27;s also hard to remove. Won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
    <li> 3 days before starts chipping</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Not crazy about the color, it&#x27;s more red than scarlet.  But I do find that it lasts longer than other polishes!!!</li>
    <li> It lasted 4 days without chipping. I wash my hands constantly so this was good for me</li>
    <li> I love the color, and I bought it to match a gel color I have.  I prefer to use gel polish on my nails and regular polish on my toes because removing gel polish myself is much more difficult on my feet.  This polish chipped just as fast as any drug store polish would.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is like thick vinyl, it feels too thick on my nails and doesn&#x27;t stay shiny even with a top coat.  Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t really last much longer than any other quality nail polish.</li>
    <li> Good product and strong polish finish - dries the nails out if left on over a week, tho.</li>
    <li> last a long time without chipping.</li>
    <li> This polish lasts as advertised. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  Let me tell you, not a fan.  I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy, no matter how thin you try to get it, and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.  And then when you put the topcoat on, it looks even goopier and bubbly.  And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  So sorry I wasted all that money!</li>
    <li> Dark red very nice color for the fall and winter.  2 coats provides good coverage.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get at least a week out of a manicure but this starting chipping on day 2.  It does dry fast with the Vinylux top coat, so if you just want polish for a few days or you change your polish color often then I would recommend this polish.</li>
    <li> Good product; as long as you do not need to do nail strengthen.  The product does stay on even longer than they say it will stay.  I have had it on for as long as two weeks!  For me, I need to use a nail strengthening product; and with this you cannot use one.  But, the product is excellent and is all plus more that they say it will do!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It stains your nails even with the base coat. It does last as long as it says though.</li>
    <li> Dont notice anything special than any other nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love all of the colors that vinylux has created!  Great and long lasting polishes!</li>
    <li> I wore this for a week, wore a different color and my nails got weak and broke, would like to return product.</li>
    <li> I have only used this polish one time. It went on easily and seems to keep it&#x27;s shine. I have used the top coat on top of other polishes and it definitely lasts and stays shiny. I think that this is a good product. Finally, a polish similar to Shellac that is easy to remove. I will probably purchase additional colors for spring. It is inexpensive and worth trying.</li>
    <li> Love the Vinylux Polish. Stays on my nails for 7-10 days. I no longer go to the salon for gel. It has been a money saver for me. I have now ordered about 7 different colors because I like it so much!</li>
    <li> love this classic red color.</li>
    <li> I really like the product because it is long lasting and doesn&#x27;t chip too easily....also great variety of colors are availab le</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; color...not too garish and just enough red.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s also wearable for the office as well as hitting the night spots.</li>
    <li> For the most part I give Vinylux a 5 star rating.  For some reason the reds seem to be a bit harder on my nails.  WIth no base coat, the red polish stains more than any of the other colors, however, the Vinylux brand is my go to brand for nail polish.</li>
    <li> love this polish dries fast and very durable</li>
    <li> CND vinylux is great for no chip manicures.  This is a very dramatic purple/red color and is great for a night out on the town!</li>
