<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love,  love, love this product.  It feels so good going on your face.  Makes it very soft.  Would highly recommend it.  Also it comes from a very good company. Very helpful and really nice to work with.  This product is a must buy!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom who has a very sensitive skin and she looked a bit irritated but she liked how her skin feels anyways.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this serum and the way it goes on and penetrates the skin immediately.  It is my first experience using Vitamin C products so I am not sure if it is really working.  However, I must say that my skin feels softer and did not get irritated when I first started using it.  Perhaps it just takes longer to see real results.  I have only been using it for about a month.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this serum! It&#x27;s silky as you apply it, but not the least bit oily. I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks, but I&#x27;m already seeing a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It smells good, feels silky and nice.  But I have not seen any changes in toning, correction or tightening.  I use it twice a day, and put moisturizer (nerium) on top of it.  I don&#x27;t use a primer with my makeup - I use clinique tinted BB cream like a foundation and bare minerals for the rest.  It feels nice, I wish I would see a change though.</li>
    <li> Love it! So nice and silky! Absorbs 100% into my skin! Well worth the cost!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving it, the serum just seems to disappear after putting it on.  Love the aroma (mmmmgood), I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet, but, I am 73 so it may take a while.....</li>
    <li> Product is very silky and smells great.  Just started to use it so I don&#x27;t know the long term results yet.  Awesome customer service from Liz. I had an issue with my original purchase, but  it was resolved quickly!  :)</li>
    <li> Very light, but not with SPF!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum now for about 10 days and I truly love it.  Reasons being, once applied, my skin feels soft, supple and hydrated.  I also have a noticeably brighter complexion, meaning I had somewhat of a reddish blotchy appearance on my cheeks and chin, and seriously, that is remarkably diminished, in 10 days!  Also, I do see a noticeable difference in the fine lines that were around my eyes (I do sweep across my under eyes and crows feet area), all look rejuvenated and totally refreshed.  I am very excited about this product, I have never used a vitamin C serum in the past, and I regret it now!  I use this serum in the AM and PM, then moisturize, and am really looking forward to seeing more of a transformation as I continue to use.  I will absolutely buy this product over again, and am looking forward to Vidi coming out with their eye serum this spring.</li>
    <li> I have tried other vitamin C serums before and I have to say that it is by far superior to other brands. I love the pump of the bottle and the consistency of the product...no more dealing with a dropper and wasting product! I am in my 30s and am trying to get rid of old cystic acne scars...this is the only vitamin C serum that has delivered in that aspect. I also love that it contains AHA and BHA along with vitamin C to help keep skin clear! I will defiantly purchase again and I look forward to my skin looking even better in months to come!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Used it for 3 days now.  I can tell already that my face is smoother feeling.  Looking forward to seeing what other results may be.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say very awesome product. I have only been using this vitamin C serum for a couple of weeks and it feels amazing. My skin feels very soft, and the product glides on smoothly. It smells good too sort of a citrus orange cr&amp;egrave;me smell. Also my face is looking brighter, and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.  I will purchase again. I recommend this vitamin C serum to all. Not to mention the sellers care about you, and are very good at keeping you posted through email on information about this product. Oh and it was delivered very fast within 2 days. Excellent product and customer service.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Good product.  I have used many, and this seems to be the one working the best for me.  Dark spots are lighter and skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> I did see some difference in the marks on my face but not too much to justify the 40 dollars i paid.</li>
    <li> First of all, I like the fact that the pump style container gives you a measured amount of product to use - less waste and more value for money.  Also like the perfume and the silky feeling of the serum.  I have very sensitive skin, so not all skin products work for me. After applying this Vitamin C Serum in the morning, I later felt a burning/tingling sensation.  I thought that once again, I am going to have to give a skin product away.  Then I received a very informative email from the company, which told me I need to apply sunscreen if I am going outside otherwise I would experience tingling/burning sensation - Ah Ha! - I had just walked the dog in pretty hot sunshine.  Applied the Vitamin C Serum again, didn&#x27;t go out into the sun - no tingling, just a lovely smooth texture on my skin - I keep the serum and my daughter misses out this time!  I appreciated the informative follow-up email from the company - good stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to combat my acne and acne scars. I have only been using this product for about a week but I am already very happy with my purchase. I definitely see an improvement in my skin, it feels much smoother and I see a decrease in the redness around my scars. On top of that, all of my correspondance with the seller has been extremely pleasant, as they are very helpful and thorough.</li>
    <li> I received this product to test months ago and I never even took it out of the box.  2015 I decided I will try the serum and WOW, I wish I had used it as soon as I received it.  My face is truly lighter and brighter than ever.  I&#x27;m a 40 year old black woman so I was skeptical at first.&lt;br /&gt;I use my serum in the mornings.  A few minutes after applying it I then use shea butter as my sunblock.  The combination for me is Amazing.  I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells delicious, wasn&#x27;t sure at first whether to eat it or wear it. The perfume doesn&#x27;t linger, so this is a plus. I love the silky feeling and it absorbs extremely well. After using twice a day for 8 days, the dry patches on my face seem to have gone.</li>
    <li> The serum has a really nice silky feel and a nice scent. However, I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic change to my skin. But I really haven&#x27;t used it very long.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day and today is the first day in years that I have come to work with no makeup on, I was running late, looked in the mirror and thought wow! I&#x27;m having such a wonderful skin day. I feel more confident without makeup than I have in a very long time. My freckles and old acne red spots are faded, my skin appears well moisturized and bright. Also the occasional break outs I would get have completely cleared up. This stuff feels like silk on your face and I think I am hooked on this stuff. The pump prevents waste by offering a portion control so you don&#x27;t use to much, honestly one pump is enough to do your entire face and neck. It arrived on time, and I will most defiantly purchase again.</li>
    <li> Dullest purchase.. dried my skin..</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I bought 4 already. I gave one for my sister and one for my mom. I love the smell of it kind of orange-y but not overpowering. You can feel your skin a lot softer and smoother right after you put on the product but you must and really it&#x27;s a must to wear sunscreen whenever you will go out because your skin will be more prone to sunburn. All in all this is a good product if you want to improve your skin specially if you are starting to see some signs of aging. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, love the satin smooth look and feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells lightly of orange and spreads on like melted butter, skin feels so soft after applying and works really well under your daily primer, foundation or sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Yes this Vitamin C product is really excellent&lt;br /&gt;I returned from Mexico with an allergic reaction which made my skin dry and itchy ... No product helped. Not even prescription creams!&lt;br /&gt;As I had never had skin problems before and I am 66 yrs old it really was of great concern to me...&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical  reading about the product and didn&#x27;t expect a great result but it has REALLY helped- My skin is smooth and clear again… Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Vivienne S</li>
    <li> Feels artificial. Kind of light weight greasy. The other vitamin c serums I use are all natural maybe that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t care for this. Too orangey like it was artificially added.</li>
    <li> My face seems to glow!</li>
    <li> Very good product; smells good, too!</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of Vidi almost two weeks ago and like this product so much, I bought two more the other day. I&#x27;m very careful with my skin (sunscreen rain or shine, indoors and out) and, at the age of 58, look at least 10 years younger with very few deep wrinkles but a bit of sag at the jawline and neck, and some fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years - creams, glycolic acid minipeels and laser (great for zapping dark spots and freckles, but very expensive). I even tried a TCA peel which caused a 7 to 10 day downtime, later exposing glorious skin. The downtime of this kind of peel rendered this method completely unacceptable. So, too, surgery (too many horror stories).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant; slightly citrus, not overpowering. The packaging is attractive and the pump delivers a small drop of oil at a time which goes a surprisingly long way. I&#x27;d love to be able to see how much is left in the bottle, but the opacity preserves the oils which are susceptible to deterioration from exposure to light. I&#x27;m still on the first bottle, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use every morning and at night. I use facial cleansing towelettes first on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, neck and face, rubbing lightly to exfoliate and let dry for a minute or two. I use one drop of oil on my chest, one for my neck and one for each side of my face. The oil absorbs quickly, leaving my skin silky smooth. I use a moisturizer after a few minutes followed by 50 SPF sunscreen (morning only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost two weeks I&#x27;m seeing an evening out of my skin tone and texture, with very, very slight firming along my jaw and neck. My skin feels nicely moisturized and it lasts for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it. The price is right, customer service is great and I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note for the few reviewers who haven&#x27;t yet seen results... it does take some time, probably longer than desired depending on the extent of sun damage and/or age. You&#x27;re not going to see instant results - no product does that.ote for the few reviewers who haven&#x27;t yet seen results... it does take some time, probably longer than desired depending on the extent of sun damage and/or age.

    <li> I started using a month ago.  My skin tone is even and looks so much better!  I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> You can really feel this working, from the moment you put it on, it makes your skin feel great. I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but already it seems to be making a difference and gives a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of vitamin C serums and this is by far my favorite!  I love the scent and the smooth, silky feel of the serum.  The pump dispenser is much easier to deal with than the dropper bottles and, I assume, keeps it fresher.  The company and its representatives are extremely helpful and responsive.  Great experience all around!</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for over a month and my skin is looking a lot better. My skin was tired looking and had no life. Now it glows and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have ordered The Vitamin C Serum and I will re-order again and again.  It is smooth as silk on my skin.</li>
    <li> This serum is much easier to apply than many others we have tried.  A small pump is enough to cover and massage the whole face.  It is crystals clear with the consistency of pure aloe vera.  No offensive smell, just a very subtle scent.  It spreads faster and covers the area quickly.  Thinner and lighter.  No masking feeling.  The skin feels naturally moisturized.  Use it by itself or use it after a derma roller session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful going outside the sun.  Skin is more sensitive with the serum.  Protect by wearing a hat or use an umbrella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos also for product presentation.  It comes in a creative classy bottle that looks like a test tube inside a glass cylinder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided for review purposes.</li>
    <li> This serum is the best ever.  It gives your skin the feel of a baby&#x27;s skin, silky soft.  I have used it for about 2 weeks and I am amazed at my skin.  Smooth, silky.  I love it so far and can only imagine it getting even better.  I seldom wear makeup other than a light powder and I don&#x27;t even feel I need that. The pump is the perfect dispenser for the serum, no waste!  This is the first time I have tried a product such as this and loved it from the first moment I used it. For others I tried and I just kept hoping.  Wonderful product.  It has a lovely light scent not the usual cloying perfume fragrance.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> i love the way it feels on my skin.  It does seem to be helping the blemishes and i haven&#x27;t been using it very long.  a little will go a long way.</li>
    <li> VIDI Vitamin C Serum goes on so smooth and silky. I look forward to using this everyday. My skin has never felt so silky.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the pump dispenser. Easy to measure and no waste.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s but this one seems to be richer and definitely makes your skin feel silky immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> . This is a very nice serum. I like that it is in a pump bottle. The pump delivers the exact amount needed and being a closed system it prevents oxidation. I chose this serum because of the ingredients. I like that it has 20% vitamin c, alpha and beta hydroxy acids, matrixyl and silicone.the fragrance is very pleasant and the silicone gives it great slip which makes the skin very smooth. This product also \\&quot;plays well\\&quot; with other products. No pilling and rolling off the skin. I definitely will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 3 weeks and my face is so smooth and the tone is evening out. If you buy this product you will not regret it. Love this product I would recommend it highly ...my only complaint is the pump stop working I am hoping they will send me a new bottle.....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;Have noticed improvement in my skin. It is balance not oily or dry. My complexion is way better since I have been using this product. Hopefully they don&#x27;t change the formula. I will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It combats pre-mature aging that caused by my high-stress life style and makes my face look refreshed.</li>
    <li> I liked the texture and smell of this product.  It was easy to apply and absorbed into my skin very quickly. Would recommend to anyone suffering from dry skin.</li>
    <li> VIDI&#x27;s antioxidant, Vitamin C Serum is a great regular use product that is providing me with solid overnight results - particularly with tightening of pores, balancing out of skin tone and a nice overall healthier appearance that is noticeable first thing in the morning. There seems to be a good balance between aggressive acids (salicylic, glycolic, etc) breaking down impurities along with antioxidant vitamins and oils that insures you&#x27;re getting work done without overtly drying out the skin (although you will want to wear sunscreen if using this serum while exposed to sunlight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is very easy. The serum itself is clear and slightly viscous and absorbs immediately into the skin. Fragrance is pleasant and with sugary vanilla and citrus overtones very reminiscent of an Orange Creamsicle. I can cover the entirety of my face with 2 pumps of serum and with the small amount dispensed - the 1 oz of product should last 1-2 months. Nice overall solution and glad to add this to my daily routine (note: I was provided this product gratis for review purposes).</li>
    <li> This lightly citrusy serum applies easily and evenly over the face and does not sting. Since it contains agents that make the user sun-sensitive, I have been using this only at night.  The next morning the skin still feels soft and moisturized. A few drops is all it takes to feel results.  As a moisturizer I&#x27;d rate this five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not speak for it being able to remove age spots, though.  I do have crows feet around my eyes, and a deep wrinkle across my forehead, and neither seem to be helped by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like is the non-greasy moisturizer and the subtle, citrusy aroma.</li>
    <li> My sister always talks about VIDI products. So to give a try I ordered my first Vitamin C Serium. It is fantastic my skin feels so smoth nothing like I had before. I have been using diferent products with higher cost and VIDI is away much better for less. I high recommend this product if you want to have a great skin.</li>
    <li> My face feels so light and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> This is a good serum that can replace a primer, too. It stays on the skin well and provides some sun protection from the vitamin C. It is real proof that a good product need not cost a fortune. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I first received a sample of this product I thought it would be something my wife would add to her daily grooming regiment. But when I applied it to my face one morning after shaving I loved the way it felt on my skin. It moisturized with a light refreshing scent that really seemed to penetrate my pores without clogging them. I have since added Vidi to my nighttime routine, and I’ve found that I wake up in the morning with a face that’s better prepped for a close shave. My wife loves that this product has allowed her to dispense with a few of her other products, because it works so well as a moisturizer/refresher. So it looks like I’ll have to purchase my own bottle. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really like how soft my face feels after I apply it and it has a nice scent but not over-powering. The pump allows me not to use too much so I am not wasting it and having to buy more sooner than expected. So far my skin seems brighter under my eyes and I think the fine lines are relaxing...hoping to see more results the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> Hahaha! You might want to hire my daughter - she is a darn good editor &amp; you really need one! Your email errors were hilarious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; OK - so you want feedback on the Vitamin C Serum I purchased in April. I&#x27;ve used the serum faithfully 2X a day: AM &amp; PM.  I can&#x27;t say I noticed major improvement overall. More like &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34; improvement. I expected more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT! The feel of this serum is truly divine. Very silky. ( I love the mild fragrance, too. ) It soaks into my skin leaving it soft and moisturized. For these reasons I plan to purchase a 2nd bottle in the near future.</li>
    <li> I love vitamin C serum, and with the added alpha and beta hydroxy I love this serum. I was using a Vitamin C serum that was costing me almost $100, but I was not getting the results I have with this one. I can already see the patched of freckles that have been made worse by the sun start to fade after only a week&#x27;s use. I use it on my preteen daughter(after the dermatologist recommended vitamin C for her skin) as well who has started having some breakouts from being oily. It has completely cleared her face up. I love the citrus smell. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product either to cover your entire face which is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> i love the way it feels on my skin and it smell really nice.</li>
    <li> Age: 57&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEN STARS! This serum is A-Maz-Zing! I have tried numerous serum products, and while I have really liked a few of them, this one beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the packaging: it comes in a nice-looking bottle with a stylistic sketch of a woman on the front, but the best feature is the pump action. My other serum, that I did love but Vidi I like even better (better feel, better  results, better ingredients), comes in a jar, so that I have to dip a bit out - not as hygienic even though I do wash my hands well before using. As well, the pump gives you just enough -- you don&#x27;t need much, just a nice gentle push on the applicator and that is enough for my entire face-- I do have a small peahead, so - laugh  - still, you won&#x27;t need a lot. I received this free in exchange for a review by my effusive exclamations are honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the texture. When I saw what it looked like - sort of a thin gel - I thought, &amp;#34;Oh, well, guess that&#x27;ll feel gel-like on my face.&amp;#34; No! As soon as I used my fingertips to smooth it over my skin, it was like silk! SILK, y&#x27;all! I have never had a serum so silky feeling! It immediately soaks into your skin, but that silky feel lingers - I wanted to rub this over my entire body, oh that I could buy a vat of this and do just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see how it will do on any fine lines, but, I already see a difference in how my skin looks -- there is a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; about it, and though I know it must be too soon, I still feel as if my face looks smoother. Perhaps it&#x27;s doing something wonderful even as I write this *smile*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients: made in the USA, and I was happy to see that not only is it a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; but one that has  Antioxidants, 2 Hydroxy acids, and Multi-Peptides (Glycolic and Salicylic Acids) -- however, I do not have any stinging or irritation on my sensitive skin. And no break-outs. Yes, even at my age, some products still will break me out. Not this one. In fact, after it is absorbed into my skin, I forget I have it on - it just does it&#x27;s thang while I sleep, or go about  my business. I want to use it just at night to make it last longer, but I love it so much, I use it twice a day: morning, night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this product that I will be purchasing it when this bottle runs out, and as well, I want to look at what else Vidi has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, y&#x27;all, you will not be disappointed - this is a wonderful serum. I just can&#x27;t say enough good about it.break me out. Not this one.

    <li> Great feel immediately and I don&#x27;t have to use any of my other additional products that I normally would. With so many medications that I am on, my face is always dry, red and broke out in certain areas and this has helped. Not sure about the skin lightening but it has helped the redness. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels heavenly going on....I don&#x27;t know if it is going to be super anti-aging as i have only been using it for a few weeks..</li>
    <li> I have been using this Serum for about a month and I have notices a difference in my complexion for the better.  Smoother, softer lines..... it works great!</li>
    <li> I really love this serum. It gives my skin a smooth, matte finish that isn&#x27;t shiny at all. Although it&#x27;s not a moisturizer, it does make my skin feel less dry and flaky. I cannot comment directly on its anti-aging benefits, but I will say my skin looks noticeably better after using this for a few weeks. It also seems to prevent breakouts (probably due to the salicylic acid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it will make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so definitely wear sunscreen if you&#x27;re going to be outside for a while. As long as you don&#x27;t go into the sun, however, it does not make your skin red and does not give chemical burns. Despite being fairly pricey, I&#x27;ll most likely be buying more after my first bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To comply with online review regulations, I need to mention that I received a free sample of this product for review.</li>
    <li> I have been using VIDI Vitamin C Serum for about two weeks now, and I am seeing some subtle differences in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I purchased it to lighten some dark spots on my face, and for burn scars on my arms. It is definitely helping these areas. I think with continued use, I will be very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I got this serum for my mom (early 60s) and it&#x27;s been almost 2 months now and her face got really improved and I was really surprised. Now I am getting more for myself ;)</li>
    <li> I used to do homemade vitamin C and it takes some effort to do using Ascorbic acid and store it. This vitamin C serum works very well and makes skin shine. The bottle is great looking and packaging is awesome! Definitely works for me. Sample was provided in exchange of a fair review.</li>
    <li> I was provided a sample product for review.  This is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like an Orange Juiius to me if you&#x27;ve had one of those.  The scent reminds me of citrus and vanilla.  It is very pleasant.  I&#x27;d wear it for a perfume if they&#x27;d make one.  It&#x27;s quite yummy.  To me it is not too strong, but if you don&#x27;t like scent, this might be one to skip. It is a very natural scent though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has several beneficial ingredients, including Vitamin C (20%) and Vitamins A and E.  It also has salicylic acid in it all in a cyclomethicone base, which is an artificial silicone base that works as a carrier to get the good stuff to the skin.  Because of this, it feels super silky going on, and helps the serum spread very easily.  It immediately helps plump up small fine lines under my eyes, so I&#x27;ve enjoyed applying it prior to my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump works great, giving a nice dose that&#x27;s all I need, but I enjoy applying it so much I usually use another pump or two.  It has this silky feel - a lot like Estee Lauders Ceramide capsules, if you&#x27;ve ever used those.  It&#x27;s not the same ingredients, but it FEELS a lot like those.  I have been following mine with Clinique&#x27;s All Day moisturizer with SPF 15.  I have not had any redness with this regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  My skin rarely if ever breaks out at all though - people prone to breakouts might have issues with the cyclomethicone,  though the salicylic acid might be enough to counter that, so I won&#x27;t recommend it for them, but on my aging skin that is clear, this has helped keep my skin tone even and help plump up small fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is truly a delightful skin serum with a refreshing, although far from overpowering, citrus fragrance.  Love the feel of this on my face.  For reference, have had allergies and facial itching and hive like rashy patches, and even still this serum applied like a dream with zero irritation whatsoever.  In fact, over time - say a week - saw my red patches lightened and evened out.  And even though overall have good skin, could feel a difference in texture.  Many skin treatments are strictly cosmetic, meaning they mainly treat the surface, but this product made an actual difference in my complexion.  The one caveat though is, if you have very dry skin like me, you will still need to use a moisturizer.  This serum alone will not cut it, and your skin won&#x27;t be properly prepped for makeup application.  As for anti-aging effect, cannot speak to that because do not have much wrinkling (yet that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the packaging.  Vidi Vitamin C20 Anti Aging Serum is a tall cylindrical column (1 oz.) which comes with an excellent dispenser that gives you the exact amount required.  No waste and the only way to hygenically dispense product.  Bottle has an upscale feel, and it&#x27;s a product anyone would feel proud to display on their vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The labeling cautions that, being this product contains vitamin C, your skin will become more reactive in the sun, so you&#x27;re going to need a sunscreen.  Personally, don&#x27;t go out in the sun regularly, and do not wear sunscreen.  However, wearing a brimmed hat went out directly after applying this serum and felt no ill effects whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure:  received a complementary sample in return for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Love this product - it does what it says!</li>
    <li> I like to use vitamin C serums during the summer to provide a little extra protection to my skin.  I live in Georgia and it&#x27;s sunny and hot; I&#x27;m outside frequently to walk my dog.  So I like to do what I can to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this product was the texture.  I guess it is the micro-encapsulated vitamin C I am feeling, but I LOVED the way this felt going onto my skin.  It was a clear liquid (not very viscous) but it almost felt like it had powder in it when I applied it to my skin.  It was not at all greasy and didn&#x27;t leave any residue.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a scent but I tend to use a lot of skincare products and the scents all mingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is an airless pump and it is quite large, so you are getting a lot of product for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night only.  First I cleanse and use toner, then apply this serum, then finish up with a moisturizer.  I apply to my whole face and neck.  I have sensitive skin but this did not cause any negative reactions, redness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;d been using this for awhile, I noticed that my skin was clearer.  I wanted to use it without expectations so I could truly evaluate the effects, so after I noticed my skin clearing up, I went to read the ingredients and found that it contained both salicylic acid (an ingredient in many anti-acne preparations) and glycolic acid (an ingredient in many skin peels).  So it has both AHA and BHA ingredients, and I think these contributed a great deal to the improvements in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that this helps or doesn&#x27;t help with already-existing wrinkles as it doesn&#x27;t contain many moisturizing ingredients typical in these sorts of products (i.e., there&#x27;s no aloe or hyaluronic acid).  Plus, I kept on using my normal moisturizer.  Where I think it will be beneficial in the long term is in preventing new wrinkles from forming -- the antioxidants (vitamins C and E, for example) should help to counteract free radical damage caused by the summer sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that some of the ingredients may increase sun sensitivity.  If you intend to use this product during the day, please use a high SPF sunscreen.  I prefer only mineral (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) sunscreens for use on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using one daily and have not experienced any negative effects from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this helped clear up my skin, felt wonderful going on, left no residue, and should help protect my skin from damage due to UV exposure (but it is not a substitute for sunscreen).  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.act free radical damage caused by the summer sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that some of the ingredients may increase sun sensitivity.

    <li> The company sent me the serum for free, in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that when I put it on, my face feels incredibly velvety soft and smooth.  My skin feels very nice after putting it on.  Also, I have VERY sensitive skin, and it did not cause my skin to burn, turn red, or break out.  My skin did start to dry out a bit, so I switched to only using it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very nice bottle, with a nice pump, that allows you to squeeze out exactly how much you need.  I normally used 2 pumps for my face, and 1 for my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but after using it for 3 weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  My skin tone hasn&#x27;t started evening out, and I don&#x27;t notice any more or less wrinkles, zits, or blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s such a nice product, but after 3 weeks, I did not see any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I just got it today and I used for the first time. My first impression was, I loved the smell and the way it felt on my skin, it feels very smooth, can&#x27;t wait to see the results... :) Andreia.</li>
    <li> My skin looks younger and brighter, just make sure to also use sunblock when wearing.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. Feels like silk going on and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I noticed vitamn C face serum has been quite popular these days, so was curious and wanted to have a try. After browsing on Amazon, I decided to get VIDI&#x27;s because it also contains Salicylic Acid &amp; Glycolic Acid, I know these two will help lighten up my complextion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and I was delighted to see that the bottle is a pump style which I like as the air can&#x27;t get in and make the serum spoil, like some others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottle it says use day and night, also reminds me to use sunscreen if use the serum during day time. I used it at night only though because my dry skin need extra moisture boost while sleeping. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 nights so far and can feel the difference already! The serum feels beautiful on my skin, it really is very silk like. My skin feels deeply moisturized, soft and fresh after applying. More importantly, my face feels so comfortable every morning, unlike in the past, I can feel it tighten up due to the lack of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I no longer need any other moisturizing or anti-age serum, I simply use one bottle of VIDI vitamin C serum, so really a good value for money.</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME product.  I noticed a change in my skin and age spots in one week!  I will continue to purchase it for as long as it&#x27;s sold!</li>
    <li> I was offered a free sample of VIDI Vitamin C20 serum in exchange for an honest review. Used as directed, this is a great product. I haven’t seen my skin go through any major changes (I’m 63), but it looks good and seems somewhat smoother. I found that my skin felt a bit tighter after a few days, but putting on an Aloe Vera Moisturizer over the serum during the day seemed to take care of that. I applied the serum in the morning and before I went to bed and used it without anything else at night. I love the delicate citrus smell, which goes away as the serum penetrates the skin. The package warns that the serum can increase sensitivity to the sun and suggests wearing sunscreen while using the product outdoors. Heed this warning! I forgot to apply the moisturizer one morning and went for a walk. I haven’t sunburned in a long time, but for some reason my chin burned to the point of blistering. I was shocked! With moisturizer or sunscreen, there should be no problem, so don’t forget like I did! I do not fault the product in any way since this was an “operator error” - I just want to warn possible users to take the warning seriously.</li>
    <li> I have order other producs vitamin c but this I really love the texture and smell too soon to see results but I will posted a review soon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe 2-3 weeks now and I like the fact that it&#x27;s silky and moisturizing. I did notice a little bit that my sunspots have faded a bit and hoping they&#x27;ll fade even more as I keep using it. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product earlier this year and I fell in love. It made my skin baby soft and clear from acne. I barely had any pimples for months. About to reorder since I&#x27;m all out!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Love the texture of it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product..Have seen improvement of my skin in only a week.</li>
    <li> Ordered this serum a couple weeks ago.......have been using daily and am beginning to see the long term affects.  It makes you feel instantly special.  It&#x27;s liquid softness!!!  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have not noticed much improvement. I love the smell and the way it feels on my skin but I have noticed any lightening of my sun spots. I will continue to use maybe I will see results in time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C Serum for Face for about 2 months now.  I put it on my clean face first in the morning and at night followed by my moisturizer.  My skin is definitely softer, with less visual lines.  My husband has commented on my face and runs his hand across my face feeling it.  He says I have baby soft skin!  I plan on continue using this product.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Being a native South Floridian my wife has damaged her skin for umpteen years and has tried numerous products/potions from high end retailers, dermatologist and snake oil salesmen (hundreds if not thousands) in an attempt to correct such with little if any success. While she has only been using this product as directed for two weeks I have noticed a big difference in damage sustained from years of tanning. The age/dark spots have become considerably lighter along with shrinking in size. While she still needs to maintain her preventive maintenance routine (sunscreen etc.) adding this serum to her arsenal has been a game changer.</li>
    <li> Very nice serum. Goes on very smoothly, and my skin feels smoother. I use it in the morning so it does not conflict with retin a at night. I really like it. This is the 5th time I have purchased it. My friends are now using it and loving the serum also.</li>
    <li> This product makes my face feels and look healthy without a shine but a nice glow.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the stuff will most deffinetly but agian</li>
    <li> I really like the packaging. The serum come in a non see through pump bottle. Since air and light makes vitamin C in moisturizers degrade faster, I feel the packaging will keep the active ingredients fresher for longer. As for the serum itself, it feels so good and leaves a silky feeling when applied to the skin. The main short term affect I&#x27;ve noticed is that I wake up with glowy skin and less blotchiness. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my skin looks the more I use this serum in the long term.</li>
    <li> My product arrive with a pump dispenser that did not work.  The product itself I use after a sauna or if I get a bit too much sun. It seemed to help.</li>
    <li> It appears to work quickly. Better if you don&#x27;t apply cream or makeup over it. Unfortunately, my skin tone is pale and uneven. I use it before bedtime and the skin is smoother fine lines practically gone. Reapply after morning shower, on dry skin wait a few minutes and apply make up. Open to suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> I would give it zero stars if I could. I used it for about 3 weeks and saw no difference. But the worst problem was the smell. It smelled like a cross between cheap maple syrup and cat pee. The sheets around my face picked up the smell and if I didn&#x27;t wash the sheets every 3 days my room had this same horrible smell.</li>
    <li> everyone should try this product, I had a wrinkles under my nose and neck, they are going a way for a long trip. I am very please with it</li>
    <li> I usually apply this product first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t use anything else for a couple of hours.  I like the moisturizing feel when it goes on. Also trying it on top of my &amp;#34;parchment&amp;#34; looking hands.  Can&#x27;t say I look any younger yet but I&#x27;m giving it time. Maybe the idea is to stop looking older! Will probably reorder soon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It goes on silky smooth and feels wonderful on my skin. Absorption rate is fast so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to put on sunscreen and/or foundation. I use it on my face,neck and upper chest and my skin feels smooth. Plus, it lasts throughout the day. I love all that it offers and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product and I have to say that so far so good, my skin feel soft and silky, when I wake up is not grease like I get it when I use night creams, my skin absorbs this serum pretty quickly and keeps it hid rated trough out the day, love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in the hopes that it will help with the fine lines and the usual &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin that proud, beautiful 40-is women have. Well, I&#x27;ve only had it two days and let me tell you....I am so excited to see the long term effects!  This product is light and has a nice, not intoxicating orange smell.  I have used it 3 times....2 times in the morning and 1 time at night before bed.  My skin feels amazing when I put my make up one! Super excited!  I will definitely post any updates on the progress.</li>
    <li> Four stars since I started using it a few days ago. Ill update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 years, normal skin with patches of melasma on cheeks front and nose.&lt;br /&gt;First impression,&lt;br /&gt;This serum comes with a pump which I love since I know this will preserve better the vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;Feels super  silky smooth on my skin, maybe because the silicons in it, which I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;It has a matte finish ( a plus for me ), the vitamin C is micro encapsulated ( for better preservation )&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m exited to keep using this serum since it includes Matrixyl  synthe 6 ( this ingredient is supposed to improve the appearance of  fine lines and wrinkles ).&lt;br /&gt; I will update the results on my melasma, skin texture and tone..&lt;br /&gt;Also the seller provided me with vast information about the product, super fast delivery...</li>
    <li> What a great cream. Helps with keeping wrinkles down and skin smooth. A must have for your morning regimine. Give this cream a look.</li>
    <li> This products smooth velvety texture has a moisturizing almost soothing quality.  When I applied it to the eye area it smoothed out the texture of my skin, nearly diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  I used it on my laugh lines and didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference, but my skin appeared softer and more supply.. I like the results I got around the eye area!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using this about 3 weeks and today someone complimented my skin! It feels wonderful when applied, not greasy at all, rather smooth with fast absorption. The smell is pleasant. I had some occasional breakouts and they seem to be less frequent since using this product. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am 74 and have been using Retin A cream &amp; Tazarac cream since my 30&#x27;s and have practically no wrinkles at all therefore I did not think that using this serum in the morning was going show much difference but I was wrong.....after using it for about 3 weeks now I see and feel a definite silky smoothness in the texture of my skin...I would highly recommend it to who ever is having pause about purchasing this....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few months, so I have yet to see results.  Nice fragrance and I like the way it feels on my face.  I used to use it in the morning with a sunscreen and at night, but now only at bedtime.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to go through the entire bottle, and I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it.This product instantly made my skin feel so smooth as soon as I applied it. It smelled amazing. I&#x27;m so happy I got this serum. Just 2 pumps for the whole face and neck, you will feel so good. I used it at night with my night cream. There&#x27;s vitamin C in it so it will actually brightens your dark spots. Please try it out if you haven&#x27;t, It&#x27;s amazing. I will definitely buy some more to use with my night skin care routine.</li>
    <li> If using for sun damage or freckles,  dont bother.  This stuff is worthless.</li>
    <li> im allergic to aloe vera gel and i have sensitive skin i was happy to find one without aloe. it is absolutely perfect. my skins already clearing up. i can wear it under my powder makeup! it works more like a primer. its silky and seriously has the best smell i have ever had from a cream. the bottle is perfect! you get exactly as much as you want to use. I add a bit of lotion or cream over it, just a touch. the company follows up with you which is very nice and rare.&lt;br /&gt;update, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this great in years! already in a few more days my skin is glowing! the salicylic acid and vit c has gotten rid of all my redness, amazing! I have tried at least 30 different creams over the years, this is the first one i have ever loved!!! its seriously perfect, i haven&#x27;t seeing my skin looking this nice in over 7 years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now. I notice a lightening iof age spots and a softening of skin.  The back of my hands have lightened the age spots.  i would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this serum on my skin.  It absorbs quickly and has a wonderful light scent.  I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my skin and others have noticed too.  I use the serum at night after I clean and exfoliate my skin. The customer service is also exceptional, I would definitely purchase this serum again.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had the product for very long, it feels wonderful on the skin and has corrected some dry spots already.  Being of an age and growing up when there were no sun screens has left me with skin problems.  I highly recommend this product as an excellent treatment for skin problems.</li>
    <li> I started using it the day it arrived.I could see a glow on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The following day I shook it and could see the orange pieces in the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I could also feel the slight sting on my face, but not hurtful. I figured the serum was working.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost a month since I started using it. I could see the difference in the line..&lt;br /&gt;my face doesn&#x27;t look  tired as it had been, with raising 2 toddlers at my age-almost 50</li>
    <li> This was admittedly my first time using any anti aging serum, I have been skeptical of the claims that are made by companies and the prices they charge have steered me clear thus far. I was contacted by the manufacturer and asked to review a free sample and readily agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the changes in my skin in the month that I&#x27;ve been using this product! The serum comes in a pump bottle, with a measured application that is just the right amount for my face. I like that, no guess work about how much to use. The serum goes on silky smooth, without a greasy after feel. It absorbs quickly and the scent is light and citrusy, it smells clean and fresh and doesn&#x27;t linger long, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chemical sensitivity issues, and many perfumes, cleansers and detergents cause me to break out and have even caused burns in the past. Not so with this product. I know a few other reviewers complained about an initial breakout when they began using this product, and I was worried at first, but I was lucky and had no such issues. I have a spot of psoriasis on my chin and even when some gets on the spot, it doesn&#x27;t aggravate it, and doesn&#x27;t make it worse either. It actually soothes the area temporarily, and moistens it. I do not intentionally apply the serum to that area, although the product is rather watery and it sometimes runs into that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly impressed with the effects this product has on my skin. I don&#x27;t have truly deep wrinkles, more laugh and squint lines around my eyes and in my forehead. They have visibly lessened since I began using this product. I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product is supposed to have an effect on my pores, but they have visibly improved also. I will continue to use this product and will consider purchasing more when the sample is gone!</li>
    <li> I have only used this for two weeks, but I can already see and feel a difference in my skin.  It really is a great product!</li>
    <li> LOVE VIDI Vitamin C serum!  Makes my 63 year-young face feel so silky smooth!!!!  After smoothing it on my face with my fingertips, I then rub what is &amp;#34;left&amp;#34; on my fingers over my nails.  My nails and cuticles have never been so healthy!!!!  Don&#x27;t think I will ever be without VIDI serum!!!</li>
    <li> so dry feeling after applied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now twice a day.  It does leave your face feeling very soft however, I purchased this to help even my skin tone.  And with that I do not see any difference after using it.  A little disappointed because I was hoping I didn&#x27;t have to spend an arm and a leg to get even skin tone.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product on a regular basis and am very pleased with the results! My skin is smoother and more radiant. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. I did not notice any change at all. Save your money for something that works.</li>
    <li> Great product. No irritation. Leaves your face very smooth and refreshed. Will continue ordering in the future. Second time I have purchased.</li>
    <li> This product feels wonderful on your face- I did have a problem with the pump, however I called customer service and they sent me another one immediately- wonderful customer service- I have been using it for a very short time, so it is hard to say what the results are, except for the fact it makes my face feel great-  I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this serum. I have wanted to wait a little longer on it to see full results before posting a review! Well, I have been using this product daily for a month now, and my normally dull, lifeless hormonal-acne ridden 41 year old face is looking young and healthy once again. This product smells pleasant, smooths on skin very nicely and leaves a nice non-greasy moisture level to the skin. No irritation whatsoever, and my acne is just about completely gone! All in all a great product! I will be buying this again! I only wish it were slightly lower in price, but for the amount you receive and how little it takes to cover the entire face daily, it is worth it!</li>
    <li> This seerum is a bit more oily thn my creams.  But I discovered that if I apply it 30-40 minutes before bedtime it absorbes into my skin.  I still have a slightly oily feel in the morning but it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  Nice product and not expensive as some are outrageous and do no more than this serum.</li>
    <li> when i use this product its feels like oil in the start then it becomes so smooth on the face.. its like amazing!!! i highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and am in love. It lives up to its description. It&#x27;s feels so silky and smooth when applied to the face.. I already seen d difference on my skin.. Would be buying more. This is a keeper. PS. Remember to use your SPF.</li>
    <li> this product gave me little whitehead spots, and I stopped using it. Other similar products did not.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. Even got compliments on my skin looking good lately! I need to order more.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this a couple of weeks, so no real results yet except that it absorbs quickly and has not broken my face out!!! And that in itself deserves 4 stars!!! Will update as time goes by!!</li>
    <li> Love the texture of the serum but did not see much difference on the appearence of my skin after using it for a couple months.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum goes on smoothly and feels good on the skin.  I then apply moisturizer and finally foundation. Am not sure as yet if I see any changes to my skin but will use it as part of my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have already noticed a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> Waste your money ,not buy</li>
    <li> Contents leaked out, arrived empty.</li>
    <li> Since I have oily skin, I find this serum a little greasy.  But if I use only a little, it&#x27;s OK.  It leaves my face soft.  I only use it at night.  I would recommend it, especially if you have dry or normal skin.</li>
    <li> Will have to wait until it use it longer, but so far so good</li>
    <li> Hi Liz,&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, my Mom was in the hospital, and I went to&lt;br /&gt;visit her.  She complained about age spots on her face and wondered what brands&lt;br /&gt;at Walmart would help her get rid of the spots.  I told her that I wasn&#x27;t sure,&lt;br /&gt;but I would look into it.  After some research, I found your product.  (Nothing&lt;br /&gt;at Walmart impressed me. lol) I ordered her a bottle of VIDI and she started&lt;br /&gt;using it right away.  She loved how it felt on her skin as she applied it.  The&lt;br /&gt;product has worked wonderfully for her.  My mom is now battling cancer and I was&lt;br /&gt;visiting her again last weekend, when she told me she had ran out of her VIDI&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum.  She asked me if I could get her some more.  So I immediately&lt;br /&gt;ordered her two more bottles and shipped them directly to her.  I wish I would&lt;br /&gt;have taken a before and after pic for you because the brown spots on her face&lt;br /&gt;have disappeared.  Your product has lived up to expectations, more so, they&lt;br /&gt;exceeded them.  Thank you for your great product.  I will read the article you&lt;br /&gt;sent.  I may start to use the product even before I have any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your product.  It has really helped my Mom look and feel beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, K. Wagner</li>
    <li> Love how light weight &amp; non oily that it feels. Easy to rub into skin &amp; feels great.</li>
    <li> I really like this so far. Just received an email from the seller with a video on how to use the product. Very nice email and video. Great seller!</li>
    <li> Love this serum! It makes my skin so soft. The only reason its not five stars is that I have sensitive skin and it does bring out the red for a short time. Then again, most products do on me.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and have used it before. I had used the Avon Clearly-C but when that was discontinued I was looking for something similar.  This is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Vidi Vitamin C Serum has it all! I stopped using Vitamin C liquids on my face, the product oxidized quickly, became brown and left me with clogged pores.  Finally, I found something that works: my skin has become more youthful looking, fine lines around my eyes have diminished as well as around my upper lip and, best of all, I&#x27;ve been receiving many complements.</li>
    <li> I just received my product, and Oh My Oh My! It is like velvet on my skin. I&#x27;m excited to see the great results in a few weeks! I&#x27;ll definitely keep Amazon customers updated as I have a very good feeling about this product!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is awesome too! Thank you Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> The Serum does soften the dry skin and minimize the spots making your skin &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; younger. It does not however eliminate the spots and blemishes on your skin. I have only used it over a month though, so maybe it does work in time.</li>
    <li> I love the VIDI Vitamin C Serum. It goes on so smoothly and there is no greasy feel on my face. I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this serum would work, but, it makes my skin look great.  smoother, pores smaller.  I like the fragrance and the feeling of it on my skin.  it makes it feel silky.  one bottle lasted just about two months for me.  unlike the other vitamin c product, you don&#x27;t have to refrigerate it because its in a air-less pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take SKIN ETERNAL capsules by source naturals.  it helps to shrink the pores on my face and makes the skin on my feet and hands much softer, so I recommend that as well.</li>
    <li> My wife got it so I will answer for her. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This serum is is easy to put on, it gos on smoothly and effortlessly. Making you face feel hydrated and healthy. In most cases it can be used on Its own but a smidgen of Vidi moisturizer seals the deal. I just had someone ask me if it can be uses as an eye cream. I think that is a great way to use it. Let your face or eye orbit soak in the serum then use them apply the moisturizer over the area  that you want to become smother. the total face or under your eyes and this would seal in the serum and leave the eye area or face extra soft. Used every day your fine lines will diminish greatly. Morning or night or both will give you a visible change in the condition of your skin. It has for the person I bought it for the person I buy it for.</li>
    <li> I found that the Vitamin C Serum has definitely improved the darked spots on my face, and also birghtened my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I would love a product for under my eyes, for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Softer and smoother skin after only 3 days. Very happy with my results so far. I am using it with my high frequency device.</li>
    <li> I love to put it on--it feels so good. Also, nice fragrance. I have no idea how much Vit C &amp; A will help my face, but it was recommended by plastic surgery practice and Amazon has it so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I loved this serum from the first use. I&#x27;ve been using it once daily for about a week and I already see changes in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I inherited large pores from my father&#x27;s side of the family and this serum does an excellent job of minimizing my pores.&lt;br /&gt;I also have very oily skin (Thanks again, dad.) and the serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see if there are future improvements in my skin tone and forehead wrinkle.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum has an amazing texture and leaves skin radiant and feeling beautifully balanaced. I&#x27;ve actually stopped using a primer as it helps my foundation glide on perfectly.A small amount goes a long way and it has a non greasy, matte finish. I love it.</li>
    <li> Feels smooth on my face but so far no other benefits after almost a month of application. It has not reduced my age spots or  reduce the wrinkles but I would buy it again and see If another month would make a difference..</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on many different anti aging creams just to throw them out. I&#x27;m 50 years old, I expect to have SOME wrinkles, what I hated is that I always looked tired. This serum brightens my skin to an even, smooth, tone.  I use it in the morning under my foundation ( I&#x27;d like to see a makeup line from the company), and I use it at night and it doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy or oily. Definitely a keeper. Another note, GREAT customer service. They really want to know if your happy with their products.</li>
    <li> Great product with mosturizer....I can tell the difference the first week!</li>
    <li> Superior customer service and feedback from seller, product as described and happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> I really think it makes a difference.  My face is so silky when I use it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Excellent customer service. I never see customer service like this (five stars). This is my first experience using Vitamin C Serum. After my first application of the serum, I could not believe the feeling that I had. My skin felt immediately smooth. I felt my skin firming instantly. I loved the way the serum absorbed into my skin. I really recommend the product. It is a must to have! I cannot wait to try the moisturizer. Both serum and moisturizer together will definitely make my skin looks great. I don&#x27;t need to buy any other products. This is a dream come true! Thanks VIDI Skin care!</li>
    <li> This serum in one of the best ones I have ever come across. I like to keep trying different brands so I have came across this one. I am very surprised with the high quality. The texture is amazing and the fragrance is beautiful. With one pump only I can spread all over my face. I have been using for 4 weeks now and I can see the small lines above my upper lip getting smoother and the texture of my skin getting firmer and plumped. The price for a Serum is about right but if you compare with other brands you are getting a bargain. Will order a few for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will do...gets rid of wrinkles and makes your skin feel younger and smoother. I have tried so many products and this one is officially my favorite. I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been approximately a month since I received the serum.  I use it twice a day, in the morning with the VIDI SPF moisturizer and at night with another facial moisturizer brand.  I noticed a few pimples within the first few days but they eventually faded away.  It could have been a reaction and my skin just adjusted to the new product.  The texture is great, it&#x27;s a silicone best.  I have seen any major changes nor was I expecting to see any in less than one month but for one thing for sure, this leaves my skin feeling very silky and smooth.  I very seldom wear  makeup but the two times that I have since using the product, I noticed that it looks even better.  My faces feels good. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Again this is exactly like much higher priced products.</li>
    <li> Feels really nice.  I like this product and will get it again.</li>
    <li> Use as a primer. Leaves skin soft and silky. Only had about a month now but will continue to use. Only wish there was more in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use in conjunction with my Aveya phytoceramides and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled! Much to my dismay,I was starting to get a little wrinkly place on my neck under the chin area. I started using this serum and the first thing I noticed was that it went on so smoothly. It smells like an orange, and it feels smooth, not greasy at all. I will buy this as for long as they sell it!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27; been using the vitamin c serum long, maybe about 2 weeks.  I am starting off only using once a day as I have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  It has not made my skin break out or cause any irritation which most vitamin c products have.  My skin seems to have a brighter look and I am noticing some tighting.  If I can say that after 2 weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after a month.</li>
    <li> This serum is absolutely awesome! It leaves my face feeling amazing! When. You first pump it, feels a little greasy but once you get it all in it soaks it right in. I have oily skin and that would be a problem but it works out great! I&#x27;m loving my results so far can&#x27;t wait to see it in the long run! It&#x27;s also a great amount of serum!!&lt;br /&gt;I receive my product for discounted or complimentary review</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It makes my skin soft and youthful, but not greasy. Do yourself a favor and buy it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to evaluate a product when you haven&#x27;t seen the results. I feel like I was being hounded to provide feedback when these products take time to note any difference. I wish Amazon or the company would ask about feedback 30 days after product purchase. Right now I have no clue!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a short time, but so far I&#x27;m going to be a repeat customer, I&#x27;m sure.  It is silky and wawrm going on with a nice scent.  It is not at all greasy and does leave my skin feeling softer and smoother.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams, serums and lotions, and I can honestly ssay this one is definitley one I&#x27;m glad I tried.  I&#x27;ll have to use it a while longer to see about the lightening of darks spots, and decreaseing of  wrinkles, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> The moment I put this serum on my face I knew I had finally found what my skin needed!  I simply love it and I will never be without it!</li>
    <li> I received my product in a very timely manner, I have only had a chance to use it 3 times so far, but am enjoying it thus far. It only takes a little bit to cover your whole face, which is nice. This is the first time that I have used a product like this, so far I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I really love how this product makes my skin feel. It also smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Better than expected!! My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I like the feel of the product on my face and it smells nice which is always a plus.  I really can&#x27;t say if it works or not since I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days.  Will come back in a month an update review</li>
    <li> This has a very unique feel to it.  When you do a pump/squirt, you have clear liquid in your hand and face.  But, almost instantly it soaks into the skin with a dry, non-greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this a few weeks, putting it around the eyes, under the eyes, and face and neck.  I have been appllying it only once a day, and of course, it may be a long time before I determine that it has \\&quot;kept me from aging\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful bottle, it looks nice in your bathroom or vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product free in order to supply a review.  .....Rizzo</li>
    <li> I recived my product...packaging very nice, bottle looks really nice. All though I belive you have to use a product for at least 2 weeks to notice improvement. This product feels very nice and smooth on the skin and the scent is very nice also. Will update my post in two weeks to see if I have any noticeable improvements.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my skin -- it feels so silky.  I have noticed my pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable but that&#x27;s about all.  I will give it a little longer to see if it helps with fine lines or not.</li>
    <li> OMG!! This stuff is amazing!!!!! I have been using for about 2 weeks now and I can see a definite improvement in my skin and I LOVE it!!! Highly recommend this product! My skin looks much younger than it did a couple of weeks ago. LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> great product ,  works very fine</li>
    <li> I am writing this review on behalf of my wife as she is using the product......She began using the serum the same afternoon she received a sample for review purposes. By evening she had noticed a difference. She used it on dark spots she has had on her jaw for years. (The spots were probably due to sun damage.) After the 2nd application those had begun to fade. She also uses the serum on her chest, where she also has many dark spots. She has seen a difference there as well. The serum has a less oily feel than other products of a similar nature. She has a lot of alleriges, and this doesn&#x27;t bother her at all. She also likes the fact that you apply this by pump. It strikes her as being more sanitary . She even likes the bottle and finds it aesthetically pleasing!</li>
    <li> I bought this back in August 2014.  I have combination to oil skin. Mostly T-zone, and the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about 10 days or so.  At first twice a day morning and night. then only night, then fully stop when I noticed my face have more bumps, not acne, just small bumps and those bumps itches.  So I stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;I did used Obagi Professional-C Serum 15%  before (bought direct from the Doctor clinic).  I remember it made my face tight and slightly dry the first few days, after that no problem, skin have less oil, and face smooth, that was it, no other skin reaction like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I was just too busy and too lazy to contact the company to get my money back, since I believe it was just my sensitive skin not agreed to the product.  I gave it to my friend she has normal to dry skin, and tell her my negative experiences and other reviews with positive experiences.  Since I did not think this is a bad batch&lt;br /&gt;Pro -  after putting on the serum, my face feel smooth, not oily, not dry, kind of silky smooth.  I loved the feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;  -  I believe the serum even out the oiliness so my face does not feel oily 2 hrs later, just smooth.&lt;br /&gt;  - The company (not Amazon) send email before I even receive the product, to tell me how to use it, and later email asked me how did I like it.&lt;br /&gt;  (I do not like to do review - bad of me! - so just ignored the company email.)&lt;br /&gt;  I like their customer service.  If the company take time to go over detail how to use it right and ck back to see how you are doing, then they do&lt;br /&gt;  care.&lt;br /&gt;  MY FRIEND - loved the product.  She said when her skin dry and flaky, this product help tone down the dryness.  She only used it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;  her skin does not feel silky smooth, but it has became less dry, no more flaky. We both believe it even out her skin tone too.&lt;br /&gt;Con - it gave me bumps and itchy skin after 1st day using it.  I toned it down, only use one a day all over face, still bumps, then only forehead and&lt;br /&gt;  nose, still bumps on forehead and on nostril.  When I stop completely, it took a few more wks for the bumps to completely faded away.&lt;br /&gt;  it gaved me quite a scare! I thought I will have these bumps for life!  This never happened before!&lt;br /&gt;  MY FRIEND- have no complain about the product.  only that it running low now...guess that is a hint for me to buy her another one!ps, then only forehead and&lt;br /&gt;  nose, still bumps on forehead and on nostril.

    <li> I&#x27;m older and am beyond my acne years. I generally don&#x27;t have a problem with it, but this made me break out all over my face, not just the t zone.</li>
    <li> I love this serum  my face looks so much brighter.. Ladies it is a winner!!! Price is right I have try more expensive serums and they did not work as good as this one.</li>
    <li> The product is really amazing. Love it!</li>
    <li> so far this seems to be working. It feels great on your skin and the spots are starting to fade. :)</li>
    <li> Within two weeks, I started getting bumps and lumps where the product was filling my pores.  After two more weeks, no difference in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I bought it for acne marks and a dark age spot. So far, it hasn&#x27;t made a difference in either of those. It does make your skin soft but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything great about it yet. I don&#x27;t like the dull matte appearance it leaves on your skin. Pure vitamin E oil works better.</li>
    <li> This is only day #2 of using this and I had to leave a comment. My skin was irritated from another product and I had no idea what to do. I ordered this hoping that it would help and it calmed my skin immediately. Amen! I have really sensitive skin and it seems to be more sensitive as I age and am no longer able to use products from the drug store. I will be back to update on my results but I am thankful to have found this product. This is also my first time using an anti aging product. I just turned 31.</li>
    <li> Works well but I don&#x27;t like the texture.  It has an oily feeling to it.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for several weeks now and I do not see any change in the age spots as yet.  The product itself has a very nice feel to it, leaving a very silky texture to the skin.</li>
    <li> After trying many products, I must say that I am actually amazed that this works.  I have used this for a month and the skin discolorations are pretty much gone.  The raised sun spots appear lighter, but I will give it more time to see how well this works on them.  But I am very happy with just having the discolorations gone.  I love the light scent, as well as the silky smooth feeling it leaves my skin. I had trouble finding a good moisturizer with sunscreen to apply over it and under my foundation, so I&#x27;m glad they came out with one.  That will be the next thing on my list to purchase.  Overall, this is a great product and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This product is great!  It goes on as a gel, but has a satin feel as it dries.  It is perfect for wear under makeup.  However, it does contain age defying acids that are beneficial to the skin, but make it more sensitive to the sunlight.  So what I do is apply a layer of sunscreen on top before applying my makeup.  The fragrance of this serum is delightful.  Not too strong, but very pleasant.  The fragrance reminds me of an orange creamsicle. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> I like this product quite a bit.  It glides on smoothly and does not leave an oily finish.  I really feel that it is improving some uneven skin tones.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and just placed an order for another.  It lasts about one month, I use it rather sparingly.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! It has a pleasant, yummy scent, which I like because I hate beauty products that have a nasty chemical odor. My skin instantly felt softer and hydrated. It&#x27;s only been a few days so it&#x27;s too soon to say much else. I&#x27;ll update my feedback when I have some long term results. So far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Feels great on and works as a primer too.  Nice citrus scent.  I have been using for about a month and notice my skin looks brighter over-all.</li>
    <li> I do love the feel of this Vit. C Serum.  I had ordered another popular Vit C Serum from Emagine but I like this formula even more.  Problem is now the cost of Vidi has increased from $30 to $35 - I decided that I would just use the other brand I get also from Amazon.  Same quantity but priced at $20 - so I did not reorder the Vidi Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Update July, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use a coupon from Vidi 3 Sigma. So I am again using this product and like it as much as before. The feel of this serum is incredible. Thank you, 3 Sigma</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I continually get compliments on how beautiful my skin is. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and have noticed a brighter complexion and even skin tone. I use it in the evening in combination with my NIA 24 moisturizer. LOVE IT! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have melasma on my face and some wringkles im using this over a month but I didn&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product.  It goes on easily and makes my skin feel smooth.  Time will tell if there will be a visible difference, but like anything it will take time, consistency in use, and patience.  Those looking for an instant fix will never find one!  Quick delivery was a bonus.</li>
    <li> I like the packaging and serum but havent really noticed any difference after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I have been using it on myself and on my boyfriend (who is not particularly familiar with sunscreen) for about a week or two. So far I love the glow both if our skin has. I would expect the results to continue to just get better and better. Love it so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using VIDI for about a month now and the result was excellent. I would definitely endorse VIDI to my friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> i like this product , and will buy again,</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It has a very silky texture to it.  I have been using it for about a month.  I haven&#x27;t had miraculous results, but I do think it&#x27;s working!  My skin is not super sensitive so any product I use does not really bother me.  This is very gentle and I like how it feels when applied.  I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> Goes on silky smooth, and a little goes a long way. Noticed a difference in my pores &amp; skin looks glows. This stuff is AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Best ever serum!  Within a month, my skin tone was even and sunspots were diminished.  Be patient and it will work!  I love the look of my skin without makeup.  It really does look fresher and younger.</li>
    <li> Love this Serum. Makes my skin feel smooth and tight..</li>
    <li> Great item.  Face feels clean as soon as you put it on.  Definitely buying again.</li>
