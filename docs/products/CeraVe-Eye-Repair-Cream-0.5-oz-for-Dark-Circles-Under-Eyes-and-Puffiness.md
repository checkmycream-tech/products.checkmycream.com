      <li>I love this stuff :-)</li>
      <li>I am very picky about my face/eye cream and a friend told me how great this product was.  </li>
      <li>However, I also am not attempting to use it more then once a day because of this effect, just as a precaution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this eye cream and all CeraVe products.</li>
      <li>CeraVe is great, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
      <li>I feel this helps my eyes look more youthful and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Makes me feel a bit better anyway.</li>
      <li>but I love both of them.</li>
      <li>I am truly in love with these CeraVe creams.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best eye cream at any price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s having a great effect on my crows feet. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye repair cream is wonderful.  I noticed a difference the first day I used it.  I was using a very expensive eye cream, and was not getting the same results.  It is fantastic and for such a great price.  Wow!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent ingredients but it has a dry texture and needs to be used as repair serum in addition to moisturizer under the eyes rather than a stand alone eye cream. At least for me, it is not moisturizing enough but I love the ingredients which are known to repair so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought this upon recommendation on Paula&#x27;s Choice Beautypedia site. I don&#x27;t have much problem with dark circles or wrinkles, but this does help with puffiness, which sometimes happens if I don&#x27;t get enough sleep. I feel this helps my eyes look more youthful and refreshed. I use both morning and night for about 3 months now. It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced, around $14 at most, and can be found at most drugstores. There are often BOGO 1/2 off sales and I will stock up. Great tube packaging as well.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and have tried very expensive department store eye creams but this one works just as well! Plus it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve entered my late 30s and started developing crow&#x27;s feet and a little crepiness on my eyelids, I&#x27;ve realized I should probably do more for my skin. I was skeptical about the possible results, but decided this cream was worth a try because it&#x27;s so affordable. I&#x27;m actually shocked: I&#x27;ve been using it for for one day, and my eyelids already look noticeably smoother. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it works over time!</li>
    <li> Has gotten rid of my under eye circles and makes me look refreshed. My boyfriend even noticed a difference. I love this stuff :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I read that it was good for eczema or dry skin. I was very disappointed after only a couple of uses I could see that it didn&#x27;t moiterize my eyes at all! At least it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes but not only I won&#x27;t be buying this again but I stopped using it after a couple of days because it was too drying... I have now found a natural and organic eye cream that I&#x27;m so happy with called Beefriendly!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, it makes my eyes feel moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. I have shed 10 years so far I figure.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner. I&#x27;ve used it several times. It&#x27;s good a keeping my under eyes hydrated but other than that nor big changes so far.</li>
    <li> Best price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Good but not great eye cream.  But what is a great one?  Haven&#x27;t found one yet.</li>
    <li> rich and luxurious for such a low cost product! non-greasy, even under makeup and very fast absorbing. I like that it reduces puffiness while moisturizing without being super expensive. Comparable products from big name beauty brands are easily twice this price!</li>
    <li> I switched to this from Burt&#x27;s Bees and so far I LOVE it (been about a month.)  Eyes are well hydrated, and it&#x27;s not sticky at all, blends in easily.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the CeraVe products! I use the eye cream and the SA renewing cream. Ceramides really do the job along with a good retinoid product. I use along with Philosophy retinoid pads and retinoid eye cream. I also take Sports Research brand Phyto Ceramide pills and have had amazing results!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the niacinamide, which is listed first in the ingredient panel (after water). The CeraVe PM Facial Moisurtizing Lotion, which I love, has the same ingredient listed third, so I&#x27;m using this in its place, all over my face. Yeah, it ends up being way more expensive (this is half an ounce and the PM lotion is three ounces), but I wanted the higher concentration of niacinamide, as that&#x27;s the important ingredient that does the work. It&#x27;s not easy finding unscented products and one&#x27;s without things like sodium hydroxide that sting like crazy, but the CeraVe products are effective, don&#x27;t irritate, and aren&#x27;t scented. I&#x27;m a devotee.</li>
    <li> Could get into it! But I&#x27;ll probably start buying it from walmart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m changing my previous 3-star review to 5-stars. When I first started using this product my under eye concealer didn&#x27;t stay on well. Now that I&#x27;ve let the Cerave under eye cream absorb well before concealer application, it&#x27;s awesome! Not only have I seen a dramatic improvement of my under eye dryness, but it has improved the puffiness and has started to smoothe my fine lines! Cerave may be a tad higher in price, but it lasts a long time and the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. It is my third one. Great value. You can see a difference as soon as it is applied. I like the consistency and absorbability.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream. I had head good things about this brand and wanted to try it. My favorite is still Clinique&#x27;s All About Eyes, but, for the price, this is a good alternative. Doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> Great for use at night before bed time.</li>
    <li> CeraVe is great, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. I&#x27;ll stick with the regular lotion.</li>
    <li> Great basic eye cream. Right price and packed with proven moisturizers. I use it mornings and nights. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It felt ok on my eyes but didn&#x27;t see any improvement in puffiness or lines. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product works well for the eye area, it moisturizes very well and does slightly and temporarily reduce puffiness, I cannot speak to dark circles because even though I am 49 years old, I have never had to deal with that problem, knock on wood.  One note, a little goes a long way, the first time I used it, I squeezed too much out, so use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream and works great</li>
    <li> This product did seem to help with my dark circles, but with taking them away, this stuff gave me milia under my eyes. I would&#x27;ve rather had dark circles that I could cover with concealer than have little bumps under my eye that still show. I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eye creams and to be honest, I dont see any difference from one to the other.  This one does have good consistency and no weird smell, so thats a plus</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing! Not sure it&#x27;s really helping much with lines or dark circles yet but definitely like the creaminess.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much more than keep under eye area hydrated. Hydrated under eyes is important so, that was nice. As for working any miracles. Nope.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it is cheaper than my normal eye cream. It did not work for me but I still use the face wash and moisturizer from this brand.</li>
    <li> It has done absolutely nothing for my dark bags under my eyes but mostly because it&#x27;s probably my own genetics. However, the consistently and the value is great and I am sure it is benefiting my skin positively in some way, just not cosmetically. I purchased this along with the CeraVe SA Renewing Lotion and surprisingly it really has FIXED the dots my upper arms so I highly recommend that !!!</li>
    <li> I have never used an eye cream consistently before, mainly out of laziness but also because they often feel thick and I don&#x27;t particularly like the feeling of lotion on my face.  This is very lightweight, has no smell, and is more tolerable than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve been using it pretty consistently for a few weeks- I don&#x27;t think I see any significant improvement, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and see no visible change in my under eye darkness problem.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this eye cream it is the only thing I am currently using, I&#x27;ve thrown out all other products. Anyone who suffers from eczema or allergic reactions to products should try this. It took a little while but skin around my eyes almost back to normal and won&#x27;t be using any other products and have started using just CeraVe products.</li>
    <li> Granted, I&#x27;m under 30, so maybe this is not the product for me, but I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and other eye creams.  However,  this is a pretty good bang for your buck, and it does absorb into the skin pretty nicely.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. It is very moisturizing and not irritating. I use Proactive for my skin care and I was having a problem that when I put some eye creams on they would burn. I think it was just a reaction with the proactive cause when I put the eye cream on first and then the proactive there was no burning. Some eye creams caused the entire area to be red. But I will be honest, for some reason I can&#x27;t remember to put the eye cream on first so I need an eye cream that doesn&#x27;t burn.  Anyway. I don&#x27;t have dark circles or crow&#x27;s feet (I am only 33) but I was starting to develop some deep wrinkles under the eye and I think it&#x27;s because my skin is dry from the benzoyl peroxide. This really helped with that.  The wrinkles under my eye are softening. The cream feels good and it isn&#x27;t greasy. I will keep buying it. The amount you get for the price and how much you need to use is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year. While it DOES make my dark under eye areas a little less dark and puffy, it will never, ever fully get rid of them. But no product will, as the problem I have is due to allergies, also known as &amp;#34;allergic shiners&amp;#34;. However, I really like this eye cream because it&#x27;s fine for my ridiculously sensitive skin, first and foremost. Also, it&#x27;s un-scented, smooth and a little goes a very long way! It does a good job with crow&#x27;s feet in the corners of my eyes, by softening the lines and making them less noticeable. I honestly haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else, like laugh lines or whathaveyou, but I might try it just to see what happens. What could it hurt, really? I do recommend this. Also, the shipping from the seller was amazingly fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Does not reduce or prevent puffy under eye bags</li>
    <li> Maybe it does the trick, maybe not. Certainly lacks the feel of hydration or delicate enough for eye area. Pretty unimpressive.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! I used to use Clinique Eye Repair Creme, a luxury expense I had to replace every month or two. I found this CeraVe eye product very similar in terms of hydration, and the container is great to contain the flow of application (not too much waste). It also fits nicely in my small makeup pouch. It&#x27;s a great product for its purpose and for my budget.</li>
    <li> great product and plan re-order</li>
    <li> Causes excessive itching/burning sensation in eyes so I have to stop using it.  Have no idea what the fuss is about with this brand.  Does anyone actually believe that a minuscule amount of this or any similarly priced (do you notice how all eye moisturizers seem to magically cost around 9.99 to 11.99?) product will magically make wrinkles disappear around your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find a facial moisturizer that works on your face without causing annoyance from aromas or greasiness, then I recommend you apply a bit more near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using LUBRIDERM Men&#x27;s 3 in 1 body, face, and post shave lotion - fragrance free 16OZ for after shaving.  It&#x27;s ok, but most importantly it doesn&#x27;t annoy me like this Cerave product.  I also use and recommend Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce, for hands and body.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye cream that I&#x27;ve tried that absorbs quickly into the skin around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or white residue. I think it has definitely made the skin around my eyes less dry, and the fine wrinkles forming at my eyes edges look slightly less prominent. I don&#x27;t think this has improved the dark rings around my eyes, but they haven&#x27;t gotten worse either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this 2X a day, and it works well under makeup. I&#x27;ve also gotten my boyfriend into this, and he swears it helps his dark circles, so who knows!</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin/eyes love this cream.  CeraVe is&lt;br /&gt;-a trusted product for sensitive skin, recommended by my dermatologist and many others,&lt;br /&gt;-loaded with the ceramides that restore skin&#x27;s natural skin barrier,&lt;br /&gt;-has hyalauranic acid that pumps moisture to the surface of skin.&lt;br /&gt;-is anti-aging in that it is highly and deeply moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped buying anti-aging, plumping creams when I realized, moisture is the key to anti-aging (well, moisture, sunscreen and a healthy lifestyle).  This is very moisturizing, reasonably priced, and won&#x27;t sting my eyes or cause an allergic reaction, as other eye creams have done.&lt;br /&gt;Remember not to stretch the skin around your eyes when applying eye cream or makeup.</li>
    <li> Typically love CeraVe products, but this one doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything.  It goes on easily, if a little waxy, but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s having any moisturizing effect.  Very disappointing, especially since I stopped using a product that was having good results, to try this.  Can&#x27;t wait until the tube is empty.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the retail price in most drug stores but Amazon offered this very reasonably priced. My dermatologist suggested I try this as a daily moisturizer because my eye area was very dry after a bout with eczema.&lt;br /&gt;I applied a few dots around the eye area sort of dabbing this in. The results weren&#x27;t overwhelming at first, but after 3-4 days the area looked both softer, smoother, and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;My eye area has taken a real beating during my eczema attack. It was a brilliant red at one point and was so inflamed that it had started to swell and then crack. The entire area from the lids to eyebrows as well as the surrounding area was fairly awful and when it all subsided the skin began peeling. I am not certain where I am going with this, but I have pretty much returned to normal in respect to my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;If you are experiencing very dry skin around your eyes this may help.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. I don&#x27;t really find that any eye creams work all that much for dark circles or puffiness, but I really needed some moisture under my eyes and this does just that.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I bought this because of the low price, to hold me over until I found something I really liked. That was the plan-- turns out, I REALLY like this stuff! I&#x27;ll be ordering my second tube soon!</li>
    <li> This is awesome lotion, this brand is recommended by my dermatologist</li>
    <li> I did not like it because it burns my eyes. They get red and puffy. Not sure what causes such reaction, but I will not be using this product.</li>
    <li> I prefer this to other fancy eye creams (even Chanel) - it works great and is perfect for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Love love live this! My eyes look younger and more vibrant than ever!!!</li>
    <li> The only eye cream I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t cause tiny pimples.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It stays moist without being sticky or oily.  Like the list of ingredients, and also that it&#x27;s non fragrance.  The price is the real kicker!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!! The facial wash and moisturizing cream is on point if you have dry skin. I highly recommend this product because my dermatologist recommended it to me. It has done great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am already a big fan of CeraVe facial cream, and so I decided to give the eye cream a try as well.  So far, it feels wonderful, and the nozzle opening is so slender, allowing the bottle to release only adequate amount.  I am truly in love with these CeraVe creams.  My face feels taught and the color is even.</li>
    <li> Good eye cream. Absorbs very well. Works for me.</li>
    <li> just got it, not sure working or not</li>
    <li> I like it. I use several products combined on my face for fresher look. I&#x27;m a guy in my fifties, lines are present, but this stuff helps to minimize a bit, over, and under, the eyes. Crowsfeet too. Makes me feel a bit better anyway. Lines are here to stay, but a few relatively inexpensive products like this help a lot for temporary lessoning. Eye repair, skin serum, moisturizer, and cover concealer for slightly darker areas, especially at inner and outer corners of eyes, will help men to look wide awake, fresh, a bit younger, and still completely natural. DO IT.</li>
    <li> Love it... makes a big difference in my complexion....after using it, the wrinkles around my eyes diminish.</li>
    <li> clean, fragrant free, simple white cream, works well, I love it.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works just fine.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for a good portion of my life and my dermatologist recommended other CeraVe products which I use most of the time (they are somewhat pricey so I will usually wait for a good sale) and I ran across their eye cream.  I have been using it for almost 6 months and while it hasn&#x27;t turned back time I do notice a small difference and my the skin around my eyes is always hydrated.</li>
    <li> It is ok,no miracles.I will try the Diva one and let u know how that is.Just received other day.</li>
    <li> A big portion as eye creams</li>
    <li> I was already a fan of the face wash and moisturizer, so I thought I would give this a try! It&#x27;s very lightweight and absorbs quickly. Can&#x27;t wait to see if it&#x27;s as great as the rest of the line!</li>
    <li> The funny thing about eye creams is that there is no miracle potion... although we look here and look there and we hope and we try. Maybe one day there will be something that will knock our socks off and truly banish the years and tired eyes \\&quot;aged\\&quot; look. Maybe?  Until then, I am hoping and trying. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CeraVe Eye Repair Cream is extremely good for the price and quality. This is worth the try.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s good for hydrating the dry eye skin and wind burned skin conditions- thus making the under eye skin look smooth.  I do not have dark circles very often- only when I really have no sleep for days. But I feel that when my skin is properly hydrated my skin does look more luminous. And when I have dry skin that is making under eye lines this product will hydrate that skin to make those lines decrease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into the skin superbly and it really does seem to moisturize the sensitive eye area. To assist in skin hydration it is also beneficial to try to drink more pure water daily- as I have to remind myself to do this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no perfume or chemical smell to this. I wear it and I did not get any skin sensitivity reaction. When I am wearing it there is NO obvious sheen. There is NO pilling and peeling up of this product under my makeup.  Other under eye products I have used in the past have left me with a glazed shiny look under the eye or it peels up when wearing something over it looking like a severe case of eye junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CeraVe Eye Repair Cream seems to really get absorbed by the skin and not just lay on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison products- with problematic \\&quot;product pilling\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;EltaMD Renew Eye Gel may be helpful for relief of dark circles more than moisturizing. I bought it and used it but I would not buy it again. I did not love the eye gel because it does not moisturize, it seems to dehydrates my under eye and it pills up (clumpy little bits) if touched or makeup applied over. I also purchased the renew gel for a friend and it seemed to helped lessen the dark circles under his eyes (I noticed it a lot less). My main dissatisfaction with the Elta MD Eye Repair clumps up if touched and its not good under make-up so its better for sleeping/night use.

This product does not seem to get absorbed at all...it leaves a film that I can feel under my eye.

    <li> Really excellent cream. My skin is combination and this doesn&#x27;t break me out, while making my skin so soft.  and it has SPF! I love it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working okay. Good price.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes tear after a few hours.</li>
    <li> First of all, this tube is .5 ounces, which is quite little. But there is actually a lot of product in there. I used one tube twice a day for abut 3 months before I ran out. So I would say that it is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not under any misconceptions about eye creams. I know that they can&#x27;t cure dark eye circles or unsightly fat deposits. I mostly look for under eye creams that are a bit thicker to hydrate the area well and keep it plump. And this was just fine for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I think this cream is very solid. Ceramides and hyaluronic acid are great ingredients for the skin. I would say the texture is definitely heavier than the Cerave cream in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then only reason that I&#x27;m leaving the review at 4 stars is because near the end of the tube, it became very hard to squeeze out. And I had to struggle with that for a couple mornings.</li>
    <li> Not enough moisturizing for me</li>
    <li> After months of use, the area around my eyes are still dark and dry.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, prone to dryness even on my undereye and eye lids. This eye cream firms and moisturizes for sure! I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and like it!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is better at bringing down puffiness.</li>
    <li> great product for the price, very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have very dry and sensitive skin, and this hydrates without irritating. I usually use a teeny tiny amount for under my eyes and it plumps the area up. In the dead of winter I also put some on my extra flaky patches of skin across my face for relief.</li>
    <li> Love the texture of this eye cream! Rivals much more expensive creams. I can&#x27;t say that I see outstanding results, but it feels great.</li>
    <li> good for dryness around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream better than anything that I have tried before. Although Iv inherited puffy eyes it still helps I use it twice a day morning and night.</li>
    <li> this product has fixed my dark circles and smoothed out the skin under my eyes..</li>
    <li> CeraVe eye cream is a fantastic value.  My under eye area is incredibly dry and this cream does a fantastic job of moisturizing.  I use it morning and night.  It really helps smooth my skin so my concealer doesn&#x27;t cake.  Love that it comes in a tube instead of a tub.  This is a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I learned about cerave products from my derm. I needed a night cream after applying retin-a which can be drying the first few weeks. So I heard about this eye cream and decided to try it out. When I apply it, I mix it with argan oil but so far it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m 26 so I can&#x27;t really give you much information on if it helps with really bad wrinkles but it IS moisturizing. I gave it 4 stars bc it stings a bit when first applying it but it goes away after a few seconds.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive but it&#x27;s not as moistening for a night cream.</li>
    <li> I got this because Paula&#x27;s Choice made it sound like a great eye cream for very cheap. Nothing mind blowing but it is a good eye cream with great ingredients. Definitely very much worth the money. Probably won&#x27;t suit those people with super dry skin.</li>
    <li> works great my doctor recommended it</li>
    <li> It does what it say&#x27;s on the tin</li>
    <li> As expected, prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Not seeing any real difference in my eye area. It feels nice and thick, but I have used better eye creams. Okay for the price.</li>
    <li> I have three huge drawers full of creams, serus, gels, lotions, you name it! I look at all the reviews before buying and usually wind up dissapointed anyways! I went to CVS and bought this. Didn&#x27;t research it first though. I happen to see it had hyaluronic acid while I was browsing the isle and I had used that before and loved it. So I figured if this had it, then it couldn&#x27;t be bad. It&#x27;s wonderful! It has no smell and goes on really nice. Not greasy. It absorbs great but still leaves your eye area moisturized. At night I use Retina that I got from my doctor which dries you out. Then in the morning when I wake up and wash my face, I put this under and around my eyes. Give it a minute before applying your makeup. I use powder make up and it works great! Don&#x27;t know how it does with cream or liquid make up. But it smooths out my lines under my eyes. I don&#x27;t have crows feet but I have lines under my eyes. I don&#x27;t sleep well so they look horrible sometimes and this smoothes them out nicely!! This has replaced my expensive eye products other than the Retina at night.</li>
    <li> Love CeraVe products.  I use the baby Shampoo and Body wash regularly since its gentle and kind to my aging skin.  This eye repair cream has definitely helped with my eye bags (like conditioning your leather carry on?). It&#x27;ll be in my regular regime.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Potent. Inexpensive. Fragrance Free. Absorbs quickly. Not sticky or tacky. This helps smooth out, soften, &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; and generally comfort the skin all around my eyes--especially the &amp;#34;beginning to crinkle now that I&#x27;m not young 30s anymore&amp;#34; skin under my lower lash line. Half a pea sized amount twice a day does the trick. Glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Works great goes on smooth</li>
    <li> Good but probably no better than the other lotions and creams by CeraVe.  Don&#x27;t think it is &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; anything special.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I have eczema and get it around my eyes so my eyelids and under my eyes get very dry and flakey.  After using this, the fine lines and dryness instantly decreased.</li>
    <li> I received Saturday, and I see a difference already!  Very hydrating!</li>
    <li> I like this no-frills eye repair cream! It is non-greasy, goes on smoothly and readily absorbed.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of eyecream and CeraVe Repair Cream is the best of them all.</li>
    <li> Love it. It really helps with the bags under my eyes. I received a number of complements on how good my skin looked</li>
    <li> Okay, well, I love the CeraVe products and feel they are all good and contain ingredients that promote good skin care.  I&#x27;ve been using the eye cream just a short while, so I will give it more time.  It seems fine, no overnight miracles, but the cost is definitely reasonable and you can take this tube traveling with you, a real plus!  When your tubes get low, use a utility knife or scissors to cut them open and you will find a lot more of the product inside.  I then put this into a small container with a lid and it goes a long way.  No need to just toss them out when the tube seems empty.</li>
    <li> great for eye area, use day under make up and at night after cleansing off make up...not greasy and the price&lt;br /&gt;is great.</li>
    <li> Comes highly recommended from Paula Begoun and her site paulaschoice.  No daily use cosmetic has a miraculous effect, but it does do what it says for my 48 year-old skin.  Fragrance free.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about my face/eye cream and a friend told me how great this product was.  For the price I decided it was worth it and I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream!  Second time I&#x27;ve ordered.  Not greasy.  Eyes feel soft and refreshed after application.</li>
    <li> Really great eye cream at a sensible price point.  This luxuriously moisturizing for a less expensive brand.  I&#x27;ve tried them all - both high and low end - and this stuff is pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> Good product, I need to continue to use this before I say I have gotten any resultls.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic state-of-the-art eye cream, loaded with skin identical ingredients and antioxidants, in an air tight tube!  It moisturizes and soothes my eye area without stinging or burning, and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes.  I only wish it came in a bigger tube.  However, nothing in this formulation, or any eye cream for that matter, can reduce puffiness or dark circles.  The only thing that can do that is your plastic surgeon!</li>
    <li> Worked surprisingly well for me! I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and only recently experienced the need to do something around my eye area. I already am using other CeraVe products (I have sensitive combination skin and this line really does the job), so i&#x27;ve figured i&#x27;ll give the eye cream a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest i didn&#x27;t expect a whole a lot beyond some xtra moisturizing. To my surprise and delight the puffiness and lines were noticeably reduced after the very first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply it in the AM. There is a little light &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; i feel immediately after application, especially if I was a bit more agressive removing eye makup the previous night, but it goes away quickly and doesn&#x27;t produce any visible irritation. However, I also am not attempting to use it more then once a day because of this effect, just as a precaution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I do not need any intense help with my eyes (yet), but rather a fine tuning this product seems perfect in its price range.</li>
    <li> Terrific eye cream.  Keeps skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> As far as eye creams go it feels great and seems to work well.  I am not fond of the tube style container but for the price I can live with it.  I love the product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product..diminishes the puffy dark ur les!</li>
    <li> My daughter, an internist, told me the dermatologist friend of hers recommended this for her use. I does seem to lighten dark circles and does reduce puffiness. Also very gentle around the eyes.</li>
    <li> very good. nothing like a miracle, but it mosturizes very well and have a good amount of antioxidant in it. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Hi, did not notice much of difference - been using it for few weeks now.</li>
    <li> Non-irritating, easy glide-on product to keep my eye area moisturized. I&#x27;ve struggled with sensitive skin around my eyes and many special eye area formulations cause redness and make my eyes puffy. This product is fluid and contains no drying alcohol, fragrance, or heaviness to make my eyes puffy in the morning. I won&#x27;t go without it now that I found it.</li>
    <li> Love the way this has helped the dry skin around my eyes!</li>
    <li> I liked it very well. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;Teresa Reasor</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for eyes ,i like it.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell any difference in this product and some similar ones out there on the market.  Personally, I prefer Neutrogena&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> This products really does heal your skin. I had sun damage to my eyelid. I developed cancer there two times. Had it removed both times. A dermatologist told me to use this cream and when I went back to the eye doctor, he told me my eyelid skin was completely clear. I had developed blemitis there and this cream cleared it up completely.</li>
    <li> I get dry patches on my eyelids. This is the first eye cream I have used that got rid of the dry skin.</li>
    <li> probably an excellent cream but something in the ingredient appeared to irritate my eyes after applying.</li>
    <li> CerVe makes fantastic moisturizing products on a budget. I&#x27;m not sure this is any better than the regular cream but I love both of them.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Love the dispenser because you only squeeze out what you need, minimizing contamination of the whole product.</li>
    <li> The best I have used I think. Goes on nicely, absorbs right away. Easy to use and good results.</li>
    <li> This product stings!  After four or five attempts  to use it, I retreated to my go to product of Cetaphil moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream and all CeraVe products.</li>
    <li> It is the best!  The price is reasonable and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about a month and so far the only difference I note is a slight increase in firmness under the eye;no change in dark circles, bags, or wrinkles. It is also not quite moisturizing enough so I have to add another eye moisturizer on top of it. I shall finish the tube and see if any differences occur with more time.</li>
    <li> This product helps appearance of skin with sun damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over a month now but haven&#x27;t noticed any changes. That being said I&#x27;ve tried a few eye creams with a variable price tag and none showed much result. Will finish the tube and continue my search.</li>
    <li> This was recommended my my dermatologist and I like it so far :)</li>
