<li> The flavor doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> By the way back then it was five cents a pack along with a lot of other candy and gum.</li>
<li> Can be found in local gas stations sometimes but usually costs $1.00 to $1.25 per pack</li>
<li> but too bad they don&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> There are probably not many people who would like this gum, it has an acquired taste, almost perfummy.  </li>
<li> The drawback is that your mouth will be purple followed by magenta for at least a day.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not allow to have those artificial sweetners for health reason.  </li>
<li> bad breath.</li>

    <li> I used to chew this many years ago back in the days of the local candy tobacco store. When that went by way of the kooky bird and before the internet it was a lost forever item.  By the way back then it was five cents a pack along with a lot of other candy and gum. The price is higher now but at least it is available. Enjoy the product and will re-order in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it! Reminds me of my childhood!</li>
    <li> I made purchase of this 24 Choward Scented Gum 24 each, It arrived very fast and well packed.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this on several occasions and always enjoy the sweet taste it offers.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this gum to anyone that desires a sweet taste.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable and this gum is hard to find in our town and only a few stores have it.&lt;br /&gt;ThankYou.</li>

    <li> This is the best gum, love the subtle flavor ... Not sweet or minty at all. Can be found in local gas stations sometimes but usually costs $1.00 to $1.25 per pack so this is a DEAL</li>
    <li> This gum has a unique flavor. Kind of a &amp;#34;violet&amp;#34; taste. It&#x27;s different, but very tasty. Will buy it again.</li>

    <li> I love this company&#x27;s violet candies and peppermints, and bought this gum thinking for some reason that it would taste like the violet candy.  It really does not--it reminds me of clove gum, but with a more subtle and complex flavor.  The flavor doesn&#x27;t last long and I generally chew all 8 pieces from a package at once.  I like it, but wish that they would also make gum in the violet flavor.</li>
    <li> Flavor is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I rather have the candy.</li>
    <li> This is the best gum for refreshing one&#x27;s breath.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager.  So glad I was able to find it.  Most gums in the stores today have zorbitol or xylitol and I&#x27;m not allow to have those artificial sweetners for health reason.  I&#x27;m so glad to find a gum that is made with sugar.</li>
    <li> There are probably not many people who would like this gum, it has an acquired taste, almost perfummy.  I remember my grandfather chewing this gum and he never had that &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; bad breath.</li>
