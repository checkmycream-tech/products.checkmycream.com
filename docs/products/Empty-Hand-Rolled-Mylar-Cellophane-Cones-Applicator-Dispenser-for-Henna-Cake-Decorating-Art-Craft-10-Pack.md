    <li> Great Great Great!&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find better ones!</li>
    <li> Aplicators are very big and have very incisive points. It is very easy to drew using them. I like it</li>
    <li> Cones were longer than I expected, and I had to cut it shorter when using for henna. Very fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> it advertised it as filled henna cones, then gave me empty ones and they aren&#x27;t even the same color! I mean, what the hell?!</li>
    <li> Will not buy these again. The color in the mylar crumbled off staining my hands. They were also not sturdy.</li>
    <li> S***ty. Leak everywhere. Dont purchase.</li>
    <li> Worth not rolling my own, but you do need to add extra tape</li>
    <li> They leak a bit.  Gets frustrating.</li>
    <li> The cones kept their shape during shipping, very pleased</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t rolled tight</li>
    <li> Well made and performed as expected.  Just wish they were a little smaller.</li>
    <li> Really hard to get the henna into the cones</li>
    <li> These were perfect and worked very well!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend buying these cones. They came fast, look exactly like the picture, and work very well! I was initially worried that they would be flattened in the mail, but they had been stuffed with paper so the tips were still looking great!</li>
    <li> Love these henna cones, they are so pretty.</li>
    <li> The other reviews were very misleading, they came shipped in an envelope... FLAT! And they are basicalled made out of a plastic bag. I was so let down when i saw that was what I bought.. Not worth the money, the henna was so hard to get in considering how flimsy the cone was.. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for someone. It&#x27;s of no use to me. Don&#x27;t take my rating in to consideration</li>
    <li> I normally use bottles but I decided to try out cones and so I came upon these. The arrived in less than a week and I loveee them!!! Absolutely in love they are obviously easier to use than the bottles because I can actually hold it like a pencil and you can actually use all of the henna. For bottles, it hurts my hand even when the bottle is still 3/4 full. Rolling up the cone is extremely thin and easy! You cut up the tip to your desirable length. Although they are not reusable, definitely going to buy more!!!</li>
