<li> The strips are bigger than shown on the package so it might take a few tries to apply and re-adjust, but this does not affect the stickiness of the strips.  </li>
<li> The reason that I decided to try them is because the area underneath my eyes is always dry and flaky and any moisturizer that I have used in the past didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
<li> They seem to give a little bit of a glow under my eyes.</li>
<li> They instantly give off a cooling sensation and aren&#x27;t annoying to leave on overnight which is how I normally use them.  </li>
<li> not sure whether my product expires</li>
<li> Usually keep it on about 45 minutes and eyes looked refreshed.</li>

    <li> This product works well!!! Have reordered them many times.  Usually keep it on about 45 minutes and eyes looked refreshed.</li>

    <li> comfortable for my eyes</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye masks for over 5 years now. It was very easy to peal and and moisture for the eye areas. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I have used these several times. They really help the wrinkles!  The effect is temporary but I did not expect a miracle. You can sleep in them with no problem.</li>
    <li> Love DHC products... Having sensitive skin, DHC is the only thing I can and will use.. These patches are a girls best friends.. Pampering myself after applying a mask with them, gives me that complete glow and freashes skin in an instant..</li>

    <li> I love these better than any other moisturizing eye strip. They stay on, have the fabric backing (so I can wear an eye mask to keep them in place at night while I sleep), etc. I will definitely be buying more! I put my eye moisturizer on, then toss these on over it for the extra punch of moisture and max absorption.</li>
