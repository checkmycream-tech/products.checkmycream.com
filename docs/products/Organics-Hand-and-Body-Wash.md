      <li>If I thought it was no longer a favorite but bearable, I would have just used up the bottle I opened.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, I would rather avoid it until theres more information regarding its safety.</li>
      <li>:) This preservative is found in a lot of &amp;#34;paraben free&amp;#34; lotions.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is NOT a greasy lotion, in fact it rubs in faster than most</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a shame because I genuinely loved this lotion and always received enthusiastic compliments about it.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, although the scent does fade a bit quickly.</li>
      <li>I received this lotion as a gift, and was excited about it because I love the scent of chai tea.</li>
      <li>The scent reminds me of the warm vanilla sugar products from bath and body works, but with a bit of spice that isn&#x27;t exactly chai spice.</li>
      <li>The lotion is a light brown which might be off putting to some</li>
      <li>Very intoxicating and warm.</li>
      <li>It was so strong and sweet</li>
      <li>The best part is that it is one of the few organic lotions that does NOT contain phenoxyethanol!</li>
      <li>Earth friendly product too.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was funny that it says &amp;#34;uplifting&amp;#34; on the tube, but the scent is so nice that it actually does put me in a good mood.</li>
      <li>Dessert essence is absolutely my favorite lotion, but I highly recommend that you avoid the Vanilla chai flavor.</li>
      <li>overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think the quality was worth the money, either.</li>
      <li>But the actual lotion has a very strong, very perfume-y scent that doesn&#x27;t bear a strong resemblance to chai.</li>
      <li>The texture of the lotion was fine, but I ended up not being able to wear it due to the scent.</li>
      <li>This is a very reasonably priced organic product.  </li>
      <li>Looks like it will be sticky, but it&#x27;s not and it make my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Vanilla chai&lt;br /&gt;Great light natural lotion.  </li>
      <li>It smells exactly like its name..</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion!</li>
      <li>Everyone is different so, who knows you may love it.</li>
      <li>It also seems to hold up well to winter, my hands feels nice and soft and I use it only in the morning and at night.</li>
      <li>And major A+ to them for being cruelty free.</li>
      <li>This is on the lower end price range for products that meet all these standards, but it absolutely doesn&#x27;t seem like a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; product.</li>
      <li>It really does smell just like a frothy chai latte.</li>
      <li>In a day, using gloves and this lotion, her hands were much improved.</li>
      <li>It rubs in easily with a light fragrance that is definitely not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s time to find something new!</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly so there is no greasy or waxy film left on your hands.</li>
      <li>It is one of my favorite little luxuries.</li>
      <li>In two days they were normal again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy feeling, and it&#x27;s a nice thick cream.</li>
      <li>The bottles I received have \\&quot;new fragrance\\&quot; printed on them, but that is not indicated online.</li>
      <li>list of ingredients given on the Amazon listing must be for the almond scent as they are completely different than what is on the packaging on the Spicy Vanilla so for those of you who are interested here goes:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
      <li>But when you rub it in it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to see that the lotion was brown, but I guess that makes sense because it has Chai in it.  </li>
      <li>Oil * Natural Fragrance/Flavor * Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba)</li>
      <li>The chai notes are much heavier and the vanilla is almost entirely overtaken by the spiciness.</li>
      <li>A nice thick cream that hydrates well, especially after a shower.</li>
      <li>Although I had used it briefly before this was the first time I had used it extensively.</li>
      <li>While this preservative only got a 4 on skin deep, there is limited data available regarding its safety and that data is conflicting.</li>
      <li>The scent of the new bottle was much stronger and sweeter than I had expected.  </li>
      <li>Because I love drinking chai, I tried Vanilla chai, it was not a good idea at all.</li>
      <li>Also, the color of the lotion has changed from a neutral off-white/cream color to a light brown, which might not matter, but the sheen left behind seems distinctly shinier to me compared to some of the old formula I have left.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t feel much difference compared to other lotion I have used</li>
      <li>it actually made me feel kind of ill.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve used from this company and I will definitely be trying their other products!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When your hubby tells you your legs look like lizard scales it is time to get out the lotion! (Hee Hee!) I have had this lotion for a couple months but I had put in our travel trailer to use when we travel. Although I had used it briefly before this was the first time I had used it extensively. LOVE IT! The lotion is a light brown which might be off putting to some but rest assured it doesn&#x27;t dye your skin! It rubs in easily with a light fragrance that is definitely not overwhelming. An hour later, the scent is still on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a greasy lotion, in fact it rubs in faster than most I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients given on the Amazon listing must be for the almond scent as they are completely different than what is on the packaging on the Spicy Vanilla so for those of you who are interested here goes:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Leaf  (Aloe Vera) Juice * Camellia Sinensis (Black Tea) Leaf Extract * Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter * SD Alcohol 38-B * Glycerin (Palm) * Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters * Jojoba Esters * Stearic Acid (Coconut) * Cetyl Alcohol (Coconut) * Leuconostoc Radish Root Ferment Filtrate * Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil * Natural Fragrance/Flavor * Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil * Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Fruit Extract * Tocopherol (Vit E) * Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract * Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract * Eugenia Caryophyllata (Clovebud) Oil * Limonene * Xanthan Gum * Sodium Phytate * Water</li>
    <li> I received this lotion as a gift, and was excited about it because I love the scent of chai tea. But the actual lotion has a very strong, very perfume-y scent that doesn&#x27;t bear a strong resemblance to chai. It was so strong and sweet it actually made me feel kind of ill. The texture of the lotion was fine, but I ended up not being able to wear it due to the scent.</li>
    <li> This is a very reasonably priced organic product.  It is the best scented lotion ever, and is nicely rich and very effective.  It is one of my favorite little luxuries.</li>
    <li> I totally love Coconut, fantastic sexy scent and excellent hydration!! Because I love drinking chai, I tried Vanilla chai, it was not a good idea at all. It smells weird, too spicy...I mean, who on earth wants to smell spicy??  Dessert essence is absolutely my favorite lotion, but I highly recommend that you avoid the Vanilla chai flavor.</li>

    <li> It smells exactly like its name.. Vanilla chai&lt;br /&gt;Great light natural lotion.  The scent is nice and not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a little gel-ish feeling to it..  Not like thick creamy lotion.&lt;br /&gt;But overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> but after a while I got sick of the smell. Everyone is different so, who knows you may love it. I would not buy it again though.</li>
    <li> A house guest had left behind a small amount in a tube.  I thought I really liked the lotion and the scent so I bought it through Amazon.  The scent of the new bottle was much stronger and sweeter than I had expected.  I didn&#x27;t think the quality was worth the money, either.</li>
    <li> Very intoxicating and warm. Spicy and exotic. Great 24 hr moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the price. Great moisturizer for the winter. Switched to this product do to allergic reaction to products from a big name bath store brand.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, although the scent does fade a bit quickly. The scent reminds me of the warm vanilla sugar products from bath and body works, but with a bit of spice that isn&#x27;t exactly chai spice. Absorbs quickly so there is no greasy or waxy film left on your hands.</li>

    <li> This is a great organic hand lotion.  I have very sensitive and dry skin and this does a great job of hydrating my skin without leaving it oily or slippery.  The best part is that it is one of the few organic lotions that does NOT contain phenoxyethanol! :) This preservative is found in a lot of &amp;#34;paraben free&amp;#34; lotions.  While this preservative only got a 4 on skin deep, there is limited data available regarding its safety and that data is conflicting. The European Union classifies it as an irritant.  In my opinion, I would rather avoid it until theres more information regarding its safety.</li>
    <li> It is rather runny in texture. Don&#x27;t feel much difference compared to other lotion I have used</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer and the smell is great!  Earth friendly product too.</li>
