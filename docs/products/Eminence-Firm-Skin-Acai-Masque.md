      <li>Love this masque.</li>
      <li>Gel are mostly water.</li>
      <li>Lovely product.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know for sure yet, as I just started using the product.</li>
      <li>Problem is, there are too many to chose from, and the Spas want to sell you all of them.  </li>
      <li>Love all the Eminence products.  </li>
      <li>Love,</li>

      <li>This product was used on facial I had at the Ritz Carlton  Love it!</li>
      <li>This is a fun mask to use, moisturizes/tightens</li>
      <li>and if i&#x27;m paying top dollar, i&#x27;d prefer to get more active ingredients.</li>
      <li>I prefer their cream-based enyzme/aha masques such as the [[ASIN:B003POGRLO Eminence Rhubarb Masque Skin Care, Strawberry, 2 Ounce]] which are more worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have been using Eminence products for the last 6 months and completely love them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product, since I&#x27;ve used it before and know that it&#x27;s good, but my order arrived with the seal broken and some of the content spilled out.  </li>
      <li>Also would be willing to try Eminences other products of which there seems to be many and appear to have a variety of items depending on age and skin type.</li>
      <li>There are real blueberry skin in the cream.</li>
      <li>Really works and not greasy.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product - thinking of ordering other products from them!</li>
      <li>love the natural aspects of their formulas but find that their gel masks are less substantial than their cream masks.</li>
      <li>Was this a new product?</li>
      <li>and it leaves your face feeling quite soft.  </li>
      <li>From the moment I applied it, I felt it firming up my 64 year old skin.  </li>
      <li>and i buy the professional size tubs, which are a much better deal than those dinky shallow jars.</li>

<li> You can feel it immediately pulling your skin tight.</li>
<li> It is not too heavy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not cheap and not a lot in the jar</li>
<li> Noticed the difference within a few days!</li>
<li> Not sure about the anti ageing claim??  </li>
<li> I had such bad reactions to the cleanser and moisturizer that I was afraid to use the masque.  </li>
<li> Sorry not a keeper.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> But for me, that&#x27;s a very expensive hydrating</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does a nice job of cleaning face, face feels wonder after each use.</li>
    <li> I like Eminence products. I ordered all Eminence acai products, but when I use the moisturizer it burns my eyes -used the cherry moisturizer with no problem. I have tried only using it on the lower part of my face but it will eventually start burning my eyes.</li>
    <li> I use Eminence on my treatment room, this mask is the one that I used more fir my clients, the results are amazing</li>
    <li> Great face mask. Makes your face feel good. Nice and moist and dewy afterwards.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product - thinking of ordering other products from them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product, since I&#x27;ve used it before and know that it&#x27;s good, but my order arrived with the seal broken and some of the content spilled out.  I should have returned it, but didn&#x27;t want the hassle.</li>
    <li> This product was used on facial I had at the Ritz Carlton  Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, and hoping that it works as good as it smells.  Don&#x27;t know for sure yet, as I just started using the product.</li>
    <li> I feel the cream like yogert. It didn&#x27;t same as I bought before. Maybe this is different type. There are real blueberry skin in the cream. I didn&#x27;t understand the purpose of this product.</li>
    <li> Noticed the difference within a few days! Love this product! Reduces the look of pores and lines beside my mouth.</li>
    <li> Really works and not greasy. You can feel your skin tighten and lift. Great product and I will continue to use</li>
    <li> Received this product as part of gift package for Christmas.  Liked it so much, I ordered more.  Works great with Clarisonic Sonic.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Actually left my skin dry. Tamron Hall recommended this as a Christmas gift. Sorry not a keeper.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on the eminence line.  Had a spa facial a few times with products, decided to save some money and do at home.  Eminence has a product booklet you can get that guides you for all products needed to achieve best results.  Love, love results.  FYI, important to note in these reviews I am 56 with fair aging skin.</li>
    <li> This is a fun mask to use, moisturizes/tightens and it smells like you want to eat it!  Very nice for a treat.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Eminence masques and once a year, i stock up on all their masques--- and i buy the professional size tubs, which are a much better deal than those dinky shallow jars. Firming Acai is a gel-based mask which you dilute with water to make it spread more evenly. It has a jelly texture and a pomegranate/acai type-scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the natural aspects of their formulas but find that their gel masks are less substantial than their cream masks. Gel are mostly water. and if i&#x27;m paying top dollar, i&#x27;d prefer to get more active ingredients. Sadly, the actives are probably too low to warrant a true firming effect. It does, however, hydrate. But for me, that&#x27;s a very expensive hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going thru a whole jar, i feel this is not Eminence&#x27;s best masque. I prefer their cream-based enyzme/aha masques such as the [[ASIN:B003POGRLO Eminence Rhubarb Masque Skin Care, Strawberry, 2 Ounce]] which are more worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  A little goes a long way. Makes our face feel really clean.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  I have been using Eminence products for the last 6 months and completely love them.  My skin is looking great!</li>
    <li> This is a great night time cream. It is not too heavy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I quite like this Eminence facial mask.  At first I thought it was a bit expensive but the produect goes a long way.  I think it will last quite awhile and it leaves your face feeling quite soft.  Not sure about the anti ageing claim??  But its moisturizing.  I am trying to use it twice a week and leave it on for as long as I have time for before washing it off.  I&#x27;d recommend it.  Also would be willing to try Eminences other products of which there seems to be many and appear to have a variety of items depending on age and skin type.</li>
    <li> Eminence is all natural and their products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Fast service, great product, will order again !</li>
    <li> I can see the difference in my skin.  Seems firmer and glows!</li>
    <li> Awesome.  I love it and my skin looks nicer too!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever purchased. You can feel it immediately pulling your skin tight. It has done wonders for both my mother and myself. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for result within a week.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I can immediately see a difference in my skin and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> My container was not sealed scared to use it! Was this a new product?</li>
    <li> Love this masque.It really makes the skin look healthy and fresh.Feels nice and smell amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like it. Easy to use. Smells great. Dries quickly. Leaves face feeling smooth, yet firmer. Not cheap and not a lot in the jar but it only takes a small amount to cover your face where needed. Lasts a long time using it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> I like everything by this company.  This is also a winner for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Love all the Eminence products.  Problem is, there are too many to chose from, and the Spas want to sell you all of them.  They have different advice every time you return.  This one&#x27;s a great pic.</li>
    <li> I had such bad reactions to the cleanser and moisturizer that I was afraid to use the masque.  It sits in the box, unopened because I don&#x27;t want to have the same or  a worse reaction than the other products I used.  For some this may be a great product because the ingredients listed in the description appeared to be without additives, etc.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. After use, my skin feels wonderful. The fragrance!! Have to remind myself its a mask - not something to taste.</li>
    <li> From the moment I applied it, I felt it firming up my 64 year old skin.  I have used this product for a couple of years and, along with my regular routine, have noticed a less sagging skin.</li>
