      <li>This is usually a great product, but I have my doubts that what I bought from this seller is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>I like the heavier cream in the jar better, but this is ok for lighter styling.</li>
      <li>Be sure to get the roots.</li>
      <li>It has a very light, nearly unnoticeable, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery good price discount.....</li>

      <li>Washes out easily, and leaves your hair conditioned.</li>
      <li>I love this product, works great with short hair and a must for girls.</li>
      <li>Does not have a strong smell, thank god.</li>

      <li>would recommend this to anyone with fine textured hair issues,for easy added volume and styling.</li>
      <li>It is great to add body to short fine hair, you can add the product then style the way you want it and it will stay for the day, but dispute when you sleep m it.</li>

      <li>I love Short Sexy Hair products!  </li>
      <li>I have tried about every hair product for short to medium length hair, and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>how much I use it still comes out perfect and never sticky or weighed down.</li>
      <li>This stuff works really well - strong hold, quick drying, and smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>The lightweight nature of this product is perfect for fine,  thin hair.</li>
      <li>I have used it for many years it adds volume and softness for my hair more than the blue version does.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the short sexy slept in styling creme by sexy hair, 5.1 ounce.</li>
      <li>I give a 4 star only because i find the fragrance to be nice and light but unwanted.</li>
      <li>and I used to be able to get it locally but not any more.  </li>

      <li>Looks great - still has texture even though it&#x27;s a firm hold.</li>
      <li>It makes it stay in place better, gives it better shape and texture, and doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy, wet looking, or greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Have a nice smell and it last all days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now, and its the only texture cream i plan on using..Washes out easily, and leaves your hair conditioned.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.R</li>
    <li> Fast delivery good price discount.....</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this stuff at the barber and I loved it.I knew the guy so he gave me a bottle for no charge.The only downside is that it&#x27;s too pricy.</li>
    <li> My husband buys this for his hair. He loves it. Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive he had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at my local Great Clips and it seemed to have a different consistency from the product I received at home. Overall it serves it&#x27;s purpose, just wish it was the same as the one I tried before.</li>
    <li> Love this product.-----&lt;br /&gt; Helps my permed hair look natural curly. I put it on damp&lt;br /&gt;hair-comb it with my fingers - (using a comb or brush take too much curl out) - crunch it - dry with a deflector.&lt;br /&gt;I get asked on a regular basis if my hair is natural curly. I have a soft non frizzy perm.</li>
    <li> You can not get a better product for short hair. I use this stuff everyday and my hair has never looked and felt this good before. It is to bad that the manufacturers try to make it for sale in SALONS only. That should be a crime. The best prices for ShortSexyHair hair is right here on Amazon for about 11- a each or you can go to the expensive Salons and pay 18- each for the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this products for years and this is the first time I found tiny hard pellets in then cream. I purchased two bottles and highly disappointed. I didn&#x27;t  return the product in time because I didn&#x27;t notice until it was too late. Bad experience.</li>
    <li> Great item great convenience great price! I will buy this product again because it is not too heavy but still provides plenty of hold.</li>
    <li> best hair creme ever!</li>
    <li> I used this product in the heat and humidity and it worked quite well.  I would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best creme for people who have thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a long long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It is really thick. I used a pinch and it made my hair feel thick. I know that is the way it is suppose to work but it shouldn&#x27;t make it feel like you put lard in your hair. If you like thick and greasy than its 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I really  like this prouct!</li>
    <li> An amazing product!!!!! A must for managing short hair!!!!! A very small amount will allow for arranging a creative style with little effort!!!!! Needless to say, I am delighted!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Received this product in a couple of days....way before the estimated time of arrival.&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly as described, and looks exactly like the bottle in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and works awesome!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for my short hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously magic. I have very fine and wispy hair, but I have a lot of it. Without this product I end up looking like a blonde Rod Blagojevich. However, a little glob of this gunk worked into my wet hair fixes everything. It makes it stay in place better, gives it better shape and texture, and doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy, wet looking, or greasy at all. It has a very light, nearly unnoticeable, pleasant smell. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for four years. Container is now black not clear</li>
    <li> I like this creme because it does not make my hair sticky and heavy and I used to be able to get it locally but not any more.  I hate having to pay shipping, everything is becoming such an inconvenience these days.  But Amazon did a good job getting me this product.</li>
    <li> It smells terrible. I don&#x27;t why.....I think it has already passed its sell-by date.... I  regret that I bought it.....</li>
    <li> Hair cream doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of things to do - it needs to be non-greasy, and needs to hold the hair in place, without any bad smell. That&#x27;s it. Yet, other brands that I&#x27;ve tried have gotten at least one of these wrong.&lt;br /&gt;This one was recommended by the barber that I go to - and it is a good recommendation. Just needs a tiny dab (for me - short hair), right after a shower/tower-dry, and comb as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Taking one star away for the price (could/should be a little cheaper)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the short sexy slept in styling creme by sexy hair, 5.1 ounce. It makes my hair feel dirty and not slept in.</li>
    <li> My hair salon stopped selling this, so I searched online, where I found a much better price, almost 1/2 of what I used to pay.  I&#x27;ll always get it online in future - one of the best products for adding body to fine hair that I&#x27;ve used, not stiff or sticky like some others.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product. Same brand and very similar but not what I thought I was getting.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair texture and this product works great as a styling product.  They sell it in many beauty shops, but this price on Amazon is by far the best!</li>
    <li> I wear my hair pretty short and this gives just enough extra hold to help me style it easily.  The price it was offered for was less than I had paid in the past.</li>
    <li> I use it per my stylist&#x27;s recommendation and it works great! Not too heavy and not too light. It doesn&#x27;t dry hard in the hair either.</li>
    <li> This is usually a great product, but I have my doubts that what I bought from this seller is the real thing.  It had a different smell and feel.  Didn&#x27;t work as well as it usually does.  I have used this product for over a year and will go back to buying it from my local store.  Should have known the price was to good to be true!</li>
    <li> I have short/medium length hair I like to keep &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; and this stuff works. It keeps that &amp;#34;sexy, I don&#x27;t care look&amp;#34; going for me.</li>
    <li> i live in the humid south and this styling produce helps maintain my style longer, without frizz.</li>
    <li> The bottle came damaged with over half of the product wasted and all over the package. it was a mess. The bottle has a hole in it so whenever I use it makes more of a mess. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect product if you don&#x27;t want stiff crunchy hair. It holds your hair in place all day without a tacky shine and you don&#x27;t need much for short hair. Just make sure your hands and hair are damp before applying. FYI this now a black bottle. Only con is the high price, $6 per bottle would be right on for how well it performs.</li>
    <li> I have short hair. This give it shape and body and hold. But doesn&#x27;t make it feel gummy or sticky. I only wash every other day and it keeps the style nicely</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two years. It takes all the frizz out and leaves my hair very manageable.  I usually buy it from my hair salon but found it on the web for $5 less.  Great seller, had the product within three days.  Awesome.  I will  buy through this seller from now on.</li>
    <li> This product has always been good. Sometimes I use it and sometimes I don&#x27;t. But it is a good one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve used. The money is worth it. It&#x27;s soft and it doesn&#x27;t make your face greesy like the other products.</li>
    <li> I love Short Sexy Hair products!  However, I especially love this texture cream.  It&#x27;s light, it holds my hair well, and it doesn&#x27;t get too stiff, like most gels do.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t get flaky; and since it&#x27;s not too stiff, my lady friends can actually run their fingers through my hair without a problem.</li>
    <li> I just needed something to keep my hair from looking like a bush after it dried. This does the trick. DOn&#x27;t get it if you are expecting something to hold styles in - it is not meant for that nor does it have strong enough hold for spikes.</li>
    <li> Love this product, just wish it was more affordable! It holds your hair in place but still offers movement. Not sticky or greasy, and does not flake. Highly recommended for people with wavy and/or curly hair.</li>
    <li> Another product my grocery store stopped keeping in stock.  This product great for texturizing my short hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product for my hair. I have used it for many years it adds volume and softness for my hair more than the blue version does. Unfortunately, my hair has become even more fine so very little goes a long way if you do not want flat. Most gorgeous product in all the hair styling stuff advertised. I have curly fine hair and for years it made it look just straight not like stick straight but with very large wave. I am a happy customer up to this part especially when summer rolls around and my hair gets kinky or fuzzy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine as long as you don&#x27;t put even a little too much on. A little goes a long way. I have very thick, somewhat coarse, frizzy/curly-wavy hair--a serious challenge for any hair product. This takes a way that dry look and tightens up the waves and curls a bit. Does not have a strong smell, thank god.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase for me. I have a pixie cut and sometimes have a hard time finding product that holds well without feeling gross (read: crunchy) to the touch. This stuff does the trick. I sometimes use a little texturizing powder with it, but as-is, it works great. I don&#x27;t love the stiff look, and this product leaves my hair feeling touch-able but styled throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few years now. Love the lotion like feel and the non-stickiness. Wait a few minutes after drying your hair with a towel after a shower and then rub it in. Be sure to get the roots. I have thick hair and so it&#x27;s been good for that. The problem comes when my hair gets longer. It&#x27;s a bit harder to maintain at that point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched all over for this product, thought I&#x27;d check Amazon and sure enough, there it was for sale !  I&#x27;ve used Short Sexy Hair for years and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
    <li> This is different that gel, palm-aid, or oils. It&#x27;s leaves your hair softer than the gel and palm-aid but firmer than an oil - but i guess you could have guessed that it being a cream and all. I cannot speak for wax because i never tried it but I am guessing this will leave your hair more flexible than wax considering its softer.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, I have short think straight hair. I can form my hair with this but its not very firm - its not like gel in that once you gel your hair that&#x27;s it no more adjustments. This will give you a light hold and leave your hair flexible so you can run your hand through your hair or whatever and it will give. I style my hair much the same way as it grows, I would not recommend for hair styles that will force your hair to go in a direction it does not want to. I give a 4 star only because i find the fragrance to be nice and light but unwanted. I like to use aftershave and don&#x27;t want to have the hair cream, and my aftershave fragrance mingling.</li>
    <li> Great for right after you wash your hair!</li>
    <li> It did what I wanted it to do.  I put it on damp clean hair (I have a curly pixie) with no other products.  Nice structure and separation without being rock hard and nice shine.  Fragrance is not too strong.</li>
    <li> Good product but way to expensive.</li>
    <li> I was shown this product during one of my hair cuts, and I love it. I have tried about every hair product for short to medium length hair, and this one is by far the best. It smells great, and works perfect for the person who wants a semi shine look without the gross flakes you get with hairspray or gel. It is a lotion type product that will also moisturize your hands while you apply it. It&#x27;s much better than a balm or a wax, and it allows for great control of your hair though out the day. It only takes a small amount to style my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I USE IT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a dime size portion and put it on my hand and rub my hands together then apply it to my hair evenly. I like to use it a few minutes after getting out of the shower. That way my hair is still damp, but has had a few minutes to air dry. It makes it easier to shape my hair the way I like it, while still giving it a little of that wet hair look all day long. If you like the drier look let your hair completely dry first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Holds Great all Day&lt;br /&gt;Lotion Like Texture (Don&#x27;t have to wash your hands after, just rub it in like a lotion)&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave your hands or hair sticky or gross.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey, but lasts a long time if you only use small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;Only comes in small bottles.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! You can work with it like hair gel, but without the shine and hard look afterwards.  It&#x27;s also easier to use than pomade or wax.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair product for several years. I have fine hair texture,and this gives my short hair some volume for styling, without feeling like I had put glue in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I simply use a small amount,work it through my hair,and leave the product in, after towel drying.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and size makes it easy to travel, without fear of spillage in my suitcase .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with fine textured hair issues,for easy added volume and styling.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, bleached short hair and this product is my holy grail. It&#x27;s lightweight and non-sticky. I apply a quarter sized amount to damp hair then blow dry with a round brush. The result is the bouncy, voluminous, smooth and soft hair that I have been trying to achieve for years. It literally does not look like my hair, it&#x27;s amazing. I wash my hair every other day, and on day two I dampen it with a spray bottle, add a little more Slept In, blow dry, a little dry shampoo, and voila! Perfect hair again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how effective this would be on thicker coarser hair. I&#x27;ve tried many products that others rave about and they usually leave my hair dry/sticky/flat/gross. The lightweight nature of this product is perfect for fine,  thin hair. I have yet to overdo the amount as well - it seems no matter how much I use it still comes out perfect and never sticky or weighed down. I&#x27;d give 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. It does the job without making your hair look unnatural. Best product in the market for me.</li>
    <li> great product.  Holds well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> great hair product. My son loves it</li>
    <li> I have super thick chin-length hair with a very slight wave, and I was looking for a product to give me some texture for a bit of a messy look if I didn&#x27;t feel like blow drying. I apply this after washing when my hair is pretty wet, and then scrunch it up a bit and let air dry. It changes the texture of my hair to an almost post-ocean swim look. It is a bit more tousle-able and has some hold to it. I can move my hair around with my hands after it&#x27;s dry and it doesn&#x27;t quite stay, but does take a different shape. Smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  I&#x27;ve used every kind of gel but this stuff is different and smells awesome.  Holds my hair just right without over hardening and never ever flakes.  It works well in dry or wet hair depending on what kind of look you want because it seems to dry differently depending on if the hair is dry or wet.  Try either way but it&#x27;s great I used about 30 tubes so far!!!</li>
    <li> I use this after I have blown dried my hair to help style it and give it some body.  I love this product since you just use a tiny amount and it adds a nice finishing touch.</li>
    <li> I like the heavier cream in the jar better, but this is ok for lighter styling.</li>
    <li> Best product for my hair. Smells good and has a waxy and not crunchy feel.</li>
    <li> It is great to add body to short fine hair, you can add the product then style the way you want it and it will stay for the day, but dispute when you sleep m it. Great product</li>
    <li> I bought this because I recently cut my chin-length hair very short and wanted something to give it body and a little bit of an edgier spikyness than just mousse.  It works, although it does leave residue on your hair.</li>
    <li> Great gel, I&#x27;ve been using this gel creme for 7yrs and this is the best price you&#x27;ll find it at.  You only need about a dime to nickel amount and your hair will stay in place all day long.</li>
    <li> Only thing my son in law will use in his hair - (I also use it to refresh my elderly mother&#x27;s hairdo)&lt;br /&gt;It was a welcome stocking stuffer -</li>
    <li> Not greasy, keeps hair in place and looks natural. I have used the product for 2 years. It is worth the price</li>
    <li> This really weighs my short hair down, so I don&#x27;t get the effect I&#x27;m trying to get. Also makes my hair look oily and like it needs to be washed. Might be good for long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have been growing my dense, thick hair out and this product tames the savage beast.  The price is about $5-7 cheaper than any retail store I have seen.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this stuff, but it is only &amp;#34;fair.&amp;#34; You have to use a lot to get any hold. It is almost impossible to find a product called Prive Concept Vert Volumizing Froth and I was hoping this would be a good replacement, but nope, I will still be looking...</li>
    <li> I used many hair gel products before and this is one of the best I ever used. It is not sticky. Have a nice smell and it last all days. Your hair will look natural too.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff.  I have thin, fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, but gives enough root boost.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that does the following:&lt;br /&gt;1) dry/natural look, not wet like gel&lt;br /&gt;2) good hold, but not overdone&lt;br /&gt;3) doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff like some gels or styling cremes&lt;br /&gt;4) Absorbs into your hair, doesn&#x27;t leave gel or goupy residue&lt;br /&gt;5) girlfriend can still run her hands through my hair and can&#x27;t tell it has products in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this exclusively for my hair. I&#x27;m not a hair freak, I only spend about 2 minutes putting this creme in and styling as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price - but it lasts me a long time so I don&#x27;t mind spending $16 every 4 months&lt;br /&gt;Availability - I have been buying it at my local drug store but haven&#x27;t been able to find it there, so I&#x27;m forced to either get it at a salon or here on amazon</li>
    <li> I love this product, works great with short hair and a must for girls. Not too sticky or gross in your hair but you really need to shampoo it out to get it all out. Love It</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, it&#x27;s the only one I can find that holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t make it look slicked with grease and gels.  It gives a very natural look while supplying the hold necessary for styling however you like.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well - strong hold, quick drying, and smells fantastic. Looks great - still has texture even though it&#x27;s a firm hold. Resists water, but isn&#x27;t impossible to get out in a hot shower. Like all gels, it&#x27;s a little oily when you sweat and it runs.</li>
    <li> I like the old version, in the yellow tube, not the black tube.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and I love the texture creme.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it!  Fast shipping, exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, and this works very well to give it some body. I use less than a quarter size dollop, and then blow dry. There is no miracle out there, but this comes closer than a lot of other products that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Brought this for my boyfriend who has thick straight waves hair he loves it. The only place I can find it is on amazon everywhere else what $17 or more for a 5 oz bottle</li>
