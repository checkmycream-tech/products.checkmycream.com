### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is a great product !!!</li>
      <li>I am happy.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will notice that the LED head gets very warm - up to 106 degrees.</li>
      <li>Additionally, this unit has heat which is also good for killing bacteria and speeding healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device has a good weight and feels sturdy and well built.</li>
      <li>The good news is that I didn’t notice any adverse reactions or side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good thing</li>
      <li>We are very pleased.</li>
      <li>but my wife seems to love it too!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You should have some kind of timing device (an hour-glass egg timer works well) to tell you when to move the device to another area.</li>
      <li>Nice stand and charger&lt;</li>
      <li>Nice stand and charger&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice sleek device, it lasts a week or so on one charge and comes with a nice stand.  </li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if they could put a time reminder on it</li>
      <li>The time investment isn&#x27;t much more than applying medications, and I feel that I&#x27;m doing something both safe for my skin, and good for my skin.</li>
      <li>It would be more cost effective to do them yourself at home.  </li>
      <li>main downfall to this device is that is incredibly time consuming to use.  </li>
      <li>Very good heat level - feels very warm, like a heating pad - extremely soothing</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s very secure in the stand, even when bumped.</li>
      <li>Interesting, but not terribly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>Either way, this device is worth the money for happiness.</li>
      <li>My wife has had ongoing acne issues for most of her life.</li>
      <li>Plus, facials are way more relaxing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>have been using this for three or more weeks, and have had to stop.</li>
      <li>do think I would like it better if it would beep after the 3-4 minutes is up in one spot so that I would know I could move on to another spot on my face.  </li>
      <li>After we ate, we found a couple of cute summer outfits.</li>
      <li>Most things seem to help, somewhat, but nothing seems to help fully.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t recommend this device, because it created so many problems with my skin.</li>
      <li>I suspect the rechargeable battery is positioned toward the top as well.  </li>
      <li>- excellent product and definitely recommended.</li>
      <li>She and I waited some more.</li>
      <li>I have better things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and after it&#x27;s full, hold it against the area for 3-5 minutes, which is where a timer in the device would have been handy, hence the loss of a star.</li>
      <li>I found it best to use in evening when more time was available, but it is supposed to be used twice daily.  </li>
      <li>The results were pretty good</li>
      <li>I like that there is a charging dock that the device easily slips into, making for better storage and room placement.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Naturally, diet plays a part in skin care but overall this is a great product to own if you fight acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so far happy with this gizmo.</li>
      <li>and it’s a lot better than the &amp;#60;$79-99 light sticks out there.  </li>
      <li>But the most important thing you will need is patience and determination.  </li>
      <li>Not the most comfortable and time efficient of solutions.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it’s a lot better than the &amp;#60;$79-99 light sticks out there.  </li>
      <li>Blue Light is very good at killing bacteria in the pores.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everything is laid out well, seems durable, and the stick itself is easy to grip and use with the one button operation.  </li>
      <li>Sleek looking and easy to hold</li>
      <li>Sleek looking and easy to hold</li>
      <li>It is time consuming, but you can easily do it while watching TV or reading a book.  </li>
      <li>She found the head of the device was getting pretty warm.</li>
      <li>She thought the heat was getting pretty warm.</li>
      <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal..</li>
      <li>The charging light never turns on when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
      <li>Well, it is fully charged when the light goes off, so that’s not</li>
      <li>Still, considering it uses visible wavelengths of light, I doubt it will have any side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, it is fully charged when the light goes off, so that’s not</li>
      <li>/&gt;The unit is light weight and comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on those areas, and it seems to have helped a lot with giving me smooth</li>
      <li>I like this because the light never shines in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still, considering it uses visible wavelengths of light, I doubt it will have any side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dermatologists and salon&#x27;s use light therapy to help problem skin and sessions can run anywhere from $45-60.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the Silk&#x27;n Blue to be a really great alternative to both prescription and OTC medications for my skin problems.</li>
      <li>This was a great idea, so I decided that was how I would go about comparing how well the Silk&#x27;n Blue is working for me.</li>
      <li>Maybe this will be nice in the winter, but in the summer it just makes your whole body sweat.  </li>
      <li>Holding the device to the face means you can’t see the light, so</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>need to wait another month or two to update this review as to any additional results, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not enough to burn, but it is very warm.</li>
      <li>unique thing about this unit from Silk&#x27;n is that the LED array is surrounded by a metal collar which prevents scattering of the light from around the sides of the head.</li>
      <li>Silk n Blue Acne Solution Device is an amazing product that works !</li>
      <li>So we were excited to try out this Silk&#x27;n</li>
      <li>After the first use you can see the problem area is much more</li>
      <li>Blue light therapy in particular is very good for acne because it kills the bacteria that&#x27;s at the root of every zit.</li>
      <li>They think that maybe darker skin types are more sensitive to the infrared heat in the device, and maybe they should get used to the device more gradually.</li>
      <li>manual recommends that you clean the head between uses with a \\&quot;specially formulated cleaner for electronic equipment.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>and I have to keep my eyes closed during treatment on certain areas because the light from that unit is very bright to my eyes.</li>
      <li>And the lights on the side kind of go all wild.</li>
      <li>She liked the results aside from the rare new blemish.</li>
      <li>Just inside the front cover is a page of Quick Start Instructions which we both read.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call that a quick start.</li>
      <li>it charges quickly and does shrink zits.  </li>
      <li>At this point in my life, I have mild bouts of acne that pop up here and there.  </li>
      <li>This is not my first experience with light therapy.  </li>
      <li>But right now with the initial usage - it certainly looks like a great buy</li>
      <li>If you have really severe acne this might work better but for my occasional breakouts it didn&#x27;t seem to be all that effective.  </li>
      <li>If you have really severe acne this might work better but for my occasional breakouts it didn&#x27;t seem to be all that effective.  </li>
      <li>people may find this device useful, but I would highly recommend shopping around for a model that has more features (a timer, for example) over this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless as to whether this is an issue for everyone or not, the lack of a timer and the length of time needed makes this solution less attractive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless as to whether this is an issue for everyone or not, the lack of a timer and the length of time needed makes this solution less attractive.</li>
      <li>For the price of this product, I can have three facials which in turn do as much good as this product did in a week of use every single day.  </li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it !!!</li>
      <li>Obviously, given the surface area of the metal trapezoid, and depending on how many areas you want to treat, this can easily take 12-30 minutes each</li>
      <li>After a short time with item, it does seem safe and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>me niece try this out since a teenager has lot more acne than an adult</li>
      <li>She is sufferng, like so many young teens, from periodic outbreaks of acne.</li>
      <li>device has a nice sleek to it and is simple to setup and use.</li>
      <li>I like it hot, but if you&#x27;re someone who always likes it cool, you may want to sip ice water or a mojito while using this.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth adding this to your skincare treatment.  </li>
      <li>So…4 stars for the really nice design, ease of use, and potential benefit…</li>
      <li>Works well, but l don&#x27;t know it its worth the effort for someone with a lot of acne.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does what it says. Recently, I am experiencing hormonal acne problems and with the help of an external antibiotic + this blue light solution it really helps to dry my pimples. I recommend it. After the first use you can see the problem area is much more dry.&lt;br /&gt;One thing, you have to be consistence every day.</li>
    <li> I wish this product had a built-in timer like my electric toothbrush. The manual says to hold it against the skin for 3 - 4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I measure the 3-minute time span? With a stopwatch? Do I need to keep watching the bathroom clock while using this? No I have better things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after 6 week of continuous use. So far I have been using it on my shoulder, cheek and nose.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally have adult acne...I like to think those awful teenage years have granted me some reprieve! But lately I&#x27;ve had some minor acne on my chin and forehead/hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for three or more weeks, and have had to stop. It has turned the very minor pimples into large welts that do not go away. I have no contraindications, use no acne medication, and followed the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Using 2-3 minutes per small spot, I spent about 20 minutes at a time. There is no timer or indicator for the 2-3 minute usage. It would be nice to have one, perhaps a small beep like my electric toothbrush has.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this device, because it created so many problems with my skin.</li>
    <li> been using faithfully for about 1 month and can see difference on side of face where I had blemishes , dark spots and scars.</li>
    <li> Works great I give it two thumbs up</li>
    <li> This is an interesting little doodad. Interesting, but not terribly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the logistics of using the thing. You are meant to use the device anywhere that you experience acne. This is to be done for 3-4 minutes per application, twice a day. After a 6-8 week treatment period, you move into maintenance. Maintenance is 3-4 minutes per application, twice a week total. The booklet says to expect possible redness and irritation upon initially using the device, but my redness never lasted very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device works by emitting blue light and exposing your skin to heat. According to the literature that came with it, Blue&#x27;s light and heat combo work by breaking down the bacteria in the pores that are the culprits behind acne and other blemishes. Realistically, the device seems meant primarily for those people who have chronic acne but only in spots. If you have chronic acne all over, using this device as directed would require hours. Even someone with just average acne problems is probably going to need half an hour (if not more) for a full session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also not a good device for use on or next to the nose. When I get blemishes, they&#x27;re usually in that crease between the cheek and the nostril.  Applying Blue there means smooshing your nose to the side and hoping that the blemish is getting enough of the light and heat. Blue is also not designed for spot treatment.  When I have a blemish pop up here or there, it&#x27;s usually gone within the week, especially if I apply some benzoyl peroxide. With a 6-8 week treatment period, Blue doesn&#x27;t seem like the proper tool for eradicating spontaneous, short-lived zits. That means that when all is said and done, this tool is a reasonable purchase only if you have chronic acne that affects just a few small, easily reached areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also a few technical issues with the device. When you turn it on, you must wait for the green light to indicate that it&#x27;s ready, and then you press it against an affected area. Upon contact with your skin, the blue lights illuminate and the head gradually heats up. After the 3-4 minutes, you move the wand to another spot. Once it loses contact with your skin, the lights and heat are meant to turn off. However, frequently the lights remained on after lifting the device off my skin. At least once every couple of days, I had to turn it off and back on. Less frequently, the lights would not come on at all.  A quick power-cycle fixed that for a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it seemed to work as directed (more or less), it&#x27;s hard for me to recommend the device. First of all, I can&#x27;t guarantee that my blemishes went away because of the device or just due to natural causes. For me, zits don&#x27;t stick around long unless I pick at them, so the ones that faded away on my face may have done so because it was just time. Secondly, the amount of time one is required to spend holding a heated light to your skin is pretty problematic unless you were already planning to spend the next half hour or more sitting around doing nothing. Therefore, I recommend you try out Blue only if you have one or more of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Chronic acne that occurs in very small patches;&lt;br /&gt;2. Overly-sensitive skin that reacts badly to chemicals like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid; or&lt;br /&gt;3. A ton of free time to use Blue on larger acne-prone areaspress it against an affected area. Upon contact with your skin, the blue lights illuminate and the head gradually heats up.

    <li> The Silk&#x27;n Blue Acne Solution Device is a well-designed unit, but your response to the somewhat time consuming treatments will probably vary.  As a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve received the Silk&#x27;n Blue device as a reviewer product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for just over 3 weeks at the time of writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the device is very well made.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple AA and AAA battery operated light treatment devices in the past, and the Silk&#x27;n Blue is much better than those units.  The Silk&#x27;n Blue has a plastic charging cradle and the curved light stick fits snuggly into it.  There is only one button on the light stick, along with a green/orange LED indicator that lets you know what the battery charging status is.  The light stick is top-heavy, where a metal trapezoidal piece houses the blue LED therapy lights and a heating element.  I suspect the rechargeable battery is positioned toward the top as well.  On the bottom of the stick are vents, and there is an active cooling mechanism that kicks in after about 15-30 seconds of use.  Everything is laid out well, seems durable, and the stick itself is easy to grip and use with the one button operation.  The only substandard part of the product is the cheap AC adapter with the huge wall wart size, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation is fairly simple.  The light stick takes a few hours to charge, and once it’s ready to go, you simply hit the button and put it against your skin.  What I noticed is that the metal trapezoid begins to heat up, and then the blue-violet LED lights come on.  Sometimes the blue LEDs don’t turn for awhile, and you have to take it off your skin, and put it back on until the lights turn on.  I think this is a safety mechanism so that the lights are only on when skin is in contact with the metal trapezoid, but occasionally it takes awhile to get going.  Once the lights turn on, though, it’s easy to reposition onto a new area of skin and keep the lights active.  The instructions state to keep the light stick on one region of skin for about 3 minutes, and then move to a new area.  Obviously, given the surface area of the metal trapezoid, and depending on how many areas you want to treat, this can easily take 12-30 minutes each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silk’n Blue performance, like other devices of this nature, can be difficult to gauge.  At this point in my life, I have mild bouts of acne that pop up here and there.  To be as scientific as possible during my review period, I only treated the right side of my face in 3 spots (3 minutes each spot), every day for 3 weeks.  I never treated the left side of my face.  That was about 9-10 minutes of total treatment time each evening.  While that doesn’t seem like much, I definitely felt it weighing down my nightly routine.  If you want to fully treat yourself, you’ll notice adding an extra 15-30 minutes every night.  As for the results?  Well…I’m not exactly sure.  It was tough to gauge improvement in that 3 week span.  The instructions say it could take 3-8 weeks before you benefit from the treatment, but I’m supposed to post this review within 30 days.  My take is that it somewhat helps for acne that leads to white heads and breakouts that are near the surface of the skin. When I had a pimple that was primarily subcutaneous and deeper under the skin, I don’t think the Silk’n Blue had any effect.  The good news is that I didn’t notice any adverse reactions or side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science behind the Silk’n Blue and other light sticks is that there are published reports that violet-blue light (380-470 nm wavelengths) can induce bacteria cell death.  Many reports have shown that Staphylococcus bacteria, in particular, will die or suffer a growth arrest in response to these wavelengths of light when subjected to certain amounts of energy (typically around 405 nm of light at &amp;#62; 110 J/square cm).  Silk’n Blue uses 415 nm wavelength LED lights, which should be relatively safe on your skin (it’s not damaging UV light), and is in the range of wavelengths that have been shown to be bactericidal.  The majority of these published, peer-reviewed studies were performed on bacteria growing in culture, and not on human skin.  So while the rationale for the commercial product design is reasonable, I’m not completely sold on the clinical evidence just yet.  Still, considering it uses visible wavelengths of light, I doubt it will have any side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the Silk’n Blue is a well-designed product, and given the functional LED light source, it should last a long time.  The downside is that the treatment regimen can take a long time, depending on how much surface area you need to treat everyday for a 3-8 week span.  I personally only had a little success with the unit with my mild acne, but I’m sure your mileage may vary.  If you do suffer from constant acne, and are ok with the cost and the treatment time, I absolutely think it’s worth a shot and it’s a lot better than the &amp;#60;$79-99 light sticks out there.  However, if you manage well enough with washing your face and occasional salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide treatments, the Silk’n Blue is probably not worth the cost to you.  So…4 stars for the really nice design, ease of use, and potential benefit….the loss of the star for the limited surface area leading to the long total treatment time.d be relatively safe on your skin (it’s not damaging UV light), and is in the range of wavelengths that have been shown to be bactericidal.

    <li> I ordered the Silk &#x27;n Blue Acne Solution Device with my fourteen-year-old granddaughter in mind. She is sufferng, like so many young teens, from periodic outbreaks of acne. She and I sat down and opened the box. Inside were the acne device, a cord, a charging device, and a small booklet of instructions in English and a couple of other languages. Both she and I read the instructions. Just inside the front cover is a page of Quick Start Instructions which we both read. The first thing they said to do was plug the charger into the wall and place the device on the charger for 6 to 8 hours. I wouldn&#x27;t call that a quick start. But we followed the instructions and then went out shopping and had lunch. After we ate, we found a couple of cute summer outfits. That worked to my grand-daughter&#x27;s advantage. When we got back, she went in and washed her face with plain old soap and water. There was plenty of time for her skin to dry. The charging time was still not up. She and I waited some more. The lesson here is don&#x27;t expect to be able to use this thing as soon as you open the package. Plan ahead.  We didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6-hour wait was over and we pressed the on/off switch. A green light flickered to life and finally stayed on. Ready for action. My granddaughter&#x27;s blemishes were concentrated on her forehead and chin, so those were the areas she concentrated on with the Blue. The LED light was on and she held the Blue against the skin on her forehead for a little over 3 minutes. She found the head of the device was getting pretty warm. She moved the head of the Blue to another place on her forehead every 3 to 4 minutes. She thought the heat was getting pretty warm. She applied the Blue to about 8 areas on her  forehead and 3 areas on her chin. It took about 40 minutes to get around to all the areas that had blemishes. She was through for the evening. The Blue was returned to the charger so it would be ready the next morning. After the Blue had been on the charger for another6 hours, I removed it as I had read in the comments not to leave it on after it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to use the Blue twice a day for 6- to 8-weeks to start and to repeat the treatments twice a week for maintenance. The maintenance schedule seems reasonable but getting there seems to be a real hike to me. Lucky for my granddaughter, it&#x27;s summer vacation but to keep up that starting schedule during the rest of the year would be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She managed pretty well through almost 4 weeks of treatments but she was definitely flagging in her enthusiasm. The treatments, lasting at least an half-hour each, twice a day, were taking up an awful lot of time, time she would have preferred doing other things. Fortunately, she was showing some fairly decent results with her skin. Maintenance arrived just in time, or I think she may have given up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her skin has been fairly clear now for a couple of weeks and she has been doing the maintenance schedule. I hope she can keep up once school starts again. We discussed the ratings for this device and she felt the amount to time necessary, especially at the beginning, was a real problem. She liked the results aside from the rare new blemish. I thought the time spent charging and getting the Blue off the charger so it didn&#x27;t overcharge was a pain. All in all, we decided that 3 stars were just about right. The results were pretty good but it took an awful lot of effort to get there.</li>
    <li> This is not my first experience with light therapy.  There are red and green options for other types of skin treatments.  However blue light therapy is used to treat moderate acne problems, the blue light kills the acne bacteria while it helps tighten pores and decrease skin&#x27;s oiliness.  Continued use will help less acne breakouts and reduce the inflammation of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologists and salon&#x27;s use light therapy to help problem skin and sessions can run anywhere from $45-60.  It would be more cost effective to do them yourself at home.  It is time consuming, but you can easily do it while watching TV or reading a book.  Noticeable results are expected to be seen in 1 to 3 months with continuous use.  Even after your skin has cleared up, you must continue a routine maintenance treatments or your breakout problems will come back.  This has held true to my green light therapy for dark spots.</li>
    <li> This device is neat for fighting acne. I get a couple of spots now and then and figured I&#x27;d try it out as a Vine member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You charge this up and after it&#x27;s full, hold it against the area for 3-5 minutes, which is where a timer in the device would have been handy, hence the loss of a star. Still, I was seeing results a few hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, diet plays a part in skin care but overall this is a great product to own if you fight acne.</li>
    <li> This is great for killing the bacteria deep down in the pores. It shines blue light LED into your skin, and I think that it goes through your skin to help fix acne. I used it on my problem areas, and it seemed to work well. I like the size of it. It&#x27;s big enough to cover a pretty big part of my face at one time. I usually get acne on chin and above my ears when I shave my head. I&#x27;ve been using it on those areas, and it seems to have helped a lot with giving me smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets quite hot. It&#x27;s not enough to burn, but it is very warm. I like it hot, but if you&#x27;re someone who always likes it cool, you may want to sip ice water or a mojito while using this. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the light that warms my skin or if there&#x27;s a heater in this, too, but it gets pretty hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked one star off because mine came a little broken. The charging light never turns on when it&#x27;s charging. It still charges, though. It&#x27;s just confusing. And the lights on the side kind of go all wild. And the instructions are really hard to understand if it&#x27;s working or not. But, I just improvise, and it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6057cdedc8c556c37255243b133fff6]] Highlights of my Video Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Blue Light is very good at killing bacteria in the pores.  Especially great for those deep cystic acne that don&#x27;t pop but are super painful.  Start zapping it as soon as you feel one growing and it will actually get rid of it without it ever coming to head.  It kills the bacteria and then your body can deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cordless with a very sleek and attractive base&lt;br /&gt;3. Very powerful&lt;br /&gt;4. Very good heat level - feels very warm, like a heating pad - extremely soothing&lt;br /&gt;5. Use for 3-5 minutes in each area - I end up spending about 1/2 hour on my face - but I made it my evening routine. At the end of the day, after face is washed and prepped, sit down and watch some TV or read a book while running this across my face. Really relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;6. Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;7. No limit to how much use you can get out of this light, unlike other similar products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - excellent product and definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my daughter but my wife seems to love it too!  The product takes a lot of patience as you need to carefully count out enoogh seconds in each spot before moving it.  As my daughter uses this on her back it is a time consuming process with my wife needing to hold it, to cover a big area.  If you use it on your face it is not so bad.  It is close to three weeks since i got this product and my daughter has already seen some positive results on her back.  But the biggest benifit so far is with my wife.  Her skin seems to have a glow that several people have commented on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I have is that the instruction book is very sparse and really doesn&#x27;t give enough information about the product but it is fairly simple to use and seems to require no maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to wait another month or two to update this review as to any additional results, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> It clears the acne by killing the bacteria on face. So REMEMBER IT. The device won&#x27;t help anything else except KILLING the bacteria. For me, my acnes are from the allergic reaction. I hoped the device could relieve the pain from the acnes a little when I bought it. But it doesn&#x27;t work for it.</li>
    <li> Works well, but l don&#x27;t know it its worth the effort for someone with a lot of acne.  The footprint is small so going over a large area is very time consuming.  I used the device in conjunction with clean &amp; clear persa-gel right before my period and while it did not prevent all acne from appearing, there was a noticeable difference to months past. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing that will make a teen wail \\&quot;My life is OVER!\\&quot;  faster than a case of acne and I think it really can do a lot to damage a Child&#x27;s self-esteem.  It makes me sad to see adults with terrible acne scarring that could have been avoided. As far as I can determine eating things like greasy food or chocolate causing acne is a myth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I should remind you this device is not for scarring, wrinkles, dark spots, rosacea, cystic acne or anything else except inflammatory acne. Of course don&#x27;t use on moles, cold sores etc. If you&#x27;re on a prescription consult your dermatologist. If you have dark skin start using the \\&quot;blue&#x27; more slowly.  They think that maybe darker skin types are more sensitive to the infrared heat in the device, and maybe they should get used to the device more gradually. They don&#x27;t say so but I would think this would be a reason to avoid using on tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should have some kind of timing device (an hour-glass egg timer works well) to tell you when to move the device to another area. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if they could put a time reminder on it like they do electric toothbrushes? But the most important thing you will need is patience and determination.  You have to hold the device on each area for three or four minutes twice a day.  You won&#x27;t believe how long three minutes really is. If you&#x27;re listening to music it&#x27;s about the length of one song (unless it&#x27;s \\&quot;stairway to heaven\\&quot; of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to completely charge the unit the first time before you use it.  Be sure your skin is completely clean and dry before you start. They say it will take from three to seven weeks for the \\&quot;Blue\\&quot; to work but I think there is a visible improvement in as little as a week.  After the acne clears you will need to continue weekly for prevention of outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in Israel.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have been using this Silk&#x27;n Blue Acne Solution Device for a while now and seen significant results. I have a couple problem areas but my acne problem is on the minor side still I have seen significant improvement his problem is bigger he has some problem areas with repeat breakouts on the regular and it has been very helpful for him his troubled areas are much more clear/clean. It is a bit time consuming but worth it, it does not get very hot, I am please we have it as he definitely needed it especially since it gets in there kills bacteria many his pimples never really pop but are deep into his skin. We are very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so far happy with this gizmo. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it seems to be working. It gets hot, but not hot enough to be unbearable. I wish the Blue had a timer so you could more easily keep track of how long you were holding it in position. While it&#x27;s easy enough to apply yourself, the shape and design necessitate that you get help for hard to reach areas like your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a terrible acne problem, but I do get pimples here and there, and recently, more than usual. I really like that the light and heat actually kill the bacteria without the need to break the skin. I know you&#x27;re not &#x27;supposed to&#x27; pop pimples, but sometimes they are so painful, they need relief. No matter how careful I am, I will still sometimes get an infection from one I&#x27;ve popped. This has so far kept me from having pop three really gnarly pimples.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with acne. I have tried prescription acne creams, products on television, in the stores, and even received treatment from doctors. Yet, nothing ever really seemed to work. It worked for a little while but then it seemed that the acne would adapt to the products or treatments and stop working. I can not count the many times I cried myself to sleep due to the acne. Which if it was just a simple pimple or blackhead that is one thing but as I have gotten older, my acne seems to have grown to sometimes the size of a nickel/quarter and not just on my forehead but all over my face and on my chest and back. One of the biggest issues is that the acne forms but with no head to it and hot compresses don&#x27;t seem to help that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I picked this up to try it. Wow, after using it 4 times already I noticed a big improvement. I had one that was like the size of a quarter and already it is about penny size or less. I am happy. The heat does get hot but not hot enough to burn. I did notice after the first time that I had a couple of small bumps appear due to the heat and the drying effect from this device. I am looking forward to see if this device really does help keep future breakouts from happening and give me clearer skin. Either way, this device is worth the money for happiness.</li>
    <li> If you have a bad case of acne or possible other skin conditions, this might be a solution. My daughter and son have started breaking out so they tried it. The use has to be patient and methodical during application, and as kids, they just aren&#x27;t but they gave it a shot. There was some improvment with my daughters sking, but not with my son&#x27;s.  Granted, they are only 3 weeks into the 6-8 week period of seeing results, but I doubt it is a program they can stick to. Which makes the blue light treatment worthless for them. Others may benefit though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> The Silk&#x27;n Blue Acne Solution Device is advertised as a way to rid your skin of pimples, acne, and even prevent further breakouts.  Using this product steadily for five days, I noticed a few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is inconvenient.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to use it in the bathroom and there is no way that this product can be used quickly  Because of the natural blue light and dermal heating, you are supposed to steadily hold the device on the infected area for more than three minutes.  Of course, there isn&#x27;t a time, switch, or morse code to tell the user when time is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the product is expensive.  For the price of this product, I can have three facials which in turn do as much good as this product did in a week of use every single day.  Plus, facials are way more relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind sitting on your couch with this device pressed to your face then this product is for you.  It is definitely not for someone who only has a few minutes here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine&lt;br /&gt; The dual power of natural blue light and dermal heating offers a safe, drug-free, and effective way to combat the root causes of present and future acne: the blue light destroys existing acne-causing bacteria residing beneath the skin’s surface, and the dermal heating dehydrates the overproducing oil-glands</li>
    <li> I think there may be an effect on the quantity of acne, but it&#x27;s hard to gauge. I used to have pimples all the time, but now it&#x27;s like towards the time of the month I&#x27;ll get several breakouts that go away within a few days. When I first started using the product (3 minutes on each affected area), I got several large pimples afterwards, but it&#x27;s probably not b/c of this product. I targeted them with the device for a few days, but I didn&#x27;t think they went away because of the device, however, just on their own. Lately though I haven&#x27;t seen many breakouts, but I haven&#x27;t been using it consistently either. I like to think that the device had a lasting effect so now my skin is clearer than before. One thing I had hoped but don&#x27;t really see is for my blackheads to reduce or go away. The manual doesn&#x27;t mention blackheads, but I still hoped...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of design, I found the shape awkward to use on the nose area (to be expected), and don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s no blue LED right in the middle of the device. This is supposed to be device to target breakouts, so I expected it to have a light in the middle b/c people would intuitively place the middle of the device right on top of the affected area. Not sure if they explain this in the manual...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this when I have 20 minutes to spare at night, and hopefully the blue light does magic and prevents large, uncomfortable breakouts. However, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really doing anything or not. The differences are too slight to tell.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it - no one likes zits! Almost everyone gets the occasional zit and lots of people (especially teens) get them on a regular basis. Some people are unlucky enough to have severe cystic acne but no matter what variety, no one likes them. Prior to the availability of home blue-light therapy units like this one from Silk&#x27;n, most home treatments involved salicylic acid or some form of peroxide applied to the face. Anything stronger required expensive visits to a doctor and often medications taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light therapy has been used by doctors for various skin conditions for quite some time with good results. Blue light therapy in particular is very good for acne because it kills the bacteria that&#x27;s at the root of every zit. The blue LEDs in this device operate at a wavelength of 415 nanometers. Additionally, this unit has heat which is also good for killing bacteria and speeding healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is rechargeable and features an array of 24 blue LEDs on the head. Treatment is administered by placing the head of the unit directly on the affected area for 3-4 minutes twice daily for a period of 6-8 weeks and then once weekly thereafter as a maintenance routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice that the LED head gets very warm - up to 106 degrees. This is a part of the treatment and it is not uncomfortable to me or anyone in my family but for people who have extremely sensitive skin, it may feel uncomfortably hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unique thing about this unit from Silk&#x27;n is that the LED array is surrounded by a metal collar which prevents scattering of the light from around the sides of the head. I have a different light therapy device that does not have this and I have to keep my eyes closed during treatment on certain areas because the light from that unit is very bright to my eyes. This unit directs the light on the area being treated with almost no light leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is light weight and comfortable to hold. It comes with a charging stand that is keyed so it&#x27;s very secure in the stand, even when bumped. It takes about 8 hours to completely charge. The battery is non-replaceable and when it will no longer hold a charge, the unit has reached it&#x27;s lifespan and must be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fully charging, to use the device you press the power button on the front and then wait until the green indicator light stops blinking and glows continuously. Place the head against the affected area and leave it in place for 3-4 minutes. The blue LEDs will not light up until it is placed against the skin. I like this because the light never shines in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Move the unit from affected area to affected area, treating for 3-4 minutes per area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like many of the features on this unit, there are some that are lacking in my opinion and should be included in later versions of this device. First, the head is quite small and thus can only treat a very small area at a time. This is fine for occasional break-outs in small areas but it would take as long as an hour twice daily to treat most of the face. There are units available with much larger heads that will probably work better for people with problem areas covering a large part of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is no timer. I&#x27;m very surprised that no timer was included! When you are treating multiple areas of the face twice a day for 6-8 weeks, it can get very tedious. Watching TV or reading while treating is almost essential but it&#x27;s a distraction to try and time each section. The other similarly priced unit I have has a timer. Hopefully, Silk&#x27;n will add this to future models because it&#x27;s ridiculous, IMO, not to have a timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the build is solid and I think the added heat speeds healing of break-outs. It&#x27;s working very well for my almost 13 year old son who is just beginning to get a zit here and there so I think it&#x27;s a good device for people with mild to moderate breakouts on small areas of the face. For acne that covers large areas of the face, I would look for a unit with a larger treatment head and a timer.or acne that covers large areas of the face, I would look for a unit with a larger treatment head and a timer.</li>
    <li> My wife has had ongoing acne issues for most of her life. She’s tried everything from gels, wipes, scrubs, washes and even the pricey Clarisonic. Most things seem to help, somewhat, but nothing seems to help fully. So we were excited to try out this Silk&#x27;n Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device has a good weight and feels sturdy and well built. Plastic is tough and not cheap. Button responds well and shouldn&#x27;t wear out over time. I like that there is a charging dock that the device easily slips into, making for better storage and room placement. My wife tested this device for about a month, and interestingly enough, some of her deeper acne issues have started to clear up a bit, giving this tool promise. That said, it also has flaws. For one, you have to hold the device on each affected are for several minutes. With my wife, that pretty much means moving it around her entire face, which to do properly, would take a good hour. Not only that, but the instructions say to do it twice a day, which means spending two hours of her day holding the device to her face. Not the most comfortable and time efficient of solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that she has to use her cell phone timer to see when the minutes are up. I can’t imagine why the manufacturer didn’t build a timer into the device. Even something as simple as a beep to let her know it’s time to move to a new area. The other issue we’ve come across is that the device isn’t always on. She holds it to her face, being careful not to bump the power button, but when she pulls away the blue light is off. This is an intermittent issue where some days it’s turning itself off constantly, and others more rarely. The problem is that we don’t know when it goes off or what is causing it. Holding the device to the face means you can’t see the light, so she she has to constantly check, which prolongs the process even further. It may be that we just have a fluky unit with some inner defect, but the only troubleshooting advice the manual gives states that the device needs to be recharged. Well, it is fully charged when the light goes off, so that’s not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless as to whether this is an issue for everyone or not, the lack of a timer and the length of time needed makes this solution less attractive. That said, if you have patience, and lots of time on your hands, or a more minor acne condition, there is evidence that it really does help to clear up some of the acne and redness.gives states that the device needs to be recharged.

    <li> My daughter loves this!</li>
    <li> Silk n Blue Acne Solution Device is an amazing product that works ! My son has terrible acne on his face,he used silkn blue on one side of his face to see if it works after a few days his face looked clean and clear. It was really unbelievable!! Now he has to use it on the other side. You use it by holding it on the affected area for a few minutes then move to the next spot . It works really well and I would highly recommend it !!! It is a great product !!!</li>
    <li> The Silk&#x27;n Blue Acne Solution Device is one of many products in a crowded market of skin and acne products.  After a short time with item, it does seem safe and easy to use.  It can be time consuming and results appear to be positive.  Of course, only long term usage can really determine the overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are easy to follow and using the device is simple to operate.  I will say that it takes time to cover the entire face (if needed), so that is something to keep in mind.  Covering limited affected areas is a little easier, but still time consuming.  It also seems a bit flimsy, so I would be concerned about its lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have notice some improvement over the short term.  I&#x27;d be interested to see how it goes over the recommended 6-8 weeks.  I found it best to use in evening when more time was available, but it is supposed to be used twice daily.  It gets warm, but nothing too terribly uncomfortable.  I think it&#x27;s worth adding this to your skincare treatment.  I still think other products might be necessary, but there has been some effectiveness after using the Silk&#x27;n Blue.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;So, what I like about it is that it&#x27;s lightweight...good thing or I&#x27;d never make it through all the time you have to spend holding it to your face...it charges quickly and does shrink zits.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or give me any other side effects, although it does get really warm on your face while in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I do think I would like it better if it would beep after the 3-4 minutes is up in one spot so that I would know I could move on to another spot on my face.  I also find it to be monotonous and hard to stick with doing it.  It&#x27;s pretty time consuming.</li>
    <li> It takes to much time but it work&#x27;s</li>
    <li> My daughter is ten with mild to severe acne across her forehead and upper lip.  We&#x27;ve be using this device religiously and exclusively (we discontinued using &amp;#34;acne cleansing pads&amp;#34;) for a few weeks, and have seen minimal changes.  We have noticed that this device seems to bring her acne spots to a head quicker, but the amount of pimples has little to no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an easy to use device, no pain involved, but it does add several minutes to her morning and evening routine.  We will move forward and keep using this device in hopes that more times will equal clearer results.</li>
    <li> I let me niece try this out since a teenager has lot more acne than an adult and here is the feedback after 3 days of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good&lt;br /&gt;* It seems to be working (will update in about 1-2 months)&lt;br /&gt;* Relatively harmless compared to all the creams and lotions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad&lt;br /&gt;* Takes time (actually patience) to apply this (about 5 mins daily)&lt;br /&gt;* Might get uncomfortable for some with the high heat generated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in about 6-8 weeks.  But right now with the initial usage - it certainly looks like a great buy</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve found the Silk&#x27;n Blue to be a really great alternative to both prescription and OTC medications for my skin problems. What I especially like with regard to that is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about side effects and adverse reactions with medications, as well as allergic reactions - such as contact dermatitis all the way to anaphylactic reactions. I&#x27;ve even had paradoxical reactions and in one case with a pretty common medicine had Stevens Johnson Syndrome - which no one would ever want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel very comfortable that I&#x27;m not going to have any of these reactions with the Silk&#x27;n Blue - I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far, and I&#x27;m finding my skin slowly clearing. My husband suggested I treat one area and leave another - so I can visibly compare the difference. This was a great idea, so I decided that was how I would go about comparing how well the Silk&#x27;n Blue is working for me. (I will post pictures IF they&#x27;re not too embarrassing!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the warmth of the Silk&#x27;n Blue on my skin. It&#x27;s a very gentle, soothing warmth, I&#x27;ve never felt any burning. The time investment isn&#x27;t much more than applying medications, and I feel that I&#x27;m doing something both safe for my skin, and good for my skin. There&#x27;s no smell as there often is with medications for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I&#x27;m slowly beginning to see positive results with the Silk&#x27;n Blue on my skin. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from hormonal acne (or any other type of acne).</li>
    <li> This is a relatively simple device and kit. What you&#x27;re getting is an upright charging stand and the blue-light device itself which is slightly thicker and approximately similar in size to a standard electric toothbrush without the brush head. Once the device is charged up (takes about 6 hours on the initial charge) the device is ready to go. To use, you simply turn it on and press the top surface against your skin.  At this point the blue light is activated and will gradually heat up (the manual says it can go up to 106F but it never feels too hot or unpleasant) as you keep the device pressed against your skin for 3-4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the device work? At this point, having used it for around a week it&#x27;s difficult to accurately gauge as the instructions recommend twice daily use on your skin and best results will take place after 3-7 weeks of continuous use. I will say that I did have a couple of early stage breakout spots that I treated for around 4 days and so far they have not progressed to a full stage breakout. I continue to treat the problem area daily and so far the results are holding up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device has a nice sleek to it and is simple to setup and use. The surface area could be a bit larger as it is triangular in shape with each side about 1\\&quot; long and so it will take around 30 minutes to cover the entirety of your face. Watching a TV show or reading through a book/magazine does make the time go by but you will certainly need a degree of patience in order to take full advantage of this product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this device; unfortunately, I kind of hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The blue light doesn&#x27;t always come on!  I thought maybe it was just shutting off really quickly, the instant I lifted the head off my skin, so I tried using it in a dark room, facing a mirror.  I could clearly see the blue light seeping around the edges when it was on, but sometimes, for no apparent reason, it just never came on.  Can you imagine spending half an hour patiently moving this thing around your face and it turns out it wasn&#x27;t even working?  After that, I found myself constantly checking to see if it was on.  There&#x27;s a load of blinking and flashing lights on this thing; they couldn&#x27;t have thrown in one to indicate when the blue light is on?&lt;br /&gt;*The lack of a timer is a real deal killer.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be that big of a deal, but setting a timer manually over and over again gets really tedious really fast, and if I don&#x27;t set  a timer, I forget to note the time or forget what I&#x27;m doing and go way over in application time.  Is that harmful to the skin?  The manual doesn&#x27;t address this.&lt;br /&gt;*The indicator lights are confusing and complicated.  I had to repeatedly refer to the manual to remember what they meant, and even then it wasn&#x27;t clear.  A green blinking light when you first turn it on could mean that it&#x27;s getting ready for use, or it could mean the batteries are low.&lt;br /&gt;*The manual recommends that you clean the head between uses with a \\&quot;specially formulated cleaner for electronic equipment.\\&quot;  Yes, this is the same head that you will then be smearing around on your face, so choose wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect the device to be perfect, but I did expect, at this price point, to hate it a little less.  I can&#x27;t say yet if it is actually effective or not, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to have the patience to give it a six-to-eight-week trial as recommended.  I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this device; it was sent to me for review purposes.  However, I&#x27;ll have to paytaxes on its full list price, and it is soooo not worth even that.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have the option of returning it to avoid the tax penalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may find this device useful, but I would highly recommend shopping around for a model that has more features (a timer, for example) over this one.</li>
    <li> I got this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I have had some trouble with breakouts around my chin and bottom of face, I think mostly because a new hair product I was using.  Anyway, I stopped using the hair product and thought maybe using the Silk&#x27;n Blue would help clear up this breakout.  I also breakout a lot during my monthly cycle and was hoping this would help with that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short I used it for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t really notice much difference either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice sleek device, it lasts a week or so on one charge and comes with a nice stand.  The blue LEDs turn on when the device is close to your face (you do have to power it on and then bring it close to your face for the lights to turn on).  It&#x27;s an interesting idea and similar to the Tanda (which I had previously used and had similar results with..that is to say not much change in skin quality).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main downfall to this device is that is incredibly time consuming to use.  Silk&#x27;n recommends treating the area for 2 minutes, 2 times a day for 6-8 weeks to see results.  Since I am reviewing this for Vine I only have 30 days to try it.  In reality though I only used it for a couple weeks once a day.  With the 2 minute per area treatment time it was taking me about 30 minutes to treat my face (just chin area and forehead).  It was just way too time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the area where you are holding it on your face gets pretty hot.  Maybe this will be nice in the winter, but in the summer it just makes your whole body sweat.  It&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable and my skin was red and poofy when I was done with a treatment.  I did the treatments at night and the poofiness and redness was gone by morning so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal..but my skin felt a bit raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a bit of trouble getting the light to come on.  I would turn it on and then wait a few seconds and put it up to my face, the light wouldn&#x27;t come on.  So I would turn it off and turn it back on and try again.  It did this every time I used it, so it always took a few minutes to get it running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I noticed absolutely no change in skin quality.  If you have really severe acne this might work better but for my occasional breakouts it didn&#x27;t seem to be all that effective.  I personally don&#x27;t have to time to keep using this giving the lack of benefit I was seeing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Sleek looking and easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Only have to charge weekly&lt;br /&gt;- Nice stand and charger&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t make my skin worse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Made my skin very hot, in the summer this made me uncomfortable and sweaty&lt;br /&gt;- Left my skin red and poofy and sensitive right after use (this went away by the next morning)&lt;br /&gt;- Took forever to treat a small area&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t notice any change in skin qualityd turn it back on and try again.

    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and already see BIG improvements, today I was able to go out without makeup, been a while since I could do that. I&#x27;ll try remember to write an update, but I&#x27;m already so relieved that I bought this!</li>
