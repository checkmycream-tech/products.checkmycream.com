### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best deodorant out there.</li>
      <li>I use this all the time with great results</li>
      <li>It smelled great until I put it on.  </li>
      <li>That sounds good but my experience is that it burns my skin.</li>
      <li>The unscented Tom&#x27;s is a good product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good ..  </li>
      <li>It was good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This new formula of Tom&#x27;s is one of the best!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s neutral scent makes it suitable for men and women.</li>
      <li>He has tried eveything and this is the only one that is perfect in every way.</li>
      <li>We love the apricot version.</li>
      <li>I tend to do some very intensive exercise during the weekends, up to the point where all of my clothes are soaked with sweat, but this stuff works great at keeping the odor away.</li>
      <li>I like many of the products</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t work for more than 4 hours.</li>
      <li>bought it to my sister in law, who is super sensitive  in the under arm area  , and she was very happy with it.</li>
      <li>The deodorant goes on easily and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Smell is a bit strong, and Calendula is not listed among its ingredients.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the smell, too.</li>
      <li>but I do wish it was still operated by the original owners.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t sweat much and Tom&#x27;s deodorant doesn&#x27;t work much better than not wearing deodorant all.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be a mild scent with Aloe and Calendula.</li>
      <li>It helped me overcome a mild rash I got from using a roll on harsher product.</li>
      <li>I recently gave Tom&#x27;s of Maine Calendula deodorant a try and was not only pleased with the natural ingredients and pleasant (not overbearing) scent, but I also have had no itching since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
      <li>This is a very soft and smooth deodorant.</li>
      <li>Great deodorant that is naturally healthier than those with aluminum and other toxic additives.</li>
      <li>On a particularly hot day, this is a definate no go.</li>
      <li>not my first one or my first Tom&#x27;s product  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my first one</li>
      <li>but yes my first one of this essence ..</li>
      <li>Like the concept and know several people who use this and remain stink - free, but this product doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product because it is natural, does not contain aluminum, and is gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>Luckily I did find another natural brand that works.</li>
      <li>May require more than a single application in a day.</li>
      <li>It costs a little more but there is no staining, no harsh chemicals, and it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like it that much ..  </li>
      <li>I really like TofM&#x27;s toothpaste</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, not too heavy or cloying.  </li>
      <li>As clearly shown in the picture of the product we thought we were ordering the Toms of Maine Original care natural deoderant stick, calendula.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Sooo if you want main woodspice, go ahead.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>We recommend this highly.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product-</li>
      <li>It is safe, green and I like this aroma.</li>
      <li>As most reviews indicate, the picture is not accurate for this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to under arm products and this did not cause a rash.</li>
      <li>I am trying a nother natural deordorant now.</li>
      <li>The photo is of the old Tom&#x27;s of Maine product.</li>
      <li>As I developed psoriasis under my arms deodorants became unbearable until I thought about the properties of calendula and tried the Tom&#x27;s Calendula Natural Deodorant...</li>
      <li>Nowhere near the protection that is claimed on the label.</li>
      <li>I have had occasional underarm itching, not ever really thinking it may be a reaction to the deodorant I was using.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>deos, and it has taken a long search to find something decent.  </li>
      <li>What arrived was the new \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; formula.</li>
      <li>It will be finding a new home without a single use.</li>

<li> However, what came to us was the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Long Lasting deoderant stick, calendula, which my husband is seriously allergic to (and we knew that prior to ordering which is why I specifically ordered the original care).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been able to use other deodorants and anti-perspirants in the past, but have always had to stop using them after a few months because they would cause a rash.  </li>
<li> They send you the newer, long lasting formula.</li>

<li> so frusturating as I had already spent two weeks searching for the proper product all around town to no avail</li>
<li> The description was not clear either as to what I was ordering.</li>
<li> Although it does not irritate like other deodorants, it only protects against odor for about 2 hours (if that)!  </li>
<li> so if you like lavender but want to try something a little different, buy calendula.</li>
<li> My husband is allergic to all other deodorants except this one scent from Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
<li> dunno why, but do prefer other ones ..</li>
<li> What the other reviews don&#x27;t say is that they&#x27;re also sending out the &amp;#34;maine woodspice&amp;#34; scent instead of Calendula.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;ve tried some deodorants that had such a thick scent that it clashed with my perfume!)  </li>
<li> For me it is next to useless.</li>
<li> it was a fail for me.</li>
<li> Sad.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t even get me through the day without my smelling stale.  </li>
<li> But I am allergic to it :-(</li>
<li> This deodorant is a real disappointment to me.  </li>

    <li> I use this all the time with great results</li>
    <li> Great deodorant that is naturally healthier than those with aluminum and other toxic additives. Does not stain. May require more than a single application in a day. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to under arm products and this did not cause a rash. However, it&#x27;s not long lasting, if you are physically active. Additionally, it left stains on my undershirts. I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been able to use other deodorants and anti-perspirants in the past, but have always had to stop using them after a few months because they would cause a rash.  I&#x27;ve been using deodorants from Tom&#x27;s of Maine for a couple of years and haven&#x27;t had to switch.  The scent is nice, not too heavy or cloying.  (I&#x27;ve tried some deodorants that had such a thick scent that it clashed with my perfume!)  The deodorant goes on easily and lasts all day.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have had occasional underarm itching, not ever really thinking it may be a reaction to the deodorant I was using. I recently gave Tom&#x27;s of Maine Calendula deodorant a try and was not only pleased with the natural ingredients and pleasant (not overbearing) scent, but I also have had no itching since I&#x27;ve been using it.  &lt;br /&gt;It also seems to me this deodorant lasts longer than the commercial brands I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m on my first one so we&#x27;ll see. I would highly recommend this product- and it&#x27;s neutral scent makes it suitable for men and women.</li>
    <li> As I developed psoriasis under my arms deodorants became unbearable until I thought about the properties of calendula and tried the Tom&#x27;s Calendula Natural Deodorant...It works!! [[ASIN:B00014D2OQ Toms Nat. Deodorant Stick 2.25z Calendula]]</li>
    <li> Although it does not irritate like other deodorants, it only protects against odor for about 2 hours (if that)!  Nowhere near the protection that is claimed on the label.</li>
    <li> The photo is of the old Tom&#x27;s of Maine product. What arrived was the new \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; formula. That sounds good but my experience is that it burns my skin. Numerous similar complaints exist here and on the Tom&#x27;s of Maine website.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft and smooth deodorant. It helped me overcome a mild rash I got from using a roll on harsher product.</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me at all.  I do have to say that a lot of deodorants don&#x27;t work well for me.  It smelled great until I put it on.  It smelled like a man&#x27;s deodorant on me.  Luckily I did find another natural brand that works.</li>
    <li> Smell is a bit strong, and Calendula is not listed among its ingredients. The unscented Tom&#x27;s is a good product.</li>
    <li> We love the apricot version. I thought this would be a mild scent with Aloe and Calendula. My daughter and I both can&#x27;t stand the scent. It will be finding a new home without a single use.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but it did not work. Let me revise that- it didn&#x27;t work for more than 4 hours. I would have to wash and reapply every 4 hours or I would smell.</li>
    <li> As clearly shown in the picture of the product we thought we were ordering the Toms of Maine Original care natural deoderant stick, calendula.  However, what came to us was the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Long Lasting deoderant stick, calendula, which my husband is seriously allergic to (and we knew that prior to ordering which is why I specifically ordered the original care).  The description was not clear either as to what I was ordering. UGGG! so frusturating as I had already spent two weeks searching for the proper product all around town to no avail so turned to Amazon and still don&#x27;t have what we need!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sweat much and Tom&#x27;s deodorant doesn&#x27;t work much better than not wearing deodorant all.  It also goes on super-slimey.</li>
    <li> I tend to do some very intensive exercise during the weekends, up to the point where all of my clothes are soaked with sweat, but this stuff works great at keeping the odor away. I really enjoy the smell, too.</li>
    <li> I really like TofM&#x27;s toothpaste so I decided to give the deodorant a try. it was a fail for me. On a particularly hot day, this is a definate no go. I had to buy a regular deodorant to use as a back up. I am trying a nother natural deordorant now.</li>
    <li> As most reviews indicate, the picture is not accurate for this product. They send you the newer, long lasting formula. What the other reviews don&#x27;t say is that they&#x27;re also sending out the &amp;#34;maine woodspice&amp;#34; scent instead of Calendula. Sooo if you want main woodspice, go ahead. Otherwise, you&#x27;re outta luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It costs a little more but there is no staining, no harsh chemicals, and it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant out there. It is safe, green and I like this aroma. Appreciate the fact that Tom&#x27;s now has 12 hour protection products. We recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> The cost was comparable to a store. I like many of the products but I do wish it was still operated by the original owners.</li>
    <li> It was good. But I am allergic to it :-(</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Tom&#x27;s deodorant because it&#x27;s made with organic ingredients. I have the lavender one and now I have the calendula. The calendula smells almost like the lavender one so if you like lavender but want to try something a little different, buy calendula.</li>
    <li> My husband is allergic to all other deodorants except this one scent from Tom&#x27;s of Maine. He has tried eveything and this is the only one that is perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product because it is natural, does not contain aluminum, and is gentle on my skin. The fragrance is light, not overwhelming. I love it!</li>
    <li> bought it to my sister in law, who is super sensitive  in the under arm area  , and she was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Actually the deodorant it&#x27;s good ..  not my first one or my first Tom&#x27;s product  but yes my first one of this essence ..and I don&#x27;t like it that much ..  dunno why, but do prefer other ones ..</li>
    <li> I am allergic to regular anti-pers. deos, and it has taken a long search to find something decent.  This new formula of Tom&#x27;s is one of the best!</li>
    <li> Like the concept and know several people who use this and remain stink - free, but this product doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh. Sad.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is a real disappointment to me.  It doesn&#x27;t even get me through the day without my smelling stale.  For me it is next to useless.</li>
