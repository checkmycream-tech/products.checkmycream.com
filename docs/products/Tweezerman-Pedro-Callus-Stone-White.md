      <li>Easy to clean and effective.  </li>
      <li>Much better than a pumice stone, really well made, works quickly and is even attractive.  </li>
      <li>For the money, there are much better products available.  </li>
      <li>Ergonomic handle, and a good size for fast foot work (not an iddy-biddy lady foot thing).</li>
      <li>, I find it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done very quickly</li>
      <li>Handle is designed well, easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Nothing special, it does the job and the price is okay.</li>
      <li>however I have not used the fine grit side which the literature says if for skin.</li>
      <li>My feet feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
      <li>No one would ever know looking at my smooth feet</li>
      <li>Comfortable.</li>
      <li>The rasp was also faster if not quite as comfortable.</li>
      <li>My feet were baby&#x27;s bottom smooth after just one use.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Long handle provides great leverage.</li>
      <li>Really functional I love it.</li>
      <li>Good and sturdy, I use it regularly.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, very sturdy, very well made, I use it in the shower every day, I recently picked one up for my boyfriend, he was impressed too and that&#x27;s not easy.</li>
      <li>but if you want effective with no regrets, then overlook its $20 cost.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast.!!</li>
      <li>The long handle is wonderful, and I like having the different textures on each side.  </li>
      <li>I love Tweezerman products because they are of consistent high quality.</li>
      <li>My heels look baby smooth now, and they were really cracked before.  </li>
      <li>The handle makes it very convenient and by the time you \\&quot;finish\\&quot; your feet with the smooth side, you will be smiling with delight.  </li>
      <li>Better than cheap feet exfoliators obviously and durable.</li>
      <li>I need a powerful and ergonomically designed stone to use in the shower and this one does not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>This design is wonderful:  the handle allows reach in every direction without cutting up fingers touching the stone.  </li>
      <li>I bought another one for the shelf so that when the first one gets used up, I have another one.  </li>
      <li>First callus stone I have ever used and</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect first time around</li>
      <li>I think I should go back and get more for gifts.</li>
      <li>Very convenient!  </li>
      <li>One side is rougher than the other which is nice when you have some tougher calluses to handle.</li>
      <li>My second one - and the first is still going strong.</li>
      <li>I get callus on my large toes from wearing work boots 12  hours a day, tried the DR scholls liquid, the pads, etc...</li>
      <li>The tear-drop shape allows for large and detail area work.</li>
      <li>The handle makes it easy to use, especially on the side of the foot where I cannot really see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
      <li>The two sides have noticeably different \\&quot;grits\\&quot; to them--easy to tell which is fast and which is fine</li>
      <li>More expensive than most but worth it.  </li>
      <li>I make sure my feet are thoroughly wet and soaked, and then I sit on a bed or chair and use this.</li>
      <li>It feels really well made.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t care how my feet look.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The money you save in not having to go to a professional is well worth investing in this product.</li>
      <li>This is a nice and heavy quality callus stone.</li>
      <li>I use it after-well honestly, I rarely have to use the other because my feet stay so smooth now.  </li>
      <li>Got this one for my husband and he can&#x27;t believe how much better this is than other</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get such a bargain, rushed home and started using it.</li>
      <li>One side is rough and the other side is more smooth.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommened product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I would Highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it as it works without being too abrassive.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, you can use the smoother finishing side, and it still works really well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra cost.</li>
      <li>Works very well to clear calluses off feet for a professional home pedicure.</li>
      <li>It was gentle and seemed to be making a slow but sure progress until I dropped it in the shower tub.</li>
      <li>but at the same time is very gentle on your feet.</li>
      <li>This is my second one, the first lasted well over 8 years.</li>
      <li>&quot; stone works fine, wet or dry.</li>
      <li>I dropped my first one a couple of times without breaking but be careful, it&#x27;s ceramic, it can break.</li>
      <li>I used the rough side at first of course then used to smoother side to finish things off.</li>
      <li>In general I am a tweezerman fan.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good and sturdy, I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I have Shrek feet and this works well.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my podiatrist.  It is a perfect size, is easy to hold and control.  There are two stones, one for smoothing and one for getting the calluses off.  This works great!  I bought another one for the shelf so that when the first one gets used up, I have another one.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> In general I am a tweezerman fan.  This product is not one of their better items. For the money, there are much better products available.  I will keep it but would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Tweezerman Pedro Callus Stone eight years ago.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> I use the Pedi Egg to get the very rough stuff from hiking and not-so-good-a-fit gardening clogs.  Then my yoga teacher told me about this product, so I use it after-well honestly, I rarely have to use the other because my feet stay so smooth now.  This Callus Stone is the best I&#x27;ve ever used in my 53 years.  The handle makes it very convenient and by the time you \\&quot;finish\\&quot; your feet with the smooth side, you will be smiling with delight.  Easy to clean and effective.  The money you save in not having to go to a professional is well worth investing in this product.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman products.  I need a powerful and ergonomically designed stone to use in the shower and this one does not disappoint.  The coarse side really works on tough calluses.  The smoother side polishes and smooths the skin after you have sloughed off the callus with the coarse side.  This is the best hand-held stone I have found yet.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t care how my feet look. I just want them to feel good. This \\&quot;callus\\&quot; stone works fine, wet or dry. Maybe men&#x27;s feet and skin are different from women&#x27;s, but I found that the Tweezerman&#x27;s rasp on the end of the callous remover did just as well and for a dual purpose tool, was half the price. The rasp was also faster if not quite as comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is my second Tweezerman.  I use it regularly.  Highly recommend it as it works without being too abrassive.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every foot-smoothing method known to man.  However, the Pedro is, by far, the best.  It&#x27;s rough enough to take care of the callouses but not so rough to hurt the skin.  The handle makes it easy to use, especially on the side of the foot where I cannot really see what I&#x27;m doing.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products and this is the one.  My heels look baby smooth now, and they were really cracked before.  I giving these for presents.</li>
    <li> I bought this same Tweezerman Pedro Callus Stone at the TJ Maxx for less than 1/2 the price listed here this past week. I was really excited to get such a bargain, rushed home and started using it. It was gentle and seemed to be making a slow but sure progress until I dropped it in the shower tub. It broke into 4 irreparable pieces!!! And this was just a drop from a shower stand a foot or two above... I cannot believe Tweezerman makes such a flimsy product! I&#x27;m glad I did not pay $20 for it. I&#x27;m disappointed but not ready to give up on the  brand, so I am ordering the Tweezerman Spa Callus Smoother from Amazon as we speak. *Fingers crossed*</li>
    <li> The handle is perfect, it makes it easy to work with in the shower.  But I wish the stone was rougher, I find it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done very quickly and I don&#x27;t want to spend 5 minutes per foot in the shower...</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I anticipate it will last a long time before needing to be replaced like the cheaper versions that fall apart.</li>
    <li> This  is the best one I have ever owned.You won&#x27;t believe the difference.Love it !!! Got this one for my husband and he can&#x27;t believe how much better this is than other we have tried. Shipping was super fast.!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised....excellent product.</li>
    <li> This works great on feet and toes, and it does not harm the skin. But I use this after a shower. I make sure my feet are thoroughly wet and soaked, and then I sit on a bed or chair and use this. I tried to use it while standing on one foot in the shower and trying to scrub my other foot with it, and I almost slipped and fell down! If you have sensitive skin, you can use the smoother finishing side, and it still works really well.</li>
    <li> I love this pumice stone best one I have ever owned and I&#x27;ve owned many</li>
    <li> This is my second one, the first lasted well over 8 years. Handle is designed well, easy to hold. Rough enough to really scrub w/out hurting. I dropped my first one a couple of times without breaking but be careful, it&#x27;s ceramic, it can break. Eventually mine did, one to many drops.</li>
    <li> Smooths out the callouses perfectly.  I love this.  My feet feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  I don&#x27;t know how I livws without it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  One side is rough and the other side is more smooth.  It removes the extra callused skin on the back of the heel to avoid cracking, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous callus products and this truly is the best I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> This tool is a little pricey but if you want effective with no regrets, then overlook its $20 cost.  My feet were baby&#x27;s bottom smooth after just one use.  It has two sides however I have not used the fine grit side which the literature says if for skin.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something with a little longer handle.  This is the same as going to Wal... so I can&#x27;t complain.  Nothing special, it does the job and the price is okay.</li>
    <li> This is a nice and heavy quality callus stone. It feels really well made. It feels like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best callous stone I&#x27;ve ever used.  Much better than a pumice stone, really well made, works quickly and is even attractive.  I got mine at Walgreen&#x27;s for about $9.  I think I should go back and get more for gifts.</li>
    <li> More expensive than most but worth it.  Great design, easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to treat feet. The two sides have noticeably different \\&quot;grits\\&quot; to them--easy to tell which is fast and which is fine (I hate a file that I can&#x27;t tell a difference on, don&#x27;t you??). Ergonomic handle, and a good size for fast foot work (not an iddy-biddy lady foot thing). The tear-drop shape allows for large and detail area work.</li>
    <li> I got this in my stocking this morning, and used it in the shower today. I let my feet soak in epsom salt water in the bathtub while I showered. I have NEVER had anything work so fanastic on my nasty feet. No &amp;#34;mom feet&amp;#34; for me. I would Highly recommend this.  I followed it up with some MadeOn hard lotion. No one would ever know looking at my smooth feet how bad they looked at the beginning of the day.</li>
    <li> Got this for a family member for Christmas. He has rough, cracked feet. He says that it works perfectly and his feet felt nice and smooth after a good 10 minute soak in the tub followed by some exfoliation from the Callus Stone. The handle is ergonomic. One side is rougher than the other which is nice when you have some tougher calluses to handle. I love Tweezerman products because they are of consistent high quality. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Simply don&#x27;t buy it.  It does not work at all.  Every time I tried to use it, I realized that it was useless.</li>
    <li> Durable. Comfortable. It meets or exceeds all expectations. Works wonders on callused feet. Highly recommened product. My second one - and the first is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Really functional I love it. Better than cheap feet exfoliators obviously and durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and my feet thank me. It works great after a shower to keep callouses in check. Though I used to have problems with my feet and hard shoes, I no longer suffer the corns and callouses that would cause me so much grief. A great investment.</li>
    <li> First callus stone I have ever used and it worked great. I get callus on my large toes from wearing work boots 12  hours a day, tried the DR scholls liquid, the pads, etc... they barely worked and only removed a small layer of skin. With this stone I got all of the callus removed no problem. In fact I am embarrased to admitt this but I got a little too caried away and took a little skin away leaving a sore spot. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect first time around but now I know! I used the rough side at first of course then used to smoother side to finish things off. Not ever going to do without this stone again.</li>
    <li> Works very well to clear calluses off feet for a professional home pedicure.</li>
    <li> This is the second Tweezerman Pedro I have owned.  I&#x27;ve had the first one for many years, and it still works great.  I bought this one to keep at our vacation home.  I briefly tried less expensive stones, but this one has them all beat.  The long handle is wonderful, and I like having the different textures on each side.  It&#x27;s worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but you can use it for years. Long handle provides great leverage. Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, very sturdy, very well made, I use it in the shower every day, I recently picked one up for my boyfriend, he was impressed too and that&#x27;s not easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m raving about Pedro!  These are the 3 I bought for our children, bring the number I&#x27;ve purchased to FIVE!  This design is wonderful:  the handle allows reach in every direction without cutting up fingers touching the stone.  Two abrasion levels.  Very convenient!  Worth the price!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the best foot thingy ever and well worth ever cent. My sister bought one for me and I fell in love with it and I bought one for my friend and she loves is. I will never use anything else, only these.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I go barefooted a lot and my feet get calluses because of that but the Tweezerman Pedro Callus Stone keeps my feet looking young and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This product works great but at the same time is very gentle on your feet. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
