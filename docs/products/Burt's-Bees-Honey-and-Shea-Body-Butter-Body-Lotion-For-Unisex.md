      <li>for years and loved it.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Smells good and moisturizes quite well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so good to meet my expectation.</li>
      <li>I loved the smell and the texture.</li>
      <li>The old formula was great smelling and wonderful on the skin.</li>
      <li>The honey smell I loved is gone and the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; product smells very strongly like old-fashioned baby talc.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very a strong scent and not in a good way.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>The original Burts Bee&#x27;s Thoroughly Theraputic Honey and Shea Butter was great, I loved it.</li>
      <li>The smell was amazing.</li>
      <li>It was so nice...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
      <li>but it does absorb nicely into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I bought this nice creamy cream for my sis.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>It has a sourish finish to it that honestly turned my stomach.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(and it also doesn&#x27;t moisturize much better than a lotion), but I think their aloe &amp; buttermilk and cocoa &amp; cupauco lotions smell much better and make moisturizing so much more pleasant.</li>
      <li>the smell is ok,  wasn&#x27;t over the top about it,  and it moisturizes ok,  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this body butter and the smell is divine.  </li>
      <li>I used to love this product, before the formula was changed.</li>
      <li>We used to love this stuff</li>
      <li>smooth like silk and smells so nice, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the fragrance and my skin loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>There are many better alternatives to this body butter.</li>
      <li>The texture now is much more like thicker lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most moisturizing one I&#x27;ve found</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body butter.  </li>
      <li>cheaper ,also love it on me..</li>
      <li>LOVE It</li>
      <li>but I value my marriage more than this cream.</li>
      <li>This product was one of my favorite smelling body products I&#x27;d ever bought</li>
      <li>Using subscribe and save this is priced much better on amazon than at walmart.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to believe that Burt&#x27;s Bees wouldn&#x27;t change my favorite body butter ever.</li>
      <li>Ok, why is a man writing about body butter?</li>
      <li>This is hands-down my favorite beauty product.  </li>
      <li>Use it on my dogs belly, he gets rashes,much better then steroids , etc also</li>
      <li>The old Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter had a pleasant scent that didn&#x27;t wear out its welcome, and it had a nice, consistent, buttery texture.</li>
      <li>Great Natural choice</li>
      <li>, my cuticles are healthy, and as a result, my nails look fabulous.</li>
      <li>I put on good moisturizers and it really helps,  </li>
      <li>I find it clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I guess I will switch to Yes to Carrots, which isn&#x27;t as good as the original Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Theraputic Honey and Shea Butter, but is a far better choice than this \\&quot;new\\&quot; version.</li>
      <li>New recipe that does not have the scent or thickness of the product I LOVED that it replaced.</li>
      <li>you will probably be fine with this one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a natural smell to me, although I agree it would be nice if it smelled like honey.</li>
      <li>LOVED the old version...</li>
      <li>I used to love this product and it smelled sweet &amp; mild like honey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll always love Burts Bees and this product is no exception - excellent for those of us with dry but sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I mix a small amount of almond oil in with this, and it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>It used to smell like sweet honey.</li>
      <li>This used to be my absolute favorite body butter.</li>
      <li>I personally will NEVER buy this product again which is a shame since I loved it before...</li>
      <li>Other body butters I&#x27;ve tried feel great going on,</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>Takes a minute to soak in, so don&#x27;t put your clothes on right away.</li>
      <li>Normally, I use olive oil as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>Stuff is great for hands or feet or anything that is dry and cracked and needs a little help. :-)</li>
      <li>I do have to say that I preferred the original product consistency-wise,  but there is nothing about the new smell that bothers me.</li>
      <li>have used this cream ever since she first use it .&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
      <li>I will say though if you like the smell of the other body butter that it is better at being absorbed in your skin and isn&#x27;t as sticky after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>The texture of it in the tub is more of a regular thick lotion, then a body butter, but as you apply it to your skin it thickens into more of a traditional body butter, I live in California and this winter has been very drying to my skin, I had tried other body butters but this one was the most moisturizing, it absorbed quickly, left my skin smooth soft and with a nice healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>So, I really only bought about 3.5 ounces for FULL PRICE!</li>
      <li>Not too watery, not sticky or oily, not smelly, also suitable for other body parts.  </li>
      <li>It is an unusual scent, but to me it&#x27;s not offensive, and it seems to smell nicer once it&#x27;s on my skin.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t take care of your skin here (anywhere really), you&#x27;ll regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was going to use up the whole thing till the end</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wear it if I&#x27;m going out of the house, not that it&#x27;s very helpful anyway.</li>
      <li>I really wonder why they decided to change the formula.</li>
      <li>There is no way of knowing how much you are really getting until you peel off the foil.</li>
      <li>When I first opened the new body butter</li>
      <li>Bring back the original Body Butter, please.</li>
      <li>I just purchased a \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; container of it, and the smell reeks now!</li>
      <li>but it came highly recommended</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent of the cranberry and pomegranate body butter from Burt&#x27;s is a little better but still smells off</li>
      <li>They also have a new cranberry pomegranate body butter I also tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Things I like about this new formula:&lt;br</li>
      <li>but then they lose their moisturizing qualities quickly and my skin feels dry again.  </li>
      <li>It is a eco friendly alternative to some other mainstream products and works just as well.  </li>
      <li>Looks like the original Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey and Shea Body Butter, but this particular one is a waste of money.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this product if you are expecting the old honey body butter.</li>
      <li>My daughter who has sensitive skin loves this</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin soft</li>
      <li>and the odor was not close to the old one.  </li>
      <li>users whose supply is nearly gone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the old version of this product...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they couldn&#x27;t have just changed the formula without completely changing the product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It gets 2 stars for being a natural product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My Husband loves this lotion!  Great Natural choice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good to meet my expectation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin soft</li>
    <li> This was a gift but it came highly recommended</li>
    <li> LOVED the old version...this version is very disappointing.  Not as \\&quot;buttery\\&quot; and the odor was not close to the old one.  Boo.  I used it up, but did not re-order.  Bring back the old version!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product. Looks like the original Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey and Shea Body Butter, but this particular one is a waste of money. The smell is so awful! Can&#x27;t even put it on w/o getting nauseous.</li>
    <li> Smells good and moisturizes quite well.  Takes a minute to soak in, so don&#x27;t put your clothes on right away.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product I used before. The consistency is completely different. It stinks and doesn&#x27;t have the same healing powers that the old formula had. I used to make products for a natural skin care line. The souffle we made was made from a base that is exactly the same consistency as this product. There was no bees wax in it and we didn&#x27;t put bees wax in the base. If there is any bees wax in this at all it is not enough to contribute to the healing powers this product is designed for. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product. The formula was perfect. I am turned off by Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down my favorite beauty product.  I put it on my hands, neck and elbows multiple times a day, and I keep it on my nightstand so I can use it before bed.  My hands don&#x27;t dry out anymore, my cuticles are healthy, and as a result, my nails look fabulous. I do have to say that I preferred the original product consistency-wise,  but there is nothing about the new smell that bothers me. I find it clean and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I use this one my hands.  It softens and sooths dry hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as part of a holiday set. I really just wanted the other product included in the set, but once I tried this, I was pleasantly surprised! This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried recently that actually moisturizes and softens my super dry hands. And it does so instantly! It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. It does have a strong scent, but I don&#x27;t find it to be a bad scent. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> It smells horrible but it does keep my skin a bit more softened.  Again, smells awful!!!</li>
    <li> the smell is ok,  wasn&#x27;t over the top about it,  and it moisturizes ok,  just didn&#x27;t do what I needed.  I have diabetes and my skin is so itchy at times, when it itches,  ( I think dry)  I put on good moisturizers and it really helps,  this was a big disappointment.  sorry  will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this nice creamy cream for my sis.&lt;br /&gt;She have used this cream ever since she first use it .&lt;br /&gt;Smell may not good for some people though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always love Burts Bees and this product is no exception - excellent for those of us with dry but sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve yet to have a reaction, even though it&#x27;s scented.</li>
    <li> the product works great</li>
    <li> LOVE It ... works so great - too bad Target will not bring back.</li>
    <li> The original Burts Bee&#x27;s Thoroughly Theraputic Honey and Shea Butter was great, I loved it. It was thick, smelled pleasant, and was one of the few lotions or creams that didn&#x27;t burn where I have eczema. The \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; formula smells awful, it&#x27;s very a strong scent and not in a good way. Also the only thing that lasts is the awful scent, my skin feels dry again in less than 10 minutes. The \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula also burns when first applied to my hands where I have eczema year round. It&#x27;s very disappointing, I will not purchase this version ever again. I guess I will switch to Yes to Carrots, which isn&#x27;t as good as the original Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Theraputic Honey and Shea Butter, but is a far better choice than this \\&quot;new\\&quot; version. I hope Burt&#x27;s Bees reads the reviews and considers going back to the old formula.</li>
    <li> My daughter who has sensitive skin loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend it to my friends who are looking for something.</li>
    <li> The old formula was great smelling and wonderful on the skin. This new formula cream smells rancid and has a terrible texture. I wish they would go back to the old formula. This is giving them a bad reputation.</li>
    <li> I mix a small amount of almond oil in with this, and it is wonderful. Best moisturizer ever.</li>
    <li> This hand cream used to smell like honey. Now it&#x27;s flowers and chemical smell. It doesn&#x27;t have the same texture. Wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the formula!</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells great and moisturizes well without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I used to suffer from painful, cracking feet that would bleed, with deep cracks in my heels and on the ball of my foot.  I use this every morning before I put on my socks or sandals.  With continuous use, no more pain or cracking, dry skin.  Not too watery, not sticky or oily, not smelly, also suitable for other body parts.  Using subscribe and save this is priced much better on amazon than at walmart.</li>
    <li> Always and forever I love this body butter ! ! .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the old version of this product... Thoroughly Theraputic Honey and Shea Butter... for years and loved it. I loved the smell and the texture. When they said they were improving the product it made sense to me to try it. When it arrived I was very disappointed. It smells completely different and has a different texture. If you like the smell of their other product the Coca Butter and Macadamia Nut body butter... you will probably be fine with this one.  It has the scent of stale coconut mixed with something that smells sort of like play dough to me. My husband thought it smelled vaguely like vanilla ice cream.  The texture now is much more like thicker lotion. The batch I got was separated too like the ingredients weren&#x27;t mixed well. I personally will NEVER buy this product again which is a shame since I loved it before... I just can&#x27;t get past the smell. I will say though if you like the smell of the other body butter that it is better at being absorbed in your skin and isn&#x27;t as sticky after it&#x27;s applied. but it&#x27;s a no go for me. I am so disappointed. I don&#x27;t understand why they couldn&#x27;t have just changed the formula without completely changing the product. They also have a new cranberry pomegranate body butter I also tried. It&#x27;s not quite as bad but smells a little too much like bubble gum to me.</li>
    <li> smooth like silk and smells so nice, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the fragrance and my skin loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to smells, but this is AWFUL! I can&#x27;t even give it away!</li>
    <li> The smell of this cream is so awful my husband decided to sleep on the couch because he could not stand the &amp;#34;bug spray&amp;#34; smell. I was going to use up the whole thing till the end but I value my marriage more than this cream.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product, before the formula was changed. The old Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter had a pleasant scent that didn&#x27;t wear out its welcome, and it had a nice, consistent, buttery texture. It was so nice... unfortunately, Burt&#x27;s Bees changed their formula, and the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; Honey &amp; Shea is awful. The smell is overpowering, and it&#x27;s not even pleasant. When I first opened the new body butter I thought it had gone bad. Just being in the same room as an open container makes my eyes itch, it makes my ears itch, it makes my throat sore, it makes me nauseated. I tried really hard to learn to like it, but I just can&#x27;t deal. It&#x27;s so gross. I don&#x27;t know who cleared this decision but it must have been someone without mucous membranes. Plus, it&#x27;s not buttery anymore, it&#x27;s like smearing lumpy yogurt on your body-- I don&#x27;t know why they put it in this container instead of a squeeze bottle. This stuff is an assault on the senses.</li>
    <li> Stuff is great for hands or feet or anything that is dry and cracked and needs a little help. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. This product was one of my favorite smelling body products I&#x27;d ever bought and now they&#x27;ve ruined it. It used to smell like sweet honey. Now it smells like stale chocolate and it&#x27;s VERY watered down, almost runny, not buttery at all. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Use it on my dogs belly, he gets rashes,much better then steroids , etc also cheaper ,also love it on me..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body butter.  I have very dry skin and generally use body butter rather than lotion, and I&#x27;ve tried many other body butters, some much more expensive than this one.  I&#x27;ve stopped trying all the others and I now use Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter exclusively.  Other body butters I&#x27;ve tried feel great going on, but then they lose their moisturizing qualities quickly and my skin feels dry again.  Not so with this one.  It&#x27;s the most moisturizing one I&#x27;ve found, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it continues to moisturize throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve read quite a few reviews that talk about the scent, and there seem to be a lot of people who don&#x27;t like it.  I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  It is an unusual scent, but to me it&#x27;s not offensive, and it seems to smell nicer once it&#x27;s on my skin.  It&#x27;s more of a natural smell to me, although I agree it would be nice if it smelled like honey.</li>
    <li> Some of the product sold by &amp;#34;Get it Wholesale&amp;#34; was defective, although priced low enough to make it almost the same as normal.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of this product for several years now.  It is a eco friendly alternative to some other mainstream products and works just as well.  Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> I used to love this product and it smelled sweet &amp; mild like honey. A little goes a long way, so I was using my last container for a year and when it ran out I ordered another one and didn&#x27;t think twice about the updates on the label. The honey smell I loved is gone and the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; product smells very strongly like old-fashioned baby talc. Moral of the story: go to the store and try the new Burt&#x27;s Bees products before you automatically repurchase old favorites.</li>
    <li> Living in the desert, my skin is usually dry anyway.  Normally, I use olive oil as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s fine.  But it just doesn&#x27;t cut it when I add in pregnancy hormones:  I literally scratch myself bloody.  But this body butter stops all that and I can be &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; again!  Yay for Burt&#x27;s Bees!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body butter and the smell is divine.  It smells like chocolate pudding.  I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers are talking about with the New and Improved on the label.  Mine does not say anything other than Honey &amp; Shea Body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this product 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t quite provide the level of moisture I was expecting but it does absorb nicely into my skin.  I usually put coconut oil on my skin first and then the body butter to get additional moisture and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> The texture of it in the tub is more of a regular thick lotion, then a body butter, but as you apply it to your skin it thickens into more of a traditional body butter, I live in California and this winter has been very drying to my skin, I had tried other body butters but this one was the most moisturizing, it absorbed quickly, left my skin smooth soft and with a nice healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion, it works like magic. I joined to get a discount with a subscription.  We use several products from Burt&#x27;s bees</li>
    <li> New recipe that does not have the scent or thickness of the product I LOVED that it replaced. Bring back the original Body Butter, please.</li>
    <li> The product is nice, but when I removed the foil I was shocked to discover that the jar was only half full! So, I really only bought about 3.5 ounces for FULL PRICE! There is no way of knowing how much you are really getting until you peel off the foil. I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy this one again!  I felt like it was a rip-off!</li>
    <li> CON: There is a strong &amp;#34;clayish&amp;#34; odor at first when you apply this, then it turns into a faint honey smell after a while that stays on your body all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: This new formula actually moisturizes all day. It is not other lotions that just apply water and oil on the outside of your skin. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This smells like a sweet bakery experiment gone totally wrong!! I regret that I didn&#x27;t throw this out upon opening it for the first time, and that I actually applied it to my skin since I now have to smell it--and after an hour, the awful smell is still there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 2 stars for being a natural product. The consistency is more like a thick lotion, not a body butter, and it was not as moisturizing as it should have been. My skin feels softer but it is not worth the smell!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the cranberry and pomegranate body butter from Burt&#x27;s is a little better but still smells off (and it also doesn&#x27;t moisturize much better than a lotion), but I think their aloe &amp; buttermilk and cocoa &amp; cupauco lotions smell much better and make moisturizing so much more pleasant. Other natural products of similar cost are Alba (their body creams in kukui nut, papaya mango and coconut are excellent!!), Jason cocoa butter body butter, and Nourish raw organic shea butter--which is the only shea butter I&#x27;ve found to melt in my hands well enough to easily apply. There are many better alternatives to this body butter.</li>
    <li> This used to be my absolute favorite body butter. The smell was amazing. I just purchased a \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; container of it, and the smell reeks now! It&#x27;s disgusting and is nothing like the old product. I hate it. Bah!</li>
    <li> Ok, why is a man writing about body butter? Because I live in Vegas and it&#x27;s ridiculously dry here. If you don&#x27;t take care of your skin here (anywhere really), you&#x27;ll regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and doubted them--I shouldn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too am one of the &amp;#34;old formula&amp;#34; users whose supply is nearly gone. I wanted to believe that Burt&#x27;s Bees wouldn&#x27;t change my favorite body butter ever. They did. For the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like about this new formula:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;1.) The smell. Horrible. It has a sourish finish to it that honestly turned my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The feel. It&#x27;s greasy. Your skin doesn&#x27;t feel hydrated it feels slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that this Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter is 180 degrees from what it used to be. Don&#x27;t buy it. You&#x27;ll be disappointed. I really wonder why they decided to change the formula. I wish they hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The best butter for your body ever.  Have dry skin this is the answer.  Great for after shower or bath.</li>
    <li> This is the thinnest body butter I have ever used. Also it smells really bad. I can&#x27;t wear it if I&#x27;m going out of the house, not that it&#x27;s very helpful anyway. In fact, I threw it out.</li>
    <li> We used to love this stuff but now it is a terrible consistency and odor with less effectiveness.  Do not buy this product if you are expecting the old honey body butter.</li>
