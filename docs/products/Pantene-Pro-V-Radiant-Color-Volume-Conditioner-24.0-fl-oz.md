    <li> This was a lighting deal not to long ago and I bought it.  I have enough hair conditioner for quite awhile.  These are nice huge bottles, work great on my colored hair and make combing it wet very easy.  I had my hair cut about shoulder length recently and the conditioner does not weigh it down, it actually helps give it some fullness which I need with my thin hair.  Once again, a good price, good product and a package of three large bottles will last quite awhile even with me washing my hair every day.</li>
