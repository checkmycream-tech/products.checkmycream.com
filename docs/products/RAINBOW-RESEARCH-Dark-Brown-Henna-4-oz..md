      <li>Okay, no problem.</li>

      <li>I love Rainbow</li>
      <li>Love no chemicals</li>
      <li>It gives a natural  beautiful color.</li>
      <li>Does not work that great Colorado stay only for a week</li>
      <li>hair was a light orangish brown with two inches of medium ash brown roots.</li>
      <li>If you try to use it in the same way, you won&#x27;t be happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Take care to mix until smooth, no grains at all.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
      <li>I Like that its an all natural product thats why I gave it more then 1 star !</li>
      <li>Or you can periodically blow dry or sit in a very warm room .&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried Henna Rainbow yesterday for the first time (this brand) and I must say that it is a good product, it covers the grays and leaves the hair shinny and soft.</li>
      <li>I wrap the cap in an old towel to keep my hair warm.</li>
      <li>I exclusively use henna to color my hair and have for over a year now, and bought this because I needed to do a last-minute quick touch up and didn&#x27;t have time to do a 2-step</li>
      <li>color is always consistent and I feel good knowing that I am using a product that won&#x27;t cause me health issues later to get the color I want today.  </li>
      <li>once you figure out what works for you, you will never go back to toxic dyes!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Healthy Hair to you!</li>
      <li>The final result is good, the hair is really shinny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of mixing powder and water and putting it on my hair, but my dad seemed to like the natural look of it better than dye.</li>
      <li>rinse in warm (not hot) water until smooth.  </li>
      <li>a hair color touch-up brush to mix the henna power very very well.</li>
      <li>I used hot tap water until the consistency of cake batter.</li>
      <li>mix with hot coffee instead of water.</li>
      <li>you may put some conditioner on the ends to comb out your hair to help loosen the caked on henna, but do not shampoo the first day.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>so I bought Rainbow Henna based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Good product darkened hair but leaves a smell for days and very messy</li>
      <li>it got chunks all over the place and as much water as I added it was still crumbly.</li>
      <li>wash hair very well with clarifying shampoo in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Covered the orange and didn&#x27;t take as much on my virgin hair</li>
      <li>Looks okay and is really shiny but not what I expected.</li>
      <li>I mix it using very strong black coffee with a couple of tsp of apple cider vinegar to help cover grays.</li>
      <li>I followed a tip by letting it sit and process for 3-4 hours then left it in my hair for a full 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Our local rich-folks&#x27; super markets stopped carrying it.  </li>
      <li>I had a mixture of dark brown and light brown hair.</li>
      <li>It helps to apply it to the roots first with a brush and then go back through and cover it all.</li>
      <li>This may be necessary for very pale-skinned people - it has never stained my skin, and I do not use goo.  </li>
      <li>I developed an allergy to the Surya Henna</li>
      <li>. scoop some of the mixture into a paper cup then apply directly to the roots.</li>
      <li>use an old toothbrush or else</li>
      <li>if the mixture gets thick, mix in more</li>
      <li>Oh it colors but not dark brown,</li>
      <li>So far after a few weeks its faded but not as fast as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I have African American natural hair.</li>
      <li>This turned my hair more black than dark brown, and it felt really dry after I rinsed it out.</li>
      <li>apply henna once hair is almost completely dry, or is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

<li> use an old button down shirt and gloves.&lt;br</li>
<li> Turned a medium to dark brown, not a black brown, with redish highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have long hair</li>
<li> Wish it didn&#x27;t take do long!</li>
<li> I have mixed coarse/fine curly hair, and I use dark brown henna.  </li>
<li> and I still only need a half of a tub per application.</li>
<li> You can put it on your hair after shampooing (I just stay in the bathtub for about 20 mins) and then rinse it off with plain water and do not shampoo again until next day.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t actually dark brown .</li>
<li> Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen.</li>
<li> So now I get it for less money through Amazon.  </li>
<li> So think long and hard.</li>
<li> It was a little messy, but the clean up wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> If you want deeper color, leave it on a little longer.</li>
<li> Henna mixture should be a little runny - like milkshake consistency.  </li>
<li> Messy</li>
<li> It turned my hair green.</li>
<li> My hair smelt like a lake for a week and my bf didn&#x27;t want be around me half that time!</li>
<li> (I usually do a 2-step henna/indigo treatment which takes me literally all day).</li>
<li> Give yourself at least an hr to try to get this stuff all over your hair and don&#x27;t bother using a brush you need to just use your hands and squish it in like mud.</li>
<li> leave on the hair for at least 2 hours.  </li>
<li> It was so messy - splattered everywhere and impossible to rinse out.</li>
<li> Maybe the worst part, and Henna users know this, is the application part and time of waiting (I waited about 6 hours), but Henna Rainbow instructions suggest  to wait less (about an hour or an hour and a half).  </li>
<li> Horrible the power was green and that should have been a clue.  </li>
<li> Very depressing......</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Does not work that great Colorado stay only for a week</li>
    <li> I used this to cover my gray. It worked great and conditioned my hair beautifully.  It was a little messy, but the clean up wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I followed a tip by letting it sit and process for 3-4 hours then left it in my hair for a full 2 hours. After ringing it with warm water my hair was not even one shade darker!! My hair smelt like a lake for a week and my bf didn&#x27;t want be around me half that time! Very depressing......</li>
    <li> This stuff was a nightmare to apply... it got chunks all over the place and as much water as I added it was still crumbly. I Like that its an all natural product thats why I gave it more then 1 star ! Give yourself at least an hr to try to get this stuff all over your hair and don&#x27;t bother using a brush you need to just use your hands and squish it in like mud. So far after a few weeks its faded but not as fast as I thought it would. I will probably try another brand next time but still try Henna again.</li>
    <li> Since I have an allergic reaction to hair coloring,I have switched to Rainbow Research Henna hair coloring. It gives a natural  beautiful color. It adds shines and volume  to your hair. I do not have an allergic reaction to henna.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellent results. I used hot tap water until the consistency of cake batter. Applied immediately, left on for one hour. Turned a medium to dark brown, not a black brown, with redish highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a light orangish brown with two inches of medium ash brown roots. Covered the orange and didn&#x27;t take as much on my virgin hair so it looks like my hair is one color again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this henna!  I&#x27;ve been dying my regularly since I was a teenager, and starting using henna some years ago to try to prevent my hair from getting so damaged.  I developed an allergy to the Surya Henna I have been using (tremors, nausea, headache) so I bought Rainbow Henna based on all the positive reviews.  I am so glad I did!  I have gray roots, and this product covers exceptionally well and the color lasts for weeks.  I have mixed coarse/fine curly hair, and I use dark brown henna.  Here are my tips for success:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. wash hair very well with clarifying shampoo in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;2. apply henna once hair is almost completely dry, or is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. put the henna powder into a glass tupperware dish.  mix with hot coffee instead of water. do this on several layers of newspaper to protect both counter and the floor.&lt;br /&gt;4. use an old toothbrush or else a hair color touch-up brush to mix the henna power very very well. Henna mixture should be a little runny - like milkshake consistency.  Take care to mix until smooth, no grains at all.&lt;br /&gt;5. add two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, then mix again until smooth.&lt;br /&gt;6. use an old button down shirt and gloves.&lt;br /&gt;7. scoop some of the mixture into a paper cup then apply directly to the roots. if the mixture gets thick, mix in more coffee.&lt;br /&gt;8. put on a shower cap with elastic - and put cotton or papertowels around the edges to stop the drips. leave on the hair for at least 2 hours.  I wrap the cap in an old towel to keep my hair warm. Or you can periodically blow dry or sit in a very warm room .&lt;br /&gt;9. rinse in warm (not hot) water until smooth.  this will take time. you may put some conditioner on the ends to comb out your hair to help loosen the caked on henna, but do not shampoo the first day.&lt;br /&gt;This method works perfectly for me, every time, with this henna.</li>
    <li> Great color, easy to mix, to apply, and to clean up. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I exclusively use henna to color my hair and have for over a year now, and bought this because I needed to do a last-minute quick touch up and didn&#x27;t have time to do a 2-step (I usually do a 2-step henna/indigo treatment which takes me literally all day). I will never purchase this again! It was so messy - splattered everywhere and impossible to rinse out. I still have grainy bits of henna in my hair after washing, conditioning, combing and repeating. My hair also has a blue tinge which tells me that whatever additive they used to bring out the darker (brown) color is probably not the best quality. I&#x27;ll just leave it at you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> That henna is not for me I have African American natural hair. It turned my hair green. Horrible the power was green and that should have been a clue.  Oh it colors but not dark brown, green&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase this again</li>
    <li> good products item as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of mixing powder and water and putting it on my hair, but my dad seemed to like the natural look of it better than dye.</li>
    <li> I love Rainbow Henna!&lt;br /&gt;The color is always consistent and I feel good knowing that I am using a product that won&#x27;t cause me health issues later to get the color I want today.  I&#x27;ve used this brand since forever, and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that henna is not a chemical dye. If you try to use it in the same way, you won&#x27;t be happy with the results. Henna won&#x27;t hurt your hair. If you want deeper color, leave it on a little longer. I have a lot of gray roots, so I leave it on 2 1/2 - 3 hours to get the color I want  You might have to play with it some, but once you figure out what works for you, you will never go back to toxic dyes!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Healthy Hair to you!</li>
    <li> Good product darkened hair but leaves a smell for days and very messy</li>
    <li> I tried Henna Rainbow yesterday for the first time (this brand) and I must say that it is a good product, it covers the grays and leaves the hair shinny and soft. Maybe the worst part, and Henna users know this, is the application part and time of waiting (I waited about 6 hours), but Henna Rainbow instructions suggest  to wait less (about an hour or an hour and a half).  The final result is good, the hair is really shinny.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t actually dark brown . The white hair is not totally covered and it was red</li>
    <li> You do not need to use heat with this product.  You can put it on your hair after shampooing (I just stay in the bathtub for about 20 mins) and then rinse it off with plain water and do not shampoo again until next day.  The label says to put goo on your neck, ears, forehead, etc., so that the henna will not stain your skin.  This may be necessary for very pale-skinned people - it has never stained my skin, and I do not use goo.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades.  Our local rich-folks&#x27; super markets stopped carrying it.  So now I get it for less money through Amazon.  Okay, no problem.</li>
    <li> Henna has so many benefits but YOU CANNOT BLEACH OR USE REGULAR COLOR OVER IT. It will turn green/turquoise/purple, depending on what colors you are have used and are using. Chemical color over henna will literally disintegrate your hair. So think long and hard. Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen. You have to grow it all the way out. If you darken with henna bleach is the only way to lighten which you cannot do.. No salon can fix this mistake.</li>
    <li> Love this Henna. It always gives wonderful results. I mix it using very strong black coffee with a couple of tsp of apple cider vinegar to help cover grays. I also like to add a spoonful or two of Mahogany or another type of red to add some depth of color. You have to have your own gloves and cap. It helps to apply it to the roots first with a brush and then go back through and cover it all. I have long hair and I still only need a half of a tub per application.</li>
    <li> Messy and you have to leave on for hours and hours. I did 3 and almost no change. Wish it didn&#x27;t take do long! Love no chemicals but I think I prefer convenience!</li>
    <li> I had a mixture of dark brown and light brown hair. This turned my hair more black than dark brown, and it felt really dry after I rinsed it out. Looks okay and is really shiny but not what I expected.</li>
