      <li>It was soo cute when i got it.</li>
      <li>I love the design looks just like the photo, I bought the four seasons backpack.</li>
      <li>The smell was very overwhelming and made my stomach gurgle a bit…I had to put it in another room to air out before I carried it for the first time.</li>
      <li>Other than that, is perfect.</li>
      <li>It is easy to carry by the handle or as a pack.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s fine, for being under $20</li>
      <li>clasp holding one of the straps broke the very first time I wore it!  </li>
      <li>The inside of the bag seems like really cheap quality</li>
      <li>Comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll bump it up to two stars because of an easy return and a quick refund.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it from the moment I opened it because the graphic is blurry</li>
      <li>The price I think is cheap and worth it because of the style.</li>
      <li>I use this bag as a purse, the straps are very helpful for when I want to be hands free, and are easy to take off and put on the bag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute and cheap enough.</li>
      <li>A strap broke as I tried to connect it to the bag, right out of the package.  </li>
      <li>Also it arrived on the exact date it said it would.</li>
      <li>This is a very roomy, functional tote or purse!  </li>
      <li>Cute, but the metal piece attaching the clip to the backpack straps broke after only a couple of uses.</li>
      <li>The straps the first week</li>
      <li>zipper around, and it would be very convenient to have two pulls so it could be opened at the top without opening the entire pack.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty much</li>
      <li>The bag is beautiful itself although poorly crafted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute and everything, but I dont recommended you waste your money on it.</li>
      <li>would recommed it only to customers who are interested to wear a cute and fairly appealing backpack, once in a while, just to show off, but don&#x27;t care that the product is put together poorly, with cheap looking materials.</li>
      <li>Had a difficult (but not impossible) time communicating with the seller, who did end up refunding me for this item and were very kind.  </li>
      <li>I really like this pack and get lots of comments.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful small bag!</li>
      <li>It was better than expected, the leather is really nice and much bigger than the other bag.</li>
      <li>the right you could open just a small portion at the top to access the inside instead opening the whole thing each time and often spilling the contents out.</li>
      <li>Finally there is no outside pocke to keep an ATM card and car/house keys for easy access.</li>
      <li>Its cute very roomy doesn&#x27;t hv a smell like other review stated, only dwn side is its a one way zipper..</li>
      <li>If you want to be different but still fashionable this is the right backpack.</li>
      <li>the bag is cute but smaller than i expected.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the zipper is cheaply made and zip smoothly.</li>
      <li>It works for what I need it for, the only problem with it was the chemically smell when I first got it.</li>
      <li>much so I am giving regift it to her as a present.</li>
      <li>I like it because it was small fit for all things I need when travel out of town on the bus</li>
      <li>This backpack has an interesting visual appeal, but is of poor quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its cute very roomy doesn&#x27;t hv a smell like other review stated, only dwn side is its a one way zipper.. I&#x27;m taking it off and replacing with a 2 part zipper.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bag. My only complaint is that the zipper is cheaply made and zip smoothly. Other than that, is perfect. I get compliments every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it from the moment I opened it because the graphic is blurry (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just the way it is supposed to be, or if mine was just a lousy print) but for the price, I decided to overlook it and keep the bag.  However, the (metal?) clasp holding one of the straps broke the very first time I wore it!  This will be getting sent back. Update: I&#x27;ll bump it up to two stars because of an easy return and a quick refund.</li>
    <li> I like it because it was small fit for all things I need when travel out of town on the bus</li>
    <li> very nice bag , my wife loved it.</li>
    <li> 15 days after I received this backpack it started falling apart</li>
    <li> I really like this pack and get lots of comments. It is easy to carry by the handle or as a pack. The only negative is that it has one rough (perhaps cheap?) zipper around, and it would be very convenient to have two pulls so it could be opened at the top without opening the entire pack.</li>
    <li> The zipper was difficult to use, My husband used a sop bar to smooth out the slideing motion it still continually hung up. As well there is only one zipper pull.  so you have to unzip the purse all the way from one side to the other to access the inside. If it had a two zipper pulls, one one the left, one one the right you could open just a small portion at the top to access the inside instead opening the whole thing each time and often spilling the contents out. Finally there is no outside pocke to keep an ATM card and car/house keys for easy access. I don&#x27;t like my sister much so I am giving regift it to her as a present. I am such a wonder relative.</li>
    <li> the bag is cute but smaller than i expected. however after 2 days it started falling apart. after the 3rd day of use the zipper broke. would have like to return it but since it came from China it wouldnt work out in my favor</li>
    <li> It was soo cute when i got it. But the problem was I had to many problems with the zipper, it was difficult to use. Not even a month after i got it the zipper broke. It&#x27;s super cute and everything, but I dont recommended you waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful small bag! The only problem is that zipper is not of the highest quality. Otherwise it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and cheap enough. The image on the front is a bit pixelated, but not to the point where it needs to be returned. It works for what I need it for, the only problem with it was the chemically smell when I first got it. The smell was very overwhelming and made my stomach gurgle a bit…I had to put it in another room to air out before I carried it for the first time. Otherwise it&#x27;s fine, for being under $20 it&#x27;s pretty much you get what you&#x27;ve paid for.</li>
    <li> It looks better online.  I needed to leave in on the screened porch for a week to out-gas.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I might give it to someone else.  It&#x27;s coming from far away and took a while to arrive, but that was expected.</li>
    <li> very bad quality, bad product, deceptive reference images</li>
    <li> A strap broke as I tried to connect it to the bag, right out of the package.  Had a difficult (but not impossible) time communicating with the seller, who did end up refunding me for this item and were very kind.  The bag is beautiful itself although poorly crafted.</li>
    <li> Good quality of matter. Colors correspond to picture. Comfortable to wear. I like addition pocket inside. My sister likes this bag too.</li>
    <li> I love the design looks just like the photo, I bought the four seasons backpack. I use this bag as a purse, the straps are very helpful for when I want to be hands free, and are easy to take off and put on the bag. The lock on the bag and zippers were a bit stiff but after a while it breaks in. Enough space on the inside for all my stuff. The price I think is cheap and worth it because of the style. Also it arrived on the exact date it said it would. It took a few weeks but it came on time. The inside of the bag seems like really cheap quality so that is why I give it 4 stars. If you want to be different but still fashionable this is the right backpack.</li>
    <li> This is a very roomy, functional tote or purse!  I love the pockets and the clasp lock for security--wonderful and nice looking!</li>
    <li> This backpack has an interesting visual appeal, but is of poor quality. You can buy sturdier backpaks here on Amazon for the same price. Four season oil painting feels sticky and it gets even stickier on a warm summer day. The strap broke after just few days of wearing it to my work.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommed it only to customers who are interested to wear a cute and fairly appealing backpack, once in a while, just to show off, but don&#x27;t care that the product is put together poorly, with cheap looking materials.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as in the image. Perfect, as soon as it arrived I started using it. It arrived sooner than told.</li>
    <li> This purse fell apart. The straps the first week and then the zipper broke.</li>
    <li> Cute, but the metal piece attaching the clip to the backpack straps broke after only a couple of uses. I bought it specifically to use as a backpack and now that function is gone.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bags when I bought this I preferred this bag over the other one. It was better than expected, the leather is really nice and much bigger than the other bag. I just thought the painting had more color but thats okay its not sticky like some other reviews mention.</li>
