      <li>I have used many over the years and really like and trust their products.</li>
      <li>Its not a scented oil, however the oil itself smells very strong, almost like a very old olive oil would.</li>
      <li>This is another oil that I like to use as part of my nighttime skincare routine and apply to my face, neck, decollete and shoulders after cleansing &amp; wake up with soft, super hydrated &amp; smooth skin. :)</li>
      <li>This oil absorbs quickly and has no grease or shine to it</li>
      <li>To my surprise, my skin look very radiant, “plump”, healthy and very moisturized.</li>
      <li>I put a couple drops on my split ends and it was like they were healing right before my eyes.</li>
      <li>This is a very large amount of rosehip oil for the price.</li>
      <li>this feels great on my face, and i put it on my upper arms and it helps with those red bumps.</li>
      <li>I love the crazy benefits of these oils and how incredibly versatile they all are.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t super strong, but enough for me to have to stop using it on my face (since it is so close to my nose).  </li>
      <li>After trying the Emu Oil, I thought I would try out further products from AzureNaturals and was pleased when the rosehip oil came to my mailbox.</li>
      <li>I have learned so much already!</li>
      <li>It really does the trick!</li>
      <li>It is as good as others I have bought in smaller quantities for about the same price.</li>
      <li>I have already tried a few products from Azure Naturals and I have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>I would much rather use this than the prescribed lotions the doctor gives me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to get two different oils, Emu and Rosehip, from Azure Naturals.</li>
      <li>it will be a while before she lets me know how much this product has helped her....  </li>
      <li>The Rosehip oil makes my hair very silky and soft after its rinsed out.</li>
      <li>During long winter months I also like to add it to my conditioner and do a weekly over night rosehip treatment in my hair to keep my hair soft and frizz/static free.</li>
      <li>An unexpected benefit is that it clears up breakouts overnight.</li>
      <li>I add it to my leave-in conditioner and it makes my hair silky and soft.  </li>
      <li>A little bit goes a very long way so don&#x27;t do more than a squirt or two.</li>
      <li>I felt trying rose hip seed oil was a shot in the dark in my search to find a natural solution for cystic acne that my teen daughter has been batteling for past 18 months</li>
      <li>This bottle was a decent size and lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended as natural remedy , the continious use smooths, improves, prevents and tones wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, sun burns, insect bites, stretch marks and more.</li>
      <li>but yes, it does smell pretty bad - kind of leathery</li>
      <li>Recently I have been receiving tons of oils and natural skin care products to try and review.</li>
      <li>Organic Rosehip Oil is a natural moisturizer composed by essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins, which makes it a powerful skin regenerator.</li>
      <li>I mixed this Rosehip oil (about half the bottle) with conditioner and applied it to freshly shampooed hair.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been using for quite awhile now and am unsure if it really is doing anything other than providing some moisture..for the cost, and to keep me from feeling that i&#x27;ve been had, i continue to use it...and maybe, just maybe, that glow will come...</li>
      <li>It really relieves dry peeling skin and helps restore my brittle nails and heal my dry cracking skin.</li>
      <li>It may be an oil, but it is a dry oil and something I&#x27;ve learned is that if your face is stripped of natural oils in washing it will actually over produce oil making the face extra oily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product!! I felt trying rose hip seed oil was a shot in the dark in my search to find a natural solution for cystic acne that my teen daughter has been batteling for past 18 months (she is 16 and the cystic acne breakouts began at 14.5).I was told by a friend to give it a try since doctor prescribed medicated washes, snd antibiotics had not worked. This rosehip seed oil is amazing and has significantly cleared up her cystic acne, alleviated redness and inflammation associated with the acne. She still has some acne although she just started applying this product twice a day just three weeks ago. She is so excited we have found sonething that works without making her skin worse before it started working, burning her skin, or upsetting her stomach as the dermatologist prescribed treatments had done in past without results anywhere close to rosehip seed oil.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of Azure Naturals rosehip oil for my honest review and I can honestly say that I really like it!  I started out by using it on my face in place of my usual serum and a couple of dry patches that I had started seeing due to the cold weather cleared right up.  I have combination (mostly) oily skin and am very acne prone.  I had no problems with this rosehip oil.  No breakouts!  Along with my skin feeling more moisturized and soft, it also seemed more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of uses for rosehip oil, from what I have read, so I decided to try it out in other ways than just on my face.  I have also been using it on stretch marks from my pregnancy.  Although I cannot say they eliminated the stretch marks (I have been using the oil for about two weeks), I would say that they have reduced in appearance, at least a little bit.  Hey, I will take what I can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative (and it isn&#x27;t really all that negative) is in regards to the smell of the oil.  A few other reviewers have mentioned the oil smelling like tea.  That was not my personal experience (and it may just be because I do not really know what tea is supposed to smell like).  To me, it smelled a little fishy.  The way I explained it to my husband was that it reminded me of what the oil in a sardine can smells like.  It isn&#x27;t super strong, but enough for me to have to stop using it on my face (since it is so close to my nose).  I will continue to use the oil on my body, however!</li>
    <li> Organic Rosehip Oil is a natural moisturizer composed by essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins, which makes it a powerful skin regenerator. Highly recommended as natural remedy , the continious use smooths, improves, prevents and tones wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, sun burns, insect bites, stretch marks and more. Leaves no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I had the opportunity to review this product. I have used it for a few weeks now and can really tell a big difference in how my face looks and feels. I will definitely purchase this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s another MUST HAVE oil!  I loved testing out this Organic Rosehip Seed Oil that Azure Naturals sent me!&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is is great stuff and another one of those oils that is a multi-tasker and that you can use on just about everything.  It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, and quickly absorbed so this is one that I can use on my oily skin and thank goodness because it helps with just about every skin issue! Like I said, this GREAT STUFF!  This is another oil that I like to use as part of my nighttime skincare routine and apply to my face, neck, decollete and shoulders after cleansing &amp; wake up with soft, super hydrated &amp; smooth skin. :)</li>
    <li> I love using Rosehip oil in my hair, so I was excited to get this bottle in exchange for an honest review. I mixed this Rosehip oil (about half the bottle) with conditioner and applied it to freshly shampooed hair. The Rosehip oil makes my hair very silky and soft after its rinsed out. I added the rest of the Rosehip oil to a spray bottle of water. I use this mixture to spray my hair sparingly throughout the day because it tends to get dry. I have gotten used to the smell of Rosehip oil, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me like it used to. This bottle was a decent size and lasted a long time. I think it&#x27;s a good quality product.</li>
    <li> OMG the best rosehip on the market!  I love it!</li>
    <li> the oil tends to clog my pores -- but my mom loves it!!! so I gifted her with my bottle too.</li>
    <li> no, i didn&#x27;t see instantaneous results that left me with radiating skin...i&#x27;ve been using for quite awhile now and am unsure if it really is doing anything other than providing some moisture..for the cost, and to keep me from feeling that i&#x27;ve been had, i continue to use it...and maybe, just maybe, that glow will come...</li>
    <li> this feels great on my face, and i put it on my upper arms and it helps with those red bumps. but yes, it does smell pretty bad - kind of leathery but it goes away and i put lotion on over it after 5 min so it doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
    <li> bought this for a gift for someone. She has a scar that it needs to be used on. It has a mild rose smell, and she is happy to have it. it will be a while before she lets me know how much this product has helped her....  look for the followup.</li>
    <li> I love this product! An unexpected benefit is that it clears up breakouts overnight. I use it at night, after I wash my face, before I put on my night creme. You only need a very small amount, too much and you&#x27;ll be causing breakouts instead of clearing them up.</li>
    <li> Av been a sing this product for 3week, avnt seen any improvements on my stretch marks. Am not sure if it helps with that.</li>
    <li> Rosehip works on your hair, skin and nails!  This is a nice rich oil.  It has healed some of my skin problems and rashes that I had.  It also heals itchy, dry skin.  I use it alone or with other lotions to enhance them.  I add it to my leave-in conditioner and it makes my hair silky and soft.  This is a great high quality product.  I have used a lot of Azure Naturals products and have been happy with every one.  I received a complimentary product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Rosehips oils and the brand Azure Naturals.  Rosehip oil can be used for so many things.  I personally use it for my sons eczema.  He starts squirming every time I use it on him because he thinks it is one of mommies beauty treatments, but I&#x27;m telling you it controls his eczema.  I would much rather use this than the prescribed lotions the doctor gives me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rec&#x27;d this product for free in exchange for my opinion  be that as it may my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
    <li> A little too oily for my taste.</li>
    <li> The smell was awful to me, too strong for my senses. To my surprise, my skin look very radiant, “plump”, healthy and very moisturized. This in my opinion is the “anti-aging” product out of them all since it does contain Vitamin A (retinol). I used on my face as a moisturizer and it works great. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily at all, my skin is dry mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.  Its not a scented oil, however the oil itself smells very strong, almost like a very old olive oil would.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is such a versatile oil, and I think that is what makes it such a desirable beauty product. It can be used on hands and nails, hair, skin, the face, on cuts and scrapes, and even some actual skin conditions. I am a fan of Azure Naturals products. I have used many over the years and really like and trust their products. I especially like their ultimate rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil on my dry hands and nail area. It really relieves dry peeling skin and helps restore my brittle nails and heal my dry cracking skin. It is really great for healing my cuts and scrapes too. I recently got some blisters from shoveling snow and lifting boxes etc. and they popped. To keep them hydrated I used this rosehip oil and they seemed to heal more quickly and I have very minimal scarring from the skin peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use this instead of my regular moisturizer. It may be an oil, but it is a dry oil and something I&#x27;ve learned is that if your face is stripped of natural oils in washing it will actually over produce oil making the face extra oily. This oil absorbs quickly and has no grease or shine to it and I love how soft and healthy my face looks and feels. During long winter months I also like to add it to my conditioner and do a weekly over night rosehip treatment in my hair to keep my hair soft and frizz/static free. It really does the trick! A great product and another five stars to Azure Naturals!</li>
    <li> Recently I have been receiving tons of oils and natural skin care products to try and review. I have learned so much already! I love the crazy benefits of these oils and how incredibly versatile they all are. I was fortunate to get two different oils, Emu and Rosehip, from Azure Naturals. I have already tried a few products from Azure Naturals and I have been very pleased. I was not disappointed with these oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Hip Oil is a skin rehydrator- which means that it will help dry skin heal!&lt;br /&gt;You can use it to diminish the appearance of skin-aging signs- like wrinkles and dark spots&lt;br /&gt;Rose Hip Oil also reduces the appearance of damage due to the sun&lt;br /&gt;It helps heal and reduce skin scars and even stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;Rose hip oil is also great for dry, brittle hair- You can use it for split ends and hair treatments&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used to heal dry scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Hip Oil is easy to use and the benefits are great! This brand from Azure Naturals is very nice and comes with a pump for easy application! I love this oil for homemade hair treatments and lotions!</li>
    <li> After trying the Emu Oil, I thought I would try out further products from AzureNaturals and was pleased when the rosehip oil came to my mailbox. You can use rosehip oil for many things including hair, skin, scalp, stretch marks, etc. I personally have been using it as a treatment for my split ends as well as for dry skin. It has a nice pleasant smell to it and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. A little bit goes a very long way so don&#x27;t do more than a squirt or two. It&#x27;s a convenient squirt bottle and easy to use. I put a couple drops on my split ends and it was like they were healing right before my eyes. I also have a lot of scars after going through cancer twice so I put some on just to try to experiment and after a week they are not as noticeable. I&#x27;m thrilled to say this will be staying in my beauty regiment and I think everyone should go out and purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very large amount of rosehip oil for the price. It is as good as others I have bought in smaller quantities for about the same price.</li>
    <li> I never thought a beauty oil could smell this bad; it smells like dead fish sitting on your face. yuck</li>
