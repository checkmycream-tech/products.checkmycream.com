      <li>It does warm, but it does NOT curl your lashes at all.  </li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Curls lashes with mascara or without.</li>
      <li>I didnt try it with mascara yet, but I do hear it&#x27;ll enchance the look more.</li>
      <li>I like this product better than Sephora&#x27;s comparable mini heater that I had for years</li>
      <li>It was shipped fast which was great.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a cap; most of the others didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I love the sleek &amp; compact design.</li>
      <li>So worth it!!</li>
      <li>and it looks like the plastic will clean off very easily anyway.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It heats up very quick.  </li>
      <li>The product also shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>It requires one triple A battery and heats up very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Made cheap but it works</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>Had tried the hot, it is okay</li>

      <li>I pressed it against my lashes pushing them upwards and curled them much more gently than my eyelash curler!  </li>
      <li>I read the review and was excited when I ordered this product.  </li>
      <li>It heats quickly and gets just warm enough to curl your lashes easily.</li>
      <li>Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t get super hot - haven&#x27;t been burnt yet.</li>
      <li>Heats very fast.</li>
      <li>I love the results on my super straight asian lashes!</li>
      <li>I never thought about heat working for eyelash curling until my other eyelash curler (before I bought this) was sitting in the sun one morning and it curled my lashes much better!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and very small and handy.</li>
      <li>Tool did not feel warm much less hot.</li>
      <li>Amazing little gadget.  </li>
      <li>I got it because the price was reasonable, and wanted to try it out of curiosity.</li>
      <li>But I would be very cautious since this is by your eye.</li>
      <li>With mascara it&#x27;s very dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work that well..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for a no make-up  casual fresh face look.</li>
      <li>Curl may not be the right word - it seems to help separate and fan out the lashes well when used in conjunction with a regular lash curler.</li>
      <li>I used the regular curler first, added a coat of mascara, then the heated curler.</li>
      <li>I have straight lashes, and regular curlers don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>but WoW what a difference.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read the review and was excited when I ordered this product.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I followed instructions.  I&#x27;ll have to go back to my crimper.</li>
    <li> Gave lashes a slight curve (if I&#x27;d even call it that). Maybe 4-5 times less then a regular curler. Not a bad product, I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
    <li> Works well! It heats quickly and gets just warm enough to curl your lashes easily. I like this product better than Sephora&#x27;s comparable mini heater that I had for years</li>
    <li> Made cheap but it works</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Curls lashes with mascara or without. Doesn&#x27;t damage it. Heats very fast. Easy to use and very small and handy. I bought 4 as a gifts for my girlfriends</li>
    <li> Was hoping that this would work.  It seemed to work but after two days battery was dead.  Put in a new battery and again after two days the battery was dead.  I did not leave it on.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the results on my super straight asian lashes! Although I do use a traditional curler as well. The heat helps with the curl, and then I use the cold metal from a traditional curler to set it and lift it more. Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t get super hot - haven&#x27;t been burnt yet. But I would be very cautious since this is by your eye. I did notice once that if I hear it too long my lash can get a little burnt (adds a kink to it - and then falls off). So use it with caution and you&#x27;ll get great results.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I have never tried one of these before and I was skeptical about it.  But for the price I figured why not!?  It requires one triple A battery and heats up very quickly.  I pressed it against my lashes pushing them upwards and curled them much more gently than my eyelash curler!  I am happy with this product and will happily continue using it.  I have also started a YouTube channel, so I&#x27;m excited to demonstrate this in one of my videos showing how it works.  I never thought about heat working for eyelash curling until my other eyelash curler (before I bought this) was sitting in the sun one morning and it curled my lashes much better!  I wanted to try something with heat, and this does the trick.  I tried it using no make-up or mascara on, but I will also try it with mascara to see how that works also and it looks like the plastic will clean off very easily anyway.  The product also shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a joke.  It does warm, but it does NOT curl your lashes at all.  Total waste of money</li>
    <li> Works great. ..recommended to my family and friends!!  It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> No curling whatsoever. I tried it before mascara and after. Tool did not feel warm much less hot. Wasted $</li>
    <li> For the price a good buy. Yes, it works, and you will not get burned.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. It works great!! I will NEVER go back to a regular lash curler after using this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work that well..not enough heat..kinda disappointed</li>
    <li> Just as advertised!!!</li>
    <li> This works great! I have straight lashes, and regular curlers don&#x27;t work. This does!</li>
    <li> Had tried the hot, it is okay</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Gets slightly warm and then you push your lashes up towards your eyebrows, but they don&#x27;t curl or stay lifted. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I will never use a crimping curler again!  I LOVE this thing!  My husband thought I had gotten fake lashes!  Works great and for this price, buy two in case one quits on you.  So worth it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing little gadget.  I got to use to get the inside corners of my eyebrows to point upward instead sideways - they work work this but also work great to curling eyelashes up.  I have thick eyelashes so I&#x27;ve never thought to use a curler but WoW what a difference.  It&#x27;s great for a no make-up  casual fresh face look. With mascara it&#x27;s very dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very quick.  I love that it has a cap; most of the others didn&#x27;t.  For the price quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love it... works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I like this heating lash curler. It was shipped fast which was great. I got it because the price was reasonable, and wanted to try it out of curiosity. I love the sleek &amp; compact design. It definitely increased the length. I didnt try it with mascara yet, but I do hear it&#x27;ll enchance the look more. When I try with mascara i will update the review!</li>
    <li> A little hard to get used to. You definitely need to hold it in one place as you pull up on the lashes. I want to believe it is helping the curl...Curl may not be the right word - it seems to help separate and fan out the lashes well when used in conjunction with a regular lash curler. I used the regular curler first, added a coat of mascara, then the heated curler. A final coat of mascara helps to hold the lashes.</li>
