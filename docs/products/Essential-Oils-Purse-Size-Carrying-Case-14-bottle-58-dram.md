### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And I was impressed with the quality,</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s awesome for travel and for backpacking, etc.  </li>
      <li>Great size for carrying in my purse</li>
      <li>Outer material not as attractive as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for travel for a day or two</li>
      <li>There is NO WAY these oils are fitting in the elastic holders!  </li>
      <li>This is great, just can&#x27;t fit all the bottles in there when I need to.</li>
      <li>I think the fabric as the kind that would probably ball up after washing too.  </li>
      <li>It is ok but it does NOT hold 5, 10, or 15ml bottles under the straps.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line is I could sew one I would like better.  </li>
      <li>I can barely fit my finger in one let alone an oil!  </li>
      <li>Even if they did fit in the elastic opening there is also NO WAY it would hold 14!  </li>
      <li>The fabric could have been a better quality</li>
      <li>but it works better than anything I could have come up with.</li>
      <li>I use this often to carry oils to the gym and to work, and so far it has worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>It would be great for smaller bottles</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t really fit the size they say they will.</li>
      <li>If you need all 14 slots filled it might not work.</li>
      <li>The bottles fit so close that you can&#x27;t see the labels on the lids.  </li>
      <li>perfect for holding small 5/8 dram size bottles in place to keep them from leaking.</li>
      <li>I have a small case that was given to me that will hold eight samples and it is awesome, so much better quality with thicker elastic, better stitching and smooth soft fabric.  </li>
      <li>This is a cool case.</li>
      <li>Was okay for my use.&lt;br /&gt;Had to redo in order to fit my bottles and it definitely would not hold that many.</li>
      <li>This item is exactly as it was described and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>but my bottles were to large to fit.</li>
      <li>The bottles have to fit close because the elastic is very relaxed and does not hold the bottles snug.  </li>
      <li>Pretty cheaply made (which is what I paid, really)</li>
      <li>Great case for holding small samples.</li>
      <li>Seems cheaply made, but like that it&#x27;s soft and flexible.</li>
      <li>Would suggest getting case without top and bottom bottle holders on the same side of the case.</li>
      <li>Maybe another carrying case might be better for the next client but as for the one I received, was not.</li>
      <li>I was able to send her small bottles of so many oils...</li>
      <li>Looks good but not usable with small bottles.</li>
      <li>My love for oils grew too quick and this is not adequate.</li>
      <li>Stitched in large stitches (basting stitch)</li>
      <li>Can stuff it in to purses without taking up too much room.</li>
      <li>my 5/8 bottles don&#x27;t fit in the spacers, the elastic was sown in to tight.</li>
      <li>But overall a decent way to keep the little bits of oil with me easily.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a bigger case, but this wasn&#x27;t the answer.</li>
      <li>The rounded corners are almost too small to fit two of the sample bottles.  </li>
      <li>I can only fit the little itty bitty sample bottles.  </li>
      <li>The fabric is a type of material that snags to your fingers and my fingers are not rough.  </li>
      <li>It certainly was not worth the price.  </li>

    <li> Looks good but not usable with small bottles. Wouldn&#x27;t buy another one. Was hoping it would work for traveling places.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t really fit the size they say they will. Pretty cheaply made (which is what I paid, really) and it is a pain squeezing anything in it. Waste. Bummer.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as it was described and it works fine.  Thank you for providing this item in your store.</li>
    <li> Was okay for my use.&lt;br /&gt;Had to redo in order to fit my bottles and it definitely would not hold that many.</li>
    <li> This is a cool case. I carry inks in the little brown 1/2 dram bottles, and haven&#x27;t  had any issues.</li>
    <li> It is ok but it does NOT hold 5, 10, or 15ml bottles under the straps.  I can only fit the little itty bitty sample bottles.  You can carry your oils in this but they do not fit under the straps.  Quite misrepresented.</li>
    <li> I use this often to carry oils to the gym and to work, and so far it has worked great for me.  The elastic holds the bottles in place and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them slipping out.</li>

    <li> perfect for holding small 5/8 dram size bottles in place to keep them from leaking. The fabric could have been a better quality but it serves the purpose I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Seems cheaply made, but like that it&#x27;s soft and flexible. Can stuff it in to purses without taking up too much room.</li>
    <li> I bought the black and gray.  I did not care for this product at all.  It certainly was not worth the price.  Low quality standards on the sewing.  It had loops of white string pulled through and showing on the wrong side indicating the sewing tension was off.  Why they used white thread on black and gray is questionable.  If I pull on a string from the white loop it will come undone.  Stitched in large stitches (basting stitch) so only two stitches catch on the thin elastic. I don&#x27;t think that will last long.  The fabric is a type of material that snags to your fingers and my fingers are not rough.  I think the fabric as the kind that would probably ball up after washing too.

I really wanted a bigger case, but this wasn&#x27;t the answer.</li>
    <li> Great size for carrying in my purse</li>
    <li> We use this case as my husbands travel case for his essential oils when he is out of town.  It is hard to use this case.  If you fill all the opening with bottles you cannot get to the bottom row without bending it in half before removing the bottle on the lower level.  We don&#x27;t recommend this to our friend using essential oils.  Would suggest getting case without top and bottom bottle holders on the same side of the case.</li>
    <li> Before ordering this item I read the reviews but for the price decided to give it try.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!  I got it for my doterra oils and I have the small 5ml ones.  There is NO WAY these oils are fitting in the elastic holders!  I can barely fit my finger in one let alone an oil!  Even if they did fit in the elastic opening there is also NO WAY it would hold 14!  Maybe 5-6...MAYBE!  This case is not worth anyone&#x27;s time or money!</li>
    <li> This is great, just can&#x27;t fit all the bottles in there when I need to.</li>
    <li> It would be great for smaller bottles but my bottles were to large to fit.</li>
    <li> Outer material not as attractive as I had hoped.  I purchased this for my husband to keep a few oils at work; it will do the job for him, but it is not something I would keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> I was able to send her small bottles of so many oils...so I basically &amp;#34;equipped&amp;#34; a &amp;#34;medicine cabinet&amp;#34; for her!  Plus, it&#x27;s awesome for travel and for backpacking, etc.  So portable.  And I was impressed with the quality,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for travel for a day or two but that&#x27;s all.  My love for oils grew too quick and this is not adequate.</li>
