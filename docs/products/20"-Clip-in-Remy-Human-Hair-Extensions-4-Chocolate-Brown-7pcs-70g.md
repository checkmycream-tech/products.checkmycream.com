      <li>:).</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>so if your looking for more volume and thickness i suggest ordering 2 packages.</li>
      <li>All around though I love them.</li>
      <li>Gonna buy more, except for</li>
      <li>in something better is my opinion</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably order more soon.</li>
      <li>The hair quality is nice, soft, and the length was perfect,  but it came in one whole piece rather than them being clip ins which is what I wanted.</li>
      <li>the hair company sent me a courteous e-mail right away to make sure it was all sorted out.</li>
      <li>Shedding is minimal, color matched perfect, do not tangle, curl</li>
      <li>color&#x27;s fine and the texture&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>The color is exactly the same as the picture shows and it matched my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>SUPER LONGGG, soft and silky, real hair, and the color was perfect!</li>
      <li>they appear to be double wefted though, which is great in my opinion.</li>
      <li>They could have been packaged a bit better as they came kind of smushed up but other than that so far so good.</li>
      <li>IS A REALLY GOOD HUMAN HAIR</li>
      <li>Get 2-3 sets if you have thicker hair and looking for a full head.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>The transaction was quick</li>
      <li>I like them and they came pretty quick!</li>
      <li>Super stringy..buy two packs.</li>
      <li>Other than that they are amazing!</li>
      <li>these are my first extentions and I will defenetly be using this brand from now on!</li>
      <li>My real hair is an &amp;#34;over grown&amp;#34; pixie cut(purplish hair in pictures), and i like how well the extentions fit in.</li>
      <li>I would say definitely worth it and would recommend and will use again.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would&#x27;ve liked to see was a consistent hair thickness in the extensions.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re do I start, the shipping was great and on time the extensions are quite thin but not bad because I have alot of hair</li>
      <li>Okay, first off my rating of three stars is only because of the issues I dealt with for shipping.</li>
      <li>Started falling apart after first wash.</li>
      <li>So really I think these are best for someone who has already long hair that just wants more volume and thickness with a little extra length!</li>
      <li>The product is okay as long as it matches your hair color.</li>
      <li>and they do not curl they get slightly burned and to be honest</li>
      <li>colour, i knew wasnt going to match my hair,  is perfectly fine since they&#x27;re human hair.</li>
      <li>But they are definitely human hair, they&#x27;re really soft and smooth, and I can use any hot tool on them!</li>
      <li>Very silky still</li>
      <li>But not to much hair.</li>
      <li>It is much longer than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Never had hair extensions and these are super easy to put in..needed a little trim and added some curls</li>
      <li>Other than that I love the hair extensions I had to dye them to match</li>
      <li>If you already bought a pack or need to add thickness this is good if you don&#x27;t want to spend another $200 at Sally&#x27;s, alone though they&#x27;re pretty thin.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty soft as well.</li>
      <li>I have middle of my back :)</li>
      <li>product i highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The hair was a little lighter in color compared to the picture, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
      <li>Good quality, kinda thin</li>
      <li>This will be the first and last time I order this item I paid for overnight delivery it got here on time</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s obvious that it is 100% REAL!</li>
      <li>and they just didn&#x27;t work for me, would probably slip out even more on thin straight hair!</li>
      <li>I got these because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200 at Sally&#x27;s, well I did anyway because these were a little too light for me.</li>
      <li>and are still soft.  </li>
      <li>They arrived 2 weeks early</li>
      <li>They are super long, and defiantly human hair.</li>
      <li>They got here earlier and expected, and when I took them out of the package they were very soft and you could tell they were real, they curl and dye very well too,</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how thin they were, i ended up buying more!</li>
      <li>It tangles easily and isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think is real hair because I had bought real hair extensions and this is by far anything like it, to bad I sold them when I bleached my hair...other than that the color was ok</li>

<li> Does not last long term.</li>

<li> wasn&#x27;t as long as i thought it was going to be.</li>
<li> They also came earlier than expected.</li>
<li> and they are done..had to add 4 little clips,I have super thick hair and a lot of hair...</li>
<li> Hair feels like straw when it&#x27;s wet and doesn&#x27;t style well.</li>
<li> Not a whole lot of fallout while brushing either.</li>
<li> and my hair is short and has choppy layers.  </li>
<li> Not real hair.</li>
<li> and then the other another time.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
<li> Other then they are a little bit thinner than I expected.</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> Two thumbs down</li>
<li> They were really knotty and VERY thin .</li>
<li> If I could give this hair half a star I would.</li>
<li> the description says clip-in and previous customers have talked about the clips... but the product I received is just one curtain of hair!&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Forced to combine extensions to overlap each other for thickness. Extensions are very thin! Does not last long term. I&#x27;ve had these for several months and used them about twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Invest in something better is my opinion, I will never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got these because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200 at Sally&#x27;s, well I did anyway because these were a little too light for me. However even though I got the highest quality of extentions at the store these ended up being the perfect layering filler. I&#x27;ve had them for about 6 months now and I wear them daily. If you already bought a pack or need to add thickness this is good if you don&#x27;t want to spend another $200 at Sally&#x27;s, alone though they&#x27;re pretty thin. I&#x27;ll probably order more soon.</li>
    <li> 100% in love with them! They got here earlier and expected, and when I took them out of the package they were very soft and you could tell they were real, they curl and dye very well too, these are my first extentions and I will defenetly be using this brand from now on!</li>
    <li> I like them and they came pretty quick! The only downside is they are quite thin towards the end of each weft! Even if you got 2 sets it would still be thick then bam!... thin! (and i mean thin) So really I think these are best for someone who has already long hair that just wants more volume and thickness with a little extra length!</li>
    <li> Super stringy..buy two packs.</li>
    <li> Horrible !! Hair feels like straw when it&#x27;s wet and doesn&#x27;t style well. Started falling apart after first wash.</li>
    <li> Good quality, kinda thin</li>
    <li> I love them ! You can dye then and curled.But not to much hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking they were clip-in... the description says clip-in and previous customers have talked about the clips... but the product I received is just one curtain of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color&#x27;s fine and the texture&#x27;s fine but there&#x27;s literally nothing I can do with this now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty annoyed.</li>
    <li> these are awful before buying I read a majority of the reviews, some said excellent some said awful. I iopened my package and it was one long strand if hair no clips and was awful quality</li>
    <li> Good for the price I would recommend getting at least 2 packs</li>
    <li> There were NO clips on this hair!</li>
    <li> IS A REALLY GOOD HUMAN HAIR</li>
    <li> Not well made. Half of them came to me broken. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re do I start, the shipping was great and on time the extensions are quite thin but not bad because I have alot of hair the only thing that I disliked was that they tangled really bad and they do not curl they get slightly burned and to be honest I don&#x27;t think is real hair because I had bought real hair extensions and this is by far anything like it, to bad I sold them when I bleached my hair...other than that the color was ok and like I said you can use these for a one night thing and that&#x27;s it......</li>
    <li> These extensions are great! The wefts are just very thin, which they inform you that when they say &amp;#34;70g&amp;#34; thats why they are only $26. But they are definitely human hair, they&#x27;re really soft and smooth, and I can use any hot tool on them! Gonna buy more, except for maybe ill try to find an 80 or 90g set. :)</li>
    <li> Okay, first off my rating of three stars is only because of the issues I dealt with for shipping. Other than that I love the hair extensions I had to dye them to match and they turned out great. Very silky still and I&#x27;ve straightened and dyed them in one night. The only thing I would&#x27;ve liked to see was a consistent hair thickness in the extensions. Some spots are very thin. All around though I love them. They are great!</li>
    <li> The hair hair is great quality. It is much longer than I thought it would be. Great product</li>
    <li> The product came packaged nicely and timely. The hair quality is nice, soft, and the length was perfect,  but it came in one whole piece rather than them being clip ins which is what I wanted. No clips came with the hair either. So I had to order clips and will be making them myself. This is why I gave 3 stars.</li>
    <li> These came in the mail yesterday and tried them out. They were really knotty and VERY thin . Im going to have to buy different extensions that are thicker. Also the color is very different than described. I would not buy these again</li>
    <li> This was not clip ins.  It was one weft of hair and very poor quality at that.  I would never recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to return the item.  Now we will see if I get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW,  I didn&#x27;t even want to give 1 star.</li>
    <li> these are not real!!! they do not curl. they failed the flame test,and will be sending them back.</li>
    <li> picture and description are whit clips!! but i get the hair extensions they don&#x27;t have clips</li>
    <li> Never had hair extensions and these are super easy to put in..needed a little trim and added some curls and they are done..had to add 4 little clips,I have super thick hair and a lot of hair...hair is above the shoulders and with these I have middle of my back :) love then and great price</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to add some length to my hair. I have shoulder length hair, so this length was perfect for me! The color was spot on also! The only down side to this product was how thin the hair was. But for the price I think it was a great buy! I will be ordering another to make the thickness that I want!</li>
    <li> Love these extensions! The shipping was fast and the color was perfect. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how thin they were, i ended up buying more!</li>
    <li> Extremely thin. Get 2-3 sets if you have thicker hair and looking for a full head.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as long as i thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy about everything.</li>
    <li> I recently had a bad hair cut experience and my hair is short and has choppy layers.  These hair extensions are a LIFE SAVER!!! Yes they are real hair, and I am sharing this info because there were claims that the hair is fake! It definitely is real because they straightened out perfectly and just by touching it, it&#x27;s obvious that it is 100% REAL! Yes they are very thin, I mean what do you expect? Look at the price. If you are wanting thicker hair extensions, then these are not for you! If you want or have thin hair then these are for you! Or if you have what has come to be known as a &amp;#34; scene haircut &amp;#34;, like me, then this is what you&#x27;re looking for! They are everything I wanted! SUPER LONGGG, soft and silky, real hair, and the color was perfect! I&#x27;m so grateful and thrilled to have these hair extensions! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> These are really thin.... Guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because it fits in my expectations. The color, height everything is perfect what I want. And of coursed recommend this to my sister to buy it, actually I had order 1 for her too.</li>
    <li> I love these extensions. They are a little thin so if your looking for more volume and thickness i suggest ordering 2 packages. The color is exactly the same as the picture shows and it matched my hair perfectly. They also came earlier than expected. I ordered them a few days ago and they are already here!</li>
    <li> I could not belive how thin they were...next time I will order something over 70 grams.</li>
    <li> I tried dying the color darker... Color doesn&#x27;t stick. The product is okay as long as it matches your hair color.</li>
    <li> Not worth it, it&#x27;s not remy hair I tried to curl it and it burned, , also it was really thin. This will be the first and last time I order this item I paid for overnight delivery it got here on time but they charged me 50$ all together. It was a waste of $... :(</li>
    <li> If I could give this hair half a star I would. It tangles easily and isn&#x27;t thick. Worst hair I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s worst than synthetic hair and this is supposed to be remy. Two thumbs down</li>
    <li> I really hate these extensions. They are super thin and are even thinner at the bottom. I get that they are only 20$ and you get what u pay for but these things feel like barbie hair they suck don&#x27;t waste ur money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn these for about a week and still love them! Shedding is minimal, color matched perfect, do not tangle, curl okay and are still soft.  Obviously their thin but hell for the price buy a few. (:</li>
    <li> Garbage. Not real hair. Won&#x27;t curl</li>
    <li> the product did not meet my expectivas , I is not packaged properly, as shown in the reference image . these products were purchased for sale, but now can not be sold because of its presentation</li>
    <li> Great! Other then they are a little bit thinner than I expected. Other than that they are amazing! I can curl then and straighten them.</li>
    <li> They could have been packaged a bit better as they came kind of smushed up but other than that so far so good. They aren&#x27;t the very best extensions I&#x27;ve ever used but they are very good for the price. The transaction was quick I would say definitely worth it and would recommend and will use again. Thank you</li>
    <li> They were not human hair!</li>
    <li> The extensions are silky, smooth, and matched my hair colour perfectly. Some said its a little on the thin side so I ordered 2 sets but 1 set will do the deed. I&#x27;d recommend 2 anyhow. They arrived 2 weeks early and when I ran into some shipping issues (I wasn&#x27;t home to sign) the hair company sent me a courteous e-mail right away to make sure it was all sorted out. :).</li>
    <li> Recieved these today! Came before the estimated delivery date, and they were in great condition. The packaging they came in was a little disappointing though, I was expectingb a box, not a bag. But, they were sealed well. The hair itself is very thin, as I was expecting because of the weight (I bought two packs) they appear to be double wefted though, which is great in my opinion. The hair was a little lighter in color compared to the picture, but I&#x27;m okay with that. Not a whole lot of fallout while brushing either. They&#x27;re pretty soft as well. Over all, I&#x27;m very pleased at how nice they are for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting on my second set to get here.</li>
    <li> The hair is way too thin, had to return.</li>
    <li> For one, they are so good with shipping. My estamated delievery was March 3rd and i got them on Feburary 14. They are super long, and defiantly human hair. Of course they are thin, but theyre suppose to be. Its recommended to buy two at once but it will work to get one and then the other another time.&lt;br /&gt;the colour, i knew wasnt going to match my hair,  is perfectly fine since they&#x27;re human hair. I have naturally thick hair, which is to hard to handle when i have it all grown out. My real hair is an &amp;#34;over grown&amp;#34; pixie cut(purplish hair in pictures), and i like how well the extentions fit in. I cant wait to dye them and buy another pair for thickness.&lt;br /&gt;AmazIng product i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I expected thin for the price but the clips are terrible and don&#x27;t stay put. I have thick bi-racial hair and they just didn&#x27;t work for me, would probably slip out even more on thin straight hair!</li>
