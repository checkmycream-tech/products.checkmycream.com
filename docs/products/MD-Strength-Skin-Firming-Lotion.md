      <li>Definitely worth a try for yourself</li>
      <li>but so far I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
      <li>I wish the makers of this product would actually test it on their own selves first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like it because of its firming abilities, soaks right in, NO smell and somewhat moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Much needed, two thumbs up!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>Personally I have not found anything better.  </li>
      <li>I started using the this cream and noticed first two weeks</li>
      <li>I found this product very firming on my face after first time I tried it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived in an envelope with a piece of masking tape over the top but the cap on the bottle was loose and just about to come off.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even really absorb into the skin.</li>
      <li>and this worked very well on my face and neck with tightening and firming.</li>
      <li>This lotion works very well</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it really has no &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; softening results.</li>
      <li>I bought it wthout much expectations and I have to say after a week of use</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
      <li>I lost a whole inch after using it for 2.5 weeks.</li>
      <li>Much firmer, tighter and my stretch marks started to fade.  </li>
      <li>Really can feel a difference.</li>
      <li>But when my spouse said my arms looked firm, I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Bought more or less on a whim.</li>
      <li>But I have really just started using this - I will update in a few more weeks.</li>
      <li>You certainly don&#x27;t need much as it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few years after being less than happy with some others that make the same claim</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this once so far</li>
      <li>some were very sticky and heavy gels that more or less just sat on my skin.</li>
      <li>so far there s no perminent change, but in the short run it seems to help if juust temperarily.</li>
      <li>we saw tremendous improvement cellulite started to shrink fadeout unbelievable</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I received this product the lid was loose and lotion inside the envelope.</li>
    <li> This product is off the chain!  I started using the this cream and noticed first two weeks my breast has gotten firmer and plump and my skin doesn&#x27;t have those stretch marks and sagging .</li>
    <li> Personally I have not found anything better.  I have been using this product for a few years after being less than happy with some others that make the same claim</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had a show coming up and this worked very well on my face and neck with tightening and firming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my neck and chest, I also started using it on my arms because the skin is a little crepe like - and I actually see a difference after only a number of days. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> Another product with a big promise and no results. It&#x27;s just a cream.  Sorry I spent money on this.It doesn&#x27;t even really absorb into the skin. If you get wet 4 hours later the lotion is reactivated like you just put it on. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I wish the makers of this product would actually test it on their own selves first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in an envelope with a piece of masking tape over the top but the cap on the bottle was loose and just about to come off. Poor packing in my opinion. Tell the seller why bother?</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and have noticed some firming. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I use it twice a day on my neck and face.</li>
    <li> I found this product very firming on my face after first time I tried it. Really can feel a difference. Not greasey and has no scent which I liked about it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. I lost a whole inch after using it for 2.5 weeks. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay soften your skin</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because it really has no &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; softening results. However, its a firming cream and works wonderfully. I liked it so i gave my mom one and my dad uses it on his face. Hes 75 and showing alot if sun damage. I asked him what made him want to use it and he said &amp;#34;it feels good&amp;#34;. Im so glad. I like it because of its firming abilities, soaks right in, NO smell and somewhat moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I purchased it for my girlfriend I was worried about the cellulite on her back  side thighs legs arms you name it after one week we saw tremendous improvement cellulite started to shrink fadeout unbelievable this product also tone her legs thighs and arms  she has a athletic body but over the years it started to go down with cellulite everywhere product is amazing for the price I just bought a second bottle for my girlfriend she&#x27;s loving it and plans to use it for ever even after the product has done his job. Beautiful</li>
    <li> I  just statred using this product so I cannot give it a top rating yet, but it does seem to help with firming the skin. I use it mostly for my face because at 59 my fface is getting a bit droopy. I am loosing the elasticity in my skin and I am hoping this will help. so far there s no perminent change, but in the short run it seems to help if juust temperarily.</li>
    <li> So far so good. .I use it on my stomach and thighs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product. Bought more or less on a whim. I have used other skin tightening products and not been very impressed-some were very sticky and heavy gels that more or less just sat on my skin. For me this is a much better choice, a light cream that absorbs nicely into my skin, not heavy or sticky and virtually scent free. As for how it works- I will say that I see some slight improvement, not a huge drastic change, but subtle changes none the less. But I have really just started using this - I will update in a few more weeks. Will I buy again? Definitely.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I bought it wthout much expectations and I have to say after a week of use, I am convinced it is the best. I have used so many products for my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin on my neck to no avail until now! After a week, my neck looks amazing. So much so that I will try a few other areas and see how it does there. I will surely buy more and I highy recommend it, for the neck atleast!</li>
    <li> It was okay, I didn&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
    <li> Have seen some improvement. I will keep ordering</li>
    <li> skin tone is now much better and is getting even better with continued use.  This lotion works very well so use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far but I believe it may achieve the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I tried this for 2 weeks and noticed a big difference. But when my spouse said my arms looked firm, I was thrilled. I will order another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> Firming, my second bottle and will again purchase.</li>
    <li> Wow, I glad Amazon now selling this stuff!! It has been a while since I purchased this lotion. I really love this lotion. In just weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. Much firmer, tighter and my stretch marks started to fade.  I&#x27;ve mostly concentrated on my stomach and buttocks . I will recommend this product.  I will start back using this firming lotion&lt;br /&gt;after my baby is born. Much needed, two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; lotion, but does nothing for firming sadly.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews for firming lotions and decided this was what I was looking for.  I use it on my neck, chest and upper arms.  I have noticed a difference in the firmness of my neck. I use it on my face in the evening after I have removed my makeup.  It&#x27;s a little heavy so I don&#x27;t wear it under makeup.  You certainly don&#x27;t need much as it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got a bottle for my sister who has issues with stretch marks.  She has not said if it has helped her, but she has only been using it a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to remember to update my post when I have seen more results...</li>
    <li> I believe that I can see a change in some areas of my body that I use this product but I believe that diet and exercise helps speed up the process. Definitely worth a try for yourself but so far I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
