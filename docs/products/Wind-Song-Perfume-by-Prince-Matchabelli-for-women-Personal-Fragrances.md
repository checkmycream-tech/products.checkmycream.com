<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A favorite scent for 30 years.</li>
    <li> Put some on.  Wait 5 minutes.  YOu will have leveled up into a &amp;#34;Naturally Beautifully Smelling Person.&amp;#34;  I know it is considred a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; perfume, but this is a classic.  Why spend more to smell worse.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, used to wear it many  many years ago, back when i was in high school, recently purchased it again, and still love it, I get many many compliments when i wear this scent.</li>
    <li> I use this not only as perfume sometimes, but I use it as a air spray around my house.  When I walk in the house it smells just lovely,  And it&#x27;s nice for guests, too, as a nice welcoming fragrance.  Plus it&#x27;s long lasting.  I love, love, this.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Mom at her request. She has been a long time fan. Says it is a light perfume. I think it smells good, that is as I can go with it. Seems to last for a long time, between \\&quot;fresh ups\\&quot;. She&#x27;s happy, and if Momma is happy, everybody has a chance at happiness. If she&#x27;s not, nobody will be. Not much else for me to say. It&#x27;s been around for along time, and still popular, that says something for it.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t worn Wind Song for years and decided to give it a try again.  I&#x27;m getting compliments from loads of people.</li>
    <li> Always one of my favorite colognes from days gone by, so am glad to have it again and for such a good price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for Christmas. Never received any notification that it was shipped. Never got the product. I&#x27;ll be checking my January CC statement for charges then notify the bank.</li>
    <li> This company - did great, in getting me the product.  This is the same product I used in my youth and I am glad that I was able to find it online, not available locally.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Mom&#x27;s Christmas gift. Hard to find in a store and she loves this fragrance so was happy to be able to find it online, thanks!</li>
    <li> I was in a store in New York city and a clerk turned around to me and said, \\&quot;Miss, is that you that is making the room smell so nice?\\&quot;  I started wearing Wind Song since it came out and have never changed.  Everyone I am know, knows me for this scent.  I do not like: spicy, too flowery or heavy scents.  Wind Song  just touches you on the shoulder and says-\\&quot;I&#x27;m here.  I love it so much.  I feel as if I have forgotten to finish dressing if I don&#x27;t have it on.</li>
    <li> love it, been wearing it for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom for Christmas. I&#x27;m just not a big fan of the scent. It was really heavy and has a older fashioned smell. My said she liked it but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s her style cause I barely see her use it.</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful gift and the scent so good! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great gift.</li>
    <li> I have used this classic cologne for a long time. Tried a few new products along the way but always come back to Wind Song.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this scent for years, and I finally found it.  This is exactly what I wanted .</li>
    <li> This classic cologne continues to stand the test of time. Its fresh fragrance will complement any apparel and enhance your presence.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife.  She liked it.</li>
    <li> This lovely scent evokes a warm, pleasant, and sensual response. The scent enhances mood and triggers pheromones to activate pre-coded genetic programs. If you&#x27;re in the mood for love, this is a superb choice to engender a positive response from your romantic other.&lt;br /&gt;  I am a man, but have a chromosomal make-up that classifies me as a true hermaphrodite. My chemistry is a perfect match for Wind Song. I wear it for any occasion and I get nothing but very positive complements. This agent of pleasure should not be made provincial by making it only gender specific. It is an aromatic that synergizes a romantic ambiance for anyone, anytime, anywhere! Women love this scent on me. Try it and see!&lt;br /&gt;  The wisest man who ever lived once said: \\&quot;Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man&#x27;s friend by hearty counsel.\\&quot; (Proverbs 27:9) For more than 40 years Wind Song has rejoiced my heart. I even wear it to rejoice God&#x27;s heart! This is hearty counsel indeed! Ladies please send a response.</li>
    <li> Buy it. Simple put. Just do it. I am no where near a perfume person but the other day while I was shopping at Target during my break I saw the cute packaging and said &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; and I instantly held onto it and went to the check out line. Its not a scent that you smell once and you think it smells &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;. It smells like a mother A classic &amp;#34;mom&amp;#34; scent. When I smell it reminds me of a child running to hug her mother after school and then being wrapped in the smell of her perfume when she hugs them. Or the scent of an aunt or grandmother when they come through the door when they come to visit. Its just warm vintage smell that seems mature. For the rest of the day all I got were compliments and questions about the perfume. Im a cashier so whenever I handed a customer their change or put something for them to sign and they bent over to sign it theyd stop for a couple seconds before asking me if it was my scent. People would stop by me and say things like &amp;#34;Oh my god do you smell that perfume?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;It smells wonderful&amp;#34; and then theyd realize it was coming from me and would ask if it was ok to ask me for the perfume and where I got it. There were several elderly women who recognized the smell as well. But by far my favorite was a little girl who ran past me just to stop and look around and when her mother asked her why she stopped she yelled &amp;#34;It smells like Grandma here! It smells so good!&amp;#34; and she ran around in a circle embracing the scent, eventually the mother looked over at me and asked &amp;#34; Wind song?&amp;#34; and I just laughed and said yes.</li>
    <li> I think my grandmother bathes in this...she loves it and has used for many years...Amazon has it...I buy it...all is well in the world.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy</li>
    <li> I ordered this for A Christmas gift, the bottle came in tact but the box was terribly bent up and dented in!  I am very disappointing with this!  It was packaged well which means the box looked like that when they packed it to ship it.  I wouldn&#x27;t personally mind if it was for me, but who wants to receive a gift that looks like it&#x27;s been beat up.  This is my first bad review with amazon, and I don&#x27;t like to leave it, but I am very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Always loved this perfume.  It was my signature scent for years.  I have to say this is the only one of all the perfumes from the past that is still selling and has not changed it&#x27;s scent.  Identical!!  It is so dissapointing to buy perfume that you remember and discover they changed formula on new release and  the scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last but for few minutes or is entirely different although the bottle and packing looks the same.  This is definitely not ture with Windsong.  Buy it.  Great Value also</li>
    <li> I have used Prince Matchabelli Wind Song since it first came out on the market -- I believe, over 50 years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried others but none have the subtle, distinct fragrance Wind Song has.  It is appropriate for any age and has a light yet lasting effect.</li>
    <li> Wind Song By Prince Matchabelli For Women. Cologne Spray Natural 2.6 Ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently bought this as a gift for my Mom, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Wind Song cologne is a mild fragrance that a lady of any age can wear. It can be worn during the day or evening. Being mild, it does not command attention to the wearer.</li>
    <li> It goes back 45 years and a girl I met at the lake that summer. Some memories just last forever.</li>
    <li> You know that awful old-lady smell that gags you every time you&#x27;re in any store or a group of people... yep, this is it!</li>
    <li> Plunger,  did not work very well, so it does not spray well.</li>
    <li> I do not like musk&#x27;s or heavy patchouli smells.  Wind Song is a fresh, clean, out of the shower, powder smell.  Very feminine.</li>
    <li> I wore this in high school and that was 44 years ago, my first present from a guy, he placed this in my locker and I loved it, never was my boyfriend but a great friend all through school!</li>
    <li> Takes you back to the 1960&#x27;s.  It has a nice woody scent.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Excellent service</li>
    <li> So light and fresh all in one</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years and it is the only one I use.  I love it!  I get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I wore this fragrance back in the &amp;#34;old days.&amp;#34;  Now that my other fave, Enjolie, is no longer available, I went back to Wind song.  Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this one.  It&#x27;s a light floral that people seem to love.</li>
    <li> Got this for the lovely lady of the house and she is as happy with it now as she was with her first one.</li>
    <li> Lovely.....hasn&#x27;t changed in the 40 years I&#x27;ve used it.  I still get compliments.  Brings back wonderful memories of high school</li>
    <li> An Old favorite...a little &#x27;old lady-ish&#x27; but sure smells good!</li>
    <li> As I was ordering the dusting powder, I decided to order the cologne as well. I&#x27;m so glad I did! Not only was it cheaper here than what I would have paid locally, it arrived in the same condition as if I had bought it locally. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Es un regalo para mi mamá! No usa este perfume desde la última vez que fue a Estados Unidos!  Le encantó, pero no lo pudo conseguir nunca más! En Argentina no se vende! Tendrían que traerlo!</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance since the 70s.  I was pleased to find you have it on your staff there.  Linda</li>
    <li> I wore Wind Song years ago...unable to find it in stores....found it at Amazon....I am happy happy happy...love WIND SONG</li>
    <li> I used to wear it years ago but sort of forgot about it.  Recently, I bought some again and I once again remember why I used to wear it all the time.  Light and refreshing.  A really clean smell.  Excellent price on Amazon too.  It was the cheapest price I could find anywhere else online.</li>
    <li> Wind Song for women has long been a wonderful spray cologne .  Its fragrance has stood the test of time.  The clean and zesty smell yet spicy smell too will become one of your favorites .  Give it a try.  Max</li>
    <li> As Windsong...always keeps me on your mind.</li>

    <li> Wind Song cologne is a mild fragrance that a lady of any age can wear. It can be worn during the day or evening. Being mild, it does not command attention to the wearer.</li>
    <li> A deliciously subtle, floral fagrance. Always have loved it and always will. So happy to find it&#x27;s still available. Fortunately it is still fairly priced.</li>

    <li> Love the smell of this perfume!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  I enjoy the light scent.  Sprays great&lt;br /&gt;I would recommends this to others.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle will last you quite a while.</li>
    <li> I love this timeless smell.Still smells the same as it always has the formula has not changed and it is always affordable.</li>
    <li> this is one of the few old fragrances that i still love. wore it as a young woman. i&#x27;m older now, but still remember it. are you old enough to remember the commercial?</li>
    <li> Wore this in high school over 50 years ago.  Was glad to find it and still love the fragrance more than my high priced Dior</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, now it is easier to order it on line. The sint is mild , not over powering.</li>
    <li> GREAT COLOGNE...TAKES YOU BACK, YEARS AGO WHEN WIND SONG CAME ON THE MARKET WITH THEIR CATCHY SONG...&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; CAN&#x27;T SEEM TO FORGET YOU, WIND SONG STAYS ON YOUR MIND&amp;#34;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANY PEOPLE COMMENT AS TO WHAT&#x27;S THAT FRAGRANCE.  WHEN YOU TELL THEM WIND SONG, THEY SMILE AND ALSO HAVE MEMORIES OF YEARS AGO.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT SMELL, NOT STRONG OR OVER-POWERING.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for many many years.  I have always liked the fragrance and I have always gotten a lot of compliments that I smell good.  Nothing I don&#x27;t like and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite cologne for years. Not overpowering as some can be.</li>
    <li> Wow, this was a very pleasant surprise.  Unlike some websites that often ship old product, this was a new and fresh as one could expect it to be.  And filled to the brim.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. It is my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance.  To me it smells like fragrant soap. It&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> It was great - I&#x27;ve worn Wind Song for years - my favorite scent</li>
    <li> OMG.....THE MEMORIES FROM SMELLING THIS FRAGRANCE AGAIN!! YES, IT STILL SMELLS THE SAME!! A BIT PRICEY BUT GLAD I PURCHASED WINDSONG 2.6oz. NOW I CAN&#x27;T GET THE COMMERCIAL SONG OUT OF MY HEAD......LOL. FAST SHIPPING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OLD CLASSIC PERFUME.</li>
    <li> I have used this since I was a teenager.  You can&#x27;t help but feel elegant,  The fragrance is just wonderful.</li>
    <li> The ease of ordering and receiving this product for my wife, makes this purchase worth it and easy on my wallet. Amazon is great and really does care about it&#x27;s customers</li>
    <li> Just got this in and have to say I am more than pleased with the fast delivery.  I have used Wind Song over the years and it is still a favorite. Not overpowering if used right. A slight spray on pulse points and you&#x27;re good for the day and/or evening. Great price for the two bottles too. Packaging was perfect.</li>
    <li> I am 77 years old and have been wearing Wind Song since high school.  I always get so many compliments and it is just a nice, clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my mom, and I absolutely love it. I might think twice before I hand this over to her :)</li>
    <li> Wind Song is an understated, yet pleasant fragrance, making it almost a bargain for the price base. Where many other of comparable sprays might be intrusive, this is one is delicate and easy to like. 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend last Christmas and they really enjoyed the fragrance, so I recommend it 100% for sure.</li>
    <li> my mom really like the smell of this stuff, so i got it for her for christmas.  she was super happy.  who doesn&#x27;t like happy moms?</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone else.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear it because it doesn&#x27;t go with my skin.  The person who wear it loves it.  Ana</li>
    <li> A scent from my younger days that I never get tired of. Spritz it on after my bath. Guess I associate the scent with security, comfort, cleanliness. An all round good association.</li>
    <li> Loved it 50 something years ago and have recently revived my love for it when I found it was available through amazon.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Wife using this for more than 50 years and it was well handled. Expect to continue its use indefinitely.</li>
    <li> This was my very first self-purchased scent.  I was a Freshman in high school.  My mother was worried, my dad was tickled.  I still love this fragrance, though I haven&#x27;t worn it in decades.  It&#x27;s light and clean.  Just how I remember it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandmother because its very hard to find it anywhere. She used it when she was a bit younger and recently started using her almost empty bottle. So when she opened her gift and could smell the perfume she was in love. It was exactly as she loved and in a beautiful bottle.</li>
    <li> Love Wind Song. This is a really nice size for the price.</li>
    <li> I had a romantic thought that I would be 16 again if I put on this perfume. My tastes have changed and the smell was awful. I ended up throwing this perfume away. Hey, it&#x27;s 2015 with plenty of choices. No need to get nostalgic.</li>
    <li> Wore this perfume as a teenager. How wonderful to find it again and even better that it is just as fragrant as I remember.</li>
    <li> I use to wear this when i was a teenager so i bought it again, and yeah it does stay on your mind. you dont need to use much though. it is pretty strong.</li>
