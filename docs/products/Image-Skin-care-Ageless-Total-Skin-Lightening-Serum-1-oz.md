      <li>So far its very nice!</li>
      <li>Other than that I have nothing but the best things to say about the promt shipment of this product, and of course this delightful product itself.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this review after I&#x27;ve used this serum for a longer time, but so far I am VERY pleased.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that I LOVE Image products and thought I would love this too.  </li>
      <li>this is so much better</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells also it works wonders.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product ...</li>
      <li>my skin appears more radient &amp; even.</li>
      <li>and I love the consistency</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product and maybe had I caught my skin issues earlier this would have been the way for me to go, but with my skin issues the bleaching serum works best.</li>
      <li>so it is safe for most skin types.  </li>
      <li>But why would I want to pay more?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely a permanent serum in my skincare routine! :)</li>
      <li>but you have to be patient to see the fading of more permanent marks.</li>
      <li>Wonderful smelling product (as is the entire collection).</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, works well.  </li>
      <li>I love Image</li>
      <li>I love it, but it is quite pricey,so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
      <li>I feel very strong towards this product bc of the huge difference in my skin when I look in the mirror</li>
      <li>This works even better than the Murad lightening product &#x3D; quicker and more effective,  Dries fast so you can almost immediately put moisturizer on.  </li>
      <li>I thought that would be as good as it got, but I continued to use one drop (it doesn&#x27;t take much)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as obaji&#x27;s product, but does have a lightning effect.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and absorbs pretty quickly too.</li>
      <li>I am not wrinkle free or free of age spots yet, but i like the concept.</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy using this product.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel smooth.  </li>
      <li>I only only use Image on my face when washing or lighting or moisturizing honestly the best!</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic (like pineapples or something tropical)</li>
      <li>This line of facial products is all super great.</li>
      <li>Love this product ...works very well!</li>
      <li>I saw a difference in just a couple uses, hyperpigmentation around my  cheeks and temples was significantly reduced.  </li>
      <li>This product usually smells so wonderful you&#x27;d want to eat it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this consistently ever since and have seen even more improvement.  </li>
      <li>Makes your skin super smooth.</li>
      <li>I have not seen any changes, although it is true that with this product, it takes time to see any results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not painful and no unpleasant odor, either.</li>
      <li>Came quickly.  </li>
      <li>I am 60 years old and I am impressed with how it has taken away my dark spots from sun damage.</li>
      <li>one of my favorite products, great for dark spots and old acne scars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an absolute rip off!!</li>
      <li>So far I love it.</li>
      <li>It is better to find a spa near you who carries these lines than to take a risk of who knows what you&#x27;re putting on your skin.</li>
      <li>I loved how my skin was soft and clear.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter and she really likes it and wants to buy more for her friends thanks</li>
      <li>My skin is more even, soft and I’m not seeing as many break outs as I had prior to using this product.</li>
      <li>Within a few days of using this product, I noticed my skin tone was more even, healthy, and glowing.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 6 weeks now and it simply does not work.  </li>
      <li>sister uses Clinique at more than double the price.  </li>
      <li>just don&#x27;t put it too close to your eyes as it is very concentrated and powerful.</li>
      <li>I ordered my first bottle in March.  </li>
      <li>which is ok since i know international shipping and stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this product, was suffering from a lot of redness in upper cheeks</li>
      <li>I am 63 and have fair skin with a few sun spots.</li>
      <li>I love the Image skin care line, It is hard to find and I am so glad they sell it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for the right person.</li>
      <li>This thing seems to be working just fine in keeping those spots more pale, but if you are going to be at the pool and under the sun all day, this won&#x27;t save you!</li>
      <li>Very unattractive.  </li>
      <li>I am typically very prone to break outs, but I have not broken out from this product</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have 3 sun spots - on my forhead, and under each cheek. This thing seems to be working just fine in keeping those spots more pale, but if you are going to be at the pool and under the sun all day, this won&#x27;t save you! Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen (or chemical peel)!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this and I can see it&#x27;s starting to work. I ordered my first bottle in March.  I have used it 2 times a day every day and I am starting to see some of my dark spots actually getting lighter.  I have tried numerous products over the years and this one seems to be starting to help.  I am 63 and have fair skin with a few sun spots.</li>
    <li> I ordered through Amazon because the reviews are always so helpful in the honesty of the product performance.  Keep up the good work.  This is the first time the shipping has been a problem, I hope it gets fixed.  Order placed April 9,  tomorrow is April 21 maybe it will show up then.  This item is expensive, for not having a quality delivery process.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results. It could be that I&#x27;m darker skin.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Sticky, made me break out.</li>
    <li> Image Ageless Total Skin Lightening serum not only removed reddness. my skin appears more radient &amp; even. Love this product</li>
    <li> Like the price.  It&#x27;s not as strong as obaji&#x27;s product, but does have a lightning effect.  It&#x27;s a much betters price.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! No odor and not greasy! Does what it says it will do. Lightened my skin dis colorations.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product ...really works and makes your skin feel awesome !</li>
    <li> I have seen dark spots vanish over time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months.  My friend uses it as we&#x27;ll and I&#x27;ve noticed her dark spots are lighter and starting to vanish!  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My face has several brown spots that are pretty deep.  I love the smell of this product and maybe had I caught my skin issues earlier this would have been the way for me to go, but with my skin issues the bleaching serum works best.</li>
    <li> I am not wrinkle free or free of age spots yet, but i like the concept. My dark spots might be diminishing. I have been using it for a month now.</li>
    <li> Here is an email I just sent the seller, Funworld afterall.  &amp;#34;There is something very wrong with the product I received.  Normally I buy the Ageless Total Skin Lightening Serum through the salon that provides my skincare.  This time I decided to try Amazon.  This product usually smells so wonderful you&#x27;d want to eat it.  Yours (seller appears as Funworld-afterall....hummm suspect name for skin care products), however, has a distasteful stink.  I compared the two bottles, the one from my salon, and yours.  Everything looks like same on the exterior, but the contents of yours, quite frankly, stink.  Has this product gone bad, been stored incorrectly or is it a fake?  In any event I&#x27;d like to return this.  Thank you for your attention&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This immediately feels good on application,  with a nice smell and  a skin tightening effect. I was told to use it both day and night. It  evens out my skin tone better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have several age spots and was hoping this product would get rid of them or at least improve them. It didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the gradual difference my skin appears to have. I would buy it again. Plus it&#x27;s not harsh</li>
    <li> My esthetician had me start using this product to lighten red spots and post acne  marks on my face. It definitely controls redness right away but you have to be patient to see the fading of more permanent marks.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite products, great for dark spots and old acne scars. Makes your skin super smooth. One bottle lasts about 6 weeks, worth the money for this little bottle.</li>
    <li> I am typically very prone to break outs, but I have not broken out from this product and I really enjoy using this product. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after a recommendation from a facial.  I get very flushed b/c I&#x27;m half English w/ freckles.  Some how this product smooths out my face and helps from my face getting too red (which I&#x27;m not sure how it can do that part).  I receive compliments all the time how I have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.  Highly recommend for the right person.</li>
    <li> Had an OXYGEN facial recently and afterwards was given a trial kit of IMAGE products to use afterwards including this item.  Ended up ordering ALL five products because my &amp;#34;combination - post menopausal still w/t-zone&amp;#34; skin has never looked so good!</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  I have oily, breakout-prone skin (no rosacea).  I&#x27;m a Licensed Esthetician and Image Skin Care is by far my favorite skin care line!  Their products are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this serum in the mornings after I cleanse my face.  It smells fantastic (like pineapples or something tropical) and I love the consistency, it goes on evenly and melts into my skin.  This serum feels very healing and nourishing.  Within a few days of using this product, I noticed my skin tone was more even, healthy, and glowing.  My hypermpigmentation spots are slowly fading and my skin is just glowing!  I sometimes use it on my back and chest as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a permanent serum in my skincare routine! :)</li>
    <li> i just got this product and have been using it for about 6 days so no big difference yet. smell real good not oily will give a update i would  buy this again i like the moisture is gives. i just hopes it lightens</li>
    <li> I have skin issues and this is a must have for me. I have dry skin and breakout. I never do now I use this everyday.</li>
    <li> i just received my purchase earlier today, God, are these hard to find. i last used these over an year ago bought through ebay and they just disappeared never to be listed again. like ever. but then i browsed on amazon and wow i found them. this serum did an awesome job clearing up pigmentation all over my face and i could&#x27;ve paid like 100 dollars for each bottles since they are a miracle. the ONLY serum that has worked on my pigmentation (which was a result of prolong sun exposure, long term hydroquinone usage damage etc). im gonna be using these forever hopefully. as long as they keep it listed on here. which i reallllly hope they do. im a shopper from india and i think it took over 15 days for the delivery. which is ok since i know international shipping and stuff.</li>
    <li> I was so hoping that this product would help some red spots on my face, but I saw no improvement. all the Image skincare products I have tried have not worked for me, which is unfortunate because they don&#x27;t come cheap!</li>
    <li> My facial therapist mentioned about Image skin care for brightening my sun damage spot and age spot.  I found this on Amazon, much cheaper than the salon price tag.  It smells very good and is absorbed in skin very quickly.  The skin is very soft to touch after the application.  I have been using this for less than a month but can see some difference.  It seems the sun/aged spots are slightly diminishing. I use this twice in the morning and evening after washing my face.  I would update once I finish the product.  So far I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she really likes it and wants to buy more for her friends thanks</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s doing anything.....put if off until winter when not in sun</li>
    <li> Been using this serum 2x/day for a month religiously with spf 50 and I do not notice a change at all...It&#x27;s really frustrating.  I use all over my face.  I have post acne scars that i am trying to get rid of.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at the recommendation of an aesthetician to fade acne scars, and I gotta say it&#x27;s really doing the job well. I use three drops morning and night, and the bottle lasts at least three months. It smells good and absorbs pretty quickly too.</li>
    <li> I love the Image skin care line, It is hard to find and I am so glad they sell it.</li>
    <li> Item came as expected. I started using this product December 2012; it works for me. I recommend this product .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and do like it but feel that it doesn&#x27;t work fast enough or is strong enough to see immediate results. It does work but takes a long time.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel smooth.  Not greasy.  My skin glows after using this product.  I recommend. A very good price as compared to spas.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It diminishes my brown spots and leaves my skin time with an even and flawless look.</li>
    <li> My neice got me into using this product for my face.  I love it, but it is quite pricey,so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle.  My skin feels noticeable smoother, brighter.  However, the blotchyness, capillaries are still there.  I might try the MD version of the Image line for this.  Or I might go to the bleaching.  I will decide after I finish this second bottle.</li>
    <li> I loved how my skin was soft and clear. I recommend this product to my family and friends. Good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from a spa and love it!  The lightening agent is a mushroom extract and not hydro quinone so it is safe for most skin types.  I saw a difference in just a couple uses, hyperpigmentation around my  cheeks and temples was significantly reduced.  My mom is using it as well and it has lightened her age spots.  This is a wonderful product and I would highly, highly recommend it.  A little goes a long ways so it will last months.</li>
    <li> It has been several weeks now that I have used the product religiously every morning and every night and I have not seen any improvement.  My dark spots look the same as when I started using the product.</li>
    <li> I just bought this lightening serum because it was the only one claiming that it is good for roseacia.&lt;br /&gt;Since so far I have never found anything actually helping my roseacia, I was very sceptical about these claims. However, I decided to buy it hoping that it would lighten my other discolorations, like a few spots of melasma.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that after just a three days of using this serum, my complexion is brighter, my roseacia is less \\&quot;angry\\&quot; looking, in fact I don&#x27;t think one can even tell I have a case of roseacia, my skin is so much whiter and better looking. I just hope they will not stop making this product like it&#x27;s frequently the case.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the shipper would have included a list of ingredients on a piece of paper, not just what shows on the small bottle itself, as it is hard to read. Other than that I have nothing but the best things to say about the promt shipment of this product, and of course this delightful product itself.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this review after I&#x27;ve used this serum for a longer time, but so far I am VERY pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this product ...works very well!</li>
    <li> To everyone who purchases professional brands on Amazon.  These products are only sold to licensed professionals.  What you are more than likely getting is either a different product, an expired product or diluted product.  It is better to find a spa near you who carries these lines than to take a risk of who knows what you&#x27;re putting on your skin. For those of you who said how bad this one smells,  as someone who carries this line, this product shouldn&#x27;t ever smell bad which shows you something isn&#x27;t right.  Stick to your trusted professionals!</li>
    <li> This product is made and sold only by Image Skincare.  On their website, the company specifically says that they don&#x27;t sell their products on the internet. Therefore, I&#x27;m not sure whether what I purchased is indeed the real thing. I have not seen any changes, although it is true that with this product, it takes time to see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really recommend it as a purchase on the internet (for the reason specified earlier) and probably will not buy again. But, i have no seen any results over the course of 2 weeks of use. Maybe it works but really really slow. Not sure.</li>
    <li> If I could eat this serum I would! I love the way it smells also it works wonders. This line of facial products is all super great. Made for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I feel this item does nothing! It has a bad odor and is worthless. Not ever something i would get again! very too bad.</li>
    <li> I use this product to reduce rudiness on my cheeks and usually wipe the excess on the tops of my hands.  I&#x27;ve noticed a marked reduction in age spots on the tops of my hands.  One hand is almost completely void of them.  I&#x27;m only 50, so did not have bad spotting, but I did have noticeable spots and they are now gone.</li>
    <li> Recently started using this with my skincare regiem. So far very impressed with the results! Keeping my skin tone smooth and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This serum is working very well for me. I really like how it feels on my skin. I use it only at night before bedtime, and the serum really does work. I also really like the smell of this serum as well.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer.  This is the only product that has worked to lighten my melasma.  It does not work overnight, but with daily use, I have definitely seen the dark spots lift.  The smell is great too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year.  I have some very stubborn spots that even a complete Obagi skin renew cycle hardly lightened.  I tried Sanitas products after Obagi, but some spots started to darken anyway.  Then I discovered this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darkening stopped.  I thought that would be as good as it got, but I continued to use one drop (it doesn&#x27;t take much) every morning and evening.  After another 6 months, I noticed that the spots had dramatically lightened.  I have been using this consistently ever since and have seen even more improvement.  In speaking to an Image consultant, I was told that this is something you have to keep using to maintain the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister uses Clinique at more than double the price.  She says it works, too.  But why would I want to pay more?  My bottle lasts about 6 months, hers lasts about 4.  I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. So far its very nice! It smells a little like coconut. It is helping my under eye dark circle-- just don&#x27;t put it too close to your eyes as it is very concentrated and powerful. And It is helping my dark acne circle turn lighter. very nice product</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday and even at night. I&#x27;m glad I got it, its helping with my dark marks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American, early 30&#x27;s. I was recently turned onto this product during a spa visit and I’m in love! After using the product, only at night, for roughly two weeks now I can already see a visible difference. My skin is more even, soft and I’m not seeing as many break outs as I had prior to using this product. Oh yea, I love the fact that a little goes a long way so this bottle should last me for a while. Will purchase again...and again...and again.... lolol</li>
    <li> this stuff gets on everything, your hair, pillowcase, husband&#x27;s face, etc. It seems to take forever to absorb or maybe it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I saw some results since using this product, i&#x27;m yet to see if miracles comes in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So i am giving it some time.  Delivery was good as well.</li>
    <li> There are I miracle cures for pigmentation defects but this product does help lighten he dark spots.  Not painful and no unpleasant odor, either.</li>
    <li> Love this product, was suffering from a lot of redness in upper cheeks this is so much better now- great buy:)</li>
    <li> I know the product itself is good, as I have tried it before. I don&#x27;t agree with advertising a product knowing that the item is no longer in stock. I waited a week before hearing that the item was not shipped, and this was because I had to inquire. They were however prompt about answering my email, and seemed polite. I am not  a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 6 weeks now and it simply does not work.  It neither lightens or texturizes the the skin as claimed.  It&#x27;s an absolute rip off!!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.. Sadly I use the other Image products and love them but this one didn&#x27;t do as well.</li>
    <li> Does nothing. Not happy with this product. Gonna keep using it until I run out and hopefully see SOME results over time</li>
    <li> This works even better than the Murad lightening product &#x3D; quicker and more effective,  Dries fast so you can almost immediately put moisturizer on.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> STUFF IS THE BOMB. THE DAY I GOT IT TORE IT OPEN WASHED MY FACED AND STARTED USING IT AS TO USE MORNING AND NIGHT TIME. I AM NOT KIDDING THE NEXT DAYS MY FACE FLAWS WERE LIGHTER. ON MY 3RD DAY AND OM MY GOSH! I CAN&#x27;T TELL YOU HOW THIS WORKS AND SMELLS GREAT. I HAVE TOLD TONS OF PEOPLE ABOUT IT. GREAT TO DOWNPLAY ACNE SCARS, REDNESS AND I GUESS SOME OTHER STUFF IVE READ THAT DON&#x27;T APPLY TO ME. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS  ITEM. AND ITS REASONABLE HERE OTHER PLACES I LOOKED QUITE PRICEY. GIVE IT A SHOT. CAN ALWAYS RETURN IF DON&#x27;T HAVE THE LUCK IM HAVING. WILL BE BACK FOR MY NEXT BOTTLE AMAZON!!:)</li>
    <li> I use it daily.  Was recommended by my spa and so I purchased it.  It lightens dark sun spots,etc.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, works well.  It is a light, non-greasy nor thick serum. Highly recommended for sun / age spot removal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the sun freckles &amp; age spots on my face.  They&#x27;re very pronounced during the summer and I noticed this year that some of the freckles were running together, creating larger patches of brown spots.  Very unattractive.  I applied this twice daily, morning and night, used up the entire bottle and did not see any lightening at all, none whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I&#x27;m hooked!  Leaves my face feeling brighter and smoother.  One of the only things that helps calm my redness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already bought this 3 times from Amazon.  I use this after every time I wash my face with image face cleaners. I only only use Image on my face when washing or lighting or moisturizing honestly the best! drip a full size dime amount in my left hand and use two fingers to soak my cheeks chin then forehead apply all over face. Let dry naturally. Little sticky. It&#x27;s what you want to do if you truly want Red from acne gone. then I use vitamin c moisture from image. I will continue to use image products for the rest of my life.  I&#x27;m 28 so I can afford it but I wish I knew about image products in my teens. I feel very strong towards this product bc of the huge difference in my skin when I look in the mirror I don&#x27;t just see red anymore and I feel good. I love Image</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a full two months, both morning and night, and it has not significantly lightened the rosacea and liver spots on my face.  Although it has a wonderful fragrance I am disappoointed in the efficacy of the product.</li>
    <li> Using to lighten sun spots on hands and arms and after a month have not noticed much of a difference</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I LOVE Image products and thought I would love this too.  It feels geat on my skin but I have not seen any improvments of my dark spots. Will stick with Image lotions but not this</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling product (as is the entire collection). I have been using this for months and I do notice a difference it makes in addition to the Max moisturizer and the masque. This works to continue my skin protection and revitalization.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is easy to put on and very good at treating skin redness. I will continue to order this prduct.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these products accidently and the company was great in helping me return one item and sending me another. I will order from them again. The product goes on nice, not greasy, waiting for the results. I haven&#x27;t used it daily, but when I do I will post the results.</li>
    <li> It works great!  I am 60 years old and I am impressed with how it has taken away my dark spots from sun damage.</li>
    <li> This is also what I was looking for,.The ageless lightening serum i great.  I use it quite frequently.  Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Makes the skin soft and even toned. I use it with Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Prevage and moisturizer. On average, after using it for at least 4 weeks, people would guess my age to be at least 7 to 10 years younger. This is an awesome product. I just ordered a 3rd bottle yesterday.</li>
