<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is the best for my Dexcom CGM transmitter.  Skin Tac didn&#x27;t do the trick... It stuck to my body and it stuck the medical tape to my body but it didn&#x27;t have a good grip on the sticky pad around the transmitter.  I just cut a little square in this and put it over the transmitter (not covering it) and it has doubled the duration of my sensors!</li>
    <li> A must for anyone with an OmniPod or a CGM.  my husband is able to wear his CGM much longer because of this, which saves us hundreds of dollars.</li>
    <li> I have well lets say multiple hours worth of tattoo work done on my body and I use this stuff every single time I have a new tattoo. Just clean around the new tattoo with isopropyl alcohol and lay a strip of this over it for 2 days, take it off and clean the tattoo, then apply a new strip of film to the tattoo. Keep doing this process for the first week you have your new tattoo and it will heal up without all the crazy goo scabs that build up over new tattoos and can ruin the design.</li>
    <li> Easy to use with insulin pump supplies.</li>
    <li> Love it! It gives me the flexibility I need in covering the affected area.</li>
    <li> I have to use an extended release patch that I change every other day. If I use the patch alone I typically lose it in the shower or swimming (despite the label instructions). With my doctor&#x27;s OK I have been using Opsite Flexifix on top of the patch every time I apply one. It is easy to cut to size. In my case it&#x27;s a simple cut to length; the four inch width is perfect. It is easy to handle and just about disappears when it is on the skin. I sweat profusely when it&#x27;s warm out and this tape holds up to that very well. Now no worries in the shower or swimming. Like any tape that adheres well there is a minor hair &amp;quot;ouch&amp;quot; when removing. I am very pleased with this product and order it on a regular basis though eleven yards goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I use patches that contain pain medication in them. The margin of error is very small. If I am unable to protect the patch from moisture, sweat or even being snagged by clothing it is like losing 2 or 3 days worth of pain pills. Dr&#x27;s aren&#x27;t very willing to provide medication sooner than scheduled and don&#x27;t want to hear about why you didn&#x27;t ensure the patch was protected. The size of patch I use was just too big to get away with using only one Tegaderm Film Dressing. They are very difficult to apply by yourself. This Flexfit Opsite is not only easier, one roll cost less than 3 pkgs of Tegaderms from Walmart. They each hold eight dressing. That&#x27;s 24 Tegaderms for the price of 132 Flexifix (3&amp;#34;x4&amp;#34;&#x3D;12&amp;#34;x11&#x27;&#x3D;132) thank you so saving me so much money!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. In addition to what other reviewers have stated as uses, it also works well as almost a &amp;#34;band-aid&amp;#34; to cover certain types of cuts or splits in your skin (e.g., paper cuts or any small cut or split on fingers) b/c it keeps it clean and is mostly waterproof; so, it stays on through washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a couple of other brands in the past, and they&#x27;ve all been okay; but I think I like this brand best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s a little thicker (not much) than the others, which makes it a little easier to use. The others often got twisted or stuck to itself if I was using a smaller piece, which meant it was wasted. This brand doesn&#x27;t do that nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt; - It is more of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish, whereas most others are glossy. Not a big deal, but it does make it a lot more subtle.&lt;br /&gt; - You can cut this in virtually any size piece and still use the two step process to adhere it to your skin.&lt;br /&gt; - It was the cheapest product like this I could find, when you factor in length, width, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; - The only con I found was that the &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34; backing tends to come off before the &amp;#34;remove first&amp;#34; backing, despite trying to get it off in the right order. But this isn&#x27;t a big deal, just a minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Works great to secure my CGM.</li>
    <li> My 2yr old son has a Mic-Key button &amp; feeding tube - being very mobile like an ordinary 2 year old, it was a struggle to figure out how to anchor the feeding tube. We started using a large Tegaderm over the mic-key, this worked well but was expensive. Now we just use a roll of this. Cut some off, add some gauze in the middle to keep it off the mic-key (for easier removal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks to his skin well, doesn&#x27;t let go until we&#x27;re ready to take it off (several days) and does not cause any skin irritation. That&#x27;s quite an accomplishment for baby skin! We&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first but it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Use to keep mouth closed, in conjunction with Breathe Right nose strips to control correct breathing through the nose during sleep. Much more secure (this stuff really stays stuck!) and more comfortable than adhesive tape - also far less noticable - if vanity is important. The 10cm width is perfect.</li>
    <li> This was a life saver in keeping the Dexcom continuous glucose monitor sensor and transmitter in place.</li>
    <li> best medical tape ever used. so much cheaper than tegaderm and works way better. I use to hold down a fentanyl patch and they stay put the whole three days know matter how bad you sweat or how often you shower. The whole cut to length this role will last over a year.</li>
    <li> I use a weekly pain patch that is said to be \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; but often starts coming up at the edges. I tried tegaderm patches but at $14 for 4 they were pricey and I had to cut them to fit. Then I discovered this product, it is a bit thicker than the Tegaderm and seems to be \\&quot;sticker\\&quot; too. The down side to this is that it is so sticky I can&#x27;t remove it from the cloth like texture of the pain patch. Also if you have allergies to the cloth medical tape, clear plastic medical tape, or foam medical tape, you will probably also be allergic to this product. I have these allergies and although I am not allergic to Tegaderm I am to this product and had to stop using it because of a rash that developed. If you are covering something like an IV, stitches, or anything else you need to not come off with the dressing this product may be to sticky.</li>
    <li> If you use a daily changed sterile wound covering, you know how expensive they are when purchased separately.  This is a solid roll that will produce 26-33 patch covers depending on how far apart you are cutting them.  I paid $26 and change for the roll..  If you bought 26-33 individual patches it would cost you anywhere from $65/$234 (26) to $91/$297 (33). To say the least, this was like hitting really good scratch-off lottery ticket, reflecting my out of pocket savings.  I personally recommend taking your time, spend a few extra pennies and buy a ruler a pair of scissors. This will assure you of getting every bit of your money without wasting any patch length. Then, you can take the extra money you saved and go out for dinner and maybe a movie!</li>
    <li> I used to buy Tegaderm bandages to use for my medication patches. They worked great, but they were so expensive. An entire roll of this adhesive is less expensive than three Tegaderm bandages at the size I needed. So far, over three uses this has been easy to measure, cut, and apply without help on my arm with the opposite hand. It stays on well in the shower, with perspiration or humidity.  I would recommend this for fentanyl or Duragesic of any size. (I have the large 100mcg and the smaller 25 mcg) This tape covers both at once with the ability to measure and cut with the gridlines on the tape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with the patch system I was prescribed staying on my skin. This product worked perfect to apply over patch and gave the added sticking power needed.  It nice you can cut to fit&lt;br /&gt;your needs</li>
    <li> this &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; works great! I use it to keep my dexcom cgm sensor attached to my skin for a full week, and it holds the entire time. It is thin and flexible, which makes it easy to forget that you have it on, unlike other bulkier tapes.</li>
    <li> Very durable film. I use it to hold a Dexcom 4 CGM sensor to my arm because the tape that comes with the sensor doesn&#x27;t last longer than 5 days because of daily exercise and showers. With this film I can keep my Dexcom sensor for 2 weeks without any issues. I cut a piece with a hole in the middle to wrap and hold the sensor down. Very impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> This tape is a godsend for keeping dexcom sensors securely in place. A roll lasts a very long time and it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
    <li> Works great easy to use and it saves time!</li>
    <li> I was told by many people that this product was the answer to keeping my glucose monitor attached for weeks. I actually get less time out of the monitor sticking with this product than without it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to tape the edges of our son&#x27;s glucose monitoring sensor down on the side of his stomach.  Very sticky product.  Very thin film.  We found that it does take off the top layer of skin when taking it off, so we purchased &amp;#34;Desolv It Citrus Solution 12 oz.&amp;#34; to help out removing it when we put fresh film around our son&#x27;s sensor weekly.</li>
    <li> I use this for my Dexcom Glucose Monitor system.  It helps keep the sensor on longer that the sensor alone.&lt;br /&gt;I live in Texas, and with the heat comes sweat.  This helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I love how you can custom cut this to whatever shape you want. It sticks great. Has worked fantastic for my son&#x27;s CGM. It extends the use of the CGM we just add tape as needed around the area. Far better than any other product we tried (which was MANY). Roll lasts a long time too. Comes of really easy with Unisolve. My son was getting irritation with the other products but not with this. It&#x27;s so thin and flexible, moves with you. Doesn&#x27;t pinch or snag on clothes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this bandage as aftercare for my tattoo clients for a couple years now. After using multiple different brands and trying different methods, I have found this brand to be the most effective and affordable. Unlike &amp;#34;tattoo-derm&amp;#34; which is expensive and cumbersome, this bandage allowed for you to see the area you are placing your bandage by being see through. Which is much like the 3m equivalent, although Smith &amp; Nephew is more affordable, nearly 10$ cheaper per roll. This is an indispensable healing product in my opinion, minimizing the chance of infections exponentially. This type of barrier prevents the tattoo from sticking to clothing, sheets and collecting outside bacteria. When applied in the proper way in a sterile environment there is no better way to care for a tattoo. Lasting up to three days, once it is removed the tattoo is already in the peeling process, skipping the scabbing stage by allowing the skin to heal itself. Not only that, but the barrier is breathable and waterproof. All in all I have done my research and absolutely recommend this bandage to other artists and all of my clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for applying this bandage to a tattoo area&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean the tattoo with gloved hand, or if it is on yourself, wash hands thoroughly then clean the surface with a clean paper towel. Use a mild soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pat tattoo dry with clean dry paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;3. Once surface is completely dry cut bandage to size and apply, leaving a 1/2 inch to an inch barrier on all sides.&lt;br /&gt;4. If bandage becomes pinched or ruffled at edge, cut a small pice and lay flat over edge to prevent fluid from escaping.&lt;br /&gt;5. A heat rash may occur after a day or so, if this is the case remove the bandage, clean surface, let it dry then happy thin coat of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a client always confide in your tattoo artist not in other clients when curious about healing methods.&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional tattoo artist of 4 years who owns a studio in Navarre, Florida. My husband also uses this aftercare and has been tattooing for over 16 years.</li>
    <li> My mom had spine surgery and wasn&#x27;t allowed to get the incision wet for a while. This worked wonderfully to keep water out while she showered, as well as to just keep her dressing in place! Just cut to size and stick it down.</li>
    <li> use this around my dexcom site.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job to hold in place, yet the adhesive is a little less than desirable. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Really really great tape.  My daughter wears a continuous glucose sensor on her arm for diabetes and they are so expensive, you do not want to lose one early!  It is not causing any reaction on her skin and we leave it on 2 weeks.  She is in and out of the water a ton for swim team.  Much, much superior to the IV 3000s.  We also use skin tac adhesive which you might not even need if you&#x27;re not in the water so much. The 4\\&quot; tape covers a Dexcom patch quite well, just cut a hole in the middle.</li>
    <li> Of the three products that I have tried, this product is very easy to handle and has very good durability.</li>
    <li> Works great.  We have a little waste each time as we cut the roll to cover the medicine patch.  Stays on well through workouts and showers.</li>
    <li> This tape is fantastic. I use it for my Dexcom CGM and Omnipod. It&#x27;s so good it can be a challenge to remove. But I like the flexibility of being able to cut to size. I envisage a roll will last at least a year. Much cheaper than other similar options.</li>
    <li> Very good vender had a slight problem with tracking # but not there fault they made it right great service highly recamend them when looking for the hard to find</li>
    <li> Very good. Does more than what I expected.  Does the job I wanted.  When this is gone I expect to order more.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs &amp; affordable.</li>
    <li> Cost effective and does the job very very well.</li>
    <li> I use this tape for my Dexcom Platinum G4 sensor. Although the Dexcom sensors are made for a 7 day cycle, I typically try to make them last for 14 days. Because the Dexcom adhesive starts peeling after 5-7 days, I cut out a piece of this Smith and Nephew Flexifix Opsite and place it over top of my Dexcom sensor/transmitter tape to hold it down. What works best for me is to cut a 4&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34; section, cut a square out of the middle and place it around my Dexcom transmitter. I can easily make it to day 14 with the Flexifix Opsite only beginning to peel loose slightly days 12-14. One roll lasts me quite long since I only use a little every two weeks. It pays for itself quickly though considering I get 100% more life out of my Dexcom sensors.</li>
    <li> best, stays on. It is just the best, used 3M Tegaderm  before</li>
    <li> I use this tape to secure my Dexcom G4 continuous glucose monitor sensors, since the adhesive on the sensors themselves doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough. The tape is plenty secure and breathable enough such that I&#x27;ve been able to leave it on for &amp;#62;2 weeks without developing a rash. Great product!</li>
    <li> i have severe, intractable pain, but it is somewhat managed by the Duragesic (fentanyl) patches….if I can get them to adhere to my skin for for the prescribed time. This means not moving, not sweating, not showering, treating the area where the patch is adhered with &amp;#34;kid gloves&amp;#34;: once that patch falls off, you&#x27;re in for a few days of worse pain and, if it can get even better, sudden withdrawal from the strongest opioid available on the market! Smith And Nephew Flexifix solved that problem! I apply the patch and apply a piece of the Flexifix that is larger along all four sides (rounding the corners to avoid catching clothing), and I&#x27;ve never lost a patch since I&#x27;ve switched from Tegaderm. It&#x27;s much easier to work with, as well. Give it a try! It is SO much simpler. A bonus for those with diabetes: it holds the constant glucose monitors with no bother at all either!</li>
    <li> Use it as primary &amp; secondary dressing and it stays on well for many days  and it resolves wounds faster and maintains a moist wound environment !</li>
    <li> Works ok in ideal conditions. Not when I sweat</li>
    <li> great to attach my daughters divide to skin last long</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND SELLER THANKS</li>
    <li> Saved a ton of money VS the brand name for the same product.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Bought to help secure diabetic equipment and it provides a long lasting seal with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Thank You, Thank You. It is so nice when you live on my budget to get a great deal for medical supplies.</li>
    <li> I have the insulin pump and the continues montering system and need good tape to keep in place. This product worls wonderfull, the best tape I have ever used and believe me I have tried lots of different types.</li>
    <li> This is great for those who have the freedom to choose the size they need.Lines on product help you to cut straight,easy to use with one hand placement.Waterproof and sticks well!I have a tunneled picc line and can swim and shower and it stays dry.It doesn&#x27;t loosen with sweat either.Plus a great price!</li>
    <li> My husband has to wear pain patches and this is the only thing I have found that acutally works and keeps patch on for the 7 days!! Great stuff, will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product was a godsend! I have a severe tegaderm allergy, a friend recommended this after a nurse used tegaderm on my PICC site causing burns so bad that I had to have specialized burn tx.&lt;br /&gt;The material is soft, pliable and does not irritate my skin at all even without skin prep. It stays on very very well even in extreme temps as long as it is applied properly.&lt;br /&gt;When applying, this material is not to be stretched and you want to be sure the edges are completely sealed. If the edges are not well placed, the dressing will lift with moisture of any kind.</li>
    <li> Within 12 hours of using this my skin showed signs of cellulitis.  I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to this type of product and had a severe reaction.  In addition, the seal on the tap itself was poor and when I removed it the area was slightly damp.  I would be cautious when purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I use this to go over my daughter&#x27;s CGM - Dexcom site. It works PERFECT and one piece lasts all 7 days. We cut off a rectangular piece from the roll. Then with a template we made, we cut out a center oval the size of the sensor/site. Then we place the adhesive over the hole site with the sensor sticking out of the hole! It&#x27;s awesome! Also, no itching and no burns from adhesive. After a day of it being off, the skin is back to looking normal!</li>
    <li> Sticks good, excellent fitting</li>
    <li> Easy to use: cut off the size you want, apply and it stays in place until you peel it off.  Much more reliable than other adhesives and bandages that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this s***. I put it on my skin before putting on my insulin pump where the cannula will be inserted. It stays until I need to take my pod off (~3 days) but doesn&#x27;t hurt like a band-aid when you pull it off. I&#x27;ve been using those individually-wrapped tegaderm things you can buy at CVS, which are okay, but harsher on my skin and stupidly expensive (like $9 a box). This is much better, and I can cut the exact size I need.</li>
    <li> This product is great for taping down or adhering continuous glucose monitoring sensors!  I am a very active diabetic with basketball, lifting, running, and golfing.  I have even lost a CGM transmitter before, but after using the Opsite Flexifix, I have been extremely happy with the product.  Past adhesives have created irritated skin, pealed off quickly, or did not allow for adequate skin temperature variance, not to mention the overall customizable size.  I will continue to purchase Opsite Flexifix without question and you should give it a try if you have not been pleased with past adhesives!</li>
    <li> The great thing about this product is that you can cut it any size you need.  It sticks as tightly as the Tegaderm but may actually be harder to remove from the skin.  It&#x27;s was worth a try and I still use it, but I still use the Tegaderm also.  Only slight preference to Tegaderm.</li>
    <li> I had been using Tegaderm product when I tried the SN Opsite product.  Whoa nelly...&lt;br /&gt;The film is thicker than the 3m product without being overly heavy.  The adhesive stays on through just about anything.  Anytime I&#x27;ve used it I have to remember to not mess with it until the tattoo had a few days under the film.  Exceptional stuff.</li>
    <li> Used to cover my Dexcom G4 w/share sensor. Worked great!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my dexcom sensors after 1 week. Thus with the skin-tac liquid when first inserted allows me to get 2 weeks or more without any issues. It&#x27;s recommended not to cover up the dexcom transmitter so you should cut a hole in the middle for that.  To see how I made this easier with a cut out template and my review watch my video http://youtu.be/qrmCgntNKEc&lt;br /&gt;I purchased mine for he direct care store, reliable and fast shipping. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them and they are great to deal with. They carry other things also that may not be advertised in the amazon store.</li>
    <li> Once we were able to determine how to use it, we have been very pleased.  It does not irritate skin and secures the Dexcom sensor and keeps it in place.  It is an excellent product and excellent value.</li>
    <li> The grid format and double (front and back) protection makes this so much easier to use than other options!  The grid makes cutting a breeze.  Very nice on the skin (and I have sensitive skin)!</li>
    <li> Purchased this tape for use with the Dexcom G4 CGM based on the reviews of others.  It met my expectations completely: easy to measure and cut because of its grid lines; completely waterproof for nearly three weeks before it started to peel away; very lightweight; no irritation; easy and painless to remove.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Better than I hoped. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had a large cut on a finger, and was going through bandaids like crazy. Covering the finger with this barrier kept the dressing clean and dry. Later, when I no longer needed a thick dressing, I could just use this barrier, and it kept the wound clean.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful stuff, and lots of it on the roll.</li>
    <li> They stick well until you sweat and I believe I have an allergic reaction but still using them.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I still have it sitting in my medicine cabinet. I tried to cut it in sections, as I only need 1 by1in, it just makes one big stick to itself mess. Sorry I did not return it. Would not recommend this product.  Update: thought that I would try it once more since I paid$ $$$ for this product. Come to find out NO SUBMERSION IN WATER! So, this product as absolutely worthless to this ex-user I wouldn&#x27;t even use it on kids as they are always in water.....</li>
    <li> You get 10 or 20 times the amount of product per dollar buy buying this in bulk like this.  I use this for medical patches that of course never stay on as long as they are supposed to.  This is rated specifically to breath properly to hold patches and is just the same as the product used in hospitals.  It stays on a week easily, works in the shower and isn&#x27;t super painful to remove.  Fives stars all the way.  Oh and it has lines on the peel off paper so you can cut it easily to your favorite length.</li>
    <li> Huge saving,  great for sensitive skin and waterproofs wounds.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this tape for about 8 months. it works like a charm. i&#x27;ve tried many others, all of which were much less helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve never had the tape come off, it leaves little or no deposit, it seals very well for as long as a week (i&#x27;ve not tested it for longer) and works nicely even despite long showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have a type 1 diabetic son and he is extremely active.  We use this to help keep his continuous glucose monitor on.  It is so easy to use!  The green grid helps to cut it the right shape and it is so easy to peel and put on.  MUCH cheaper than the individual pre-cut adhesive.  This roll will last a really long time.  So excited that I finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> Love this product to keep our insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor on tightly.  It&#x27;s waterproof yet it breathes.  A little tricky to take the non sticking part off.  Takes some practice but even with practice it&#x27;s unpredictable at times</li>
    <li> This works GREAT!!!!!! This cost of this item is cheaper than just one box of the IV300. And with the IV300 you only get ?10?! If my figures are correct I am going to get about 145 dressing out of this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I have to cut it down to size, but there are lines that assist in this. I have been useing this for about 4 months now to cover my CGM sensor.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Tegaderm patches, but found I was using multiple patches to get the right size, and they are prohibitively expensive. This product is great: cut to size,  and sticks better for me than the Tegaderm,  and the price is much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after a previous manufacture changed the size and quality of a similar type of film.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I had been using this film until they raised the price per roil which sent me looking for a lower priced product. I have been very pleased with the quality of this film even prior to the price change. I was very pleased that the price is once again very affordable for this superior product.&lt;br /&gt;I use this film to secure a very costly prescription medical patch that cannot be replaced should it fall off. The film is very well suited for what I use it for and does a really good job of keeping the patch in place and it is very moisture resistant while letting the skin beneath it breath&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this film not only for what I use it for but most likely it would be great for covering new tattoos because of its high quality.</li>
    <li> Terrific product and priced right.</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the others reviews in the sense that it seems to be a never ending roll and it does stick well but, in my opinion it sticks a bit too well. It is extremely painful to take it off. I have a fentanyl patch where I have to change every 72 hours and the Tegaderm is much easier and much less painful to remove.  Updated opinion: Respectfully, as much as these things are painful to read Bob and as much as I thought I should just get Tegaderm instead, I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the product because a it seems likeit&#x27;s a never ending roll and secondly, it lasts a great deal longer than just buying the Tegaderm. Showering or what have you does not affect it and my Tegaderm batch always stays in place. I have change my mind andI do think these are positive medical supplies but just be prepared for something much stronger than Tegaderm.  In my opinion, this thing is Tegaderm on steroids. I have used Tegaderm for 4 years now and while it can be pricey, it&#x27;s obviously a lot cheaper on Amazon. As soon as I started using this stuff, I mediately wanted to throw it out and buy Tegaderm again but, I didn&#x27;t want to waste the money that I spent on this item. So each and every time I cut a piece off the role I keep hoping that it&#x27;s dwindles away so that I can have an excuse to buy the Tegaderm again. Some individuals mentioned using Flexifix on baby feeding tubes, etc. – I could not imagine putting the stuff on a child. I have a high tolerance when it comes to pain by any means but again, I&#x27;d much rather take the Tegaderm over the Flexifix. The lower cost and the amount you get is not worth it to me at least.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I did recieve it a day later than expected, but still an awesome product.  I recommend to ANYone who is looking for similar tape!</li>
    <li> I use this for my continuous glucous monitor.  This is my third roll, one last&#x27;s about a year or so.  It is great.  I did have some problems with the last roll, the &amp;#34;remove me first&amp;#34; piece was stuck sometimes and I had to throw away that piece.  Mostly it was at the beginning of a the roll, not a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;When my wife was in hospice, I gave some to the nurse who was out of the things she carried.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, we bought this to keep a Dexcom G4 CGM transmitter stuck on. It&#x27;s the best option out there.</li>
