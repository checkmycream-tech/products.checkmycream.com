      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love dior!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>It really is a nice product.</li>
      <li>Like Dior blackout for fullness better</li>
      <li>I had heard rave reviews about Dior&#x27;s mascara, so when I seen this waterproof version I decided to use it as a fill in for my favorite YSL mascara.</li>
      <li>I get better results from the drug store mascara then this.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and thickens my lashes and stays on and  very easy to remove.</li>
      <li>The best way I can describe my level of satisfaction with this product is &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34; In other words, not terrible, but not what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>This Iconic kind applies like a dream and stays put until you take it off, nice curling action too!</li>
      <li>I love Dior Show, but have found that it flakes sometimes, so I was excited to try this.</li>
      <li>and it cleans easily with mascara remover.</li>
      <li>but I find that it does clump easily.</li>
      <li>Does not clump,when layering lightly.</li>
      <li>Comes Off Super Easy with Water!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My new favorite mascara!</li>
      <li>Not as bold as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>I find that it goes on pretty lightly</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!!</li>
      <li>If this were a drugstore brand/ pricing I would&#x27;ve given it 3 stars; however, for the price, this was in no way worth it.</li>
      <li>This mascara is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years &amp; was always pleased when buying it direct  from a Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Super water proof for the first couple of months.</li>
      <li>but these make lashes long and separated and lovely!</li>
      <li>but they are super straight.  </li>
      <li>This color is gorgeous with my green eyes and lasts all day out in the hot sun.</li>
      <li>I just bought the blue on another site and I love this brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not that waterproof, so I feel getting the regular version makes more sense.</li>
      <li>how waterproof&lt;br /&gt;it really is!</li>
      <li>Comes off easily, goes on smoothly, particularly in the beginning when it&#x27;s new.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a fine mascara, but there are definitely lots better out there.</li>
      <li>Really cool mascara -- lied with single move, smooth for whole day without any excesses</li>
      <li>Any of the Dior Waterproof Mascaras are super, just be careful to apply lightly and layer</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and makes my eye lashes really pop.</li>
      <li>Tears or raindrops still leave black trails under my eyes while wearing this Diorshow Iconic mascara, which isn&#x27;t what I would expect for the price.</li>
      <li>If you want high quality mascara and don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s waterproof or not, stick with Dior&#x27;s Blackout Mascara which is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the regular version of this mascara, so I bought the waterproof one for long wear and for use at the beach, etc.  </li>
      <li>Maybe because I left it in a hot car.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an everyday mascara that just separates, then this is fine.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t clumped so far or bled under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>so I apply another coat, then it gets a tad clumpy and ends up flaking on my cheeks a little bit right after applying.</li>
      <li>I love the brush, but overall this is a little average in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I had read/ been told that this was much like Dior Show, but that the formula was less brittle.</li>

<li> I use it with the Dior base (it&#x27;s a white serum)</li>
<li> Disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed to find it was not at all like DS, which elongates and volumizes lashes.</li>

    <li> I had heard rave reviews about Dior&#x27;s mascara, so when I seen this waterproof version I decided to use it as a fill in for my favorite YSL mascara. I love the brush, but overall this is a little average in my opinion. I find that it goes on pretty lightly so I apply another coat, then it gets a tad clumpy and ends up flaking on my cheeks a little bit right after applying. Also, it&#x27;s not as waterproof as I&#x27;d like it to be. Tears or raindrops still leave black trails under my eyes while wearing this Diorshow Iconic mascara, which isn&#x27;t what I would expect for the price. Overall this is a fine mascara, but there are definitely lots better out there.</li>
    <li> I have used a million mascaras and this one is great.  I have plenty of lashes but they are super straight.  After curling, this one holds well.  I prefer waterproof so no smudging and it cleans easily with mascara remover.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t Clump! Stays on Great! Comes Off Super Easy with Water!!&lt;br /&gt;I have found if, I fall sleep with it on, it will flake some!&lt;br /&gt;But, what mascara won&#x27;t? I will find out this summer how waterproof&lt;br /&gt;it really is! I WILL buy Again!!  Fast Shipping!!</li>
    <li> Any of the Dior Waterproof Mascaras are super, just be careful to apply lightly and layer or else you will get clumps.  It is truly waterproof.  It lasts an average amount of time - think the Lancome mascaras are similar and last a little longer.  Don&#x27;t forget the waterproof mascara remover!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this product. The mascara doesn&#x27;t grab onto your lashes as well as it should. It takes about 5 coats to even tell your wearing mascara. Not as bold as I thought it would be. I get better results from the drug store mascara then this. For the price I should get better quality!</li>
    <li> This mascara is worth every penny.  It hasn&#x27;t clumped so far or bled under my eyes.  It really is a nice product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a Waterproof mascara, I would seriously recommend Covergirl over Dior&#x27;s waterproof mascara.  If you want high quality mascara and don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s waterproof or not, stick with Dior&#x27;s Blackout Mascara which is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Evens nicely&lt;br /&gt;Lengthens lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Is not waterproof! Which is why I purchased this tube!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl&#x27;s mascara, as an example, will clump as you shower and it will fall off.  Dior&#x27;s mascara falls under the eye and leaves hard-to-remove smudges.</li>
    <li> Diorshow mascara is hands-down the best in the world. This Iconic kind applies like a dream and stays put until you take it off, nice curling action too!</li>
    <li> Really cool mascara -- lied with single move, smooth for whole day without any excesses</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! Doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and makes my eye lashes really pop. I use it with the Dior base (it&#x27;s a white serum) and I don&#x27;t put anything else on my eyes. Love it!</li>
    <li> I just bought the blue on another site and I love this brand.It&#x27;s taken all my life to find a mascara that works with my long lashes.Does not clump,when layering lightly.This color is gorgeous with my green eyes and lasts all day out in the hot sun.It separates my lashes both upper and lower.Very happy with this will buy again.</li>
    <li> Super water proof for the first couple of months. Then it lost its power. Maybe because I left it in a hot car.</li>
    <li> Pricey but excellent mascara. I wish the brush was smaller though.. It is hard to catch my extremely stubby lashes.</li>
    <li> I love the regular version of this mascara, so I bought the waterproof one for long wear and for use at the beach, etc.  It&#x27;s just not that waterproof, so I feel getting the regular version makes more sense.</li>
    <li> The best way I can describe my level of satisfaction with this product is &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34; In other words, not terrible, but not what I was expecting. I had read/ been told that this was much like Dior Show, but that the formula was less brittle. I love Dior Show, but have found that it flakes sometimes, so I was excited to try this. I was very disappointed to find it was not at all like DS, which elongates and volumizes lashes. If you are looking for an everyday mascara that just separates, then this is fine. If you are looking for something, though, that will make a statement, this isn&#x27;t it. If this were a drugstore brand/ pricing I would&#x27;ve given it 3 stars; however, for the price, this was in no way worth it. I would send it back, but it isn&#x27;t wroth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Long, thick lashes. Comes off easily, goes on smoothly, particularly in the beginning when it&#x27;s new.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love dior!</li>
    <li> It is waterproof, does not clump but does not cover as well as I hoped it would. Over all still a good buy for the money</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years &amp; was always pleased when buying it direct  from a Macy&#x27;s.  Very disappointed after receiving this specific tube from online purchase from 3rd party vendor, as the mascara was 100% dried out &amp; non usable.  It must have sat on some shelf for awhile.</li>
    <li> My new favorite mascara!</li>
    <li> Like Dior blackout for fullness better but these make lashes long and separated and lovely! Any Dior mascara is a go! Best mascara out there- hands down.</li>
    <li> I do like this mascara but I find that it does clump easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best mascara ever. Goes on easy and thickens my lashes and stays on and  very easy to remove.</li>
