      <li>Good price &amp; very speedy delivery!</li>
      <li>these are fun, we all liked them.</li>
      <li>They go on easy.</li>
      <li>Worked well and they were easy to put on.</li>
      <li>not as easy to apply as I thought...</li>
      <li>They are as bright and vibrant looking as the Flash Tattoos brand.</li>
      <li>My 10yr old and her friends loved these but after just a day it looked wrinkled.</li>
      <li>Very stylish, latest several days before fading.</li>
      <li>What a fun trend!  </li>
      <li>But still fun!</li>
      <li>Fun!</li>
      <li>The colors are nice and the quality is good however the colors become dusty after the first day and the colors are not so bright like when they were first placed</li>
      <li>Fun, fun, and more fun.</li>
      <li>Good for 2 night doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2 days.</li>
      <li>love the new metallic tattoos!</li>
      <li>Wow, they are so easy to apply and the product looks great, especially in the sun because they sparkle.</li>
      <li>Other than that these are really nice!</li>
      <li>Really pretty!</li>
      <li>So pretty!</li>
      <li>these guys kind of cheaped out---most temporary tats give you two pages of same design</li>
      <li>These are so fun..</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish was that there was more than one sheet per package available and that they had more designs, but other than that I love them.</li>
      <li>The only negatives are that the stuff on the outsides of the tattoos turns brown very quickly and they lose their reflectiveness very quickly.</li>
      <li>The price was right and she loves them.  </li>
      <li>If you shower it comes right off with soap.</li>
      <li>good, the only drawback is that we would like to know if these tatoo produce some kind of allergy, as one person put it yesterday and in less than three hours he produced an allergy</li>
      <li>Perfect for a little extra bling.</li>
      <li>Only wish they had more options for Hawaiian flowers.</li>
      <li>hoping next time will be better...</li>
      <li>They looked great, yet they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
      <li>These are the first shimmer tatts I have used.</li>
      <li>Nice they offer varying theme other than just chains.</li>
      <li>I love these tatoos they look just as expected and came at the right day</li>
      <li>Love giving these interesting small gift to young friends.</li>
      <li>Unlike the real flash tattoos, which I think do not leave one</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>My &amp;#34;bracelet&amp;#34; lasted much longer than claimed on the package.</li>
      <li>But totally worth worth the money compared to actual Flash tattoos which are around $20.</li>
      <li>Not as cute as some other ones I have found..</li>
      <li>and we will definitely be getting more for the next trip!  </li>
      <li>However the tattoo does leave a normal tattoo residue.</li>
      <li>I have worn most of these with my family members sharing a few.  </li>
      <li>i enjoyed using but they only last one day when the directions say they last 3-5 days</li>
      <li>They are ok but all really small.  </li>
      <li>Purchased the jewelry tattoos for my 9year old granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>I had it for a whole week, and i spent it on the beach</li>

    <li> Perfect for my trip to Hawaii. I understood the design offerings better after I arrived. Turtle, flowers!</li>
    <li> It did well. It does last a few days which is not so bad</li>
    <li> Have only tried them once and didn&#x27;t turn out so well... didn&#x27;t adhere...not as easy to apply as I thought...hoping next time will be better...instructions say to cut around jewelry and make sure you cut as close as you can...that is so hard to do...so make sure when you plan to use... you have no time restraints</li>
    <li> Went on great, and were a lot of fun for ladies night out. There were plenty of tattoos for all of us. We had lots of compliments and questions on where we got them. Love the gold and silver color.</li>
    <li> I love these. They are as bright and vibrant looking as the Flash Tattoos brand. The only thing I wish was that there was more than one sheet per package available and that they had more designs, but other than that I love them. They are cute, trendy metallic tattoos.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stay on that long. But totally worth worth the money compared to actual Flash tattoos which are around $20.</li>
    <li> like the looks -but haven&#x27;t used yet</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even stay on for half an hour</li>
    <li> good, the only drawback is that we would like to know if these tatoo produce some kind of allergy, as one person put it yesterday and in less than three hours he produced an allergy now had to go to the doctor for medication.</li>
    <li> Dazzling possibilities going to great kids!</li>
    <li> Got them for gift and they were a big hit.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my party.</li>
    <li> Not as cute as some other ones I have found.. but it will do</li>
    <li> These stay on! Suggestion - don&#x27;t use lotion in the area you are placing these. They stayed on all weekend - and we attended an all day music festival outside!</li>
    <li> A nice assortment of tattoos. Good for 2 night doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2 days. If you shower it comes right off with soap. But for what is is it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> These are so fun..I have just tried one as i am waiting for my vacation. It has been on for 3 days &amp; looks great. Just don&#x27;t put any baby oil on your skin as that takes them off.</li>
    <li> Cute. My 10yr old and her friends loved these but after just a day it looked wrinkled.</li>
    <li> They are ok but all really small.  They go on easy.</li>

    <li> The colors are nice and the quality is good however the colors become dusty after the first day and the colors are not so bright like when they were first placed</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for the price!  I have worn most of these with my family members sharing a few.  These easily last 3-4 days even at the beach and in the sun!  Love love love and we will definitely be getting more for the next trip!  So pretty!</li>
    <li> great product! I had it for a whole week, and i spent it on the beach and it didn&#x27;t fade away. great quality! would deferentially order again.</li>
    <li> i enjoyed using but they only last one day when the directions say they last 3-5 days i dont think i would purchase again</li>

    <li> I love these tatoos they look just as expected and came at the right day</li>
    <li> Beautiful tattoos, makes me want to be in Hawaii!  Love them!</li>

    <li> I used these as bangles for a wedding, and got more compliments on them.  One of them actually lasted 10 days, through gym and showers! I&#x27;ll be ordering them again for sure : )</li>
    <li> love the new metallic tattoos!</li>
    <li> Very adorable. However the tattoo does leave a normal tattoo residue. Unlike the real flash tattoos, which I think do not leave one</li>
    <li> They came way before expected. I tried them on and I&#x27;ll admit, I need some practice. After I got the hang of it, I realized it looked like tin foil. They lasted for 2 weeks and then disappeared on the start of the third. Just would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Go on very easy... The do however not mKe it through the entire day, they start to fade at night. But still fun!</li>
    <li> They come off quickly but they look awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice they offer varying theme other than just chains. Sent a bunch to friends.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t stay on for more than 30 minutes</li>
    <li> these are fun, we all liked them. They are very easy to apply and they stay on for days !</li>
    <li> The tattoo sheet is partially damaged. When I tried to remove the film half of the tattoos were stuck and could not be used. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the symbols.  Fast delivery.  Only wish they had more options for Hawaiian flowers.</li>
    <li> Purchased the jewelry tattoos for my 9year old granddaughter.  She absolutely loved them!!!  The price was right and she loves them.  Perfect combination.  Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Worked well and they were easy to put on. They looked great, yet they don&#x27;t last that long. They start fading off within a couple of days and are gone within a week.</li>
    <li> Great, esp. for the price.</li>
    <li> They stay even in the hot sweat and sun!!! Still here 3 days later</li>
    <li> Very stylish, latest several days before fading.</li>
    <li> Really pretty! They last about a week which isn&#x27;t bad! The only negatives are that the stuff on the outsides of the tattoos turns brown very quickly and they lose their reflectiveness very quickly. Other than that these are really nice!</li>
