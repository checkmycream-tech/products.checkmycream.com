### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Boots 7 is really great!!!</li>
      <li>This cream is brilliant!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Just love this started using it after seeing it on the morning show with the best results.</li>
      <li>Good for men also.</li>
      <li>Nothing outstanding!</li>
      <li>This is a nice creamy cream</li>
      <li>Used before and liked it and the prize.</li>
      <li>absorbs quickly and easily and leaves no greasy feel but moisturizes beautifully... with no overpowering scent!!</li>
      <li>Love this day cream very light not oily!</li>
      <li>My wife and I have had great success using this cream.  </li>
      <li>I have rosacea on my cheeks and it definitely reduces my redness and sits perfectly under foundation.</li>
      <li>Ok moisturizer.</li>
      <li>LOVE the smell and LOVE the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>Actually, Estee Lauder has the best one.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Just love it.  </li>
      <li>Fine for the price, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
      <li>I have spent INCREDIBLE amounts of money over the years on serums, treatments, creams, balms and any product that promises to make my skin glow.</li>
      <li>This light weight cream works well under make-up and provides the moisture I need.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly over serum and has spf.</li>
      <li>Great for dry winter skin</li>
      <li>At 36 years of age and flaky skin in the South, where I am being hit with hardcore sun, moisture and aircon, I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve never had my skin look better without having a facial first.</li>
      <li>This moisurizer leaves my skin soft, smooth and gives it a lovely glow and those outcomes last all day.</li>
      <li>Really Works!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of creams but really like this one.</li>
      <li>I love this product and wish I could find it in a store other than Target, which always seems to be out of this.  </li>
      <li>do have high expectations of this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and it is my new go-to moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I buy this frequently</li>

    <li> Need the sunscreen in this area.</li>
    <li> I love this product and wish I could find it in a store other than Target, which always seems to be out of this.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> absorbs quickly and easily and leaves no greasy feel but moisturizes beautifully... with no overpowering scent!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice creamy cream and I like it, its a little too pricey.</li>
    <li> my regular go to affordable well working day cream</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell and LOVE the way it makes my skin feel.  Boots 7 is really great!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this day cream any different than all the others on the market.  Actually, Estee Lauder has the best one.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it says it is. I love it I will always continue using it.</li>
    <li> This cream is brilliant! I have dry skin and admit, I am a skincare nut. I have spent INCREDIBLE amounts of money over the years on serums, treatments, creams, balms and any product that promises to make my skin glow. I&#x27;ve found a few that have at least lived up to some of the promises but most leave me poor and disappointed. Then I found this range!! At 36 years of age and flaky skin in the South, where I am being hit with hardcore sun, moisture and aircon, I can honestly say, I&#x27;ve never had my skin look better without having a facial first. This moisurizer leaves my skin soft, smooth and gives it a lovely glow and those outcomes last all day. I have rosacea on my cheeks and it definitely reduces my redness and sits perfectly under foundation. I even moved to a cheaper foundation and it still glides on when I use this as a base. I use this, the cleanser (ladies, don&#x27;t wash your faces with water!!) and the night cream and I can;t recommend it highly enough. The price is an added bonus. I&#x27;ve gone from Chanel to No7 and it lasts just as long!</li>
    <li> I buy this frequently</li>
    <li> Really Works!  My wife and I have had great success using this cream.  Our face feels smoother .  Just love it.  Good for men also.</li>
    <li> Love this day cream very light not oily!</li>
    <li> Just love this started using it after seeing it on the morning show with the best results. Use the day and night time.</li>
    <li> Not like to expensive cream.  Works slowly and not right away.  Gives subtle changes but over time.  Fine for the price, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly over serum and has spf. Great for dry winter skin and it is my new go-to moisturizer.</li>
    <li> At this time of writing, I have only been using the&lt;br /&gt;day cream for a couple of days.It does feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Lets see how it goes after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;I do have high expectations of this product.</li>
    <li> I will be using this creme from now on! It absorbs into your skin instantly and your skin feels like satin! It works great on small lines but the feeling of my skin after using if for just a few days is unbelievable!! I will be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> This light weight cream works well under make-up and provides the moisture I need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of creams but really like this one.</li>
    <li> Used before and liked it and the prize.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lives up to its claim.</li>
    <li> Ok moisturizer. Nothing outstanding!</li>
