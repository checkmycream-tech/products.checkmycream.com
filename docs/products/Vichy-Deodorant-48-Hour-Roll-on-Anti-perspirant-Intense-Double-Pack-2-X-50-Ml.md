      <li>Best deodorant in the world as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best antiperspirant I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This has been the most effective antipersperant I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Discovered it in Italy 11 years ago and love that I can order it from Amazon vendors.  </li>
      <li>So glad I checked Amazon reviews and found the recommendation for Vichy.</li>
      <li>This is my go-to for deodorant, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>Actually, I love Vichy&#x27;s 48 hour antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>This is so effective and the scent is fabulous...</li>
      <li>I did purchase once through Amazon, and it had the same wonderful aroma as the one purchased in Italy.</li>
      <li>Finally available in the U.S. is Vichy deodorant!  </li>
      <li>I used to love this Vichy Deo that I bought all the time when I lived in Sweden.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Well, the two roll-ons lasted over six months and worked better than any product I have used before.  </li>
      <li>The 2 pack I received was fragrance free!</li>
      <li>Excellent price and costumer center.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as the one you can buy overseas.</li>
      <li>I tried Certain Dri and it stung like Ben Gay!!  </li>
      <li>Why won&#x27;t it say if it is fragrance free or not?</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this deodorant during my first visit to Spain.</li>
      <li>even in the most humidity and hot weather.</li>
      <li>Great deodorant, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t itch!  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly, has a neutral light scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>Great light fragrance, stays for whole day, no wet feelings, no itching.</li>
      <li>Or, use your hair dryers cool setting &amp; you&#x27;re golden!</li>
      <li>Great products as expected.</li>
      <li>I apply two &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; &amp; use my hair dryers cool setting to help with the drying.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t wear out quick and it keeps me fresh all day.</li>
      <li>and it gives a full day coverage, even in a hot summer day</li>
      <li>worth the $$$$</li>
      <li>Discovered this while living in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any other!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for deodorant but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
      <li>This is first time I use it, because store brand stuff just not doing anything for me....</li>
      <li>Love the french pharmacies there!!</li>
      <li>I bought this product first in Paris because I forgot to bring my deodorant on vacation.  </li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>Either way, Vichy products are superior and cheaper than the most expensive U.S. products found at NM, Saks, etc.  </li>
      <li>While I haven&#x27;t tried prescription level products, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything else.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Hahaha.</li>
      <li>This is a roll-on which applies much like a lotion so allow for drying time.</li>
      <li>I used to sweat so much all the time.</li>
      <li>No more wetness, even on the hottest, most humid day!</li>
      <li>It smells really good and the fragrance is very delicate.</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry and smelling clean.</li>
      <li>but it is worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>Honestly totally recomendable, I never like it much the roll on but this is a whole new level.</li>
      <li>This is te only deodorant that really works for me!</li>
      <li>Prices vary wildly over the internet.</li>
      <li>I think it works fairly well but expensive for the amount you get.  </li>
      <li>Light and small enough to carry on a plane, very convenient.</li>
      <li>Likely I found this product on Amazon.com, but it only has to be with light green top-cover.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding a deodorant that won&#x27;t make me break out, or that keeps me dry and odor free.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best thing ever!! You will never sweat again.. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years!</li>
    <li> Wish this was sold in the US.  Found it in Switzerland and love it!</li>
    <li> Great products as expected. Good price.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this deodorant!!!  However, it smells completely different when I buy in the U.S.  vs when I purchased in Italy. I am not sure whether Amazon retailers sell product which has been sitting for a while, but there is definitely a difference. The product from Italy is also listed as unscented, but has a very faint, fresh smell. I did purchase once through Amazon, and it had the same wonderful aroma as the one purchased in Italy. The products I have been purchasing through Amazon lately have absolutely no smell, and do not seem to work as well. They almost seem to have a watery consistency to them.  I will try purchasing once more through Amazon, but not this retailer!!!</li>
    <li> Very delicate perfum and it gives a full day coverage, even in a hot summer day</li>
    <li> Love this product. it is the best deodorant / anti antiperspirant I have ever used.  I suggest trying it.Def. worth the $$$$</li>
    <li> No more wetness, even on the hottest, most humid day! And no more worries about stains on my silk blouses!</li>
    <li> Years back, I was visiting friends in Europe, I ran out of my deodorant and bought Vichy Anti-perspirant. This is so effective and the scent is fabulous...however my one complaint is that I ordered it 2 months ago and still haven&#x27;t received it. I&#x27;m wondering if I was scammed or if it is on the way....hoping for the latter! Julie from Georgia</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but really works.  I was looking for a replacement for Bliss Under Army which was discontinued.  So glad I checked Amazon reviews and found the recommendation for Vichy.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best antiperspirant I have ever used.  I have super-sensitive skin and this does not sting at all - even after shaving.  One bottle lasted me a month, but I use it at night and day.  I tried Certain Dri and it stung like Ben Gay!!  I am on my second reorder - it is a must-have for my hygiene routine!</li>
    <li> This is The Best of The Best! I found out about this product from my co-worker and she told me that she is getting that Vichy Deodarant from Islands when she is on vacations. Likely I found this product on Amazon.com, but it only has to be with light green top-cover. Great light fragrance, stays for whole day, no wet feelings, no itching.</li>
    <li> I used to love this Vichy Deo that I bought all the time when I lived in Sweden. It had the nicest scent to it and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;So I figured if I bought the same looking Deo here it would be the same thing, but no. I was so disappointed! The 2 pack I received was fragrance free! It smells like hospital soap! Yuck! I hate it! It&#x27;s expensive to buy and now I feel like throwing it in the garbage. I will not use it. Why won&#x27;t it say if it is fragrance free or not? I would have NEVER bought it if I knew.</li>
    <li> I like this item nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I think it works fairly well but expensive for the amount you get.  It goes on wet and a bit sticky but once it dries it stays on well and I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining.</li>
    <li> This is te only deodorant that really works for me!</li>
    <li> I like Vichy deodorant, is the best control of all for its purpose, I will always suggest this product to others</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Finally available in the U.S. is Vichy deodorant!  The aerosol spray is much better, but I guess our EPA rules are stricter!  Either way, Vichy products are superior and cheaper than the most expensive U.S. products found at NM, Saks, etc.  Trust from a picky, picky, buyer!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this deodorant during my first visit to Spain. Keeps me dry and smelling clean.</li>
    <li> I think the ingredients are different then before. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same or work as well. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Another perfect product from Vichy; true to its claim &#x27;48 hours&#x27; protection.</li>
    <li> My sister bought it for me in Europe and she got me hooked on it. It is the best deodorant i have ever used. I have been using it for about 5 years now and I wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything. It smells really good and the fragrance is very delicate. It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t wear out quick and it keeps me fresh all day. It is pricey to compare to other products like that but it is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Some one told me about it a year ago, I been using it since and I love it, I don&#x27;t have to worry about any bad smell.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to for deodorant, and I love it.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great deodorant, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t itch!  Light and small enough to carry on a plane, very convenient.</li>
    <li> All of a sudden no deodorant was working. Tried this and it held up in the FL heat with no problem. Totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding a deodorant that won&#x27;t make me break out, or that keeps me dry and odor free.  This is it!  It was recommended to me by my sister who suffers from the same allergies.  It is a wonderful fragrance free product, which I&#x27;ll be using for years to come.</li>
    <li> Best hypoallergenic antiperspirant available.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective and keeps its promises.The best anti perspirant I have ever used. It seems expensive but is worth every penny to know you will not sweat and smell bad during your day. It dries quickly, has a neutral light scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> The best! Really works!</li>
    <li> really its the best deodorant!!!</li>
    <li> Have had perspiration/odor problems for years.  Always a challenge to control.  While I haven&#x27;t tried prescription level products, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything else.  This stuff works!  Period!!!!  Absolutely incredible!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent price and costumer center.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in Europe... Can&#x27;t believe I can&#x27;t get this in the states...great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product first in Paris because I forgot to bring my deodorant on vacation.  It was very expensive but I was desperate.  Well, the two roll-ons lasted over six months and worked better than any product I have used before.  Now I will order this from amazon going forward,</li>
    <li> This has been the most effective antipersperant I have ever used.  Discovered it in Italy 11 years ago and love that I can order it from Amazon vendors.  I give it an A+.</li>
    <li> Nice deodorant, nice smell, holds well. This is first time I use it, because store brand stuff just not doing anything for me....</li>
    <li> Honestly totally recomendable, I never like it much the roll on but this is a whole new level. works! even in the most humidity and hot weather.</li>
    <li> I used vichy deodorant since 2006 and I  never like a deodorant as vichy. The deodorant last for long time and there is no kind of irritation and it does not stain clothes.</li>
    <li> I used to sweat so much all the time. Now I don&#x27;t!! And they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
    <li> Actually, I love Vichy&#x27;s 48 hour antiperspirant.  The reason for my rating is because I ordered three bottles of the 48 hour product and instead received 6 bottles of the 24 hour antiperspirant, which doesn&#x27;t work as well.  It&#x27;s not the same in my mind!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the same product I bought in France</li>
    <li> It was good but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as the one you can buy overseas.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product! Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it because it works!</li>
    <li> Best deodorant in the world as far as I&#x27;m concerned. LOVE the faint fragrance. I apply two &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; &amp; use my hair dryers cool setting to help with the drying. This is a roll-on which applies much like a lotion so allow for drying time. Or, use your hair dryers cool setting &amp; you&#x27;re golden! Hahaha. I discovered this product vacationing in St Martin ten years ago. Love the french pharmacies there!! Prices vary wildly over the internet. Be careful and don&#x27;t pay an exorbitant price unnecessarily!</li>
    <li> Discovered this while living in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any other!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for deodorant but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Got my daughter hooked too.</li>
