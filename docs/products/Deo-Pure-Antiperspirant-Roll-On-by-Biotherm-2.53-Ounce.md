    <li> This deodorante has a soft fragance. It is efficient. Normally is hard to me to find a good antiperspirant. I approved !</li>
    <li> I like so much feels very soft on your skin and is light scent not overpowering so it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant in the world !!! will never use nothing else !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I live On this ...... I dont know why they dont sell them all over the USA</li>
    <li> Love the scent, it is clean but subtle. Product drys quickly and has a smooth feeling not sticky like some roll-ons. Niveas calm &amp; care roll-on felt a bit more calming to my skin but this is definitely a close second (plus I vote for this biotherm fragrance over nivea&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> The product did not work well on my delicate skin, I tried it and it still itches after a while.</li>
    <li> I actually like and use this one more than the spray. It&#x27;s fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> it works for me whole day....smell good and I &#x27;m not worry that I will smell in the summer ....best one</li>
    <li> This is a very effective deodorant that works under any stressful conditions.  I&#x27;m so glad I found out about it.  It gently rolls on and needs very little so the price is a non-issue because it will last a long time.  It has a light scent which does not linger on the skin.  It&#x27;s not sticky or messy.  I really like it.  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because I can&#x27;t see &amp;#34;loving&amp;#34; a deodorant!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a couple of weeks..</li>
    <li> Arrived in a complete mess... If I&#x27;m paying $30 for deodorant, I don&#x27;t want 1/3 of it spilled out upon arrival. STILL tried to use it and it left me smelling awful (and as someone who uses all-natural deodorants vs. antiperspirants, this was NOT normal). Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, very soft. It goes on dry and does not show on your clothing. It definitely offers great protection as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Just what I needed! It doesn&#x27;t mask the odors, with perfumes/deodorants  like most on the market.  It is a true ANTIPERSPIRANT!  No more sweaty underarms!</li>
    <li> This is the most effective antiperspirant I&#x27;ve ever tried. And to think I found it in Paris - I had neglected to pack some and found this in a cosmetics store in downtown Paris.</li>
    <li> The deodorant is the best that I have found. I have tried the crystals but this works on sweating and odor.</li>
    <li> Great deo/antiperspirant, fragrance free and good for sensitive skin. It lasts a long time so you get your money&#x27;s worth. Not easy to find in the US so I always get it online.</li>
    <li> Found what I need. While abroad I purchased it because I left mine back in the US. I was paying a high price for it and almost regret but I was highly recommended this product by my friend who always use it. I can see why - it&#x27;s last all day in the hot weather and it smell/stick free so worth every penny spent. Glad I will be able to purchase it back home for the same price.</li>
    <li> My go to since 2009! This antiperspirant is amazing, it smells nice and keeps me confident.</li>
    <li> This smells like bug repellant spray :(</li>
    <li> So far, this is the only antiperspirant that works for me. I don t mind paying the high cost. It really works. I am on my second order.</li>
    <li> Despite this deodorant being expensive, it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do. It leaves white marks on my black shirts that don&#x27;t come off. And after only a couple of hours I start feel (and smell) sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised by all the good reviews, I guess these things are highly individual.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s odorless and long lasting</li>
