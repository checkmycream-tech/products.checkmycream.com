      <li>Oh Proactiv how I love thee!!</li>
      <li>so she loved it.</li>
      <li>This is a good price for the size.  </li>
      <li>Great customer service and shipping, and an awesome price on this particular item.   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to get this product without buying a monthly or bi-monthly supply of a package of products when all you want is the repairing lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not 50% more of either!</li>
      <li>Proactive is a great product, I am happy that I was able to get a 4oz bottle for a really low price.</li>
      <li>The super size is an added bonus!!</li>
      <li>love this product and it&#x27;s nice to have it in a size that doesn&#x27;t run out quickly!</li>
      <li>Once theair is able to escape the lotion will stop oozing.    </li>
      <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I know everyone with skin problems reacts differently to the tons of products on the market, but the Proactiv Repairing Lotion is the best stuff ive found for my skin.</li>
      <li>And when I found a \\&quot;50% more free\\&quot; Repair Lotion,on Amazon, it was like Christmas.   </li>
      <li>I received the product within a couple days and the product still has lots of shelf life - more than promised.</li>
      <li>I use this with Placenta soap only, and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the products you can buy at the drug store and none of them work as well as Proactiv.  </li>
      <li>Buying the bigger bottle was the best...</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>My skin/face has never looked better...</li>
      <li>Which are they claiming this bottle is 50% more than?</li>
      <li>If they&#x27;re talking about the 2oz bottle, this is 100% more.</li>
      <li>If they&#x27;re talking about the 3oz bottle, this is 33% more.</li>
      <li>This is definatley the real deal, and much more cost effective than prices I have seen elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>All I do is wash my face with a hypoallergenic soap (dial fragrance free, or pure&amp;natural), and cover my face in this lotion.</li>
      <li>If you can afford it (because it definitely isn&#x27;t cheap)</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it shipped in perfect time and is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>There are many more natural products available for a much more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Glad to be able to buy it in a larger size.</li>
      <li>With the to removed from the super sized bottle, take the bottle and bang the side up against something.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll find that your lotion starts to ooze out as soon as you remove the top.</li>
      <li>Now, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with charging more money for more product, but I object to claiming \\&quot;50% more free\\&quot; when that&#x27;s not at all true.</li>
      <li>And yes, the bottle contains the authentic stuff from Proactiv and it is fresh and new rather than old.      </li>
      <li>and overall I am pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the entire line, but I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>bought for my teen age daughter, she loves this stuff, better than paying for medications and dr bills to help with acne</li>
      <li>like this bottle size, it&#x27;s huge, but it is kind of hard to squeeze it to get the lotion to come out.</li>
      <li>Get more product for your money and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Well let me just attest that the bottle is big and you get a very good amount of Repairing Lotion that will last much longer than the standard bottles.  </li>
      <li>So, you ran extensive Google searches and found that there is actually a large bottle of Repairing Lotion that is available for sale and at an affordable price.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes without the greasy feeling and leaves your skin pimple free at the same time!!</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
      <li>I only use this lotion during the day and apply it on my clean face then apply makeup.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Secondly, it claims this size increase is free, when it&#x27;s not; the larger bottle costs more than either of the smaller ones.</li>
      <li>&#x3D; main ingredient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, go ahead and squeeze about 1/4 of the super sized bottle into the smaller bottle.      </li>
      <li>Once you&#x27;ve got it out, put any excess lotion from the super size bottle into the standard bottle.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cheaper price</li>
      <li>It was worth the price, though, for the extra ounces.</li>
      <li>I was concerned that maybe this product would be inferior to the one purchased from the main company but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it says \\&quot;50% more\\&quot;, but the only other available sizes of repairing solution are 2oz and 3oz bottles.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve already experienced the disappointment when attempting to purchase replacement bottles from the Proactiv automated kiosks only to find them consistently out of stock.</li>
      <li>the price was very high and they didn&#x27;t even offer a bottle this big.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin clear.</li>
      <li>Works well on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin</li>
      <li>and when the bottle is getting too low, I will be right back here, buying another 4oz bottle!</li>
      <li>And you also have probably already visited the main Proactiv site for a replacement bottle only to find that they don&#x27;t indicate the size of the bottle you&#x27;re buying.  </li>
      <li>I might go back to the small bottles with flip top lids after this one because it&#x27;s kind of annoying having to unscrew and screw the huge lid for this bottle.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;More\\&quot; is true, but it&#x27;s not 50%, and it&#x27;s not free.</li>
      <li>To start off, this was the first time i bought from this company or any other company on amazon.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even thank you enough for ALL the money you have saved me...on a fixed income...by buying the things I need from you.  </li>
      <li>For those of you who have never tried proactive, it works on my near middle age skin and my 13 yr olds skin equally well.</li>
      <li>This can cause you to have to use more lotion than you intended or worse yet, throw away what can&#x27;t be put back in.  </li>
      <li>, does not peel off like a gel might, also it  does not dry up my skin.</li>
      <li>I live in Germany (US military post), so they predicted up to a two month wait on recieving the item.</li>

<li> I have horrible oily skin and my acne is embarrasing</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does nothing &amp; leaves your hand numbed after use; gave it away.</li>
    <li> love this product and it&#x27;s nice to have it in a size that doesn&#x27;t run out quickly!</li>
    <li> The Proactiv Repair Lotion, used with the recommended Proactiv 3 step application; (Deep Cleansing Wash, Revitalizing Toner and Repair Lotion) simply works. And when I found a \\&quot;50% more free\\&quot; Repair Lotion,on Amazon, it was like Christmas.   My wife and I have been using Proactiv for years, and with everyday use, it keeps our skin clear.   A repair lotion with moisturizer and 50+ SPF would be the only way to improve this product. I currently add sun protection to my face following application.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to get this product without buying a monthly or bi-monthly supply of a package of products when all you want is the repairing lotion. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the entire line, but I love this lotion. It moisturizes without the greasy feeling and leaves your skin pimple free at the same time!! The super size is an added bonus!!</li>

My rating reflects my displeasure with such blatantly false advertising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 3-step Proactiv system for over a year now and overall I am pleased with the results.  It takes a couple of months to start working so don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t get immediate results.  It doesn&#x27;t entirely prevent acne either, it just drastically reduces the frequency of getting acne.  I&#x27;ve tried most of the products you can buy at the drug store and none of them work as well as Proactiv.  If you can afford it (because it definitely isn&#x27;t cheap) I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> To start off, this was the first time i bought from this company or any other company on amazon. I live in Germany (US military post), so they predicted up to a two month wait on recieving the item. I got it in 2-3 weeks. They emailed me within a day to verify it was shipped. Great customer service and shipping, and an awesome price on this particular item.   I know everyone with skin problems reacts differently to the tons of products on the market, but the Proactiv Repairing Lotion is the best stuff ive found for my skin. All I do is wash my face with a hypoallergenic soap (dial fragrance free, or pure&amp;natural), and cover my face in this lotion. As long as i do it at least once a day, i rarely get any blemishes. I might get 1 small bump every couple weeks. Without it, my face can break out terrible. Been using this stuff for over a decade now.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that maybe this product would be inferior to the one purchased from the main company but was pleasantly surprised.  This is definatley the real deal, and much more cost effective than prices I have seen elsewhere.  For those of you who have never tried proactive, it works on my near middle age skin and my 13 yr olds skin equally well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! The size is somewhat inconvenient for use (harder to squeeze) but overall a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> I have used Proactive for about 8-10 years now.  Great stuff.  Even after picking at my acne all I got to do is use proactive and the scars/blemishes are minimal.  Great at helping my self-confidence.  One of the best investments of my life.  I went to dermatologists but that was expensive and a waste of time really.  5 STARS ALL THE WAY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed Proactiv repairing lotion before. I think it&#x27;s great. It helps keep my skin clear. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy. 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide &#x3D; main ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this bottle size, it&#x27;s huge, but it is kind of hard to squeeze it to get the lotion to come out. I have to shake it upside down a bit. I might go back to the small bottles with flip top lids after this one because it&#x27;s kind of annoying having to unscrew and screw the huge lid for this bottle. It was worth the price, though, for the extra ounces.</li>
    <li> Ive always been a Proactiv user.  But the only item I religiously use is the repairing lotion.  The wash is to harsh, the toner is too drying.  I have to moisturize a lot then use the repairing lotion. Acne treatment has always been known to be different for every individual, unlike a stomach ache. I have horrible oily skin and my acne is embarrasing but Proactiv works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue to use it. Glad to be able to buy it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for the size.  I used to get it elsewhere (um shopping channel)  but the price is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order it from here.  I only use this lotion during the day and apply it on my clean face then apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, does not peel off like a gel might, also it  does not dry up my skin.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re even considering buying this product then you already know how well the Repairing Lotion works. You&#x27;ve already experienced the disappointment when attempting to purchase replacement bottles from the Proactiv automated kiosks only to find them consistently out of stock. And you also have probably already visited the main Proactiv site for a replacement bottle only to find that they don&#x27;t indicate the size of the bottle you&#x27;re buying.  So, you ran extensive Google searches and found that there is actually a large bottle of Repairing Lotion that is available for sale and at an affordable price. Well let me just attest that the bottle is big and you get a very good amount of Repairing Lotion that will last much longer than the standard bottles.  And yes, the bottle contains the authentic stuff from Proactiv and it is fresh and new rather than old.      But be forewarned:  This bottle acts just like the standard bottles. If you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll find that your lotion starts to ooze out as soon as you remove the top. You don&#x27;t even have to squeeze.  This can cause you to have to use more lotion than you intended or worse yet, throw away what can&#x27;t be put back in.  I have two recommendations:    1) find one of your old and empty standard size bottles and remove plastic squeeze hole thing. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called but it&#x27;s the plastic thing the lotion oozes out of.  You&#x27;ll need to use a nail, tiny screwdriver, or an unbent paperclip, and insert it into the hole and dig out the piece. Once you&#x27;ve got it out, put any excess lotion from the super size bottle into the standard bottle.  As a matter of fact, go ahead and squeeze about 1/4 of the super sized bottle into the smaller bottle.      2) With the to removed from the super sized bottle, take the bottle and bang the side up against something. When I say bang I really mean tap with a little bit of force.  This will cause the lotion to sink to the bottom while allowing the air inside to escape.  Once theair is able to escape the lotion will stop oozing.    All this text I&#x27;ve written just so I can say that my review for this product is 5 stars.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Been using it for 5 years with no problems. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cheaper price</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it shipped in perfect time and is exactly what I expected. I would recommend this product and seller. Might want to mention it comes in 2, 2OZ bottles, and not one big 4oz bottle. Great product, great experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past and when I went directly to ProActive&#x27;s website the price was very high and they didn&#x27;t even offer a bottle this big. My son, husband and I have tried other products that claim to do what this does and they DON&#x27;T work. This product makes blemishes disappear in 2 to 3 days without drying out our skin.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and I wasn&#x27;t finding anything on the market for an a woman in my late 40&#x27;s, at the time I really needed to find something to put on my face.  My sons GF had ordered the Proactiv trial size set and had never used it, so one night we&#x27;re talking and I am telling her about my issue so she hands me the Proactiv and said that I could have it cuz she wasnt planning on using it.  My skin was so dry, yet my pores were always open and I was getting blackhead...at my age!!!  I started using the Repairing Lotion and OMG!!!  My skin was so soft and properly moisturized and my pores closed back up and I was SO happy with the product.  I dont use the other items...in fact, I just gave them to a 24yr old girl I met that was having problem skin due to the stress in her life...and she loves it! She was breaking out with pimples constantly before I gave her the kit.  It immediately started healing her problem skin so she loved it. When I was running low on the Repairing Lotion, I panicked, so I went on Proactiv&#x27;s website and ordered the 1 oz bottle just to hold me over becuz it was $19.99 + S/H. and paying that much for the smallest bottle it came in was CRAZY!  So, I went on my trusty friend website...AMAZON...and there it was $19.98 for the 4 (FOUR) oz. bottle and the S/H was FREE!!!  Now this is THE ONLY place I by my bottles!  Thank you, AGAIN AMAZON...I can&#x27;t even thank you enough for ALL the money you have saved me...on a fixed income...by buying the things I need from you.  But seriously...THIS PRODUCT IS THE BOMB!!!  My skin/face has never looked better...at the age of almost 53! Buying the bigger bottle was the best...it has lasted me over 2yrs...and when the bottle is getting too low, I will be right back here, buying another 4oz bottle!</li>
    <li> Proactive is a great product, I am happy that I was able to get a 4oz bottle for a really low price.</li>
    <li> bought for my teen age daughter, she loves this stuff, better than paying for medications and dr bills to help with acne</li>
    <li> I think the Proactiv Products are overpriced and undersized. There are many more natural products available for a much more reasonable price. Rosehip oil is a great repairing solution for damaged skin.</li>
    <li> Always reliable! The only product that works for me. Great for any age group and any skin type. Try it out.</li>
    <li> Use this daily. Great product. Works well on sensitive skin. Best deal for the best price. Get more product for your money and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works on my face. I use this with Placenta soap only, and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I received the product within a couple days and the product still has lots of shelf life - more than promised. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Oh Proactiv how I love thee!!</li>
