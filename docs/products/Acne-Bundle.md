### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>The best part is getting at this price!  </li>
      <li>Great quality tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>This product is great for flip-flop odor removal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s of great quality</li>
      <li>Great item.</li>
      <li>I use this product EVERY day &amp; it is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good Quality.</li>
      <li>I have fairly oily skin &amp; have a breakout every now &amp; then.</li>
      <li>- it would be nice if they posted the ingredients of these oils</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent at best, to be kind...</li>
      <li>It smells fine, a bit harsh, works fair at best for using in shampoo&lt;br /&gt;for attempted dandruff control but is just not as good as some</li>
      <li>Also I love the versatility of this product as it can be used for many antibacterial needs.</li>
      <li>Satisfied.</li>
      <li>and it has worked its magic by shrinking it as well as bringing it to a head.</li>
      <li>Tea tree oil has so many uses, Swanson Ultra has excellent credentials and i will be ordering from them thru Amazon on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>sooo I will do a updated review after a couple of more uses</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure, have no data, but my opinion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Arrived exactly as stated, early, excellent value for the price.  </li>
      <li>it is so strong, my wife got kicked outta the bedroom.</li>
      <li>This has a strong smell but once you get used to it, you will over look the smell because it works wonders.</li>
      <li>and so far so good, plus</li>
      <li>Smell can be a bit off-putting, but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>Normally Tea Tree oil has a distinct and unwelcome aroma but the benefits are so outstanding you just don&#x27;t care about the odor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This is by far the most effective natural healing remedy I have tried and the low price makes it</li>
      <li>While many of the other listing on Amazon are 10% solutions, this is straightforward.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I had wanted.</li>
      <li>I have also used it on my sandals that get kind of stinky to take away that smell, and on dry spots on my skin and so far has cleaned up.</li>
      <li>batch has a very light odor of tee tree oil but an underlying oil that is unwelcome and unknown, this lead me to believe that the product had been diluted with something else to make it add up to 4 oz.</li>
      <li>Item is as described, it&#x27;s pure tea tree oil at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I recommend using this with a small spray-bottle, as it is very potent.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really hoping it&#x27;s just alcohol</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s this brand that is diluting it so much that you won&#x27;t get the real effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the absolute CURE ALL stuff.</li>
      <li>While the smell is pretty astringent the benefits of this product far out ways the smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please, if you&#x27;re new to tea tree oil try a different brand it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>if you only use a couple of drops I haven&#x27;t really noticed that it is actually helping my itchy scalp</li>
      <li>sure enough there are some areas I can&#x27;t use tee tree oil on and those areas had no problem with this weak version.&lt;br /&gt;The monstrous problem with duping the public with substandard products</li>
      <li>You will likely need to mix it with either water or another oil before applying, but it is very helpful for a variety of dermatological and other uses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it for toenail fungus. It has stopped the growth and the nails are slowly recovering.</li>
    <li> Wowzers!!!!!! What else can be said of this product that those who have purchase it don&#x27;t already know.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had wanted. Good Quality. Would buy again any time, probably soon as I use a lot of this.</li>
    <li> Great quality tea tree oil. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I use this product EVERY day &amp; it is amazing! I have fairly oily skin &amp; have a breakout every now &amp; then. Let me tell you, this stuff stops pimples in their tracks!! Smell can be a bit off-putting, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> works well but not an oil like the aveda brand i had before - has an additional odor behind the tea tree reminiscent of formaldehyde or methanol and I&#x27;m really hoping it&#x27;s just alcohol - it would be nice if they posted the ingredients of these oils</li>
    <li> As a long time supporter of Swanson vitamin site I&#x27;m appalled by this product. It wasn&#x27;t much less than the NOW brand I had been using but the quality is NOT the same. Normally Tea Tree oil has a distinct and unwelcome aroma but the benefits are so outstanding you just don&#x27;t care about the odor.&lt;br /&gt;This batch has a very light odor of tee tree oil but an underlying oil that is unwelcome and unknown, this lead me to believe that the product had been diluted with something else to make it add up to 4 oz. I used it to see and sure enough there are some areas I can&#x27;t use tee tree oil on and those areas had no problem with this weak version.&lt;br /&gt;The monstrous problem with duping the public with substandard products is that people will think tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t work but it&#x27;s this brand that is diluting it so much that you won&#x27;t get the real effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, if you&#x27;re new to tea tree oil try a different brand it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It smells fine, a bit harsh, works fair at best for using in shampoo&lt;br /&gt;for attempted dandruff control but is just not as good as some I&lt;br /&gt;had from another company. It seems like maybe, just maybe, it&#x27;s been cut&lt;br /&gt;with something to stretch it. Can&#x27;t say for sure, have no data, but my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again; no. It&#x27;s decent at best, to be kind...</li>
    <li> Girlfriend hates the smell, but works well for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s of great quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price...would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> This product is great for flip-flop odor removal. I recommend using this with a small spray-bottle, as it is very potent.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for everything.  Disinfecting surfaces (when added in water), gargling as a mouthwash, disinfecting cuts or wounds, rubbing on scalp to prevent dandruff, etc. etc.  Been using this for ages now and always get it from Swanson&#x27;s.  Great item.</li>
    <li> Item is as described, it&#x27;s pure tea tree oil at a reasonable price. While many of the other listing on Amazon are 10% solutions, this is straightforward. You will likely need to mix it with either water or another oil before applying, but it is very helpful for a variety of dermatological and other uses.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute CURE ALL stuff. The best part is getting at this price!  Thank you for the deal!</li>
    <li> it is so strong, my wife got kicked outta the bedroom.</li>
    <li> This has a strong smell but once you get used to it, you will over look the smell because it works wonders. I have made a mixture for athletes feet with it and so far so good, plus my husband&#x27;s feet don&#x27;t smell syrupy when he takes his shoes off. I have also used it on my sandals that get kind of stinky to take away that smell, and on dry spots on my skin and so far has cleaned up.</li>
    <li> the smell is so over powering eve if you only use a couple of drops I haven&#x27;t really noticed that it is actually helping my itchy scalp sooo I will do a updated review after a couple of more uses</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as stated, early, excellent value for the price.  Tea tree oil has so many uses, Swanson Ultra has excellent credentials and i will be ordering from them thru Amazon on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> While the smell is pretty astringent the benefits of this product far out ways the smell. I used the oil as a spot treatment for my cystic acne twice a day and it has worked its magic by shrinking it as well as bringing it to a head. Also I love the versatility of this product as it can be used for many antibacterial needs.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most effective natural healing remedy I have tried and the low price makes it affordable.&lt;br /&gt;We also ordered the Derma E - Tea Tree &amp; E Antiseptic Creme , my husband started using it on his hands and they started healing within days.</li>
