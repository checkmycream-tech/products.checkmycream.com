### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I always had perfect teeth.</li>
      <li>I have always had perfect teeth and cannot afford to go days without brushing-</li>
      <li>Surprise - the timeline of when I noticed the stains matches up perfectly to when I started using Crest Pro-Health rinse.</li>
      <li>My oral health is not the greatest</li>
      <li>I had very good oral paste and used it and it helped.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the staining issue others have experienced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>if I had experienced these issues, and I plan to call them today to complain.  </li>
      <li>There is some numbness of the tongue which takes a bit getting used to, but this product is great.</li>
      <li>This product has greatly reduced gum inflammation.     </li>
      <li>And so i jumped with joy when i saw this product.</li>
      <li>It turns out that many people are having this issue and Crest doesn&#x27;t feel the need to let anyone know that this could happen!!</li>
      <li>I also wanted to choose one that does more then kill germs, and this seemed like the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>I kid you not, I am sitting at my desk at work trying to enjoy this delicious spaghetti my husband made, and it is not happening.</li>
      <li>This mouthwash seems like a good idea by reading the label.  </li>
      <li>It was so good before the mouthwash.     </li>
      <li>The good:    </li>
      <li>I thought everything was good</li>
      <li>I bought this at a drug store 2 days ago because I thought it would be a good way to keep my teeth/gums healthy and have good breath as well.</li>
      <li>However, I do not think I should have to choose between using a mouthwash or being able to taste food!  </li>
      <li>Again, not the most pleasant side effect in the world</li>
      <li>Like others stated, it&#x27;s metallic-y and lingering, and also kind of floral...</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how they saw this as an acceptable product-</li>
      <li>Being highly protective of my uninsured teeth, I tried my best to keep them healthy.</li>
      <li>My teeth are sensitive and my gums are not in the best shape.</li>
      <li>I feel very fortunate</li>
      <li>but you won&#x27;t be able to enjoy life, ha.!</li>
      <li>sent an email to P&amp;G, and they offered to reimburse the price I paid for the rinse, but also advised that it was safe when used as directed.  </li>
      <li>: You won&#x27;t be able to taste all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Over the years I have tried many mouth washes.</li>
      <li>This product makes my teeth feel much better</li>
      <li>The teeth staining caused by this product may be a turn-off for many people.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Crest needs to recall if this many people are having issues.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use it any more</li>
      <li>Great overall product and most of all GOOD for your mouth.</li>
      <li>but I sure hope my tongue and nose start working again.</li>
      <li>I wont be able to call for help.</li>
      <li>I seriously love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I use the mouthwash every morning after I brush and then once more before I go to bed.</li>
      <li>used it for a couple more days because I thought I probably had to just get used to it after not routinely using mouthwash for a while.  </li>
      <li>Crest Pro-Health has a much more undesirable result to your palette.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been something like 26 hours and maybe 30% better, still nauseous, everything still tastes horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was something that I was eating or drinking.</li>
      <li>What triggered me to think it could be the mouthwash was that the tip and underside of my tongue which I had been using the oral paste on got better.</li>
      <li>and i have tried many products.</li>
      <li>Mouthwashes causes oral cancer ...be safe.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, my mouth DOES feel better.</li>
      <li>I thought it was from something else, but I read many reviews and realized it was because of this.</li>
      <li>And i love to eat.</li>
      <li>For me that&#x27;s a problem because I love the taste of salt &amp; put it on almost everything.</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>I received this product for free to review and all thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>Why risk teeth staining just to maintain a healthy mouth?</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s more like 5 benefits in 1.</li>
      <li>Luckily I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown spotting that others note, but that&#x27;s probably because I can&#x27;t stand a full 30 seconds with this stuff in my mouth.</li>
      <li>Whoever said this would be good for dieting was right</li>
      <li>I absoutley love it, it leaves my mouth with a nice clean feeling, my breath is minty and it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
      <li>&quot; You may have nice clean teeth</li>
      <li>This Crest \\&quot;Pro-Health Complete\\&quot; does a great job freshening my breath, but at the expense of being able to taste food normally for hours after using it.</li>
      <li>This mouthwash has some sort of bizarre effect on the tastebuds, and it affects those like me who have been certified as supertasters VERY strongly.  </li>
      <li>This stuff did leave my mouth feeling very clean over time &amp; my teeth did seem whiter after a week of using.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s nice at first, but after a minute or two...eh!</li>
      <li>I actually enjoy the treated of this and that with the alcohol free formula my mouth doesn&#x27;t burn while rinsing!</li>
      <li>I also rinsed my mouth with this mouthwash more often during the day thinking it would help reduce bacteria and heal the lesions more quickly.</li>
      <li>Thank you, CREST for developing and making available a great product, and please continue to keep CREST Pro-Health Complete mouthwash on the market.</li>
      <li>It says non alcholic but its strong in your mouth and burns.</li>
      <li>I have to endure the 30s burning but after that i&#x27;m sure that there would be no painful effects.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any staining, and I can taste fine.</li>
      <li>It tasted fine as I was rinsing with it, but a minute or two afterwards, I had a bitterness coating my tongue</li>
      <li>I swished it around my mouth, surprised by the pleasant minty taste.</li>
      <li>But in reality it means you&#x27;ve made a huge mistake.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Crest products, so I was surprised, but I can&#x27;t finish this bottle.</li>
      <li>I saw this alcohol free mouthwash, with fluoride, and got excited.</li>
      <li>Not even worth one out of 5 stars!</li>
      <li>It pick up stuff I&#x27;ve missed brushing and my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe I&#x27;m taking the time to review mouthwash, but this is a special case.  </li>
      <li>Many of the things others have said about this product are true to a certain extent.</li>
      <li>I was completely unfamiliar with this product before I tried it, and was very pleased with the way it tastes, works, and the fresh after effect feeling in my mouth when I was done.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve ever eaten too much acid (too many oranges or something), it feels like that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t sting because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, but that brings us to...    </li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to taste or eat much of anything I&#x27;ve made for about a week.  </li>
      <li>Flavor was fine, but it made my tongue feel funny after use.</li>
      <li>I quickly spit it out but still couldn&#x27;t breath I was gasping for air.</li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews first!</li>
      <li>I wish I had read the reviews first!</li>
      <li>After using this product sensitivity in my teeth went away, the pain went away and my breath is fresh and my mouth feels cleaner.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as listerine, but it does have a pretty strong tingle.  </li>
      <li>The original brand used to be my favorite, but Crest couldn&#x27;t leave well enough alone.  </li>
      <li>This rinse sounds like such a good idea, and the first time I used it, it cleaned my teeth really well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Looking around here at the other mouthwashes that claim to restore enamel, the only one with more than 10 reviews that received good ratings is [[ASIN:B001H54RAQ ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint , 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]], so that is what I will try next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And those are exactly the people who will probably be most sensitive to the burn.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also DOES produce some kind of strange purple &amp;#34;sludge&amp;#34; when you spit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a no burn mouthwash for adults, because basically every adult mouthwash either has a strong mint flavor (not my preference)or has alcohol.</li>
      <li>Since everything tastes bitter but my appetite remains steady, all I want to eat is what&#x27;s good for my body</li>
      <li>Since the first use I noticed the metallic taste and change in taste buds.</li>
      <li>At least I have some confirmation that others have experienced this.  </li>
      <li>And sure enough, when I looked up reviews for this product, there were hundreds of complaints.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time just under an hour ago.  </li>
      <li>The first was Listerine with hydrogen peroxide (I think they change the formula now).</li>
      <li>I have noticed consistently better breath and a healthier mouth overall.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just bought this last night and have used it twice, it makes your tongue feel numb, it makes everything taste bad, and when I use it, I spit out purple slime. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I hate this mouthwash. I want a healthier mouth but apparently, Crest thinks the only way to deliver that is by destroying your taste buds so everything tastes like iodized metal. This is seriously disgusting. Please don&#x27;t waste your money thinking the nay sayers are liars. We&#x27;re not.</li>
    <li> After 2 days of using this product I have an awful metallic taste in my mouth that won&#x27;t go away. I googled &amp;#34;mouthwash bad taste all day&amp;#34; and got hundreds of results about this particular product. This problem goes back years and has affected thousands of people and they&#x27;re still selling the stuff. They just don&#x27;t care!</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and immediately started experiencing pain and numbness on my tongue. It has severely limited my taste of food and beverages. I was hoping it would go away but it still has not. I don&#x27;t understand how such a product could reach the shelves with such damaging effects. I would recommend Crest recall this product, and I will definitely be submitting a report to the FDA.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is disgusting. I used it before bed and was still unable to taste anything 24 hours later. Even water tastes horrible. I&#x27;ll be contacting Crest for a refund.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t describe how gross this tastes. I think it&#x27;s nice at first, but after a minute or two...eh! I&#x27;ve always loved Crest products, so I was surprised, but I can&#x27;t finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this mouthwash I had hard time breathing. I quickly spit it out but still couldn&#x27;t breath I was gasping for air. Something like this has NEVER happen to me I&#x27;m not allergic to anything but I felt like someone who was allergic to peanut and ate it. I threw it away don&#x27;t want to try it again bkuz since I couldnt breath I wont be able to call for help. I did a little exploring and found a lot of complaint for the Crest Pro Health Products</li>
    <li> I used this along with the blue formula and it has turned my teeth brown. I was not sure what turned them brown so I searched google to find out what could be making my teeth turn brown overnight. I was afraid I had some kind of weird dental/health issue. It turns out that many people are having this issue and Crest doesn&#x27;t feel the need to let anyone know that this could happen!! Do not risk brown teeth. I have no idea what to even do about it now that it is already happened. I have never seen anything like this!!</li>
    <li> Someone in my house bought this a while back; it was the purple variety. It left a terrible bitter aftertaste on my tounge. It tasted fine as I was rinsing with it, but a minute or two afterwards, I had a bitterness coating my tongue and it wouldn&#x27;t go away. I used it before bed, and the bitterness was still there the next day. It hung on all day, giving all the food and drinks I had a bitter quality. Plus, when I was rinsing with it, it burned my mouth. I don&#x27;t know what did this, since it has no alcohol, but it still burned. I tried it again recently, because someone in my house bought another color. I thought maybe it was just the purple one that was the problem, but it was the same. The person that bought it and one other person in my house don&#x27;t seem to have this problem, though. Maybe I have a strong sense of taste or something, but it was awful for me. I am not going to use it again, so I don&#x27;t know if it would stain my teeth like some people are saying here. I&#x27;m just sticking to Act brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Used it to help with gingivitis and it causes your gums to peel / shed and it ruined my holidays as i couldnt eat much. It says non alcholic but its strong in your mouth and burns. Mouthwashes causes oral cancer ...be safe.</li>
    <li> I hate this product so much. I bought it at my local Duane Reade store for 6 bucks. I used it that night after i brushed my teeth. I thought everything was good and then i tasted metal in my mouth. It was horrible. I tried rinsing my mouth with some water hoping that would do the trick. When i got up in the morning I couldn&#x27;t taste anything, my tuna sandwich was paper. My hot chocolate burned my tongue. I pored my bottle down the drain. It may say it doesn&#x27;t have the burn of alcohol but it burns the taste buds out of your mouth anyway.</li>
    <li> I have been using this exact mouthwash for about 5-6 months now. My dentist noticed that my gums (close to my teeth) were starting to turn brown but he said that it was strange because my gums and teeth are healthy, just discolored. Now, about a month ago, I started to notice brown staining on my teeth as well. The staining is behind my 4 front teeth and a few of my lower teeth close to my gums. I have stopped using the mouthwash, and have tried whitening products and they won&#x27;t remove the stains. IF YOU DON&#x27;T WANT BROWN TEETH, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and am quite pleased with the performance.   I have not had any issues with brown spots on my teeth, as some have written about.  One should be advised to brush and floss thoroughly, as the discoloration is a result of the mouthwash interacting with debris remaining on the tooth.    I have noticed consistently better breath and a healthier mouth overall.  This product has greatly reduced gum inflammation.     Overall, I would recommend the product with the caveat that brushing and flossing always be performed thoroughly before rinsing.</li>
    <li> After using this mouthwash the first time, I had a strong bitter taste in my mouth ALL day and everything tasted bitter.  This mouthwash has some sort of bizarre effect on the tastebuds, and it affects those like me who have been certified as supertasters VERY strongly.  If you don&#x27;t want everything you eat to taste incredibly bitter all day, AVOID this.</li>
    <li> All the other reviews were right, that terribad aftertaste also leaves your buds senseless. Don&#x27;t use this in the morning unless you don&#x27;t plan on tasting your lunch.</li>
    <li> This product has caused me emotional and physical stress. I am never again using any crest products. Your pro  mouthwash has caused my jaw to become severely swollen and my tongue to develop blisters and excruciating pain.</li>
    <li> After using this product my tongue would feel like it had been burned- dead taste buds and weird metallic taste to anything I was eating. I made the connection after my sister stayed with me and tried it, experiencing the same thing. It lasts at least 12 hours after the rinse, even if I do not eat anything for hours afterward as the label suggests. I would not recommend this- my sister uses a regular alcohol kind and it burns initially but no 12 hour loss of taste!</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is awful! I used it, went to the grocery store, came home to make lunch, and then couldnt taste ANY of the food  bought! I thought \\&quot;wow, this salsa is terrible.\\&quot;...and then tasted the new lemonade \\&quot;this lemonade is awfully watery...\\&quot; and then I knew something was wrong when I took a bite of my sandwich and didnt taste ANYTHING i had put in it. I figured it must have been my new mouthwash! TERRIBLE!!!  I hope this goes away! It happened yesterday and I still can&#x27;t really taste very much. Not even worth one out of 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I would give 0 star on this product. I have used this product for the last 3 days, and I lost my taste buds yesterday. I thought it was from something else, but I read many reviews and realized it was because of this. I now cannot distinguish between salt and sugar. Cheese tastes like a rubber band. It really ruined my taste buds and my appetite because everything tastes like nothing.  When I spit it, it has some purple slimy things, which are gross. Some users reported that their teeth got stained brown after using this product, but for me, it is just losing the taste buds. Both are horrifying! I am in a little depression right now to think how long this dysgeusia will last. How long did it take you to get back the sense of taste?</li>
    <li> I initially bought this mouthwash because of the promising label. Buyer beware!  After using this mouthwash 1 time, I could not taste anything I ate!  Whenever I ate or drank something hot or salty I had a horrible burning sensation on my tastebuds- and this lasted over 24 hours!  I can&#x27;t believe it advertises \\&quot;no burning sensation\\&quot; when actually the burning sensation after use is 10x worse than those containing alcohol!  I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this mouthwash and just yesterday I noticed that something was staining my teeth brown. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was something that I was eating or drinking. So I started going back and trying to think of everything that I had been eating and drinking in the past couple of weeks. Nothing was out of the ordinary. Then I realized that the only thing different going in my mouth had been my mouthwash. And sure enough, when I looked up reviews for this product, there were hundreds of complaints. I found a number to call to make a complaint on another customer&#x27;s review. The phone number is 1-800-285-9139. I urge anyone who has had this same issue (or the loss of taste issue) to call them. You actually get to talk to a person. I spoke with someone who is supposedly mailing me a refund check. He told me that this is an issue which only affects a small number of people, which I know to be not true. He assured me that the stains will come out. I really hope they do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ACT for several years and thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a try.  Boy, do I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews on this page first.  I used it this morning and I&#x27;ve had a bitter taste in my mouth all day.  Worse, anything I eat or drink has that same bitter taste.  My tongue feels like it&#x27;s been burned, like cheese burn from a really hot pizza.    Avoid this stuff.  It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many mouth washes. This is the second worst one I have used. The first was Listerine with hydrogen peroxide (I think they change the formula now). Any way this stuff is terrible, it made my mouth feel nasty for hours, I mean like I couldn&#x27;t taste anything for at least 3 hours after using it. Normally 30 min after brushing I am back to normal and this stuff ruined half my morning. I used it for a week before switching to a different wash. On the plus side there is no burn when you use it...you just don&#x27;t feel anything after you finish cleaning your teeth. I also can&#x27;t say that it did much in terms of helping my oral health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Listerine&#x27;s version of this (fluoride, complete care, etc.) for years without any problem. Found this stuff on sale last week and gave it a shot, but am really regretting it. As others have noted, it absolutely ruins your tastebuds/tongue. If you&#x27;ve ever eaten too much acid (too many oranges or something), it feels like that. I tried to eat a fruit salad over the weekend, and could only handle a few bites because my tongue felt like it was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ll never buy this again, and don&#x27;t recommend that you do.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I&#x27;m taking the time to review mouthwash, but this is a special case.  I might end up saving some taste buds here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Crest Pro-health Clean Mint Rinse is just about the worst tasting stuff I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  The original brand used to be my favorite, but Crest couldn&#x27;t leave well enough alone.  I have no idea what they were thinking.  Did no one test this toxic concoction before it hit the shelves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky that my teeth didn&#x27;t stain.  Still, I can add another voice to the chorus decrying the bitter taste of this stuff.  It&#x27;s inexplicably horrible.  And it lingers for hours.  No one is exaggerating on this page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff should be recalled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I&#x27;m writing specifically about the purple variety.  I&#x27;m not sure if the others are any better, but I&#x27;m not willing to find out.  Back to Listerine for me.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Bought this stuff and after a few minutes I started to get the most horrible, awful taste in my mouth.  This lasted for several hours.  I&#x27;ve also tried the blue stuff (also Crest Pro Health) and it was just as bad.  Seriously though, it produced an aftertaste that resembled hairspray.  It really is that bad...no kidding.  There&#x27;s a number on the back of the bottle with instructions to get your money back if you send in the UPC and receipt.  I highly suggest you do this (like I did) so Crest will get the message and take this awful product off the market!!  Seriously, Crest...did you people actually TEST this stuff on humans before you released it for sale to the general public???</li>
    <li> The good:    This stuff did leave my mouth feeling very clean over time &amp; my teeth did seem whiter after a week of using. It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t sting because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, but that brings us to...    The bad:    Whatever substitute they use for alcohol has some negative effects. The first time I used it my mouth was completely numb for at least an hour. After using it a few times that was isolated to just my tongue, but it was still really uncomfortable. Also, it left me almost unable to taste salt. For me that&#x27;s a problem because I love the taste of salt &amp; put it on almost everything. But also we all know the effects of eating too much salt (high blood pressure, etc.) so that wasn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m too keen on giving up. I&#x27;ve used other mouthwashes that work just as well without damaging my taste buds.</li>
    <li> Stains the hell out of your teeth.</li>
    <li> i have been using Listerine for a long time and the only problem i have with it is the burning feeling i have to endure while rinsing. And so i jumped with joy when i saw this product. However the result was terrible. As advertise, there was no burning sensation while rising. But couple hours after using it, my taste bud got swollen, my tongue felt like a very bad burn on hot coffee, my salivary gland was swollen as well. By the end of the day, i noticed sore spots on the gum of my lower teeth. This product left a terrible feeling in my mouth that last for several days even though i stopped using it after the first day. It&#x27;s so horrible that it&#x27;s painful to talk&lt;br /&gt;Now i go back to Listerine. I have to endure the 30s burning but after that i&#x27;m sure that there would be no painful effects. I have used Crest toothpaste for a very long time as well and nothing like this ever happen</li>
    <li> This Crest \\&quot;Pro-Health Complete\\&quot; does a great job freshening my breath, but at the expense of being able to taste food normally for hours after using it. There are a lot of other reviewers with the same experience, so it seems to effect a lot of people the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have already stopped using this and will not go back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> Whoa... I finally found a mouthwash I liked that checked off all the boxes AND seems to have helped both my gum-receding problem AND my eroding-enamel problem... and come here and am a bit shocked by the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps because I only use it at night and not in the morning, I do NOT notice any lasting lingering aftertaste. I also use the Fresh Mint (blue) flavor, not the purple.</li>
    <li> I saw this alcohol free mouthwash, with fluoride, and got excited. I purchased it and put it to use. I swished it around my mouth, surprised by the pleasant minty taste. After it was spit out, I was left with a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. An hour later, the flavor worsened and my throat was sore. I craved the chocolate chip cookies that I had baked earlier in the day. I took a bite and the flavor was pure bitterness. I noticed how in the reviews people say they lost flavor. Well, I am jealous because everything I eat with this mouthwash, hours later, tastes like butt. The back of the label warns of discoloration of your teeth and gums. This mouthwash will be going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go into detail because other reviewers have posted the same things here before:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It doesn&#x27;t taste like mint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You won&#x27;t be able to taste all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the cons far outweigh the pros.</li>
    <li> This actually eats your taste buds how i know is because 2 weeks ago i was on antibiotics and had thrush on my tongue wake up and its gone last night i used for the first time and i didnt really know the effects it had cuz i ate before i brushed my teeth i woke up and there was something off with my tastebuds then i brushed my teeth and did my mouth wash i know after you use mouth wash food taste off for maybe a hour but not 24 hours now my whole mouth is aching and to hear that it stains teeth iM gladly throwing this away or a refund this is horrible couldnt even taste the food i was cooking i hate it i hate it</li>
    <li> This is an awful product!!! After using it I can no longer taste salt, my coffee tastes like nothing, and my tap water tastes slimy and thick. I don&#x27;t know how this can be approved by the FDA, it has destroyed my sense of taste!!!!</li>
    <li> This rinse sounds like such a good idea, and the first time I used it, it cleaned my teeth really well.  However, after a couple days of use, following the directions exactly, I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t taste anything and the tip of my tongue was red and irritated, as if it had been burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a couple more days because I thought I probably had to just get used to it after not routinely using mouthwash for a while.  It only became worse, I still couldn&#x27;t taste anything, my gums began to ache, and my tongue became so painful that I couldn&#x27;t talk or eat without sharp pain on the tip of my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it, but now, a few days later, I&#x27;m still having sharp pain on the tip of my tongue.  I took a closer look and realized that not only were my tastebuds horribly irritated, but the tip of my tongue split down the middle.  I have a high pain tolerance, but this is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent an email to P&amp;G, and they offered to reimburse the price I paid for the rinse, but also advised that it was safe when used as directed.  Oh please.  As if I somehow got \\&quot;rinse 2 tablespoons for one minute twice a day\\&quot; wrong??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds almost unreasonable for an oral rinse to affect me this much, but it&#x27;s so frustrating and painful.  I cook a lot and I haven&#x27;t been able to taste or eat much of anything I&#x27;ve made for about a week.  I hope P&amp;G reformulates soon!!</li>
    <li> After a day or two of using this mouthwash, I started to have painful bumps and lesions on the tip and underside of my tongue. My tongue also felt rough and split. I had very good oral paste and used it and it helped. I also rinsed my mouth with this mouthwash more often during the day thinking it would help reduce bacteria and heal the lesions more quickly. The exact opposite occurred! The lesions spread to all over the inside of my mouth. What triggered me to think it could be the mouthwash was that the tip and underside of my tongue which I had been using the oral paste on got better. I then searched the web about this mouthwash and a bunch of complaints came up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label only warns about tooth staining but not about lesions and bumps. This is really not acceptable as someone might not realize and continue to use this mouthwash thinking they have infection or something.</li>
    <li> I saw this on the shelf in the bathroom, my wife had purchased it but nobody was using it.  The dentist told me I should be using a fluoride rinse so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I start developing this strange metallic taste in my mouth that won&#x27;t go away, and can&#x27;t figure out what it is.  My sense of smell has changed, too.  My coffee especially has started smelling bad to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I had a cold coming on or something.  I continued using it without putting two and two together, and it was just today that the metallic taste in my mouth really started driving me nuts that I made the association with using this stuff and did a little Google searching and the first hit was the reviews here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, I haven&#x27;t used it in 48 hours (I was using it before bed and forgot to use it last night, so Tuesday evening was my last &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34;) and the taste in my mouth is actually getting worse.  I won&#x27;t use it any more but I sure hope my tongue and nose start working again.</li>
    <li> I normally use a competing mouthwash which has alcohol in it, so bought this on a whim thinking I would try something new.  It leaves you with a horrible aftertaste that persists for hours.  I thought maybe there was something wrong with it or with me, after seeing these other reviews I can see it is just a bad product. I&#x27;ll be throwing the bottle out after just one use.  Thanks but no thanks.</li>
    <li> Just like a lot of other people, I lost the ability to taste anything for at LEAST 12 hours after using. Its terrible!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this mindlessly on my routine of restocking on hygiene products. After I ran out of my other mouthwash I popped this baby open on a day where my mouth felt particularly dirty. I brushed my teeth twice and then used this twice for like 30 seconds each. It BURNED. I thought it was due to my initial thought that my mouth was dirty. The rest of the day my tongue felt worse and worse and worse till I was whimpering at how burned my tongue was and how swollen it was getting. I couldn&#x27;t taste anything and everything was painful to eat. The next day, moderate pain, more swollen, tongue is shaping to my teeth now and everything is metallic tasting. Today, 3rd day. Everything is still absolutely terrible tasting and I havent used the mouthwash SINCE  3 days ago. I&#x27;m so hungry and upset and it took hours and hours of research to discover that it was in fact this mouthwash that has ruined my mouth. I still dont know when my taste will fully return. :[ This product should be taken off shelves. If suing them were an option I would. I&#x27;m so upset and frustrated.</li>
    <li> I guess other people must have different experiences using this mouthwash, but I myself have had a quite pleasant one. I use this mouth wash every day morning and night, I have already gone through 4 bottles of this stuff. I absoutley love it, it leaves my mouth with a nice clean feeling, my breath is minty and it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it staining my teet, they are actually whiter now and my teeth were yellow before I started using it. DEFINIETLY reccomend this product. Please keep on market!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I always had perfect teeth. Then I used this for 6 months. All I can say is that all the negative reviews are right and on top of all that it does the exact opposite of what it says it is meant for on the bottle. I called them about it. They said they were reporting it. This stuff should be recalled. Whatever that new ingredient is: \\&quot;cetylpyridinium chloride\\&quot; You would be well advised to look for it in everything and avoid it at all costs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining to my teeth, the weird taste is a HUGE problem. My entire mouth feels like I&#x27;ve been sucking on nails and the taste will not go away. The taste is very metallic and it&#x27;s disgusting. I ate a meal after brushing my teeth to try and get rid of the taste, and it came back once I was finished. My tongue has a tingling sensation and I used the mouthwash over an hour ago. I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is but I don&#x27;t feel safe using this mouthwash anymore, especially after reading some of these reviews. Did they not test this stuff?!? I&#x27;m calling them for a refund!</li>
    <li> How is this product still being sold?! I wish I had read the reviews first! I used it for the first time today, tasted awful, I got over it, but tried eating a couple hours later and everything tastes AWFUL! Everything tastes bitter and salty things taste sweet. Dumping this down the sink.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually burned the tip of my tongue while i was swishing it around in my mouth. I waited 30 minutes (actually an hour) to eat just like the label says. i could not taste my food. I couldn&#x27;t taste anything. The thing that freaked me out was the fact that it took forever for my taste to come back. I mean i literally had to wait a whole day to taste anything.     I figured this happened because I hadn&#x27;t used mouthwash in a long time, so i decided to wait a week and try it again. I kid you not, I am sitting at my desk at work trying to enjoy this delicious spaghetti my husband made, and it is not happening. It was so good before the mouthwash.     The worst part about it is that it catches you off guard. You really don&#x27;t expect your food to taste that bad, or not taste anything at all. I feel like my tongue is damaged.     I think i will go back to buying the off brand mouthwash. At least I could taste my food. And i love to eat.</li>
    <li> Please stop selling this product! As the other reviewers said, it affects your taste buds and leaves you with a numbness and metallic taste in your mouth. I can barely taste the food I eat and coffee (a must for me in the mornings)tastes disgusting since I started using this rinse. DO NOT BUY! And please recall/discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash leaves a very long lingering taste in my mouth pretty much the entire day that makes all food taste bad. Like the food tastes like its turning. It&#x27;s terrible. And the first few times I used it, my tongue was really irritated and I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was, then realized that this was the only change I had made. I usually use ACT restoring mouthwash and bought this because it said it rebuilds enamel, but I will pay the extra dollar or whatever to get the better quality ACT or Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mouth wash ever! After using it my tongue has been numb and my tastebuds seems fried! I cannot taste anything. It hurts to use regular tooth paste. I don&#x27;t understand how this product is still on the shelf! I should have read the reviews first!</li>
    <li> OK. Many of the things others have said about this product are true to a certain extent. It DOES burn so the advertising on the label that claims there is &amp;#34;no burn of alcohol&amp;#34; is misleading. It might not be alcohol that&#x27;s causing the burn but it still burns so what&#x27;s the point? People buying this expecting a gentle rinse that doesn&#x27;t burn will be in for a shock. And those are exactly the people who will probably be most sensitive to the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Crest should remove the &amp;#34;no burn&amp;#34; claim from the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That said, I can live with the burn since it seems to help me. My teeth are sensitive and my gums are not in the best shape. This product makes my teeth feel much better and my mouth has not been as sore as it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product does leave a strange aftertaste that does linger for a while. It eventually goes away. I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;destroys your taste buds&amp;#34; or anything quite so drastic. It does make your food taste a little strange for a while.  Again, not the most pleasant side effect in the world but I can live with it because I need an oral product that has fluoride  and seems to have an antiseptic effect. This one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also DOES produce some kind of strange purple &amp;#34;sludge&amp;#34; when you spit. I have no idea what that is but we&#x27;ll just call it another side effect I can live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At the end of the day, my mouth DOES feel better. My oral health is not the greatest and I need this. I&#x27;ll keep using it if my experience doesn&#x27;t get any worse than it has been over the last week or so since I bought it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this, my tongue has felt burned, and everything tastes bitter.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash seems like a good idea by reading the label.  \\&quot;Rebuilds enamel, helps prevent cavities, cleans teeth &amp; gums, kills bad breath germs, freshens breath and no burn of alcohol\\&quot;    If you are like me and like to taste food, however, I would not recommend using this mouthwash. The formula seems to numb or burn your taste buds, with a semi-permanent chemically-mint flavor. This cannot be removed or reduced in any apparent way. Yes it doesn&#x27;t burn like alcohol, but that would&#x27;ve gone away in a minute or so. Crest Pro-Health has a much more undesirable result to your palette.    After using only a small amount of this mouthwash, I cannot fully taste anything I eat for nearly 24 hours. Drinking soda, coffee, hot soup, salty crackers, etc... does not lessen the negative effects of the mouthwash.    Whoever said this would be good for dieting was right - It will totally ruin food for you as long as you are using this mouthwash.    I poured mine down the drain. It&#x27;s not worth saving $3 to use this product instead of buying another mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Crest pro health complete mouthwash claims to be \\&quot;6 benefits in 1\\&quot;. Well, one of those \\&quot;benefits\\&quot; is the no burn of alcohol. This isn&#x27;t really a benefit, because it isn&#x27;t something adding to your dental care. So it&#x27;s more like 5 benefits in 1. It also stains your teeth. Why risk teeth staining just to maintain a healthy mouth? Listerine Total Care is very similar, and it atleast has 6 benefits in 1, and won&#x27;t stain teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a no burn mouthwash for adults, because basically every adult mouthwash either has a strong mint flavor (not my preference)or has alcohol. I also wanted to choose one that does more then kill germs, and this seemed like the perfect solution. Clean mint isn&#x27;t overpowering as far as mint flavors go, but IT STILL BURNS! What is the point of putting \\&quot;no alcohol\\&quot; on the bottle? That only implies one thing, that it won&#x27;t burn. This does, in fact, burn. Luckily I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown spotting that others note, but that&#x27;s probably because I can&#x27;t stand a full 30 seconds with this stuff in my mouth. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have a sensitive mouth or teeth either. If you&#x27;re like me and seek a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t burn, just pass up the entire Crest Pro Health line. I guess it&#x27;s back to ACT kids bubble gum flavor!</li>
    <li> I used this mouth rinse for the first time two days ago.  Despite the &amp;#34;no alcohol&amp;#34; labeling which implied no burning, I immediately noticed a few spots in my cheeks and gums that burned while I was rinsing.  The worst issue, though, was that for the rest of the day I had an awful taste in my mouth, and I was unable to taste anything that I ate or drank.  I used it again the next morning, thinking it must be a fluke.  Again, I could not taste anything all day long.  I have not used the rinse since yesterday morning, and I still have a slight taste in my mouth and still some loss of taste when eating or drinking.  I contacted the company through their website and received a response quickly, but it only contained the copied and pasted answers from their FAQs, which I had already read.  They did give me a number to call (1-866-695-1856) if I had experienced these issues, and I plan to call them today to complain.  I will also be getting my $5 back, per the refund statement on the bottle.  There is a warning on the bottle about the staining issue, which I have not had. However, there is NO warning on the label about the effects on the tongue and taste.  Shame on Crest for continuing to sell a product with such awful side effects!  Their website does say that the effects will go away once you stop using the product.  However, I do not think I should have to choose between using a mouthwash or being able to taste food!  They need to rethink the &amp;#34;6 health benefits&amp;#34; and add &amp;#34;appetite suppression&amp;#34; as a benefit. It could be the next big weight loss product . . .</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time just under an hour ago.  At first there was a weird tingly feeling that hurt, which was odd but I thought it was just the mint flavoring.  Then I got large bumps in my mouth all of the sudden that hurt really bad and my entire mouth is getting really sore.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  Saw several reviews of similar reactions, beware!!!</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s right about the bitter aftertaste.  I just couldn&#x27;t figure it out, and after several weeks of use, I was searching for answers.  What was wrong with my taste buds?  At least I have some confirmation that others have experienced this.  I have to go back to ACT.  No doubt about it.  Maybe they should market ProHealth as a weight loss product.  Since everything tastes bitter but my appetite remains steady, all I want to eat is what&#x27;s good for my body and I don&#x27;t want to overeat since there&#x27;s no pleasure in the taste.</li>
    <li> This whitening product stained my teeth brown. Flavor was fine, but it made my tongue feel funny after use. My teeth started to look brown after a few uses, so I figured I should brush and use the mouthwash more, since something was clearly wrong. Of course, it made the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw out the whole bottle, and I recommend you do the same. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> After using, I had a horrible taste in my mouth, kind of metallic (if you&#x27;ve ever licked a battery, sort of like that). At first, I thought it was like the aftertaste of toothpaste that makes orange juice taste bad, except I could taste it without eating/drinking anything. You can ignore the taste of toothpaste after you brush your teeth; this I could not (which is why I googled &amp;#34;crest pro health bad aftertaste&amp;#34; and found these reviews). I took a shower soon after using, and I could &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; the bitterness of my face wash and my body wash even though I didn&#x27;t get any in my mouth. That has never happened before. When we smell something, we naturally taste a bit of it, but it&#x27;s usually negligible. This product magnified that and made me nauseous. I tried drinking water and the taste won&#x27;t go away. Also, my tongue stings slightly, and when I looked in the mirror, my taste buds are like red dots, where my tongue was a healthy pale pink before using. Oh, and it burns, so false advertisement on the packaging. I should have never thought to be adventurous and veer from my usual Listerine Zero. This is being poured down the drain as I wouldn&#x27;t even give it away to someone.</li>
    <li> A lot of people are complaining of the flavor and taste, especially with eating food or drinking.  I have no problems with it affecting the taste of my food or my taste buds.  The back of the label says to wait 30-minutes before eating or drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use this twice a day in the morning and evening.  For me, it does leave a a brownish stain between my teeth and my brushing and flossing does not remove the stains.  I believe the stain is caused by the chemical that coats your teeth to protect from cavities.  The label clearly mentions that this is normal and that it is *not* a permanent stain.  It comes off if you stop using the product or go to get your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  For me, the brown staining is unrecognizable unless you are really up close looking at my teeth.  The teeth staining caused by this product may be a turn-off for many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have no complaints about this product.  I do intend to try other products for the sake of exploration after I am done with my bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my grocery was out of Act Total Care (recommended by my dentist- I rate it a 5+). By the end of the bottle my teeth were stained. I got them cleaned today and the hygienist thought that it was due to my mouthwash choice. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the same issues as other reviews with staining of my teeth, but that lingering aftertaste is just a bit much to deal with. I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first, I thought maybe I was just starting to drink two quickly after the recommended 30 minuets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aftertaste really clashes with certain foods and lasts at least a good 8 hours after rinsing. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So weird people are having such bad problems with this mouthwash. I seriously love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as listerine, but it does have a pretty strong tingle.  I haven&#x27;t had any staining, and I can taste fine. I do usually just have a cup of coffee after rinsing in the morning. I wait maybe 2 hours before eating and have never noticed anything tasting off. Maybe the others are eating too soon? It does say wait 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is great. It pick up stuff I&#x27;ve missed brushing and my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean without it. I &amp;#60;3 it!</li>
    <li> Avoid this at all costs.  I only used it a few times and am still experiencing a lack of taste any time I try to eat.  I can&#x27;t believe that Crest continues to sell this.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to warn others NOT to try this product!  I bought this at a drug store 2 days ago because I thought it would be a good way to keep my teeth/gums healthy and have good breath as well. The Crest rinse sounded so good--no burning alcohol, and many other \\&quot;positive\\&quot; things about it...Was I wrong!!! Right away I noticed my mouth tasting strange and I couldn&#x27;t really taste well.  I thought maybe I had burned my tongue and thus impaired my tastebuds and even mentioned it to my husband.  The next day it continued.  He too, had the same issue with lack of taste. We then figured it HAD to be the Crest mouthwash.  So I looked up reviews of it and saw complaint after complaint about the same thing!! I still have lack of taste and a hard to explain \\&quot;numb/tingly\\&quot; type sensation on my tongue.  Thankfully no brown spots like others reported since we only used it 3 or 4 times.. Really can&#x27;t believe they would sell such a product.. don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I was absolutely shocked when I did a Google search to see what could cause the sudden brown staining on my front teeth. Surprise - the timeline of when I noticed the stains matches up perfectly to when I started using Crest Pro-Health rinse. I seriously hope that I can get these stains out with a whitening pen. I contacted Crest with a nasty complaint, so I am hoping that, as others have said, they will pay for my teeth cleaning if it&#x27;s necessary. So disappointed; who would ever think you need to check the reviews for a mouthwash before buying it?!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how they saw this as an acceptable product- I thought something was wrong with me the first few days I was was using the product.  Took approximately 48 hours of non-use for sense of taste to return.  How did this make it past the testing phase?</li>
    <li> I am angry but also as happy as a camper right now as I write this review.  I have been using this product off and on for about 6 months or so.  Only recently I have noticed that it looks like I have tooth decay between my top teeth and along the bottoms/side of my bottom teeth.  I don&#x27;t have any pain, so I did some google searches and figured out that there is nothing wrong with my teeth!  I found a picture online of someone&#x27;s teeth that look identical to mine, and low and behold--it was due to Crest Pro-Health rinse!  Wooohooo.  I swear I thought all of my teeth were decaying, but I figured that couldn&#x27;t be the case since 1.) I have no pain/sensitivity to hot or cold food, and 2.) I have never had a cavity before.  So although I am extremely angry that this crappy product caused cosmetic ugly stains to my teeth, I am so excited after reading all of the Amazon reviews that these stains are not cavities and can be removed by a deep cleaning from my dentist.  I was so afraid to go to the dentist because of these dark marks in between my teeth.  I figured he would tell me I needed crowns on all of my teeth.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars I would. Being highly protective of my uninsured teeth, I tried my best to keep them healthy. So imagine my surprise when, despite flossing and brushing and mouthwashing like only a dentist would I saw my teeth turning brown... My FRONT TEETH! Whaaaaaat!? I asked. Now normally I used ACT to rebuild enamel but the store near me was out so I bought a bottle of this demon juice. I regret this immensely. I thought maybe the burning tongue and dying tastebuds meant it was working. But in reality it means you&#x27;ve made a huge mistake. Do not use. Do not buy. Awful, awful product.</li>
    <li> I would give this no stars if I could. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth all day after I use it. Even if I use it before bed, the entire next day I can&#x27;t taste any food. I just taste bitter awfulness. The only thing that cuts through the bitter is citrus, which is probably negating the enamel building benefits of this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;This is awful, a mouthwash shouldn&#x27;t interfere with tastebuds, and healthy teeth is not a great trade off for having to force myself to eat food I can&#x27;t taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the negative reviews, I guess I am lucky to have not experienced any of the bad side effects of this mouthwash. I started using this when I had an awful toothache and could not get to a dentist right away. After a few days, my tooth started feeling better. I have not had any stains, in fact my teeth look whiter. I use the mouthwash every morning after I brush and then once more before I go to bed. I did notice when I first began using it that I would spit out a bunch of purple slime, but as time went on there wasn&#x27;t any. I am almost out of my first bottle and will definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to review and all thoughts and opinions are my own. I actually enjoy the treated of this and that with the alcohol free formula my mouth doesn&#x27;t burn while rinsing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all been said here already: this product makes your tongue feel burned, causes a terrible taste in your mouth that lasts all day and results in lost ability to taste food. TERRIBLE product!</li>
    <li> My teeth are horribly stained after the use of this product. I look like a smoker. My teeth are brown and look like they are rotting. I am appalled that this product is on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know for a fact that this product caused the change in my teeth. I brush and floss daily and have never had any cavities. I have never had oversensitive gums go to the dentist about twice a year. My checkup this year was LAST MONTH and they were cleaned. I have never had any problems with my teeth. I have always had perfect teeth and cannot afford to go days without brushing- I&#x27;m uninsured!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference in my diet or lifestyle has been introducing this mouthwash into my daily dental care routine. The first time I used it, I should have known that it was bad. My gums bled and I spit out strings of blue, afterwards my tongue was numb. It burned terribly. I attributed it to the killing of germs and effectiveness- days went by and the burning sensation went away but am still left with numbness. I continued to use it but now my teeth are BROWN AND I am so done with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t drink alcohol or coke or coffee, I am only 20 years old and despite this my teeth look like I&#x27;ve been smoking for YEARS. And this is after using this product for about 2-3 WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product. I will be uploading pictures of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Rarely am I compelled to write a review, especially a negative one, but this is THE worst product I have ever used in my entire life. If I could give less than one star I would. My hygienist actually recommended it to me after my last appointment, so I figured out would be good stuff. First of all, the flavor is utterly horrific. Like others stated, it&#x27;s metallic-y and lingering, and also kind of floral... definitely NOT &#x27;fresh mint&#x27;. Each time I&#x27;ve used it, my mouth has become very irritated and burned feeling, and nothing tastes right for a day or so. It gave me sore bumps on my tongue.  Also, when I spit, out came thick clumps of purplish slime?! I can&#x27;t even figure out what that is, as the bottle is clear with nothing thick or slimy in it. I feel very fortunate I haven&#x27;t had the staining issue others have experienced. Mine got dumped down the drain tonight. Never again.</li>
    <li> Worst taste ever and i have tried many products. Not only that , but after rinsing, it is not as clear as the liquid -saw small pieces in what i spit out, sorry for being too descriptive, but this is bizarre. I also think my teeth look yellowish since i started using this. Going in the drain. Crest must be relying on first time purchasers as no one will repurchase this awful tasting rinse</li>
    <li> Horrible..seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I was ill or something, the metallic taste is so strong it also makes me nauseous. I was using it 2 times a day due to dentist recommendation of a new brushing regimen combined with rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been something like 26 hours and maybe 30% better, still nauseous, everything still tastes horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flabbergasted that this garbage ever made it out of testing, much less is still being sold.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last weekend after my most recent checkup and on the advice of my dentist - who recommended this specific brand. After one day of using this (morning and night, following the directions), I woke up the next morning and couldn&#x27;t taste my breakfast. It almost felt like there was a slight coating on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I though that it might be just a matter of getting used to it for a day or two, so I kept using it. By yesterday evening, after 4.5 days of using it, I was starting to worry about it, so I googled \\&quot;crest pro-health complete sense of taste\\&quot;. I found numerous blog posts and these reviews on Amazon. So, I stopped using it yesterday (9/26/12) and will take it back to our local Kroger for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking around here at the other mouthwashes that claim to restore enamel, the only one with more than 10 reviews that received good ratings is [[ASIN:B001H54RAQ ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint , 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]], so that is what I will try next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to post negative things about my hometown company (Procter &amp; Gamble), but this product is defective and should never have received FDA approval, going by the negative amount of comments I have seen on the internet. I&#x27;m hopeful my sense of taste will come back soon, and will post an update so people know how long it takes. I joked with my wife last night that when we were eating taco salad (with ground beef) that I might as well have put cat food on my salad because it would have tasted the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Two days after I stopped using it I started getting a sense of taste back. I noticed I could taste a little bit (maybe 50% normal) and by the end of the following day it was back to normal. Phew!</li>
    <li> Worst mouth wash ever! What ever happened to \\&quot;first do no harm\\&quot; You may have nice clean teeth but you won&#x27;t be able to enjoy life, ha.! Floride is dangerous! Read up on it</li>
    <li> Bought this at a store without reading reviews.  I was shocked to find out that everything I tasted for a week after using this mouthwash for a week tasted like I was licking metal.  My breath does feel fresh, but it&#x27;s not worth it if I can&#x27;t enjoy eating anything anymore.  Would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> No matter what I do the mouthwash stays on my tongue (creating these little streaks the color of the mouthwash), my tastebuds are gone for about a day or two afterwards, and, oh, it burns! Just use another brand. I&#x27;ve tried two different Crest mouthwashes and they both did this.</li>
    <li> I was completely unfamiliar with this product before I tried it, and was very pleased with the way it tastes, works, and the fresh after effect feeling in my mouth when I was done.  My teeth did not turn brown (or any other color), nothing bad happened to my taste buds, and I can tell you after using Listerine Cool Mint for years that this product is much better in every way.  I even tried Listerine&#x27;s Total Care, and it can&#x27;t compare to Crest Pro-Health Complete either.  Thank you, CREST for developing and making available a great product, and please continue to keep CREST Pro-Health Complete mouthwash on the market.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not entirely disappointed with this mouthwash (the flavor is acceptable, and it certainly leaves me feeling \\&quot;minty fresh), it leaves a strange sludge in my mouth -- not unlike the consistency of snot, but an alarming shade of purple.  I avoid wasting things whenever possible, so I&#x27;m going to use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago, not only did it leave my mouth feeling numb and food tasteless, it stained my teeth and gums. I have no idea how this product has made it on our shelves but it just goes to show the lack of quality control on things being sold to the public these days. Stay away from this mouthwash!!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but after a weekend from hell, I&#x27;m hoping to stop others from experiencing the pain I&#x27;ve gone through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had tooth or mouth pain and see my dentist every six months.  No more, no less.  I first bought this mouthwash about a week ago because the results promised were encouraging.  Since then I have had to go to my dentist emergently as it caused major inflamation of my entire mouth (gums, tounge, etc., causing my gum tissue to slough off) not to mention making my teeth hyper sensitive and my jaw stiff. This is in addition to killing off taste buds mentioned in all these other reviews.  Not relating this to my new mouthwash, I continued to gargle hoping that it would relieve the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent an excruciating weekend waiting to see my dentist on Monday thinking perhaps it was oral cancer (I am a former smoker) or some sort of aggressive periodontal disease.  Imagine my surprise when it was discovered it was more than likely related the mouthwash I used to relieve the symptoms.  Large doses of ibuprofen taken over the course of a few days, and salt water/baking soda gargle have done wonders.  Now just have to pay off an unnecessary dental bill and hopefully the pain of this whole experience will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one expensive bottle of rinse.  Use with caution.</li>
    <li> This product is the worst mouth-wash product I have ever experienced. Why is it on the shelf? I don&#x27;t know how Crest Pro-Health Complete got dental approval. This product jacked my tongue up. I am now on day 2 of not using this product and my tongue still feels strange where I can&#x27;t taste my food like I want to. I was eating pizza (pepperoni &amp; cheese) and the pizza tasted like I was eating something very spicy. If your a water drinker like myself, this isn&#x27;t the product you&#x27;d wanna use. Water doesn&#x27;t taste like water, it taste like your drinking dirty water. YOUR TASTE BUDS ARE COMPLETLY OFF! Never again will I use this product. So much for doing the right thing for my teeth.</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars, I would. This is the worst mouthwash I have had in my life. The entire day after using it, everything tasted disgusting. Stay away from this stuff! Crest needs to recall if this many people are having issues.</li>
    <li> Just poured this down the drain! Seriously, I only used this twice before I decided to look online to see if anyone else was experiencing what I was....after 2 times I could tell my teeth were definitely darker in colour and my tongue felt numb?? I waited the 30 minutes it says on the bottle to eat my breakfast and it tasted awful. Do NOT recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> I thought it was my imagination...until I see others have had this problem. The purple sludge the product left in my sink also began to show up on my teeth.</li>
    <li> There is some numbness of the tongue which takes a bit getting used to, but this product is great. It really strengthens the teeth over time and makes your mouth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an example, I was suffering from a bacterial infection from not cleaning my incoming wisdom tooth properly. After using this product sensitivity in my teeth went away, the pain went away and my breath is fresh and my mouth feels cleaner. Also, I have no plaque build up. Great overall product and most of all GOOD for your mouth. Sometimes you have to take a little discomfort and bad taste for a good thing.</li>
    <li> i wish i could rate ZERO. horrible side effects. numb and painful tongue. no ability to taste anything other than a constant bitter metal taste. mouth sores on my cheeks and &amp;#34;browning/yellowing&amp;#34; teeth - only used 3 days.</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible.  I followed the instruction of not drinking or eating for 30 minutes after using it.  However, it leaves me with a bad taste for the whole day.  It tastes like nail polish to me.  I tried drinking lots of water, eating soup, etc.  Nothing works.  I hope it will go away tomorrow.  I really should have checked Amazon review on this product before buying it on impulse at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for one week. Since the first use I noticed the metallic taste and change in taste buds. Three days ago a the side effects changed to include burning, and uncomfortable dryness of my gums, numbness and irritation of my tongue, and slight discoloration of my teeth--though I just had a cleaning. I realize now, after reading the reviews on these \\&quot;PRO-HEalth\\&quot; products, that this mouthwash is causing all my problems. Read the reviews --many people are having a bad experience with this product I wish I had read them before I bought it.  I poured mine down the sink.</li>
