      <li>I have started to use it too since the climate here is really dry and the extra moisturizer is a great help to dry skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and most other moisturizers cause inflammation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recieved this as a gift for my son.  I used both the body wash and the moisturizer on my 4 year old who has suffered with eczema since 2 or 3 months of age.  In just 3 days, I have seen a significant improvement in her skin, and this is after trying several products, including strong prescription steroid ointments to clear her skin.  I have been very impressed.</li>
    <li> Some questionable ingredients :( incl. sodium benzoate, which for the life of me, I can&#x27;t see why they would ever put that in ANY children&#x27;s products!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. My skin is sensitive and most other moisturizers cause inflammation. This one never does. I love the aloe and that is the key ingredient for me. It&#x27;s a nice bonus that about 70% of the ingredients are organic and paraben free. Although it&#x27;s marketed for babies and children it&#x27;s great for adults too. I use it on my face under makeup or alone before bedtime.</li>
    <li> Still a great product, but not sure it it&#x27;s exactly the same as I remember. Probably would give 5 stars if I was using this on a baby. In the past I used to use this every day on my face and everyone commented on how young I looked. I didn&#x27;t use it for a stint as I was trying another product and decided to go back to this, but now I feel something has changed (ingredients) over the years? Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it does not quite smell the same and I am not getting the results I used to. But will still continue to use it as a base coat.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite lotion.  I love that it is free of the nasty chemicals, but it has a bit of a smell (that we don&#x27;t like), and it&#x27;s very difficult to get it to absorb/run in to skin - it takes a few times to go over it to get it to absorb.  Also, the bottle needs improved - after each use, it &amp;#34;dents&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s hard to get it to pop out to use for the next time!</li>

    <li> Awesome product...purest one I&#x27;ve found yet....love it!</li>
    <li> Great for face and body for kids and adults. A little thinner than i like but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, good lotion, I like that it rates well on the EWG skin deep guide.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle. It is a great product. I am sensitive to the smell of creams, etc on my face. This one is very light and smells nothing. The moisturizing level is medium I would say.</li>
    <li> This is a great, non-greasy, non-oily lotion that moisturizes well and soaks into skin. I use it on my dry-skinned five-year-old after his winter baths. The only thing that I&#x27;m not thrilled about is that there is a slight fragrance to it. It says that it&#x27;s fragrance free, and I am sure it&#x27;s because there is no ADDED fragrance to the product. I&#x27;ve a sensitive nose but I can handle it since it&#x27;s light and I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t synthetic and is just a result of the natural ingredients in the lotion itself.</li>

    <li> This stuff is great.  Better than anything else we have tried for eczema, and we have tried them all.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because my baby needed something for her face during winter and I didn&#x27;t want to use baby body lotion or adult facial moisturizer.  It works fine.  It&#x27;s a better moisturizer than Johnson&#x27;s.  But all the plant extracts make it smell like old lady perfume.</li>

The bottle is hard to press &amp; control the quantity that&#x27;s coming out. It&#x27;s a bit pricy in my opinion. The product works fine on my baby sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has sensitive skin.  This organic lotion does not cause irritations or bumps on her skin.  Highly recommend for children with sensitive skin.  Very happy father and daughter.</li>
    <li> The smell is good. my baby loves it.The smell is good. my baby loves it.The smell is good. my baby loves it.</li>
