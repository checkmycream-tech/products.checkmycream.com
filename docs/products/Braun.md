<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> its the best shaver ever</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for approximately one month and have generally a positive reception. Previously I owned an older generation Braun shaver and liked it. It lasted for nearly 10 years, but ordered the Series 7 after it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station works great as I experienced before. I am still on my original cleaning solution Braun included from a month ago. I clean it after every use since I think using a clean shaver every day is one of the benefits of this shaver. Also the solution is pretty cheap, so it&#x27;s only a few cents every time you clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric shavers will never provide as close of a shave as a razor, but it&#x27;s not designed or marketed to. It provides a nice shave quickly and easily. Yes, it makes a noise when it is on, but it has a motor, so that is expected. I do find that it shaves better after it has been cleaned as the cleaning solution has a lubricant. Recently I have started to use it in the shower with some cream on my face. This model is not the &amp;#34;wet &amp; dry&amp;#34; model, but it does say it is waterproof. I think as long as I don&#x27;t submerge it I should be ok!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great shaver. It is on the prices side, but I think you get a lot for your money, especially when it will last you for years, and you will more than make your money back compared to buying razors. I saw Braun just came out with a Series 9, but looks to be several hundred dollars.</li>
    <li> to large ,no blade cover,  I found it to be harsh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and a half now and it works very well.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t shave the neck as well as I&#x27;d like and I usually have to clean it up with a regular razor if I want to get everything.  Also, it&#x27;s important to know that you will need to continue to purchase the cleaning solution for this self cleaner to work.</li>
    <li> I am not a complainer...This is my 3rd. top of line Braun when puchased in the past. I&#x27;ve only had it a month and I dont think it works&lt;br /&gt;as well as the 760 model. I&#x27;ll get a new coil and blades and see how it goes...</li>
    <li> Just now replacing my shaver that has been used for 9 years. Replaced the shaving foil a few times - everything else was flawless. Hope this lasts as long. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever!  I have to fight my wife and son off because this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave bumps and ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> Great razor. Best I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Had to figure out where the trimmer was and how different it was to use than my old Braun. But cuts well.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  I was not interested in the&amp;#34;hygienic cleaning&amp;#34; apparatus, so for me the product was overpriced.</li>
    <li> Great! My friend likes very much!</li>
    <li> After using a Braun 7526 for the last ten years, I figured it was time to upgrade my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 7-790cc seems to be a quantum leap forward in shaving comfort and closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all the new bells and whistles -- LCD screens, battery life indicators, &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34; indicators, etc -- come at a price. Even though this shaver costs $170 -- three times what I paid for my previous Braun --- it feels less substantial. I am hoping that this is due to more efficient, lighter battery tech. The upside to the lighter weight, of course, is that it is more suited to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning feature is a pricy convenience, but very handy. As recommended by some other users, I take the cleaning solution packet out and seal it up between cleaning cycles so that the fluid doesn&#x27;t evaporate too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head assembly is much more complicated than that of my old Braun (integrating both the foil and cutter block into a single unit). It seems to pay off -- the 7-790cc shaves very smoothly and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this razor will last as long as my trusty 7526 did, because I am really enjoying how it performs. It has cut my shaving time in half, while providing superior results.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome!  So easy to use and clean.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> This product is nothing special for the price. My husband always has to have the most expensive version of EVERYTHING thinking it will out-perform a cheaper model. This shaver system probably does the trick but it works the same as most others. It sits on the counter, on the charger and I have only seen him use it once since he bought it almost a year ago. He uses a cheaper model almost daily that is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t require a charger so stores much easier in a drawer or vanity.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor and I am not happy I changed.  It does not give the close shave I have been use to.  After a couple of hours it feels as if I need to shave again AND I have a very light beard.  I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like if I were average and had just normal growth.</li>
    <li> I could not be happier. This gives me the very best electric shave that Ihave ever had. And that&#x27;s every day👍👍</li>
    <li> Not as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  It does a great job on all areas of my face.</li>
    <li> Real shame for a life long braun fan (the series 5 was great) but the series 7 is terrible. The shave quality is poor and cleaner is very bad (the vibration of the shaver causes the contact points&lt;br /&gt;to un align and the cleaning cycle to stop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a real shame the series 5 was a great shaver and I couldn&#x27;t praise it high enough back then but sadly Braun build quality has gone down hill, giving Philips 3D a go this time.</li>
    <li> I had been trying for over a decade to get a electric shaver for my husband.  He has a very thick, coarse beard and prone to in-grown hairs in his neck.  He was adamantly against electric shavers, saying that in his past experience they don&#x27;t shave close, they pull at his hairs and tears at his face.  I came across this shaver with all the great reviews of genuine surprise at how much they love this shaver, so I took a chance.  My hubby is a convert. He says it&#x27;s painless, the shave is closer than a blade and he doesn&#x27;t need to shave as often.  The only thing he mentioned is that it does take longer than a blade to shave.  I do get the solution for the auto-clean.  We&#x27;ve had it for 6 months so far and it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> I like this one, very good products, good design, very practical.</li>
    <li> Even better than the 7 or so year old unit it replaced. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Received the new Braun 790cc shaving system and discovered the cleaning and charging base was dead on arrival.  I contacted Braun customer service and the representative told me I had to contact their service center in Watertown, MA before sending it in for repair or replacement. I attempted to phone the repair center and waited a long time before anyone answered. That representative told me to send it back to them. I spent nearly $200.00 for a defective product, have wasted nearly an hour on the phone, and have to pay postage on returning it for repair. No wonder Walmart is so successful. They do all that work behind the scenes just to be certain the customer is getting what he paid for. Braun has been downgraded in my opinion to just another average International manufacturer who shifts the responsibility of poor product quality to the customer.  With more and more companies adopting that &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care attitude&amp;#34;, online buying has become a higher risk than a convenience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this razor so far. It gives a nice close and clean shave. I don&#x27;t believe its waterproof, which is one feature i would like to see. I also with the trimmer was slightly wider. Beyond that, the battery life is great, the cleaning system works well, and charge time is fairly quick. I have had a hard time finding the cleaner cartridges at my local stores. They seem to include a disinfectant as well as a lubricant.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband. When asked how he liked he said \\&quot;it was outstanding\\&quot;. Shaver is self cleaning, long lasting battery and compact for traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my previous Braun completely wore out. Batt would not hold a charge and motor finally stopped even using wall power. This new model is \\&quot;flashier\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t shave a close as the old one. I have used it a month and tried all the adjustments but without great success. I wish I had the old one back but in new condition.  I have a relatively new Wahl shaver which I use for traveling. It cost less than $50. It shaves closer than the Braun.</li>
    <li> Have used the Braun Series 7 for years and was on my third head change and decided to get a new one.  New one is even better.</li>
    <li> Just got it - works great. More complicated than I wish though.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth and close shave, very quiet operation.  Quick recharge and love the cleaning it gives itself!  It&#x27;s smarter than I am!</li>
    <li> At this point in time my shaving requirements are not on a daily bases, so I only shave every 2nd or 3rd day.  The shaver looks, feels and functions very nicely without concerns.  The two items that did make themselves present is that during the cleaning cycle it does appear a little loud. I believe I might be able to remedy  that by placing a vibration absorbing article/face cloth or the sort underneath to absorb the noise/vibration conducted onto the hard bathroom counter surface, thus making it less noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd item was when using the sideburn/beard flip trimmer, it exposes itself for use in a position that requires additional thought and just appears unnatural to what at least I&#x27;ve been use to in the past and therefore I have to change hand positions with care as to not give myself any artistic cuts. Over all great little shaver that does the job so far and looks good.</li>
    <li> Overall very satisfied. Only reasons for not rating a 5 was inherent to electric shavers... not able to cut as well as a blade for me. But still a satisfactory job and a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for two months now and I&#x27;m convinced that it is the best electric razor I have ever used.  It replaced an older Braun razor that I loved.  This new one provides a faster and more comfortable shave, even with my heavy beard.  My only complaint is the high cost of the renewing fluid.  But that can be mitigated by cleaning and refilling the cartridge with denatured alcohol. Much cheaper and works just as well.</li>
    <li> I have not had any good shaves with this razor. It pulls my beard and is an uncomfortable shave all the time. I purchased it in December and thought it would get better as it got broken in. Nope, it still is not a good shaving experience. It&#x27;s almost like it is a lemon. This is my third Braun but this is not anything like my first two Braun shavers. Amazon, is there anyway to exchange this one for another one? If not I may have to change brands which is sad as I really am a Braun fan.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor - both close and fast. Moved up from a Braun Series 3 and there is no comparison, even with a new cutter cartridge on the 3.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this to replace a old Braun Series 3 that doen not hold a charge any longer. Love the new design and the shaves are close and fast.</li>
    <li> Good razor except lock switch broke off shaver. On the previous Braun shaver which this unit replaced, the lock switch did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  just had my first shave with this wonderful little machine. Hands-down, the finest shave I&#x27;ve ever received from an electric shaver, comparable to a blade. Very ergonomic, and the extra features are nice. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in over ten days; I &amp;#34;rough-trimmed&amp;#34; my very thick, dense beard with a set of clippers, leaving a very rough mess with which to test the new Braun. After pre-treating my curiously handsome face with William&#x27;s Lectric Shave, I plunged the Braun into the brush. I was amazed to see and feel this unit leave a clean, tanned stripe on my face. Not one hair tug, no secondary stubble left behind, nothing. I would add that I have some difficult, rogue hairs on my neck, laying naturally in several different directions. No problem at all for this beast of a shaver.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver. I have never been a big fan of foil style shavers, rotary always seemed to work better for me, but this one does an excellent job. Sometimes I have to go over certain areas more than a few times, but I just chalk that up to my hair.</li>
    <li> Before I had this, I had this: [[ASIN:B001VEK1C6 Braun Series 3-370cc Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]. This is FAR superior to that model. I prefer to shave with a manual razor, but sometimes I don&#x27;t have time for the \\&quot;prep\\&quot; to do it. This shaves almost as close as my manual razor (there is still the tiniest bit of hair left, about 6 microns long. Still closer than the previous razor I mentioned), and the sideburn/facial hair trimmer is built into the razor MUCH more solidly than the last one, with a \\&quot;flip-up\\&quot; design. I don&#x27;t expect it to break off any time soon (like the last one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is pretty much the same concept as the previous model, just a few extra lights to show progress of the cleaning. There is a \\&quot;turbo clean\\&quot; feature, but I don&#x27;t use it. I believe it won&#x27;t get the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; cleaning done. Besides, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me since I start the cleaner before I head off to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of people think it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but I&#x27;ve found that you get what you pay for (at least when it comes to electric razors).&lt;br /&gt;Get this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This series seven shaver is a definite upgrade from the series five, which I have used for years and thought did a good job.I like the self cleaning mechanism.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver about a month ago. I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for at least the last 30 years and I always have a good experience shaving with the shaver. The Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic is expensive but very well worth the money. I love it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good most of the time. Don&#x27;t go more than a day without shaving or it will start to pull hair instead of cutting them.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Braun Shaver... I have alway bought Braun because I love and really only use the trimmer feature on the Shaver.  Well they changed the trimmer design significantly since my last one... this one is really small and now it takes forever to trim my full beard.  ...I know, I know... &amp;#34;you should buy a Trimmer or Clipper...&amp;#34;  I have, but they simply do not trim as close as the trimmer featured on the Braun Shaver... I really don&#x27;t get how Braun doest know that...</li>
    <li> my father like lt very much and it used very well.in fact its my first time use such expensive razor.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed most Brauns, this one is solid and performs pretty well except on chin, have to go over more thanb once to get good shave, Is a good product and a solid unit.</li>
    <li> The cleaning base broke within one use. My husband tried to clean it and the machine kept saying it was empty of cleaning solution, even though it was 100% full!</li>
    <li> Does not give a close shave on my neck unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Replacing a 10 year old Braun Flex XP that finally gave in with this.  The shaving experience with 790cc was so unbelievable, I wish I had bought it sooner.  It gives a quiet smooth clean shave and very powerful. I would recommend this to anyone if it&#x27;s within their budget.</li>
    <li> I have owned multiple Braun razors over the years, and all were very good...however, this one is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has very high-speed heads for an extremely comfortable and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Best one I&#x27;ve ever used! One thing I like about it over my older series 3 is you can charge it without automatically cleaning it.</li>
    <li> Had a Panasonic Rotary that just gave out on me after about a year.  This gives a much better shave and I love the cleaning deal that comes with it.  While the cost is considerable, if it holds up for a couple of years or more, it will be money well spent to me.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!! Best Braun I&#x27;ve had.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Definitely better than other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel hard to do a dry shave and often end up with wounds near the neck region.</li>
    <li> Works great with sensitive skin. Cleaning system is the best.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Electric Razor&lt;br /&gt;Definately the best I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;Auto cleaning works like a charm and lubricates too&lt;br /&gt;Love the fresh sent cleaning adds</li>
    <li> With the rave reviews I&#x27;d read, I am a bit disappointed.  The whole cleaning system is bigger than I expected. Very clunky.  Is it worth it?  Not sure.  The job it does of shaving is fine but nothing exceptional.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric razors for more than 30 years and was clearly happy with them - until this latest one.  When the battery finally gave out on my 800 series razor after many years of service , I ordered this one to replace it.  However, on every shave the corner of the shaving foil grabs a few hairs  and rips them out!  And that hurts - a lot!  It may just be a defective foil, but at $34 each, I am not interesting in experimenting.</li>
    <li> Very good shave first week.  However this is a relatively complex razor, with swivel and floating heads and head position lock, with more to go wrong than earlier models I have had over 20 years.  After 3 weeks the lock no longer worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the position of the swivel head, the floating heads lock down on one end - one side if swiveled one way, the other side is swiveled the other way.  Quality of shave deteriorated rapidly over the 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience with all previous Braun razors, for my face, has been that the cutter block and foil have lasted and matched new block and foil for 2 years.  It would appear the reduced quality of shave of the series 7 is due to the poor functioning of the swivel and floating heads</li>
    <li> After using a Braun 8985 (360 Complete) for several years, I upgraded to this Braun Series 7 when my son went to college.  Since he does not need to shave every day, I gave him my old 8985 because it still works perfectly.  The new Braun Series 7 is a fantastic shaver.  I have a very thick beard and must shave every day.  I tried a Norelco rotary shaver many years ago and found it ineffective on my thick beard.  My first shaver 30 years ago was a Remmington foil shaver.  It was pretty good and better than the Norelco rotary shaver.  My second shaver was a silver Braun which was far better than any other shaver.  My third shaver was the Braun Syncro 7526 now used by my youngest son.  My fourth shaver was the Braun 8985 now used by my older son.  My fifth shaver is this Braun Series 7 bought in 2012.  After over 30 years of shaving, I can attest to the fact that these Braun shavers last a long time and are very effective.  Here is the secret . . . You do not have to use the Braun cleaning system every day as recommended.  Just use the shaver every day for a couple of weeks until the battery gets low.  When it is time to recharge the shaver, open the lid on the cleaning solution, put it in the cleaning machine, slide the shaver into the machine, push the button and let it clean and charge the shaver.  SAVE THE LID FOR THE CLEANING SOLUTION.  After the shaver is cleaned and charged, remove the shaver and put it in your drawer.  Remove the cleaning solution and put the saved lid back on the cleaning solution.  Put the covered solution back in the cupboard.  Put the cleaning machine on the shelf next to the cleaning solution.  Use the shaver for a couple weeks and repeat.  The solution will last a long time.  Watch the price because it does fluctuate.  I got a great deal when the price went down significantly and there was a rebate available in addition to the price cut.  Some reviews indicate Panasonic shavers might give Braun a run for its money.  Although Panasonic is the one shaver brand I have not tried, I can assure you the Braun 790 provides a very close, smooth shave every time.  The cleaning machine and solution work very well.  Don&#x27;t forget the secret . . . Save the lid for the cleaning solution to prevent evaporation.the one shaver brand I have not tried, I can assure you the Braun 790 provides a very close, smooth shave every time.

    <li> Smoothest, closest shave I have ever had. Takes a little while to understand operational aspects for shaving and cleaning.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this shaver. He is 79 yrs old and has had an electric shaver for many years and has tried them all and this one is the best ever. He raves about it every day. Great close shave and he never gets knicked. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Very Quiet.  Shaves without excessive passes under the chin.  Easier to take out of the holder than the prior Braun model.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good clean shave. I have tried other company&#x27;s but this one puts them to shame! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a beard, so I find a foil shaver much more effective than a rotary (I have to shave around the places where I want my beard to be, or it starts halfway down my neck and grows up to my eyes like some kind of werewolf).  I&#x27;ve had a Braun 7526 for many years, but when it stopped holding a charge it was time for a change.  Overall, I&#x27;ve found the 790cc to be superior to the 7526, with a couple of caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The 790cc is much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;- It is better at cutting long hair (for instance, if I go a couple of days between shaves).&lt;br /&gt;- It appears to hold a charge longer than the 7526 did even when new, and the charge indicator is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t like the alignment of the mustache trimmer, which comes out at a 90 degree angle to the body and is sometimes a little hard to position.&lt;br /&gt;- While effective at cutting long hair, it&#x27;s fairly painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other comments:&lt;br /&gt;- The 7526 was completely straight (like a candy bar) whereas the 790cc is somewhat angled (I can&#x27;t think of a better description than a Star Trek Next Generation phaser).  I thought that would annoy me, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;- I do a light cleaning daily by opening the head and tapping out the residue.  I use the cleaning process once per week.  This seems to work fine and allows the cleaning solution to last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased so far, and if it lasts as long as the 7526 did I&#x27;ll have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. He loves it. His last razor lasted 6 years with daily use due to the military. Hope this one lasts at least that long.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband to update his old one (5 years old).  He felt there was nothing wrong with is old Braum and it worked perfectly.  I felt he needed to update technology, especially when dealing with his face.  So I ordered it, and now he realizes I was right :-).  Lets hope this one last 5 years also!</li>
    <li> Though still not as close as an actual razor it is the best electric shave I have ever had. I love the self cleaning charger. I have used while traveling and it holds its charge well and can be cleaned with water if you don&#x27;t want to take the base unit with you. I also recommend getting a subscription through amazon for the cleaning solution. It serves you about five dollars every 4 months.</li>
    <li> Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivers a nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Manual cleaning is also quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Very very comfortable even for someone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality build and comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes me a little longer to shave than with philips shavers, but that depends on your face type.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor smooth and close shave, take time to use properly and will not regret buying.&lt;br /&gt;Cost of monthly maintenance fluid is high even at discount centers.</li>
    <li> I thought just using a new 5 blade gillete razor was equivalent and easier to shave with. Was not good with neck area</li>
    <li> After trying to find an electric that could match my safety razor shave, I can say this shaver is definitely up to the job. Only drawbacks: the clean &amp; renew cartridge that&#x27;s provided didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped so you might want to buy a 3 pack with your original purchase. And it&#x27;s not waterproof, so you can&#x27;t use it in the shower. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I gave a different type of electric razor a try after years of using a Braun Pulsonic but it didn&#x27;t compare. I had to return the other style razor and purchase this one. Once you start using a self cleaning electric razor you just don&#x27;t want to go back to one that you have to manually clean.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt this is the best version of Braun Yet...When my pulsonic version died, I replaced it with version 7 and I was surprised how much better it is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one thing I don&#x27;t like is the cost for clean and renew cartridges...So after some research, I found out you can replace refill the cartridge with 70% rubbing alcohol and Lemon essential oil...You will save money and keep the environment green with less plastic wastes...</li>
    <li> I previously had a phillips shaver and it was good but this one was better, it had all the features i needed. i could shave abouve my mustache and it came really close to my skin. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using different models of Braun shaver for 25 years and this is the first time I bought a shaver which doesn&#x27;t come with protective cap which is so important to protect the foil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to replace a 790 I purchased when they first hit the market.  The old razor still works fine but the new one is even better. It shaves closer then the original model and is very quite, even at the highest speed. I reason I replaced the first razor was due to a malfunction with the base cleaner/charger. I thought it might be cost effective to buy the new version 790 since I needed a new base anyway.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver System to replace my old Series 5 shaver.  And the improvements that Braun has incorporated into this new system are well worth the added cost!  Superb!</li>
    <li> First electric shaver. Good but not as good as razor. Takes time to get everything.</li>
    <li> excellent shaver no issues so far</li>
    <li> The closest shave we can get and there is no iritation or etching after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;---Happy with the Product and its  capabilities ----------</li>
    <li> the shaver is very excellent. This is my 2nd Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> I have had several electric razors in the past and I would have to say that this razor is the best by far. simply phenomenal that provides a very close shave comparable to a regular razor.  This has far exceeded any expectations that I had.</li>
    <li> Always Fantastic in Braun.</li>
    <li> Good, close shave, but I have nothing special to report.</li>
    <li> This product consistently gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast, easy to use, and shave very close. It is great that it clean itself just pressing a button. Good product!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my fiance, and he says it is by far the best electric shaver ever, and possibly the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> excellent close shave</li>
    <li> I wanted this new shaver for awhile now, but got it for my birthday from a dear friend. It is everything that I imagined. I had the earlier model and it worked good enough. Braun sells excellent products. The price was slightly higher than I wanted to spend, so I was holding out for a sale. Luckily, I received it as a gift. I get such a close shave, no more razor bumps! Ladies if you want to make your man happy give him this shaver, he will be sooo happy. Gents if you desire a close shave that leaves your face feeling better than it has ever felt before after shaving, this is the shaver to try. I highly recommend the Braun 7-790cc which includes a \\&quot;quick clean\\&quot; function.</li>
    <li> Finally decided to replace the old Braun I had (10+ years old, heck, was made in West Germany, so that shows how dated it was)... anyway, what can I say, I love the product and this did not disappoint. The shave was a vast improvement over the old one, quicker, cleaner, closer, with less strokes, but it still did not getting my neck 100%, which has always been a problem. It will get maybe 98% of the job done,but  then I need to go to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide (my neck is a tough bugger to get smooth) to finish the job. I was glad to see that the shaver itself was made in Germany and was not some nasty &#x27;Made in China&#x27; piece of junk, although some of the other components were made in China (go figure). It is actually made in 4 different places: (1) shaver in Germany, (2) Clean/Storage Unit in Hungary, (3) Cleaning Cartridge in Ireland and the rest in China (so I can at least expect the cord to fail any day now... damn, why not all of it in Germany and charge me $5-$10 more, are you really saving that much money???) Anyway, enough of my rant on junk from China... To sum it up, great shaver, still German, get one now!!!</li>
    <li> ive wanted this shaver for a long time. finally got it for christmas, and am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;ive only used an electric shaver a few times before, and wanted an alternative to a razor---------hate the mess!&lt;br /&gt;its fast and comfortable. pretty quiet. BUT as with every other electric shaver (as i understand it) it doesnt do as well around the adams apple area as a razor. i expected that.&lt;br /&gt;havent used a razor for more than a month! love it!!&lt;br /&gt;4 stars? &#x27;cause nuthin  in my life is 5 stars!! lol</li>
    <li> I am a long-time user of safety razors, primarily because I have a heavy beard and never got a very good shave with the electrics.  Also the electrics tended to irritate my face, so I was willing to put up with the occasional, unavoidable cuts despite using the most advanced safety razor system.  I heard good reports about the Braun; I had previously tried primarily rotary electrics.  The results were as good as the safety razor and this time the irritation was simply not there.  I do use the Gilette Fusion Sensitive Skin Wash as a type of shaving cream to \\&quot;lubricate\\&quot; the movement of the razor over my face, which is much nicer to use than the old Gillette Pre-Electric Shave.  This is possible because this shaver is a \\&quot;wet shaver\\&quot;, which allows me to run the head under hot water before beginning to shave--no cold steel against my face on those winter mornings.  The fact that the Braun comes with the automatic cleaning system that ensures that the shaver is cleaned after each use also greatly reduces the maintenance effort, which was a pain with the other electric razors.  Finally, the Gilette Fusion blades have become so expensive that it is actually less expensive to buy this electric shaver.  I have not identified any negatives.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun shaver user for many years and each time I upgrade, usually every 5-7 years, the shavers get better and better.  This one is no exception cutting shaving time to half of my last one.  I do miss having a protective cover on the screen, although the case itself protects the whole device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Braun electric razors for three decades, and while each new generation gets better, the Series 7 is by far the best in terms of comfort, closeness, and battery life.</li>
    <li> Charged up and used the first time this morning - distinct improvement over the previous Series 7 model [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic  Shaver]] and 9595 [[ASIN:B000IWFU3W Braun 9595 Series 7 Electric Shaver]] with several modifications recommended by users incorporated into the design:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Redesigned head.  No, you do NOT need the old blue strip in the middle - the new Series 7 head is better than the previous model.  Slightly larger diameter holes with irregular shapes, redesigned center cutting strip with rounded guides (contrary to other reviews, cutting surface of the center strip is exactly the same in the new head as the old - 30mm long); it actually cuts better and more comfortably (and cooler for some reason) than the old head design.  Sort of a moot point, because you can use either head design with either shaver series, but nice to see an improved head design come out with this new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The plastic strip in the back, below the shaver head on the body of the shaver, is now smooth and without lettering.  The reason this is important is because in the OLD design, a rather meaningless \\&quot;CAUTION: Use only with Braun power unit blah, blah\\&quot; is stamped into the case, through the silver paint covering the black plastic body.  That&#x27;s important because over a short period of time, with daily exposure to the alcohol cleaning fluid, the silver paint begins to peel off around the lettering because of the break in the surface, exposing the black plastic below.  Just cosmetic, other than flakes of paint falling into the cleaning unit, but annoying on a high-priced shaver, and it&#x27;s pretty well guaranteed because it happened to all three of my previous Braun units, generally after a couple of months&#x27; use.  The new shaver has the lettering printed on the soft rubber backing, and presumably the unbroken surface of the top strip will not peel.  Still appears to be painted black plastic (in this case with a graphite-colored paint), so the jury is still out on its durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Quieter operation.  I would estimate about 20-30% quieter than the older model.  Virtually the same on the cleaning unit as the old one, but the actual \\&quot;noisy\\&quot; part of the cleaning cycle in the cleaner is less than 5 minutes (much shorter than Norelco&#x27;s or Panasonic&#x27;s auto cleaner units); the rest is convection drying and charging, which is completely silent (also unlike Norelco and Panasonic, which use a fan for drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The comfort setting buttons (+ and -) on the body of the shaver actually do work, slowing down or speeding up cycles and vibration on ALL the cutter heads.  The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting gives the most comfortable shave I have had from a dry shave on my neck and upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)  The \\&quot;Lock\\&quot; button on the head appears to be metal.  Really thin metal, but metal.  The previous design was a plastic button with a tiny pin holding the head locked, which was almost guaranteed to break around the end of the warranty period.  Again, durability remains to be seen, but if it has been reengineered with metal, that&#x27;s a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:  The soft rubber backing (on my new unit) has several gaps between it and the hard plastic body, and seems to be not fitted as well as my older unit.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to be loose, and may again be only cosmetic, but Braun QC is still somewhat lacking.  Customer service with Braun is still a well-reported irritant - if you run into an issue with their shavers you must find a Braun dealer in the nearest STATE that will accept a return of your shaver, and they may not be very user-friendly if you didn&#x27;t purchase from them - caveat emptor; you also cannot return this item to Amazon, unlike other shavers.  The \\&quot;On\\&quot; button is suitable for a night-light.  A really bright night light.  Then again, this may be a plus, depending on whether you keep it on your nightstand and are afraid of the dark.  Lots of painted plastic still, but the shaver doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;cheap;\\&quot; just a question of long term wear with use - Panasonic and Norelco shavers seem to be able to use molded plastic that is colored throughout on their units, instead of paint over plastic (actually Braun does too in their lower-end Series 7s); it&#x27;s a curiosity to me why their top-of-the-line shaver retains this archaic Mattel-like production process.  Collectively, Braun loses a star for the above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a definite improvement with a more comfortable shave over the previous Series 7 and 9595 units if you shave dry or with a pre-electric.  Still not as comfortable (to me) as a wet electric shave, but faster, quieter (for a foil), less messy with a closer shave, and I suspect the best of the dry shave lot at this time.t feel \\&quot;cheap;\\&quot; just a question of long term wear with use - Panasonic and Norelco shavers seem to be able to use molded plastic that is colored throughout on their units, instead of paint over plastic (actually Braun does too in their lower-end Series 7s); it&#x27;s a curiosity to me why their top-of-the-line shaver retains this archaic Mattel-like production process.

    <li> So far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned a Braun 340s wet/dry shaver and it worked from about two months into Afghanistan (July 2011) until now that I want to &amp;#34;upgrade.&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my 340s still does really well with a little bit of Williams Lectric Shave.  I&#x27;m not active duty anymore, but my girlfriend likes a clean face :) and I want something newer that doesn&#x27;t have deployment inside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five hours after I purchased this shaver, Amazon dropped the price from $170 to $149.  I was P$SSED!  I went to return it and buy it again to save myself $20 but I can&#x27;t because it ships with a highly flammable alcohol product.  I guess if I want to test drive shavers (as all men can attest that if a rotary works on one guy doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll work on another....same goes for foil), I&#x27;ll have to buy locally.  And then I feel weird about returning shaving products.  Oh well, my friends and 2,000+ other Amazon reviewers can&#x27;t be wrong.  I will update this review 30 days after I get the product.</li>
    <li> It works well but no shaver even comes close to a blade.  It is good for keeping your face fairly clean until you can use your real razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find a shaving system that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face since my beard made the transition from peach fuzz to wire bristle at about age 21. I&#x27;ve tried them all; inexpensive electric shavers, special sensitive skin disposable razors, safety razors, straight razors, depilatories, and more.  Nothing worked except for the Remington 1000 &#x27;Black Man&#x27;s Shaver&#x27;, which was promptly discontinued after I bought one.  I was always hesitant to try the expensive electric shavers because I would be stuck with it if it didn&#x27;t work and I&#x27;d be out a lot of money.  Since Braun is offering a 60 day money back guarantee I decided to give this shaver a shot.  IT&#x27;S GREAT!  I can finally shave every day with barely any irritation.  It&#x27;s not as close of a shave I can get with a disposable or safety razor, but that might improve as my face adjusts.  It&#x27;s plenty close enough to look presentable, which is all I care about at this point.  If you also struggle with sensitive skin and a heavy beard, give this shaver a try.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have been using it for the last 5 months. It has been a good experience so far and have put an end to the razor use! It took time to get used to the electric shaver as a first timer with the sound and particularly using an electronic device up your face. The manual tells you to shave against the facial hair growth. After you use it for 2-3 times, your facial hair will get used to this and shaving gets easier. The shaver gives a close shave, it has been very safe and the whole kit is easy to use be it shaving or cleaning. The battery charging, cleaning has not been an issue. It has a good grip and the blade motion works well too for using it against your jaw and neck. Also you can adjust the vibration level to your personal choice and put to use what is comfortable to you. Below chin/neck area for me, sometimes I have to try multiple times and up the vibration level for a close shave but I wouldn&#x27;t read much into this if I were you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it has been a good experience and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I have bought a new electric razor.  But I figured if I was, may as well go with the best.  After A LOT of research, I found this model, and I am glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is amazing.  By far the closest shave you will get with electric.  The cleaning system is awesome, it will feel new and fresh after every clean.  Braun hit the jackpot with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am coming from a rotary style razor, because I thought those would be the closet.  Wrong!!  If you are debating on this razor, no need, just buy it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I much prefer to shave with a safety razor, but there are days when I just can&#x27;t be bothered.  For those occasions there is this Braun shaver.  I use this top shave my head and face.  It does a pretty good job, but certainly isn&#x27;t a close shave.  I really like the charging dynamic (just resting it in the holder) and I like that this has a cleaner on it (which I suppose makes it shave better, longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement cartridges for the cleaner aren&#x27;t too cheap, but they do last me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember not to start a cleaning cycle right before bed because it is loud enough to keep you awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts about 5 days for me, which is good since shaving both head and face takes a fair amount of time.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun Shaver... They last 5-7 years of every day use and then the battery usually get very weak.  If you use the electrical cord they will continue to work as advertised.  Braun gives me a close shave without tearing up my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> We purchased Bruan series 7 790cc thru dealsofamerica on Amazon.com and we got a good price the razor came without a cleaning cartridge and IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK!! We plugged it in to AC- dead. So we charged it overnight - the next day still dead. We tried multiple outlets, no luck. It didn&#x27;t look damaged or have any wrayed wires- it just didnt work. When we purchased it off Amazon it stated \\&quot;This product cannot be returned\\&quot; I thought no big deal Amazon is credible right? Which is why I was so shocked our razor didn&#x27;t work.  But long story short, we contacted dealsofamerica and they let us keep the broken razor (which we can salvage for spare parts) and gave us a full refund. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with rapid responses and follow-thru that we got from dealsofamerica in making it right.</li>
    <li> Bought this bad boy to shave my dome, stupid premature balding....thanks Dad.  Had been using razors, and tried other electric alternatives that just couldn&#x27;t get the job done.  Then this beauty comes along, and does everything I need it to do.  Have been using this 3 or so times a week for quite awhile, and don&#x27;t have a single complaint.  Heck, it even cleans itself to. Nice close shave (my bald head), quick/thorough cleaning (although a little loud when cleaning).  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shaver.  It replaced a Braun shaver that I bought ten years before, and the new unit is an improvement in every respect.  The Series 7 shaver gives a fast, close shave and does not irritate my skin.  I have a fairly light beard, so this should be taken into consideration when reading my review.  For someone like me, this shaver is ideal.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun 7 series before and expected I would like the latest one as much if not more.  For some reason when I shave after skipping a day or more, the new one is much more prone to grabbing and pulling out hairs.  I have made the adjustment of shaving much more slowly, and still it pulls 5-10 hairs each time I shave.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how careful I am, this thing grabs and pulls out hairs.  I HATE that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every good thing about this shaver is eclipsed by the fact that it hurts me every time I shave, unless I shave every day.  I have taken to using a separate clipper  to make my hair shorter, if I have skipped a day or more.  I don&#x27;t think a top of the line shaver should require using a separate hair clipper before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I saved the box, so I think I&#x27;m stuck with the damn thing.  I am bummed to have spent a couple hundred bucks for a product that I dread using.  Braun if you read this, can you help out a long time customer who used to be a happy customer?</li>
    <li> It works fine, is expensive, and does not shave as close with a first pass as did my old one.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers since the 80&#x27;s, and have always been pleased. I had never spent more than $100 on a shaver before, and stepping up to the pricepoint of this one took some time, but I took the plunge. I have used it now for about 3 months, and I wanted to give it some time before I reviewed it to give it a fair shake. Bottom line: It&#x27;s a decent shaver, but not worth $250.00 in my opinion. Sure it has the requisite gimmicks to demand it&#x27;s high price: The self cleaning system, \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; technology, 3 different power settings, cutesy charging/cleaning station, hi tech look and feel, etc. But compared to all the other Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used over the years, it works about the same. It did seem to shave better when new, but all of them did. After a few weeks of using it, my shaves took the same amount of time, and my face felt the same as all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I do like the fact that the shaver smells \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot; the first shave after cleaning, and it does leave a small film of lubricant on my face, but I usually only clean it once a week, and the shave is the same whether I cleaned it or not. And regarding other reviewers comments about hair clippings falling out into the sink, what did you expect? It is an electric shaver after all, and the hair has to go someewhere. I must say that this shaver does a better job than most of holding on to the clipped hairs than all othe Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used. I just take off the head and blow the hairs out after each shave, and it&#x27;s good to go. And as far as noise? This is by far the quietest Braun shaver I have used. It might not seem like it when pressed against my face because of the \\&quot;Pulsonic Technology\\&quot; vibrating the shaver though. With some others, I swear I could wake my upstairs neighbors with the noise, not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they should have just put one power setting on it- the most powerful. I don&#x27;t see any need for the others. Why would you not want the most powerful setting? My skin is fairly sensitive especially on my neck, and I don&#x27;t have any problems with the max setting. The pop up trimmer is handy, and works a little better than past Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used, no complaints. Battery life is good so far. I tried not charging it for a week to see if it would make it, and it did. Of course it is relatively new, but since I always put it in the charging/cleaning station, this will be a non issue anyways later in it&#x27;s life. As far as the cleaning solution goes, I just passed the 3 month mark, and the indicator just turned to yellow, so it has lasted a long time, but like I said, I only clean it once a week. You may have to compare shaves with and without cleaning to see if that will work for you. Like I said, the shave seems about the same for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with most reviewers about the cord that plugs into the wall. It is just riduculously HUGE. Why they had to make it that way I have no idea. We&#x27;re not going to use this thing to power a microwave for Pete&#x27;s sake. And if you plug this thing in anywhere you don&#x27;t want light at night- say, your bedroom- forget it. This thing is more than a nightlight, and it is loud when cleaning. I have mine docked in the laundry room down the hall from the bathroom. You could land planes at night with a couple of these things! Seriously though, it is bright, and I like darkness in my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does a decent job as a shaver. I will go as far as saying it does a bit better job at a thicker beard than most. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with it&#x27;s performance. But for me personally, the Pulsonic Technology doing anything to help shaving is debatable, and I could do without the cleaning system and the power settings, if it didn&#x27;t have them I would still be satisfied. Knock about a hundred bucks off the price, and I would be even more satisfied!erful setting?

    <li> If I had to nit-pic about something, it&#x27;s that the trimmer is rounded. That may be more personal preference, but the shaver is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. My old one broke after 8 years (I got too much hair stuck in the trimmer, which is one reason I like the placement and design of the new one, and jammed up the switch that I then forced and broke) and I had to resort back to a razor, my new shaver puts everything else to shame. I love it</li>
    <li> Braun Shaver; Very dissappointed-shaver does not cut close enough; it&#x27;s a dud. All the series of instructions are nebulous and poorly exampled. Not satisfied at all.&lt;br /&gt;An 80 year-old, crippled and neary blind.&lt;br /&gt;John Clancey</li>
    <li> I used this razor for a year and a half. I told myself it was cheaper than buying all those cartridges for my razor. In the long run, it probably was. But I just never got a really close shave with this. Look, the battery life is fantastic. It is easy to clean (I also used the cleaning feature of the stand) but the auto clean feature didn&#x27;t always get all the beard residue out of the shave head. The cleaner cartridges are pretty pricey as well. I finally gave up the idea of a good shave with even the best electric razor out there and I&#x27;ve gone to DE shaving. It is, like the Braun, a bit of an investment in gear up front but the quality of shave can&#x27;t be beat (I use a Muhle R41 with Feather blades and a Parker silver tip badger brush and Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat soap.). I know this is a review of the Braun and if you like an electric shave, you&#x27;ll like the Braun Series 7. I just couldn&#x27;t get the closeness I needed without a real blade.</li>
    <li> What a surprise and pleasure this shaver is!  I first learned of it from the raves of an Aussie friend a few years ago, and finally broke down and surrendered.  No more nicks and cuts.  Now it&#x27;s a great shave, comfortable, no red necks and so easy to clean.  Expensive?  Yes, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I like it much better than my previous Braun. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot. Easier to clean. And, I loved my previous Braun, it just broke after many years of use@</li>
    <li> Bought this on recommendation from a cosmetic dermatologist. I had switched to a rotary electric shaver after repeated facial cuts in generally the same location with a blade shaver. Although less frequent I still cut myself with the rotary electric about once a month. Was considering laser treatment of surface veins; during consult the CD recommended this shaver, said he has one (and did not sell them from his office), and although it is expensive he thought it could help.&lt;br /&gt;He was absolutely correct. Had this for multiple months, no cuts, clean shaves, clean machine. I am very happy with it at this point.</li>
    <li> I found the three top of the line electric shavers - Braun Series 7, Panasonic es-la63, and Phillips Norelco 3D -  to be so similar as to recommend any of them as excellent shavers, but each has its strengths and weaknesses. Too many reviewers are only comparing the closeness of the shave, but that&#x27;s only one factor of several that may be most important. Here&#x27;s my breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness - Let&#x27;s start with the most popular category. If all you care about is how close you can shave, then I rate the wet-shaved Panasonic and Norelco even, BUT ONLY when coupled with a shaving oil/gel combo such as [[ASIN:B005ACNPLO Remington Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz. (Pack of 2)]] (there&#x27;s a cooling menthol version as well). Another way to accomplish the same thing is by using [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL- THE BEST SHAVE EVER! 18.75ML]] topped with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUU Edge Shave Gel, Senstive Skin, 7-Ounces Cans (Pack of 6)]].These provide the closest shave possible, but, of course, it&#x27;s messy, takes a lot of extra time, and can be a general pain. There&#x27;s no advantage in closeness to using non-oil shaving cream by itself.  Going dry-shave, I may give the tiniest of edges to Panasonic over Braun and Norelco, but all three are awfully close  - to each other and in quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed - If you&#x27;re in a hurry and want to get in and get out with a dry-shave as quickly as possible, the Norelco wins. The Panasonic is next followed by the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the Braun wins out (unless going wet-shave with the oil/gel as described above). The Braun has three speeds so you can go slower for sensitive areas and intensive on less-sensitive places. I just leave it set on intensive all the time and have no problem. The Panasonic is next followed by the Norelco third. The wet-shaving Panasonic and Norelco are the most comfortable of all if you want to put up with the oil/gel prep and clean-up time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Any auto cleaning system is easier than manual cleaning. Just pop in the shaver and press a button. That said, the Braun is the only system with alcohol in its cleaner to sanitize as well as a detergent to clean and oil to lubricate. Norelco&#x27;s apparently has detergent and lubrication. From what I&#x27;ve been able to tell, the Panasonic solution is only a detergent. Manually, the Norelco is easiest to clean and you can duplicate the auto clean by pouring some of its [[ASIN:B002DHVAZW Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution]] in a dish or mug and whirring the shaver in it for 30 seconds after shaving. The Panasonic and Braun can be rinsed off under a faucet. The Panasonic&#x27;s special cleaning speed makes it slightly easier to manually clean than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maneuverability - If you have a moustache, goatee, beard, long sideburns, or whatever this is a very important category. The Braun is king here with the Norelco second and the larger-head Panasonic last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - You can hardly hear the Norelco at all. The Braun is a little buzzy and the Panasonic loudest although not irritatingly so. Still, a sleeping spouse nearby will appreciate you using the Norelco most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel - The Norelco is last in this category because you&#x27;ll need to bring the charging stand with you. The Norelco soft case does not hold the stand so that&#x27;s a bit of a drawback. The Braun&#x27;s harder case gives it top honors over the Panasonic&#x27;s soft one, but the Panasonic has an on-off lock that the Braun lacks. Perhaps the Braun doesn&#x27;t need it because the case is harder, and also because the Braun is the only shaver that can run while plugged in with a depleted battery. The other two require a 5-minute charge to give you a few minutes shave. A fully-charged shaver gives you about 50 minutes in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL - They&#x27;re all excellent, but overall I&#x27;d choose the Braun with the auto cleaner. Without the auto cleaner, it&#x27;s very close between them all and I&#x27;d simply find thebest one in your most important categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2015: After four years, I still have all three electrics, and all are doing fine. That said, the Braun gets 95 percent of my use. I prefer dry shaving and it&#x27;s the best dry-shaver. The Norelco is the worst dry shaver and most irritating on my face. However, the Norelco has, by far, the best trimmer. Because of its rotary heads, it also hits my face at different angles, so I occasionally follow up the Braun with a quick run over with the Norelco. I use the Panasonic strictly as a travel razor. It offers no advantage over the Braun or Norelco, except that it cleans easier if you don&#x27;t have the cleaning station.

    <li> I recently purchased the subject razor from Amazon and have been very happy with it. I upgraded from a Braun 8000 series razor and have found that the upgrade was very worthwhile. My shaves are closer and the razor handles very well.</li>
    <li> I been using electric shaver for over ten years. Mostly I was using Norelco&#x27;s high-end models. Although Norelco was provided me comfort shaves but its battery tends to be highly unreliable. That was reason of switching to this shaver. I am using it for over a year now and I am very satisfy with its performance around all contours of my face. I do use it with Gillette or Neutrogena Face Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE 3/2012 ***&lt;br /&gt;After an year of use, shaver is still providing awesome shaves.</li>
    <li> Well hello! I&#x27;m feel compelled to take time out of my day to write a review for this amazing little shaver. A little background about me before I begin is that I have REALLY sensitive skin. I have never been able to shave with a razor on back to back occasions as I would suffer from severe razor burn/irritation as well as pain/cuts on my face. The best way for my skin to handle a razor blade would be to wait about 4-5 days after an initial shave. The worst part of this is that I would have to plan my shaves in advance to accommodate events like weddings or outings. I always envied guys that can shave everyday lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but I hate shaving. It&#x27;s such a damn process for me as I would shave with the grain first then against to get the closest shave possible but due to my sensitive skin I would have to shave really slow. Shaving for me has always been a 20 minute ordeal, may not sound like much but since I&#x27;ve been doing this most of my adult life it&#x27;s gotten to the point where at times I won&#x27;t go out on a Saturday night because I&#x27;d rather not shave. Yea, that bad.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having tried my fathers Norelco many years ago I swore I would never use an electric shaver. That thing tore my face up! I mean talk about yanking hairs, I don&#x27;t know, maybe that shaver doubled as a lawnmower or something. What changed my perception of electric shavers was when a couple months back while I was getting my hair cut the barber used a Whal electric shaver on my face. There was no pain, burn feeling, cuts or major irritation so I decided I&#x27;ll start looking into quality shavers. I say quality because that Whal left so may hairs and the overall quality of the shave was not so good, I had to use a razor at home to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always liked the Braun brand and after reading/watching reviews on this model and well as other makes I decided to go with 790cc-4 because it&#x27;s what I preferred. The other brands do offer great shaves by all accounts but I&#x27;m of the opinion that one should get what they want if it&#x27;s within your means or else you&#x27;ll live with regret. I was going to either give this shaver a one star or 5 star rating because I think shavers should do what they are marketed to do. What&#x27;s the point of an electric shaver if you have to use a razor blade afterwards to clean up what&#x27;s left behind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial out of the box impressions- The build quality of this razor is really nice! The finish is also really nice though only time will tell how well the finish will hold up. The shaver feels real nice in my big hands; it&#x27;s not too heavy but not flimsy feeling either. Also, feels solid not like it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic.  The clean and renew station is NO WHERE near as huge as it looks online. For some reason I was under the impression that the clean and renew station was ginormous, It&#x27;s actually nice and compact. I absolutely love the fact that I can use the charger cord on the shaver itself and not be confined to using the base at all times or even having to travel with it. Bravo there Braun. The instruction manual is basic but covers everything well, I remember reading where someone said the manual was lacking. I completely disagree as I think its fine. And yes, I did actually read the manual lol.....I always read instruction manuals. The travel case is also a nice addition, looks high end and insures no incidental contact with the power button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving impressions- let me say that a reviewer on this Amazon reviews page says \\&quot;shaves as good as a razor\\&quot;. He&#x27;s dead on! This shaver shaves exactly like a razor blade and that was the most jaw dropping thing for me. There is zero pain, cuts or major irritation after I shave. I say no major irritation because there is some for me from the shaving process  but don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;m pressing real hard to achieve my shave, it&#x27;s an issue of skin sensitivity for me. Please be sure to follow the recommended shaving procedure in the manual, I didn&#x27;t at first but then remembered what is written in the manual and boy what a difference.  I am able to shave on back to back occasions or everyday if I want.......I feel like a normal man lol! On to the trimmer and I must say it works great. At first I thought it would be rather obtrusive given it&#x27;s location but trust me it&#x27;s fine where it is but could be improved, see \\&quot;suggestions\\&quot; on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions- I&#x27;m going to wrap this up in a \\&quot;pros\\&quot; and \\&quot;cons\\&quot; format but not before adding that the clean and renew station is absolutely great. I thought I was going to abandon it after my initial solution ran out but not anymore. It literally gets 99% of the hair out of the head while leaving the head oiled and with a nice lemon smell, please note that the lemon smell is not overwhelmingly powerful which is a good thing in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Shaves just like a blade, face is left ultra smooth.

    <li> I switched from the rotary Norelco shavers to Braun after comparing them and realizing that I got a better shave from the Braun style shavers. After the adjustment period all was great. However, after about 14 months of use the Series 7 Pulsonic shaver started making an extremely LOUD clacking noise. I used the cleaning system regularly and it was clean. What I&#x27;m saying here is I really took care of it. I tried replacing the blade unit, and no change. I should emphasize, it wasn&#x27;t just a loud sound -- it was clacking so much it vibrating against my face and wouldn&#x27;t get a close shave. Like holding a little AK-47 against your face and expecting goodness. This was a big investment, and between the shaver, the cleaning system, and the new blade certainly in the hundreds. I would expect such a shaver to last much longer. My Norelcos only needed replacing when the batteries wore out. I like the style of shaving with the Braun better, so I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do but I&#x27;m probably done with the Braun brand and their poor quality control.</li>
    <li> This thing is super expensive and one might think after all the expense that they wouldn&#x27;t have to shell out more money but leave it to Proctor &amp; Gamble- Braun&#x27;s Owner- to find ways to milk you for money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you have to buy the cleaning trays which last only a month and will run you about $60 per year.  Then you need a new shaving block after a year and a half which is another $50.  And after shelling out all this money you will have a shaver that takes twice as long as a manual and will never shave as close or as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. Very smooth on the face. Gives a close shave. Very satisfied with this razor</li>
    <li> Great product, have had three different types of braun shavers over the last 10 years and by far this is the best; three different shaving modes for smooth comfort and a really close shave;, my sensitive skin cannot use standard razors, and after trying several competitor brands before stumbling upon the braun products.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago.  I read all the reviews on it and it appeared the automatic cleaner had some issues with it.  I will have to admit the cleaner has not been a problem with me so far.  I only clean the shaver about twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is the closest I have received with an electric shaver.  I had a Norelco, but it does not compare to Braun.  The shave is so close that I might be able to go two days without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anybody who wants a closer shave.  It is more expensive than most of the others, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been a blade shaver 99% of my adult years. Through the years I have purchased different electric razors with no real satisfaction. I am truly happpy with my new Braun 790. It has taken a couple of weeks to get used to the electric -vs- the blade. I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I really like the shave I get from this razor.  I&#x27;d recommend this one to anyone needing a new razor.</li>
    <li> It turned out to be a sad day when my Series 5 shaver broke...  I had had good luck with Braun on two previous models, so I decided to upgrade to the latest-and-greatest (and expensive) Series 7.  Bad move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all the talk of an improved design and buzz words like \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot;, it shaves about as well as the Series 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem for me is its use of the Clean and Renew cartridges... the old Series 5 would behave like this:&lt;br /&gt;* day 1 after my shave:  \\&quot;economy cleaning\\&quot; required.&lt;br /&gt;* if I didn&#x27;t press the clean button, then day 2, \\&quot;normal cleaning\\&quot; would be required.  Generally, to save on cleaning fluid, I&#x27;d clean it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;* Then, about once every two weeks, it would recommend \\&quot;intensive cleaning\\&quot;.  Fine.  Seems reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 7, on the other hand, worked like this for me:&lt;br /&gt;* day 1, \\&quot;economy cleaning\\&quot; required.  Fine, just like before.&lt;br /&gt;* day 2, \\&quot;INTENSIVE cleaning\\&quot; required already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer support (and the representative did NOT tell me that, since it was within 60 days, I could have gotten a replacement shaver), and instead they had me send it to a service center...  Like is typical these days, I was required to pay the postage, and it was recommended I insure the delivery.  Fine... my shaver just got $10 more expensive.  A couple weeks later, the technician called me, suggesting I won&#x27;t be too happy.. I wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They replaced the computer board in the thing, and now it does this:&lt;br /&gt;* day 1, \\&quot;NORMAL cleaning\\&quot; required (up from the previous \\&quot;economy\\&quot;, so I don&#x27;t even have a chance to use less fluid.&lt;br /&gt;* day 2, \\&quot;Intensive cleaning\\&quot; required again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another call to customer service, and all they could suggest is I try a different service center.  However, since they replaced the entire electronics in the thing, I don&#x27;t expect that to do much good, plus I&#x27;m not interested in spending more for postage to be without a shaver for weeks.  I was (foolishly) hoping they&#x27;d admit to the design error, and send me an upgrade, but no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, my personal suspicion is that this isn&#x27;t just a mistake with my shaver, and the replacement electronics that went into it at the service center... I think it was DESIGNED to use LOTS of cleaning fluid.. why not?  Guaranteed regular income for Braun!  It&#x27;s a shame.  If you have the older models of this shaver, I recommend keeping them!oolishly) hoping they&#x27;d admit to the design error, and send me an upgrade, but no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, my personal suspicion is that this isn&#x27;t just a mistake with my shaver, and the replacement electronics that went into it at the service center...

    <li> The Braun 790cc is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  My old panasonic finally died, and it was time for something new.  I shopped around, read reviews, looked for the best deal, etc.  I was scared of the price tag for this one, and I still think it&#x27;s a bit steep; but I talked my self into giving it a try.  All the reviews are true.  The shave is always close, the battery lasts a long time if I go on trips, and I don&#x27;t worry if I run out of cleaning fluid because I can always run it under a faucet too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think buying the cleaning fluid is still cheaper than buying blades for a regular razor, but I don&#x27;t know how good it is for the environment-- it&#x27;s a cartridge of alcohol that can be closed up and put in the trash...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a little extra cash, this is definiely the best razor on the market--for the past year anyway.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Amazon a Series 7 Braun ...........they sent me a Series 5 Braun - not what I paid for - not what I ordered...............unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I have an unfortunate combination of sensitive skin, a coarse fast-growing beard and very much prone to ingrown hairs. Moved away from blade shaving on the recommendation from my dermatologist where she said for my condition an electric shaver might help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quest started a year ago trying various shavers. I initially was drawn to the rotary types but they irritated my skin so much and produced mediocre shaves that I switched to foil shavers and really saw an immediate positive change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried each of the following for a minimum of 8 weeks before deciding (Braun 790cc-4, Braun Series 5 570, Panasonic Arc IV ES8249S and the Remington F5 5790) and the one that worked best for me was the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 790 just felt superb in the hand, build quality was top notch - no flex or give at all, the weight is perfect and the handle feels very secure. The display on the base of the shaver is unobtrusive, no bright LEDs or anything that is attention seeking, just providing the right amount of information about battery and how clean the head is. The foils float a fair bit beyond the head assembly so nothing makes contact with your face but the foils, and the foils just glide really easily across a dry face, unlike other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very effective and I found the curvature of the trimmer helps to get the occasional missed hear, even tiny stubble that the shaver missed on my neck. The three intensity settings are there however I never really found a substantial difference in performance between the three settings so I typically use the most intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The internal battery is a Li-Ion type so there&#x27;s never a need to fully discharge or any maintenance of the sort, there&#x27;s also no battery memory issues of course. The battery charges in under an hour and gives 50 minutes of use. The power cable can be plugged directly into the shaver for plugged-in shaving, for those times when the battery is completely flat. This was important to me as most other shavers I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t allow for plugged-in shaving (possibly due to them being wet/dry shavers?), which meant once the battery was done, so was the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Clean and Renew system. It&#x27;s an essential item for this shaver, especially since the Series 7 cutting block and foils are a single unit that cannot be taken apart for a thorough cleaning. You can however release the shaving head unit off the shaver to clean underneath the cutting block but with the Clean and Renew system none of that is necessary. It cleans the shaver thoroughly, lubricates it and dries it in about 30 minutes. The process is a little loud but not uncomfortably so. To top it off, the shaver smells great every time. There&#x27;s also a fast clean button on the base for a 25-second cleaning for when you&#x27;re really rushed but you&#x27;ll need to wipe the fluid off the unit after as it doesn&#x27;t dry the shaver. I can&#x27;t see myself ever using the fast clean but it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all is the shave performance. This is where in my opinion the 790cc really blew away the other shavers I tried. Not only did it give the closest shave of all of them, it was also by far the most comfortable shave. There was never any irritation and the head remained cool throughout the shave. The pulsoic action, while very gimmicky sounding, seems effective in getting the trouble hairs to get cut, those hairs that are near impossible to shave due to them being flat laying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about wet/dry shaving; the Braun is strictly a dry shaver so it cannot be used with shaving creams or gels and cannot be used in the shower. The head can be rinsed under running tap water, that&#x27;s as far as its wet-use properties go. And in my opinion it&#x27;s a good thing. While most shaver makers are rushing to make the best wet/dry shaver, Braun seems intent on focusing to make the best dry-use-only shaver and in this regard I think they&#x27;ve succeeded. Personally, one of the perks ofusing an electric shaver was that I no longer needed my shaving creams, lotions and brushes and the whole shaving process as a result became much quicker (cutting my shaving time in at least half) and a lot less messy. But for those looking for a wet shaver then obviously this shaver isn&#x27;t for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s really not much to add here. This is a superb shaver that I think will work for many people. Shavers are very personal, what works for one person will not necessarily work for another. But having this shaver out-perform all the others on my less-than-ideal skin/beard combination really impressed me and I think it&#x27;s at least worth a try for those considering the jump to electric shaving.using an electric shaver was that I no longer needed my shaving creams, lotions and brushes and the whole shaving process as a result became much quicker (cutting my shaving time in at least half) and a lot less messy.

    <li> Quit getting Razor burn. This is the best razor. Hands down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with one of the Braun self-cleaning predecessors of this shaver for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the shaving head on that old model recently but it just didn&#x27;t work well, it would cut me around the jawline (a problem written about by others in the blogs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this current model even though I was annoyed that the reason for doing so was that the new shaver head on the old model didn&#x27;t seem to be up to standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this model is SO MUCH better even than the prior model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves quickly effectively and painlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the upgrade!</li>
    <li> My Braun Shaver gives a smooth and comfortable shave. I like the fact that it cleans and sterilizes easily. This is my 3rd Braun Shaver and I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> i like it, very nice and perfect</li>
    <li> Meh...I traded up after the holidays, after using cheaper norelco&#x27;s for the last several years. So far the razor is nice, feels heavy duty and is easy to use. I like the cleaner system. I am not too convinced the shave is better than cheaper models, because I believe there is always a shave honeymoon period from fresh razors. I am surprised that the cartridges are cheaper than the less expensive models -- so I guess the prices work out in the end.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd generation off Braun electric razors I have used. I recently switched from the 8000 \\&quot;activator\\&quot; series and wondered if it was worth the money to upgrade to this razor-let me just say that it was worth every penny as this razor is far and away the best electric razor I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a smooth, comfortable shave every time I use it. No nicks, cuts, or anything of the sort. It has 3 modes to cut your face (I use normal during the week and strong on the weekend) and both modes work great. The clean and charge works great as it always has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about upgrading from an older Braun razor or are looking for a new electric razor this one is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have always owned Brauns .I had one that I thought was the best a 8585 for about 20 year.but this 7 series is my new best .I have not found a better price  .and free shipping this is a no brainer .get one from amazon .sorry I forgot to say how good it works.if you never used a electric .give it a couple days.but if you have a electric .the shave is ..you guessed it the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years and had trusted the brand until I purchased this shaver.  I usually shave while I drive on my way to work, and this shaver apparently doesn&#x27;t do well with sitting in the car when its cold outside.  Basically it stops after running for one or two seconds and will not start again until plugged in, but once you plug it in it would run fine.  It seems something with the new technology actually causes the shaver to behave like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was perhaps a defect, but the same thing is happening with a second unit.  When contacting Braun, I explained the problem and didn&#x27;t receive a great response in terms of acknowledging a known issue or any guarantee that a repair would solve the issue.  Consequently, the shaver will be returned.  Warning to anyone who keeps this shaver in their car and lives in a cooler climate - that it won&#x27;t run after a cold night.  New certainly isn&#x27;t better - in fact its a step backwards.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend likes this product so much when he saw it in the store at the first time. he told me it&#x27;s great, ease of use and looks cool.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Braun Series 7 shaver that has lasted me over 7 years with little to no maintenance.  I thought it was time to replace it with a newer version since the old one I have is on its last legs.  I initially balked at the price which I could buy smart car for but decided that if this shaver lasts half as long as my previous Bruan it&#x27;ll be worth it.  It shaves great, I love the cleaning unit, and if its as durable as the one I&#x27;m replacing it with I&#x27;m going to loving this shaver for a long time.</li>
    <li> I wish I had put down my old electric shaver earlier.  A friend recommended this product to me and I have used it for the last thirty days.  It&#x27;s the best Christmas gift I have ever given myself...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift,it was a hit</li>
    <li> everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Used other electric shavers over the years,this one takes the cake by far!Pleasure to shave with,very close and smooth results.Also a breeze to clean,just place it in cleaning charger and press button.Wish i had this years ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers in the past, but not steadily. In fact, I was using an older version Braun as a means to get a quick \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; when I didn&#x27;t have time for my blade shave ceremony which might include a British badger brush, etc. My experience was that to get a \\&quot;real\\&quot; shave you just had to do it with the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent physical condition required me to sign up for blood thinners for at least 6 months and I was finding that a nick became a serious problem so I decided to see if any advances had been made with the electric shaver industry. After checking around I decided on the Braun 790 as a good possibility and bought it here on Amazon (on a day where I was offered a bonus certificate with purchase so actually paid less than the usual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an eye opener to me. There are so many wonderful improvements of the model I had used from the early 2000&#x27;s to about 3 years ago that I find myself actually looking forward to using it. Bottom line, the shave, even in the neck area, is superb. Even several hours after shaving my skin feels razor smooth. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s a beautifully designed, highly ergonomic device. It feels fantastic in the hand and is very precise in it&#x27;s movements . . .very easy to control. I particularly like that there are 3 settings for closeness, but in fact just use the closest one. I also like the head lock button which is super easy to touch and enables the head to be precisely navigated to any small, particular area such as directly between the upper lip and the nose and the chin. It&#x27;s in a perfect place to activate and deactivate in less than a second but not by accident. Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll say again that I also love the way the shaver feels in my hand. It is a perfect fit, extremely accurate to place when moving, and just \\&quot;feels\\&quot; right. I used the word \\&quot;sensuous\\&quot; in my title and I think that bast describes what I&#x27;m trying to communicate here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, I would say that when I first used it (I had been doing just blade shaves for the past few years) the results weren&#x27;t so wonderful, I was experimenting and I had to work the shave for a while to get results. But after the second or third time it seemed that a amiracle had occurred. I guess my face got accustomed to it because with no apparent effort and much less time, I found a smooth, blade quality shave. And it only gets better. On my face, moving the Braun vertically back and forth seems to be do a better job than circular motions. But I guess that might have to do with the direction of your beard growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is well designed as well and does a lovely job. The battery seems to last forever and the LCD on the bottom of the 790 gives two bar readings: power and hygiene. I usually wait until the hygiene bars are down to one before doing a cleaning. The battery bars hardly move at all before that will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is not a very technical review. But for people who are just interested in a machine that is a pleasure to use and does the best job I have received from such devices, and even as good as my blade shave, by far, this has got be right at the top of the list. It&#x27;s hard to imagine otherwise.it (I had been doing just blade shaves for the past few years) the results weren&#x27;t so wonderful, I was experimenting and I had to work the shave for a while to get results.

    <li> Nothing special about this shaver. Still prefer blade for better faster shave.</li>
    <li> A series 5 Braun was my first electric razor (8985 I believe...) that I used for several years.  As it was my first I didn&#x27;t have any experience to compare it to.  It did the job and I liked the cleaning system that provided a fresh smelling, and clean razor for each shave.  After going through several replacement foils and blades I decided it was time to buy a new razor and went with the Panny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES-LA93-K&lt;br /&gt;I must say the first time I used it I was completely floored by how much better/easier it was than the my old Braun.  My shaving time was dramatically reduced and I was getting a closer shave as well.  For me, my neck is the hardest place to get a very close shave.  The Panasonic shaved my neck much closer and with less passes than the Braun before it.  I was a Panasonic convert... until a month later.  The cleaning system, which I was not impressed with from the start, completely stopped working.  Some googling revealed this was a very common issue on this model.  Since this was a wet/dry model, I thought I could get by just removing the foil and rinsing both the foil and blades under the sink.  However this was not the case.  A year and a half later I was fed up with shaving with a stinky razor every morning.  Hoping Braun had engineered a closer shaver I purchased the 790cc to replace the very good, but very stinky Panasonic ES-LA93-K.  Final verdict: excellent shaver, terrible cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun 790cc&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, not in the same league as the ES-LA93-K in terms of closeness.  From the very first shave I could tell a dramatic difference.  It takes a lot longer with a lot more pressure and skin pulling to even come close the the shave I got with the Panasonic.  Thinking about the series 5 Braun and this one, I can&#x27;t really tell any difference as far as improvements to the shaving experience.  Final verdict: good shaver, excellent cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine I&#x27;ll stick with the 790cc for quite some time as it is a good (just not great) shaver and I truly appreciate the cleaning system.  If you are not lazy like me and don&#x27;t mind manually cleaning your razor, I&#x27;d recommend the Panasonic over Braun in a heartbeat.good (just not great) shaver and I truly appreciate the cleaning system.  If you are not lazy like me and don&#x27;t mind manually cleaning your razor, I&#x27;d recommend the Panasonic over Braun in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> overpriced. a cheaper shaver would provide same results. not impressed.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;ve used rotary Norelco shavers for years and decided to give this type of shaver a try.  I like the cleaner/charger idea.  Cleaner does tend to be kind of loud when it&#x27;s in operation but once I realized the head was being cleaned and not the razor had turned on in the holder, it&#x27;s fine.  Shave is as close if not closer than my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in November 2011 and still think it is great. I have used several different electric shavers in the past and gotten frustrated because they would not do the job so I went back to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of friends of mine said they had a Braun shaver (different models) and they said they loved it. So I decided to spend a little extra money and buy the Series 7 - 790cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was simply amazed. It fits in my hand great. It gives a close shave. Almost as close as a razor.I should have bought one the first time and saved a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: Is buying the cleaning solution. Although it is not outrageous, it is still high priced. Otherwise, I would have given five stars.</li>
    <li> Great shaver only had 3 weeks but very very satisfied with it. long battery life self cleaning mode is wonderful dont have to worry about running shaver under running water to clean.</li>
    <li> The shaver performs great  It is about as ggod as a conventional razor.  This model is a good bit better than my previous Braun series 8000.  Very happy with it.  Hope it lasts 5 years or more like the previous.  Very fast shipping from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced my previous Braun shaver of 7 years. It is pricey, but it gives a super close shave, and makes big improvements in overall shave quality and comfort. I am getting the closest, most uniform shave ever with an electric shaver - with little effort. The self cleaning unit so far seems to work well too and is a convenience. Very much recommend.</li>
    <li> During my life (I am 67) I use quite a  few shavers of most different brands, including Brauns. But  with this purchase  I am convinced that I own about the best shaver  there is in the market. No more hard rubbing or circling a shaver over the face. It literally glides giving you a  fantastic shave. The cleaning attachment is a great addition to the  Braun series 7.</li>
    <li> it appears to give a much smoother shave than the ~10 year old Braun series 5 that this one replaces due to the airline playing rough with my luggage and the plastic pieces being cracked off of the bottom of the old one.  the various charge and clean stages can be confusing and the fact that the need for cleaning seems to be based on some internal timer rather than a real cleanliness factor means that it needs a clean about every 4 or 5 days.  Also, I have not cleaned it under water yet.  That will probably not reset the cleaning timer.  This unit was pricy, but it&#x27;s features make it worth the difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/7/2012 - shave is very close and I am now used to this device that I would give it 5 stars now.&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/29/2013 - Really like this shaver now.  Don&#x27;t like the old one any more.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He can grow a beard over night so he uses it often and really likes it. His face is always smooth without cuts or scrapes. He likes the close cut without the pulling of the hairs. The self cleaning feature is pretty nice too.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my son and have heard nothing but praise for it. It shaves very nicely, with no missed spots or hard to reach areas. He uses it every day with no irritation. It charges easily and travels well.</li>
    <li> Well, I really want it,</li>
    <li> Excellent cut and clean</li>
    <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s now two years old and going strong.</li>
    <li> For me works much better than Phillips Norelco machine , there is no more burning sensation after shaving and no more rush . Charging station is very nice addition to maintain machine charged and clean .</li>
    <li> This will be my last Braun product, as I have yet to own a Braun shaver that has made it to the 1 year mark still functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured spending close to 200.00 this go-round would land me a quality product that would last - Yet here I am, just 2 months in when the Braun has started to vibrate wildly and make funny sounds when I use it. I&#x27;ve had it with Braun. My last 3 shavers were Braun, and each one has malfunctioned at some point during the first 6 - 9 months to the point I&#x27;ve had to purchase a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Braun seems incapable of putting out a product that lasts, I&#x27;ll now be buying from the competition... Do yourself a favor and spend your money with a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> In the words of Peter Griffin (Family Guy). This is &amp;#34;fricken sweet&amp;#34;. I had a problem with the power cord on the first one I bought, however Amazon was awesome and sent me a whole new unit with almost no questions asked. This unit charges fast, the cleaning station does an excellent job, and the shave is smooth and quick. A great deal at $150 on Black Friday 2014!</li>
    <li> Definitely the best shaver I have ever tried</li>
    <li> This works great.  I had a 8985 that I really liked but was blown away by how much better this one is!</li>
    <li> I am totally happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The razor works very well- even better than the earlier version it replaced.</li>
    <li> I Love it, do not understand how to order more cleaning liquid, but the shaver is the greatest. Thank You.</li>
    <li> This was a horrible razer caused me razor burn and ingrowns. It also lead to scaring. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Took some time to get used to all the new features.  Husband happy now.  It takes up some room on the counter but worth it.</li>
    <li> but dont return my 40$ coupon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric shavers for the past seven years.  I tried the Braun Series 3 for the past year and was disappointed in it&#x27;s performance.  One of my fellow workers told me that he loved his Series 7, but I was not really willing to pay the $250 price of the series 7.  I finally ordered a Series 7 from Amazon and must say I truly love the razor.  It is fast and gives a great, close shave.  And it is just as close as a blade.  In the past it took around 20 minutes for me to get a close shave, now with the Series 7 - I&#x27;m finished in 10 minutes.  I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> A great shaver at a good price.</li>
    <li> For 5 years I have been shaving with the Braun 8595. It was a great razor. It still worked great when it passed 2000 shaves. The razor just started to show signs of wear so it was time to replace it. I knew I wanted to stay with Braun because of the great quality. As soon as I tried the 790 I knew it was the best shave ever. I have never had a razor that cut so close. I find it cuts closer than a blade with no pain at all. I have a thick beard and it has no problem with that. This is the best razor ever!</li>
    <li> good product,good price!! thanx</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Deserves top rating by &amp;#34;leading consumer magazine.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is so cool! I just got an PSN card code for FREE! :D freepsncodes .cc</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this given the reviews. However, I feel like the shaver is just \\&quot;meh\\&quot; at best. My point of reference is a 15 year old Grundig Roltronic 8835. The Grundig has better built quality, shaves closer with less irritation, is much less noisy and easier to clean. The Braun cleaning base (Made in China?) is OK, but expensive since regular cleaning will add $60+ to annual cost. The worst part is that you are basically forced to use it since it is virtually impossible to fully clean the blades with a brush given the enclosed head. Shaving takes a looong time with the 7-series, I spent upwards of 8 minutes each morning, nearly twice as long as with my old shaver. The \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; feature appear to be more of a gimmick than actually improving the shave. The micro vibrations also seemed to irritate my skin more, as well giving me a headache. Lastly, I am disappointed in the display. The Braun&#x27;s battery indicator is no more advanced than my Grundig from the 90s (!) I know the higher end Panasonics show the time elapsed of each shave, etc, but the Braun has just a basic bar display of battery usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the Braun does provide a decent shave (if you spend enough time) and the unit feels comfortable in the hand. The travel case and charger are good quality. But for a shaver in this price class, I expected much, much more.</li>
    <li> never owned an electric razor until my bestfriend recommeneded this one...after seeing 4 fusion cartridges are now $15.00...i thought enough of my money to those razor companies....bought this from amazon....the best shave ever and no nicks or cuts!!!especially caused by those cheap ones....the cleaning system is amazing..read the manual to know what all the lights indicate...i don&#x27;t have a thick beard like my best friend does...but irregular patches....wow, i am sold...actually look forward to shaving in the morning... this is a marvel of german engineering!!! check it out!!!</li>
    <li> This razor is a pretty good shaver. I had higher hopes for a closer shave. Guess the face has to get used to it because of the irritation factor. It will do but not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my husband on Fatherday. He uses it every day.he very like it and love it so much. It worked easier,and felt so smooth on his face. All the things that make me happy  and that good five star.</li>
    <li> Is it worth the 260 I paid...?  hmmm... iffy.  I had the Braun 7680 given to me as a gift and it was awesome - but it was time for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* DEFINITELY a VERY smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;* 3 personal settings for light/medium/heavy (I&#x27;m no gorilla, but heavy works really great)&lt;br /&gt;* Great cleaning system - appears better than the earlier models (my first broke after a few months - tiny plastic cog fell out)&lt;br /&gt;* Always like the smell of the blade after cleaning: good &#x27;n clean &#x27;n fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Not as heavy a feel as earlier version:  lighter and more \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;* Angle lock is seperate switch on movable head - 7680 had everything in 1 sliding switch Off/On/Lock/Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questionables:&lt;br /&gt;? THAT much better than previous model?&lt;br /&gt;? Price</li>
    <li> This is with out a doubt the best electric razor I have ever owned. My wife was always complaining about my stubby appearance. No more complaints. Pricy but worth it.</li>
    <li> EDIT::::&lt;br /&gt;Still love this.  6 years!!!  I have a light beard but get great shaves. Have replaced the foils/cutters twice in 6 years for the heck of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original 2010 review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a top of the line Braun 8000 series (8595) for about 6+ years.  It just started to fail recently - I didn&#x27;t feel like trying another replacement foil/blade and after over 2,000 shaves - I guess it&#x27;s hard to complain.  If this new one lasts the same duration, then it will be well worth the money for just over $0.12 per day plus consumables (cleaning solution &amp; replacement foils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened this new shaver this morning (790-CC4), charged it, and started using it.  I like the variable setting (3-steps) for mild to intense.  I like the feel of it and although the display is less sophisticated than my old one, this one might be more practical in usage.  It has a Li-Ion battery and so is a bit lighter, and seems well-constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test is the shave - and this is the best result I&#x27;ve ever had from shaving with an electric.  On rare occasions I&#x27;ll use a blade for a special occasion and a blade is usually much closer than most electrics - but I&#x27;ve been okay with a slight sacrifice using an electric in the past.  My face right now feels so shockingly smooth, I&#x27;d swear I shaved with a blade this morning...  So the proof is in the pudding - and I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this shaver if you&#x27;re partial to electrics.</li>
    <li> The previous version, 790CC was $180-$190 at Amazon until it was sold out and this new one (790CC-4) is currently $269.99. That is a $80 - $90 premium (or 42% - 50% more expensive)...&lt;br /&gt;Trivial fact, the MSRP of the regular 790CC was also $269.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only differences I can see are:&lt;br /&gt;1) Different color scheme (black/silver)&lt;br /&gt;2) Variable settings (called personalization modes)&lt;br /&gt;3) New foil (OptiFoil)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even tell if it is a new foil since the replacement head cassette part for the 790CC-4 (also known as type: 5692) is the 70S. The regular 790CC (type 5671) also uses the 70S...&lt;br /&gt;By the way the part number for the 70S is 65671768.&lt;br /&gt;My sources are the use/instruction manual for the 790CC-4 states 70S and the Braun Canada service website for the 790CC-4 also states 70S.&lt;br /&gt;Just a fyi, you cannot find the 790CC-4 on the Braun US website since they have not updated it yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So right now it seems like there are only two differences between the 790CC-4 and 790CC, but here is a curve ball:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun global website (or any Braun website with the 790CC-4) shows there is a difference between the OptiFoil and Smart Foil:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However (yes there is more), the Amazon Germany website shows the Braun 70S as having the OptiFoil technology... The thing is the Amazon Germany Braun 70S product page was created on January 1, 2007. I guess they can update the product page anytime they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be that the Braun 70S will eventually get an update with the OptiFoil or is OptiFoil the same thing as the Smart Foil?&lt;br /&gt;Regardless I am putting my money on a negligible difference between OptiFoil and Smart Foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless there is something else I am missing, $80-$90 is quite a bit more for what you get (only two or *maybe* three differences!). One of them being a simple change in colors...&lt;br /&gt;They did not even improve the trimmer!</li>
    <li> I find the Braun Series 7 shaves better and is even easier to handle than my 8000 series Braun. I really liked my 8000 Braun and now like the Braun Series 7 even better.  It shaves even closer and holds the whisker dust in the shaver head better.  The recharger/cleaner is louder than the 8000 cleaner/recharger but works very well.  Over all - very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It is significantly quieter but the shave doesn&#x27;t seem any better than my old Braun which means the shave is still pretty good.</li>
    <li> the product is very good  l  love it ,the  price is  nice~~ sometime i looking forword to  buy  some  interest things~</li>
    <li> i thought the  liquid that the razor is placed in after shaving  somehow cleaned the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not.  Motor started sounding funny.  The head is not  real easy to remove and&lt;br /&gt;cleaning the head requires  using  a brush  which did not come with the  razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used an old soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d r wyatt</li>
    <li> shaves as close as a blade. Self-cleaning seems to work well...</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun since I was a teenager and have since had about 4 generations of Braun shavers.  About a year ago I bought one of the newer but less expensive model Braun shavers (a series 3) for my son but was not very impressed as it did not look very much different to the last generations of Braun&#x27;s, but as they say \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.  By chance my Braun 8000 Activator series broke and immediately bought my self the top of the line 7-790cc.  My gosh, this is an incredible machine!  If you could imagine that the best shave would be by blade, and take out the rash that you&#x27;ll get afterward, this is the best way I can explain it.  I have been shaving about a month with the 7 series and the head and the blade system is just an engineering marvel on its own, unlike the previous systems that had minor revisions from one generation to another.  I am a mechanical engineer and I can tell you that you will appreciate the materials used in this shaver.  The motor is strong and quieter than the previous system.  I have medium to coarse hairs and have to shave every morning.  I leave a mustache and this machine is something I can trust without even looking at the mirror and I don&#x27;t have top run my finger up and down my face to see if I missed any hairs.  It shaves quicker and much better than my previous unit, even if you consider that I change foils on a regular basis.  You will appreciate the quality of the cut of this new shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been so far pleasantly pleased with my Braun Series 7 razor. My older series was on its last leg and was beginning to pull more whiskers than cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is so much smoother than I ever remember my old Braun.</li>
    <li> I have had the razor for about six weeks. It is so much better than my Braun 5XXX series. Much more quiet, closer shave. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s razor was about 3 years old.  It had some issues but my husband didn&#x27;t want to spend \\&quot;that much money\\&quot; on a razor - we originally saw it in a store.  I called a friend who has this razor and asked him how he liked it.  He said it was \\&quot;good\\&quot; so I decided to buy it online for my man.  Once it showed up, he was excited to \\&quot;give it a run over his face\\&quot;.  The sanitary smell of the razor is so nice compared to the old razor.  He said he liked it after the first shave but now after 2 weeks he says he loves it!  It does take a while for the beard to get used to a new razor.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great electric shaver.  Tough beard and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> best shaver ever had!!</li>
    <li> One of the worst shaving kit I ever had. If you have more hair, this is time consuming and also it hurts while shaving.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver system YESTERDAY. Charged it up, used it, and WOW what a phenomenal shave!  Very very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2, nothing works. The Cleaner &amp; Renewal system did nothing, didn&#x27;t even report the fluid level.  Would not clean. Would not report on the inserted shaver.  So as an experiment I let the charge on the shaver run down, and plugging tly into he power cord does not charge OR run the shaver! So I have nothing that works now. Day Two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking around on places other than Amazon and I found LOTS of reviews of mechanical problems with this product. Don&#x27;t trust these reviews, something&#x27;s amiss; reviews here are so positive, looking around you will get another opinion.  I am investing $15 for a power cord hoping that is the problem, as Braun only does a money back which takes 60 days or a repair center which is 2 hours from my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Really great shave - the ONE time it worked. Beware...</li>
    <li> I have used many different kinds of shavers, electric and others.  this shaver is the best I have used, and I would recomend it very highly</li>
    <li> Has gotten a lot of use over the last few years and still works great!</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a little over a month and am very satisfied with its results. You do need to use it for several weeks before you see those good results though. I think that the fact it cleans itself daily has a lot to do with the positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the three levels of shave very useful. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like having the LED read-out on the bottom to keep me posted on battery level and how dirty the razor has become. Although I haven&#x27;t done it yet, I think this will come in very handy when I travel without the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain, it would be about the base. It&#x27;s made of simple plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as sturdy as the razor. The cleaning process is VERY LOUD. However, the loud part only lasts about 5 minutes. For such a sturdy and well made razor, you would think the base would be more substantial. It works though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping in mind that it&#x27;s difficult to get a shave as close as you can with a regular razor blade, I have no regrets with this purchase. If you want electric, this is the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (5/2/2012) - It&#x27;s still running strong. I replaced the blade cartridge a few weeks ago. No major complaints. I use it three times/week and use the OEM cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of different electric shavers over the years. I&#x27;ve tried Norelco , Remington but the Braun has worked the best. It shave quickly and does not irritate my face at all. The self cleaning works great and it always ready to use.</li>
    <li> For the last 50 years or so (oops, I just dated myself) I&#x27;ve used the latest and greatest blade razors because no electronic shaver I tried could handle my heavy beard.  I get incredibly smooth shaves with my current razor, but shaving with it is literally a pain.  If I shave leaning over a sink by the time I&#x27;m finished I need a strong pain-killer for my very bad back.  Even standing in the shower using a shower mirror hurts, and I don&#x27;t always want to shower when I need to shave.  The result of all this is that I had started going two or even three days between shaves and was looking pretty scruffy.  So I decided to try an electric shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research it seemed that the Braun Series 7 was probably the best choice for me so, after choking a bit on the price, I placed my Amazon order.  And am I pleased that I did!  The combination of Braun quality, which has always been superb, and advances in their design and technology since the last time I tried an electronic shaver (probably 10+ years ago) has produced an amazing shaver. The first shave out of the box (after charging) was totally comfortable and extremely smooth and close.  Not quite equal to my blade razor, but darn close.  At the end of the day, no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun, like all electric shaver manufacturers, says that you need to use your new shaver for a month or two before your skin becomes accustomed to it.  I&#x27;ve used my 7 Series for about 10 days now and I&#x27;ve gotten consistently excellent shaves and absolutely no skin irritation.  I&#x27;m very pleased already but if the shaves get better over the next few weeks, all I&#x27;ll be able to say is \\&quot;wow!\\&quot;.  And since Braun recommends that you shave with a dry face, I can shave any time without the whole blade production of wetting your face, applying shaving cream, shaving, in my case repeating all this against the grain, rinsing, and finally applying skin moistener.  Which means no painful back from leaning over a sink or no need to take a shower.  And the whole process of shaving with the Braun takes less than half the time of a razor shave.  The result of all this is that I am a very happy camper, shaving every day and getting great shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should briefly mention Braun&#x27;s charging and cleaning system - it is fabulous.  While you can charge with a cord and clean the shaver under running water (very useful when traveling), I highly recommend using Braun&#x27;s charger/cleaner every day.  It does a fantastic job, results in better shaves, and should prolong the useful life of the shaver before you have to change the blade cartridge.to take a shower.

    <li> After having many electric shavers, this is worth the money.  It&#x27;s the first shaver that doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs and leaves a smooth finish without you having to grind it into your skin.  It will even shave a beard off without pulling on any hairs.</li>
    <li> I have a skin problem and my doctor recommended an electric razor.  The first ones I bought were the standard heavily advertised types.  I changed the rotors after a while thinking the blades went dull.  Bought a few other electrics because I had gone back to wet shaving but the doctor said give it up.  I started looking again and got frustrated because they only seemed to work for a little while and then appeared to not work very well after a while.  They also irrited my skin more than the wet shaves.  At least I thought so.  Went on the internet and found this.  I gave up the ghost and bought the top of the line. That&#x27;s over twice as much of what I paid for the most expensive electric I had purchased so far.  My skin is not irritated anymore from shaving, I don&#x27;t use a powder or alcohol prior to shaving as I get no razor burn or chaffing with this. After almost a year it still gives me a good shave. The cleaning system works well.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I recently got the 790cc.  I have been a Braun user for 10yrs.  It was time for a new shaver and I thought why not go all out and by the top of the line.  Of, coarse there is always a bit of a worry when doing this because of the cost.  The pivoting heads, the cleaning base and the amazing shave all add up to a complete package.  The only problem I have is the cost of the cleaning solution packs, but Amazon helps with that so for around $60 I got a year supply, about the cost a a years worth of shaving cream.  All, I can say is if you on the fence and your a little worried about the 2-3 negative reviews were all the rest are extremely positive, forget about them.  I have worked retail for many years and what I found out is there is always that small percentage who will trash a product regardless of how good it is.  I think it makes them feel more intelligent to be the only one who can point out all the wrongness of a product that the rest of us are to stupid to see lol.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaver I have ever owned, and I am hoping it last for many years.</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and have found the Braun 700 shaving system very comfortable and provides a close shave, even better than a blade. Over the years, I have tried EVERY type razor, including a blade, rotary electric, wet/dry Panosonic, Eltron, Remmington, and several others which I now forget. The Braun 700 model is the only model that provides a cleaning system that does what it says it will. When I use the cleaning system provided after each shave, I can look foward to a new, clean and germ free shaving experience each time I shave. Since starting to use my 500, then 700 series model, my chin has not broken out; what an improvement.My neck is free from stubble. New users need to learn to stretch their neck skin while shaving the neck area. Once you get the hang of it, you will never change razors; but might buy a newer model</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m using thsi shaver more then year (using 3 times per week) and have to say it still shaves close as it was new. Exceptional quality and build is guaranteed. Meets my expectations 100%.</li>
    <li> After having not seen my face for 20 years (and my daughter never having seen me unshaven), and having the grey in my beard the only grey, I decided to \\&quot;go bare\\&quot; a couple of months ago. When I last shaved in my 40s, I had the typical problem with ingrown hair, and was a little worried that problem would still be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after shaving for a couple of months, i can say that the shaver is well worthy of its common excellent regard. It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, gets the small curves, is almost as exacting and maneuverable as a regular blade razor. I find the trimmer useful for grabbing those few hair that lie flat against the skin and trimming them closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some discoveries I&#x27;ve made about minimizing ingrown hairs are: 1) by not pressing, but letting the razor travel very lightly over my face, with multiple strokes, and 2) using neosporin (white) cream as my \\&quot;aftershave,\\&quot; I get almost no ingrown hair, and when I do, they don&#x27;t flare into acne-like eruptions. Use the water-based neosporin cream not the oily regular stuff.</li>
    <li> I searched retail and on line stores. Found Amazon had the lowest price with free shipping and no sales tax. Saved at least $60 dollars by using Amazon. Fast response and shipment and excellent produce. Could not be happier with my purchase and the quality of the Braun razon.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my husband during valentine and after a few weeks of using it he loved it!  He used Remington electronic shaver brought for $40 bucks at wal-mart but of course that didn&#x27;t work too well.  I thought by buying this with it&#x27;s quality and price it&#x27;ll make a difference on him and it definitely did.  He has thick hair (not curly, but some laying flat) and this shaver has help him a lot.  It is true it does give a close shave.  I was actually quite surprise by how close it could shave (and I&#x27;m not exaggerating)!  Before I brought it I was a little worry because of all the reviews, but it really is a good shaver and works very well on my husband.  Thank goodness we didn&#x27;t waste our money for this high tech quality shaver. Oh yeah - the shipping was about three days from the time it was shipped.  That is pretty fast for me &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and it is amazing.  I was very nervous about spending this much on an electric razor, but it is awesome!  It is very comfortable to use, and it gets a very close shave for my husband.  If a razor is 10/10 for closeness, this is an 9/10 on his cheeks, and an 8/10 in hard to reach areas like his upper lip.  Very nice feel.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to spend this much but now I am glad I did. I&#x27;ve had several Braun over the years and this is the best yet. The pulse is faster and closer than my previous models. No negatives so far!</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave ever from a braun shaver.if you have any doubts about braun durability and performance think again.100 % satisfaction!</li>
    <li> Good goods, satisfaction</li>
    <li> I get 5:00 shadow at about 10 a.m.  Blade shaving irritates my skin and just isn&#x27;t convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep looking for an electric shaver that will do what it advertises.  Each time a shaver dies, I spend more money each time hoping for THE shaver that I will love.  This one was expensive, self cleaning, etc. but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  Sad to say, I&#x27;m stil on the hunt.  So when this one dies... I&#x27;ll try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Braun, Remington, whoever... you want a face to test new razors on?  I got a challenge right here for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband whose very ancient Hammacher Schlemmer \\&quot;Best of the Best\\&quot; shaver no longer was performing satisfactorily.  I had purchased the same Braun Series 7-790cc shaver for myself.  I detest the cutesy women&#x27;s shavers.  I found the Series 7-790cc great for my needs: legs and underarms.  I even let my husband test mine out prior to purchasing the same one for him.  He now claims it is not as good as his old \\&quot;Best of the Best\\&quot; shaver when it was new; does not shave as close, needs more strokes.  What can I say, I love mine, he dislikes his.  He also wonders why they could not \\&quot;engineer\\&quot; out the tilted handle, does not bother me at all and I love the antiseptic cleaning mechanism; him not so much.</li>
    <li> I was disapointed in this shaver. It did not cut as well as my old shaver yet cost twice as much. I  was expecting much more from this shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  He had previously used a similiar, but older Braun shaver and it was time for a new one.  He is absolutely delighted with the peformance of the shaver system and six weeks later is very pleased with it.  I&#x27;m still getting occasional thanks a month later.</li>
    <li> The best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had! Would you like to shave the back of your bent knee without worrying about nicking those tendons? What about shaving that delicate skin on your inner thighs? No problem! This razor does it all with no nicks, no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you like a razor that cleans and recharges itself when you plug it in and press a button?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d found this years ago.</li>
    <li> This cost $189 and for that much money it shaves no better than my old Remington I bought at Wal-Mart for much less.  The instructions are very hard to read.  I use a razor most of the time and may send this thing back.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for years and decided it was time to get one of the newer models.  This one works very well and I am happy with the shaver.  It seems to tell you that it needs to be cleaned more often than the older one so I leave the solution inside the cleaning / charging unit now.  I used to remove it and put the plastic back on, but this is easier.  It is nice that I can use the same solution container since I just bought four more on Ebay.  That is a great place to go to buy the solutions although maybe you could find them at a good price on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> I must help my husband shave because he has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He used to use a razor and when that became unsafe we switched to a cheaper, but well rated electric shaver. It was too noisy and caused pain in sensitive neck areas. (People with dimentia are very sensitive and it is important to keep them calm.) The Braun Series 7 gives a much quieter and more comfortable shave. It also gives a closer shave. This was a good purchase. I gave it only 4 stars because we must go over the same area so many times from different directions, but we end up with a close shave.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun clean and charge razor, so you know that I have liked the brand in the past.  I buy a new one every 3 years or so, after the battery starts wearing out in the one I have.  This \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; clean and charge razor is inferior to the prior models that I had.  Most importantly, it no longer \\&quot;cleans\\&quot; very well.  The prior two models came out pristine after cleaning, whereas this new model still has a gunk of oily hair stubble residue that must be manually removed after a while because it becomes quite disgusting.  Of lesser importance but still annoying is the extreme noise and vibration created by this razor.  The shave quality has not improved (it&#x27;s not worse either) over the older models, but now I can scare my cats when I shave.  This pulsing/vibrating thing is just a marketing gimmick.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor and am very impressed. Bought the razor not knowing if I would like it and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave and the cleaning system is great as well. Great price for a great razor and will recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have light growth that luckily allows me to go days without needing to shave. Actually my weeks worth of &#x27;beard&#x27; may be equivalent to others daily 12 o&#x27;clock shadow!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe because of this I found electric shavers never gave me a good clean shave, lots of missed spots and still leaving my face feeling rough. I&#x27;ve only owned two shavers in my 43 years, the last was a high end panasonic wet n dry model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course nothing beats a hand shave, but as I&#x27;m such an infrequent shaver find it  a hassle and &#x27;save&#x27; for special occasions!  But boy what a smooth baby&#x27;s bum result when I do!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leads me to my first impressions of the Braun 790. IMPRESSIVE!  My first shave with it was the most smoothest electric shave ever, if not quite matching the baby bum smoothness of a hand shave. But so very very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the maneuverability of the head which moulds to your face as you shave, and the ability to select mild, normal or intense shave. If I were to shave regulary - being every 2 or 3 days I would be happy to use the mild setting. If I leave it a bit longer the more intense settings can be used. I think this is a key feature  that for me justifies choosing the 790 (NB: refer to edit below) over the cheaper but similarly featured 760 model. Otherwise the enhanced display and &#x27;fast clean&#x27; functions of the 790 are nice but not showstoppers for me over the cheaper 760. Check the features as the 760 could be a better opmodel for your needs - def will give the same great shave result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to be honest I bought this with a rebate offer and was such a great deal I didn&#x27;t need to really worry about the price difference vs functions between the two models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the self cleaning/ storage unit - it does not take up as much space on the vanity as other reviews intimated. I&#x27;ve only cleaned it once so far and whilst not sure I&#x27;d clean it daily (ha, as I said I don&#x27;t even shave that often!!) but was impressed with the result and the lemony scent is quite pleasant. I used to clean my old razor with cleaning spray/brush which was a gross messy affair, so am all for the all in one self cleaning solution of the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I am wowed by this product and believe it is every penny well spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 09/07 - It appears I misread the comparison specs as ALL new Series 7 models actually have the variable shave option.  So I could&#x27;ve saved a few $$ myself as the only other differences I see are bells and whistles with the battery/hygiene display and the fast clean function on the cleaner. The specs/comparisons are in the Amazon listing, so check them out!ith the result and the lemony scent is quite pleasant.

    <li> Nice shaver with one tiny issue....just not that impressed with the level of noise when self cleaning.  It does however provide a nice shave.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would pay $200 for an electric shaver!  I used Remingtons most of my life (I am 70 years young).  When my latest Remington died, I replaced it with a top-of-the-line Remington.  It performed worse than the previous one, so I returned it.  I then ordered the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano.  While the Panasonic gave a pretty good shave, I found it quite uncomfortable to hold.  In desperation, I ordered the Braun Series 7-7900cc.  This shaver way out-performed anything I had previously had.  Maybe you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver leaves no hairs behind - even when shaving a 3-day old growth.  Also, no \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; of hairs ever!  The trimmer is the best of any shaver I have owned.  For the first several months, I did not use the Braun \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; system.  I simply tapped the removable shaver head, blew out whisker \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; from the body and followed the wet cleaning procedure (running hot water over the head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading about the cleaning cartridge issues (good for only 1 month), I decided to try tapping &amp; blowing followed by using the cartridge cleaning - then followed by resealing the cartridge until its next use (easy to do).  I only shave every other day.  This procedure looks like it will allow the cartridge to last a VERY long time.  Even so, I cannot conclude that the cartridge cleaning leads to a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I am extremely happy with this shaver.  For me, it is the Lexus of electric shavers.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this shaver. He has always used a blade, but had problems with &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; and ingrown hairs. His face is so smooth now and he doesn&#x27;t need to use the special creams anymore. He&#x27;s been using it for about a year now and it still works really well. Great for black men or anyone with very thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Had an older unit Braun and purchased this one to replace it since there were stress cracks on the sides of the old razor head.  This one performs much better and gives a great shave.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> I H\have owned Brawn shavers for years and mine need replacing.  I had been looking at this one for several months.  It&#x27;s an all around excellent shaver that has several settings for different skin conditions. Best one I have owned.</li>
    <li> it is an gift for my friend and he loves it very much. i didn&#x27;t open it but it looks good!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric shavers on the market. Shaves very close with no irritation. The cleaning/lubricating system seems like a sleazy money grab - and it is - but over time it&#x27;s worthwhile as shaving performance always feels like new and you never have a disgusting, gunked up shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, over the years Braun has been skimping on quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What used to be an all metal shaver is now mostly plastic with metallic paint - pretty crappy for a top of the line product retailing for nearly $300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***8/25/11 Updating my review to note that battery life is actually amazing, contrary to what I originally posted, and much improved from previous models. While the \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; indicator suggests a cleaning cycle after just a couple of shaves, the charge indicator barely registers a drop after a week of daily shaves. Among other things, this completely eliminates the need to bring along the charging cord when traveling, unless you&#x27;re going to be away for over a month or plan to shave your dog with it. This is such a huge improvement that it warrants a bump from 3 to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power/charging cord has a ridiculously large and awkward plug that looks ugly, takes up too much space and sticks out four inches from the wall. Braun should at least redesign the plug with a swivel so it can be folded flat against the wall. The charging/cleaning station takes a long time to charge a dead battery and sounds like a chainsaw while cleaning (the plastic housing actually seems to amplify the normal sound of the shaver.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** 8/25/11 Also wanted to note that this model features a quick clean mode (hidden button) that will get you up and running in just a few minutes. The down side is that this does not provide sufficient time for drying, giving you a face full of alcohol while shaving - so probably best to make do with the dirty shaver until you have time for a full cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you environmentalists out there, this little shaver comes in a ludicrously large box, almost big enough to pack a basketball in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, based on the previous model I owned, the pop-out trimmer is both useless and destined to fail. After finding that the hinge on mine had broken (meaning it sticks out and jabs you in the face) I discovered that many other owners have also had this part fail, and Braun&#x27;s response is simply to buy a new shaver. Stay classy, Braun. I see no change in the design or materials used in the new model to suggest the current trimmer is more durable or replaceable than the old one. My recommendation is to avoid use of the trimmer entirely as this will greatly extend the usable life of your $300 shaver.his little shaver comes in a ludicrously large box, almost big enough to pack a basketball in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, based on the previous model I owned, the pop-out trimmer is both useless and destined to fail.

    <li> Very good product, has been purchased third.</li>
    <li> I know this may be a bad pun but this Braun operates like it&#x27;s on PED&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Gillette Fusion razors for years and have been happy with them.  My one constant complaint was the razor burn and bumps I would get with my sensitive skin.  I would take weekends off of shaving if I could and don&#x27;t get me started on what my neck would look like if I had to wear a tie that day and had my collar pressed against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only owned one electric shaver in the past and it was a Norelco wet and dry rotary shaver that I received as a gift.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan, it took forever to shave and it wasn&#x27;t close at all.  I still had bumps and I swore I would never use an electric shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this recent purchase.  I had an Amazon gift card for Fathers Day and my Birthday.  After reading reviews I decided to give it a shot even though it seemed pricey.  Wow was I impressed.  I love the shaver and so does my wife &#x3D;)  I shave every day now and I look forward to it.  I don&#x27;t get bumps anymore and that&#x27;s with using the highest setting.  It is a close shave and does so with ease.  As members have mentioned, it does take some time for your skin to get accustomed to using a shaver.  You will notice your shaves being closer and closer as you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a down side it would be the hygiene setting.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how well you clean the unit it shows it as a level 2 and needs fluid cleaning.  I get that they are trying to sell their cleaner so be advised.  So far I haven&#x27;t had to replace the fluid and I have had this for over a month.  It does smell good after the system cleans the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish that the stand was straight black instead of the color with flecks.  I keep thinking the unit is dusty but it is just the fleck in the color, minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am true believer in this shaver and don&#x27;t see my self going to back to the razor.  Buy this unit with confidence and even though it&#x27;s pricey, you get what you pay for.it&#x27;s pricey, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> There are only three reasons to buy an electric razor: save on blades, save time from buying blades or to avoid getting cut while shaving.  Other than that blades, or manual shaving are superior--no one would argue that you can get as close as shave with an electric.  The only thing they might say is \\&quot;it is close to a blade.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I ordered the Braun 790.  The thing has a whole lot of items to it and things you must buy to keep it going.  Unlike the Braun of old when it actually was a German company which specialized in practicality and didn&#x27;t try to milk customers into buying unnecessary things, Proctor &amp; Gamble (the maker of Tide and Crest) bought them out and changed the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you need to have this nasty alcohol solution cleaner--which must be repurchased every thirty days--in order to use your shaver.  In the past Braun was designed to be cleaned with water and a brush.  Furthermore, you need to replace the cutting block every year and a half for about forty bucks.  So any money you might have saved by not having to buy blades is eaten up by Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s desire to milk as much money as it can from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a year and a half you will have spent nearly $400 to buy and maintain this razor--which will never shave as close as a blade and takes twice as long to shave as a blade.  And unlike Panasonic which allows for shaving under water, Braun must be used dry which reduces lubrication and the closeness of the shave.  All in all a raw deal, and therefore I am returning my Braun and realize the only thing this razor will help you get rid of is a lot of your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I returned my Braun to Proctor &amp; Gamble, you know the makers of Ivory, Crest, Tide, etc.; unlike the 8 weeks they promise to refund your money for this product, they took 13 weeks and will only give you a Citibank Prepaid Card instead of giving you actual money back.  Like most things from Citibank, the card has all sorts of rules and limitations.  I would avoid anything Proctor &amp; Gamble and their worthless 60-day guarantee!limitations.  I would avoid anything Proctor &amp; Gamble and their worthless 60-day guarantee!</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for 30 plus years. Never owned one costing this much. Well worth the money, the shave is nice and clean. The automatic clean up works great.</li>
    <li> It is much cheaper than the same product in China. the quality is much better. it is a good gift for your friends.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much. Wonderful shaver.</li>
    <li> I was excited to upgrade my older version Braun shaver to the latest and greatest, but despite all the (superfluous) bells and whistles, this razor did a worse job than my 10+ year razor.  No matter how hard I pressed the razor, or increased the \\&quot;intensity\\&quot; button, there was still stubble left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hygiene  detector is smart in theory, but it always knocked one bar off no matter how long the razor was going (e.g. if my clean razor was used once, and then twice more quickly to get a couple of missed spots, I was dinged 3 hygiene bars).  Read the product description for an explanation on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and when I finally decided to send it back (after the advised 3 week trial period), all Braun offers is a phone message with an address.  No person or opportunity to give feedback, just an address.  It seemed as though they really didn&#x27;t care that some users weren&#x27;t satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, stick with an earlier version if you&#x27;re set on Braun.  This one wasn&#x27;t quite ready for prime time.</li>
    <li> For my entire life I have had very sensitive skin.  I would break out almost everytime I shaved.  The first time I used electric shavers, it was even worst.  Earlier this year, we purchased my college bound son a Braun Series 7.  It was fantastic!  In fact, I purchased one myself.  My face no longer breaks out and it cuts close enough that I can shave everyday for the first time.  I travel a lot and the battery life is great.  The only challenge was finding this razor and that&#x27;s when I turned to Amazon.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7-790 provides a minimal shave not even close to a throw away razor.  The gadgets that come with it are near useless and only adds to an already exorbitant price tag.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a superb razor.  I researched and researched and narrowed it down to the Braun 790 and the Panasonic Arc 5.  Got both.  Returned the Panasonic and kept the Braun.  Is shaves beautifully.  I actually look forward to shaving now for the first time since I like hit puberty.  I would say it shaves as close as a blade.  The cleaning system is superior to any out there and leaves the razor clean and lubricated.  This is my second Braun.  My first is like 10 years old and still works very well and I never had a problem with it - just thought it was time to upgrade.  I would compare this razor to a new generation Corvette.  Very, very good at what it was designed to do, stout, durable, well engineered, no finicky issues and will likely never break down.  Many of the other top line razors seem much more &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; and like expensive foreign super cars.  They do what they were designed to do very well but are more likely to have break downs and will be expensive to repair.  You can not go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> Pro : Great Shaver Blade Like Cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Way to much Noise&lt;br /&gt;  Power Cord Sticks straight out over 3.5&#x60;&#x60; from outlet before bending  (Poor Design)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used rotary razors since I started shaving about 1969.  About five years ago I tried an inexpensive foil razor.  After a month, I threw it out.  I bought a good, expensive rotary razor and kept going with that, but I still wanted a closer shave......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and bought the Braun foil razor.  I am shocked at how much closer this razor gets. There is no doubt in my mind, the foil razor gives a closer shave than the rotary.  Absolute.  No contest.  No question about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if all foil razors give as close a shave as this Braun......but this razor is \\&quot;it\\&quot; for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Even the trimmer  works better!  And the self cleaning is just a wonderful added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor.  I&#x27;m amazed.  It&#x27;s about as close a shave as anyone can expect without using a straight razor.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to get up and shave with this razor!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many shavers in my 83 years and this is by far the best.  Well worth the money.</li>

    <li> Too high tech ..too much to understand..</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best one I have ever owned.  Very close shave and featured well.  Charger unit is compact and works much better then the old Braun model I had.  Nice features and close shave.  Not much more you can ask for.</li>
    <li> The shave isn&#x27;t close, even after shaving in all directions over the same spot.  Also, can&#x27;t get to small areas to shave around the nose etc.</li>
    <li> I have always used Braun shavers yet never have had one that would hold a charge.  After a few months it would need to be continuously plugged in to operate.  Over the course of 12 years I have owned 3 of their shavers and hope this is finally the one that doesn&#x27;t have battery issues.  Braun has always had great shaving capabilities and never pull the hair.  Others tell me that they can&#x27;t stand using electric razors and I always ask &amp;#34;Have you tried a Braun?&amp;#34;  Their answer is always no.</li>
    <li> The shaver does a decent job, better than my previous Norelco on the neck but it suffers from several deficiencies. The build quality is not great. The trimmer has broken (won&#x27;t go back down) after very little use, and the silver area next to the head is flaking off. The cleaning system is so noisy my wife won&#x27;t let me use it when she is in the bathroom- it is an irritating rasping noise and quite loud (the cleaning station amplifies the shaver noise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you travel you can&#x27;t really take the bulky, liquid-loaded cleaning station so the shaver rapidly indicates it isn&#x27;t clean no matter how much you manually rinse the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly, for the price, and factoring in the cost of replacing the foil head ($48) and the cleaning solution, which lasts about a month per cartridge ($12-13 each), there are more cost-effective solutions that shave about as well. It will do a reasonable job shaving but you have to work at it in the cheekbone and neck areas. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a year with this shaver I got frustrated with the effort required to get a decent shave and bought a Norelco 3D. This shaver is quiet and does not require the effort that the Braun did. Huge improvement.  Gave the Braun to our son.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun Series 7 Shaver as a gift and the recipient is very pleased with it..  The cleaning system is a definite plus; has a long battery life, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to recharge when necessary.  Recipient has tried several shavers and this is the shaver that he likes. It also gives a close shave.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband 8 months ago and it has been wonderful. His skin is very sensitive and he has had irritation only a few times. It&#x27;s great for when he needs a quick touch-up.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as a birthday gift. He LOVES it! Braun aught to pay him as he is a walking advertisement, telling everyone who will listen about how impressed he is. And coming from a man who gets a five o&#x27;clock shadow @ noon and shaves daily, that&#x27;s pretty high praise. And at two thirds of the store price, you really can&#x27;t do any better.</li>
    <li> Technically, a great product, but I wish it shaved better in hard to reach parts of the face. The system is flawless but the elusive great electric razor shave is still not be found. Best of the bunch in terms of what it is, just needs to work better at doing the task.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I expect in a higher priced E shaver. No complaints</li>
    <li> After being extremely pleased with my Braun 5550 for fourteen years, and after considering the glowing reviews on the web, I purchased a Series 7.  My 5550 reached the point it would no longer work with the cord, and since I&#x27;d already replaced the battery once, decided it was time to upgrade.  I didn&#x27;t really want all the features of a wet/dry shaver with self-cleaning, but purchasing a shaver with these extra add-ons seems to be the only way to get a quality model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning the Series 7.  What takes the 5550 two or three strokes to shave smooth, takes the Series 7 a dozen or more.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy, or fast-growing beard, either.  I think the bulk of the problem is the foil design, which has regularly-spaced, smaller holes than the replacement foil for the 5550...which has a pattern that looks like tiny wagon wheels.  These are more adept at passing through hairs from different directions, and which lay differently against the face.  Are you listening, Braun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other complaint I have of the Series 7 is that it is very LOUD!  Granted, I have sensitive hearing, but when shaving near my sideburns (over and over and over...) the noise is excruciating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story has a happy ending, though.  I found a repair service that will rebuild my 5550.  While expensive, I&#x27;ll be able to enjoy a quick and clean shave for a least a few more years.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned.  It shaves clean and close without razor burn.  I recommend it to anyone thinking of buying an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> very perfect. feel so good!</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned, all with the cleaning system, which is the way to go. So far this one gives the closest shave. I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past- Norelco, Remington, etc., but for me, Braun is best.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun and this model Braun is the best for sure. This new Braun makes it look like I use a straight razor. Buy it for sure</li>
    <li> The razor was received very fast.  Everything was as advertised.  The razor is manufactured of quality material and works great.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun razor for me.  The foil type electric yields the closest shave and the Braun is the best of these especially with the self cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple of days now. My old Braun 8000 series shaver did a decent job, so I decided to go with another Braun model, and this one is very nice indeed. It took me a day to get used to the slightly different options, but that was the only thing I had a problem with. After the shave my skin feels smoother than with my old shaver, even after I gave the old shaver a new foil and blade. This is definitely an upgrade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers ever since I started shaving. My last shaver, the Braun Activator 8595, conked out with a dead battery after four years. This series 7 gives an even better shave. The floating heads and high speed cutters give a very close smooth shave without any irritation. Even if I don&#x27;t shave for several days, it gets all the straggly hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning/charging station works easily, but you can also clean it manually, including rinsing the head under the water tap. The cleaning station works quite well.  The charging cord fits both the charging station and can be plugged directly into the shaver, so if you are traveling, you can bring just the shaver and the cord. The shaver will hold enough charge for several days without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a handy \\&quot;closeness\\&quot; adjustment you can make to change how close a shave you get, so if you have sensitive skin, or sensitive areas, just tap a button to quickly change it.</li>
    <li> THE BRAUN SERIES 7 - 790cc, is by far the best electric razor I have ever used. HANDS DOWN !!!</li>
    <li> For years I touted the Norelco arcitec rotary shaver, because it did an excellent job: smooth shave, and in all the difficult nooks and crannies. Recently however, something changed: I suppose my beard got tougher. Suddenly, even after a brand new shaving head, I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave no matter what. Not sure what happened, but my Norelco no longer worked for me. So I decided to research shavers, both rotary and foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a good three weeks of online research reading reviews both from the United States and Britain, the consensus was the Braun 790cc-4, \\&quot;the king of shavers,\\&quot; as one British reviewer put it. Very expensive, over $200, ranging from $210 to $250, depending on who&#x27;s selling. BUT -- it has the most amazing features. For details see [...] . especially the self-cleaning feature. The shaver head is automatically washed out with a special solution, the stubble falls to the bottom of a small well in the shaver receptacle, the shaver head is cleaned, dried, lubricated and ends up having a refreshing lemon fragrance. Once the automatic cleaning/charging process is done, it&#x27;s set to go again and looks and smells like brand new -- and, the shaver&#x27;s battery is fully charged. That&#x27;s just one amazing feature -- if you&#x27;re in the market for an incredible shaver, do read the feature details on the website above. Watch the videos, which explain the inner workings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me -- I get blade-close shaves with the least amount of pressure, and the head doesn&#x27;t even heat up. I&#x27;m not sure how long the honeymoon will last, but at this point I&#x27;m in it for the long haul!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, 3/2/14: After having used this baby for  the last three years now, I can say this: it&#x27;s perfect for me; I will never go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun shaver user for the past 50 years, starting with the Braun Sixtant model in 1960 when I was still living in Europe. It was an outstanding shaver and I always got a smooth very close shave with it just like with the razor blade. I brought it with me when I moved to the US in 1970 and I was using it for the next 10 years or so. At that time only the foil replacement was recommended by Braun in every 2-3 years, the cutter was claimed to be self sharpening and I never replaced mine. The foils came in flat packs and you just bend them and pop them into the brushed stainless steel foil holder. I brought quite a few of them with me when I came to the US and I never had any problem with it for the next ten years or so.&lt;br /&gt;Later on I purchased many of the new models which had a few more extra bells and whistles, some convenience features, twin cutting blocks and became cordless and rechargeable which was probably the most significant change for me. But they really could not improve on the performance of the Sixtant since it was so good to begin with, but I was happy with all the other forthcoming models I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I still have the 7570 model in very good working condition and still holds the charge very well after 11 years, the first one came with the cleaning system (very bad design) which broke after 2-3 months of use, but I felt that the cleaning system on this shaver does not really needed anyway. As long as the cutting block was separate from the foil it was fast, efficient and easy to clean it with the brush. Later I purchased the 8595 model which had a lot better designed jet cleaning system, it was a bit noisier than the 7570 but the performance was the same.&lt;br /&gt;Before I got the 790cc I tried the Philips Norelco 1280X w/jet clean system which is a very nice and quiet shaver, does an excellent job and close shave but I could not get used to the ergonomics and the Braun definitely gives me a touch closer shave, my face felt a lot smoother after shaving even with the Braun 7570.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I decided to get the 790cc the latest and greatest Braun which certainly has a lot of nice features, bells and whistles, easy to use and convenient to clean it with the cleaning system every other day, when the shaver feels and smells fresh, like new. My 7570 is still in very good working condition and compared to the 790cc it gives me the same close shave as my new 790cc, no noticeable difference to me. However I enjoy the new design, all the new features, the better ergonomics and the convenience of the clean and renew station.&lt;br /&gt;So I am back to the same brand I have been using for the past 50 years and I am delighted with the performance of this new 790cc shaver and I can honestly say there is no other shaver on the market which gives you this close shave without any skin irritation, highly recommend it to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after almost 3 years:&lt;br /&gt;I still have this Braun 790CC which works well but always has been pretty noisy and although I commented before that it gives me a touch closer shave than the Philips 1280XX it is really a toss up since I just repurchased a new Philips 1280XX/42 and alternately using both of them. They equal in closeness of shave and the Philips appears to be made from better material. On the Braun 790CC some of the nice metal looking parts are silver paint covered plastic and this paint coating is now bubbling up at the back under the cutting head after a couple of years of use and Jet cleaning which is very disappointing. The only thing with the Philips that it gives me a touch more skin irritation sometimes if I am not careful enough around the lower neck area, but very close and extremely quiet shave. No doubt that these 2 shavers are the best on the market today and I will be using both of them alternately for a while and make a final judgement if I will keep both of them or just the one I prefer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update after using both the above shaversalternately for 3 weeks:&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use there was no more skin irritation with the Philips and I had to come to a conclusion that the Philips 1280XX gives me faster, a lot quieter, smoother and even a bit closer shave than the Braun 790CC. Final word, the Philips 1280XX is the keeper for me.alternately for 3 weeks:&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use there was no more skin irritation with the Philips and I had to come to a conclusion that the Philips 1280XX gives me faster, a lot quieter, smoother and even a bit closer shave than the Braun 790CC. Final word, the Philips 1280XX is the keeper for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and after the initial adjusting for a week or so, he is loving it. Ofcourse, being new product it was expensive but all worth it!!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, it sounded like the shaver to give me the close shave.  I have used it for about a week and it is just not giving me the same shave that I get using a razor.  Kept using it thinking it would save time but found myself going over and over trying to get that close shave i&#x27;m used to..</li>
    <li> Excellent smooth shave. Handles two or three day beards like butter. Cleaning system keeps it super fresh and ready to go all the time.</li>
    <li> WELL I JUST RECEIVED THE BRAUN SERIES 7-790CC PULSONIC SHAVER THIS AFTERNOON. VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PACKAGING. ONCE I OPENED IT, I POPPED A CLEANING CARTRIDGE IN AND STARTED TO CHARGE THE SHAVER. CHARGED EXTREMELY FAST. I LITERALLY HAD 5 DAYS OF FULL BEARD GROWTH ON MY FACE AND THIS SHAVER TOOK CARE OF IT ALL WITH NO PROBLEM. LEFT MY FACE FEELING VERY SMOOTH.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric razor I have ever used in my life! Burns your skin,leaves stubble all over your neck and I could get a closer and easier shave using a butter knife. My beard isn&#x27;t even coarse I can barely grow one. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the foil design over rotary but this thing is awful. I can&#x27;t believe their are over 300 positive reviews on here for it. I have used $30 electric razors from my local drug store that work better. Back to the rotary&#x27;s and Norelco&#x27;s I guess. Way over $200 down the drain with no whiskers to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Just recieved the Norelco 1280Xcc with the jet clean system. Have not shaved after dumping the Braun waiting for this one so it&#x27;s 4 days with no shave. Plugged the razor in,only let it charge for 10 minutes and tried it out. After 4 days of no shave this razor gave me a closer more comfortable shave in half the time than the Braun ever did, with no straggler hairs dotting my face or having to go over the same area 300 times. I&#x27;m literally in disbelief that I got a blade close shave with an electric. I have to mention again that maybe the foil shavers just are not good with my face for whatever reason but I will never go back. Take it from somebody who just tried both and somebody who has been looking for a decent electric for over 20 years (and has a month old over $200 electric razor now sitting under the sink) get the rotary Norelco.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this shaver except the fact that I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave. I had finally decided to get a really good (expensive) shaver, heard lots of good things about braun, watched the \\&quot;how it&#x27;s made\\&quot; episode about the company. BUT.....when I used this shaver under the same criteria(clean, dry, face) as my old remington titanium I just couldn&#x27;t get a good shave. So after a week I gave up and returned it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used the shaver for three weeks and works as advertised. Cleaning works great and worth every penny. I had given up on electrical shavers after bad experience with Philips Norelco. This one is way ahead of Philips.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor for my husband for Christmas with the cleaning refills.&lt;br /&gt;He never opened either product, he didn&#x27;t want the product. I got on the computer to print out a return lable, it said i couldn&#x27;t return the product. I called Amazon, my husband and i both talked to different reps. They told us we could not send it back and they were not going to credit my account.&lt;br /&gt;The reasoning they gave for not being able to take it back was 1) because of the cleaning product, thats what one oerson said, 2) because of the lithium battery, was what another told us.&lt;br /&gt;If they sent it through the mail, how is it we couldn&#x27;t send it back, using the same steps?&lt;br /&gt;It was a bunch of crap. I was vert upset. I spent over 200.00 on this.&lt;br /&gt;We got rid of the razor and cleaner refills,still never opened.&lt;br /&gt;This a review about tge product we never used the product, just be well informed of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Incredible razor!  It has surpassed all my expectations.  Easy to use.  Good, close shave.  No irritation.  Could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! In every way it meets my expectations. I would recommend this electric shaver to anyone. I even love the new carrying case.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for over 20 years.  This is the best shaver yet.  The closeness of the shave cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Not quite as close of a shave as a conventional razor, but a solid shave.  I would purchase this shaver again.</li>
    <li> I had 3 different types of Phillips brand before and shaving was just a pain! This one matches the skin perfectly and shaving doesn&#x27;t take more than five min eachtime.</li>
    <li> I love my hubby even more ever since he started using it!  It&#x27;s a high quality product that worth your money!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it !!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend. He&#x27;s breaking out now. He says the shave is close. I was trying to upgrade him, not give him acne! [Sigh.]</li>
    <li> After all of the positive reviews I wanted to really like this product. However when it arrived and tried it out I was greatly disappointed. Maybe I got a defective one but it didn&#x27;t even shave a well as my $30 shaver. It&#x27;s quite, fits well in your hand, feels well made but didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a thick beard but I am African American and it didn&#x27;t even began to shave any hair at all. It simply made noise and didn&#x27;t cut anything. I took out my $30 shaver and went over the same spots just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things and sure enough it just wasn&#x27;t cutting anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say Amazon was excellent in refunding my money quickly so that I was able to purchase another shaver that works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of you who are pleased with this good for you, but for me it was a very bad experience.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Braun for many years. I have owned a couple of 3 series and loved them. I decided to move up to this series 7 shaver. Wow! The difference was day and night. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am very happy with what I have used in the past. I used this shaver for the first time this morning. After a single pass over my jaw line, it looked like hair never grew there! I also use these shavers on my head because... I shave my head. That will test any shaver for a close shave. What can I say, this shaver was hands down better. Usually it takes a little time to do my head, but this shaver must have cut down on the time by 75%! I did use the most aggressive shave setting for my face and head. Obviously it took more time (passes) on my head then face, but I never got this close or smooth of a look or feel before!  Please note: I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years with electric shaver&#x27;s so my skin is used to them. I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> After using razor blades for 30+ years,I decided to try an electric shaver for the first time because I was unhappy about the expense of the blades. After much reseach I decided on the Braun series 7 razor. Although more expensive than most I figured it would pay for itself in the long run. I have a fairly heavy beard as the blade would last about a week and was looking for quality and performance in an electric razor. I found both in this Braun razor. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  It provides a really close shave.  I also shave my head and it&#x27;s very effective at that also.  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my father and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Very good razor, does get closer than any other electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever use. BUTTTTT still, the side burn attachment, just like every other Elec. Razor in America sucks....other than that, great Razor</li>
    <li> Its a very expensive shaver and you expect a lot more from it, i can just talk for me: im a 20 y.o. guy with mixed skin, smooth hair, not many facial, but i wanted to get a present 4 myself so i got this shaver and im not very happy. i spend about half an hour ever time i go shaving and i still dont get the results that i get with a normal shaver. even dry or wet. also it gets very hot so i have to turned off every 5 min to cool down. the only nice thing i can say is that the battery last long time.</li>
    <li> I paid over $200 for this razor and then found out that Amazon would not return it. It gives a lousy shave. You have to buy Alcohol for it to clean it. And now I can&#x27;t do anything with it but throw it in the can. Stick with your old razor and use that instead.</li>
    <li> Well I had this shaver in my Amazon wish list for weeks.  I kept reading the specs. and reviews.  I was hesitant in buying it because it isn&#x27;t something that is cheap.  A few weeks ago Amazon had sale on this item so I finally said what the heck, I want to try it.  Plus I knew Braun had a 60 day money back.  As soon as it came in, I plugged it in to charge and while it charged I took the time to read the manual.  This is my first electric shaver, before this I was shaving with Gillette Pro Glide Razor, and the only electric thing I had was a trimmer.  When it was finally charged, I had my first shave with the 790cc.  Wow!!  I did not expect the shave to be that close!  It feels like I shaved with a razor.  When I would shave with a razor before I only shaved down because it would irritate my face if I shaved against the grain.  Not with the new Braun 790cc, no irritation on my face or neck.  Now I don&#x27;t need any more razors, shaving cream, or after shave, yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-close smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;-feels great in hand&lt;br /&gt;-easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;-awesome cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;-no irritation (at least for me)&lt;br /&gt;-didn&#x27;t leave stray hairs&lt;br /&gt;-battery life&lt;br /&gt;-selectable speed&lt;br /&gt;-fast charge time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-power cord has big plug (sticks out of wall)&lt;br /&gt;-may be a little loud for some (I&#x27;m ok with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used this for about 2 weeks, I will update later if I find anymore pros or cons.</li>
    <li> Definitely this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice design and also it is extremely easy to clean it.</li>
    <li> Charger stations stops working after a few uses, for example it always says it not clean after a wash</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stepped up through many Braun series over the years. And each time I thought wow the best shave ever, only for it to get better on the next series. I&#x27;ve tried all the competitors, and they pale in comparison.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have had with an electric razor</li>
    <li> Braun 790CC very good very powerful cleaning solution that is relatively difficult to buy .. ..</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. The price was also very good as well.</li>
    <li> Best shaver my husband has ever used.  I love the silky smooth feeling after he shaves, no other shaver performed this well.&lt;br /&gt;Blades last longer with the regular cleaning which is available with one push of the button.</li>
    <li> This is the worst piece of junk I ever saw. Actually I never saw it because I never ordered it. It showed up on my account and when I reported it I got all kinds of apologies but it is still on my account (3 days later)...So I decided to give it my review. In all fairness I don&#x27;t know if the product is good or bad but I do know that Amazon sure screwed up. Fortunately I wasn&#x27;t charged the $200.00 for this product but it&#x27;s not over yet. cause it is still showing on my account. I am going to return the thing (even though I never got it......Lets see how they handle that......I am sooooooo disappointed in Amazon</li>
    <li> Great shaver works great so far not a complaint . Just as smooth as a blade shave both head and face</li>
    <li> I received my first braun as a christmas present about 15 years ago, it quit last month and I purchased a new braun used it about one week,then It threw it in the drawer, what a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric razors for almost 20 years. This is probably my 5th or 6th model over that period  of time. This model (Series 7-790cc-4) is definitely an improvement. I think the biggest improvement is the increased RPMs which reduces the total shave time. However, you must turn up the 3 stage intensity to the maximum setting. I don&#x27;t really use the first 2 intensity settings as I don&#x27;t think the RPMs are high enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the shape and weight of this model. It is much more ergonomic. The carrying case is also improved over the older styles which were just cheap plastic. My only issue is that I still have to use my other hand to push against my skin in front of the razor to raise my facial hair. I keep hoping that one day I won&#x27;t have to do that. My total shave time (after going over my face numerous times) is about 10 minutes which has been cut down from 15-20 minutes on the previous model.</li>
    <li> I got this razor gift for my dad. It took a while to arrive, but once he got it, he said it was the best razor he&#x27;d ever had. the Braun Series 7 has more gizmos than my dad will ever use (according to him), but he has no trouble using the what he wants and leaves the extras in the box. So, it&#x27;s the best electric razor and you get what you want and a lot of extras as well.</li>
    <li> I always used a razor one of my friends bought the braun series 3 told me he liked it so I did my own research and fell in love with the 7 series. When I received it I was kind of scared use an electric shaver before and it pulled my hair out NOT with this one wow I&#x27;ll never go back to razor and the self cleaning awesome</li>
    <li> I bought the pulsonic shaver looking a machine to change my razor, because i can&#x27;t shave my face every day whit this one.I&#x27;m working and i have to do this, now with the Braun i don&#x27;t need take care about my face become red or use after shave. is the best choice and is as smooth as the razor. i hope you try this one. just good words.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband because he nicks himself every time he shaves. He isn&#x27;t nicking himself and he is satisfied with the shave. He is extremely picky and I didn&#x27;t know if he would switch from the blade razor, but after a little adjustment time, he really likes this razor.</li>
    <li> on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> The shaver itself seems fine, like a brand new version of the one my husband bought 7 years ago. The long hair trimmer that now pops out at a 90 degree angle is super weird. It used to come straight up, which worked perfectly. The angled design is awkward and nearly impossible to use. The razor blocks the view of what you&#x27;re trimming. He&#x27;s going to have to buy a separate trimmer--not only a waste of space, but also a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This Braun Razor was purchased as a gift.  After seeing my Braun Razor, the recipient wanted one.  Made a perfect Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I have used several types of electrics over the past years - mostly Remington and Norelco and kept returning to the dreaded Blade after tiring of the lack of a decent shave. I soon tire of the resulting irritation and go back to the Electric. So far, two weeks, the shave has been amazing with my new Braun, near Blade close and much easier on my face. I initially felt that the automatic cleaning system was a little overkill, but it sure is sweet to have a clean and lubricated shaver every morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a razor guy for a long time and every now and then wanted to go to a shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried some and didn&#x27;t like them.  So here I was again wanting to try a shaver and hit the web to find out what the best shaver was.  The reviews pointed to the Braun 790.  Given the price tag I started looking at customer reviews.  Most of the reviews were great and some where bad.  After a month of thinking this over I purchased the 790 and was hoping I didn&#x27;t waste my money.  The 790 is great its faster and gives a close shave.  Every now and then it leaves one or two hairs that I have to go over a few times to get.  This is a great shaver and gives a close shave, I&#x27;ve never had a shaver give this close of a shave before.</li>
    <li> Fine electric razor at a great price</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used many electric shavers in the past so take this review with a grain of salt. However based on my last 3 weeks of use this shaver works ok. I really have to press fairly hard and stretch my skin in order to get a clean shave. Outside of that the self cleaning feature is nice as long as you aren&#x27;t going to be right after a shave as it runs for several minutes while cleaning. Also you have to keep purchasing the cleaning agent so the cost continues, though you can get it in three packs fairly reasonable. The plus part for me is not having to run the sink and deal with shaving cream every day so on that note I leave this device with 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works well so far. Base unit is bulky.</li>
    <li> Good in a pinch but no substitute for razor</li>
    <li> This razor is outstanding i use it everyday to shave my beard and 2 or 3 times a week to shave my head it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I purchased another two for my brothers, great machine with high performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cordless for as long as I have been shaving.  This is the closest shave yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey and haven&#x27;t used the charging/cleaning cradle but the razor is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sideburn trimmer a little awkward the way it pops out instead of slide up like my old Braun and the head is a bit more difficult to get off/on but these are minor.</li>
    <li> very good! perfect feel  !!!</li>
    <li> While this is more powerful than my last one, it does not have as many functions. One can trim sideburns, but trimming a mustache is very difficult. No adjustment for thicker beards. It does have more power and operates more quiet, but better design is needed.</li>
    <li> Not as good as our older Braun Series 5.</li>
    <li> FIRST IMPRESSION REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people will be asking specifically asking which Panasonic model I&#x27;m coming from. Here it is: [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to start...People are usually most interested with how close the shave is. I thought that the Panasonic shaved close, but it really doesn&#x27;t compare with the Braun considering the passes necessary to complete your shave for the Panasonic versus the Braun. Now some people will say I paid another hundred dollars on top of what I paid for the Panasonic, but it&#x27;s more like $45 (Cyber Monday deal for the win). Even if paying another hundred dollars I&#x27;ll say this once: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR. Emphasis necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;-Shaver is well put together and excellent grip (Rubberized)&lt;br /&gt;-Buzzer for the mustache and side burns actually works (Panasonic you felt forced and uncomfortable making sure it worked)&lt;br /&gt;-The cleaning station is as simple and functional as it gets (Considerable difference between this one and Panasonic&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;-3 different power settings for shaver is a huge plus for me (Sensitive areas benefit from lower power setting)&lt;br /&gt;-Travel case looks awesome and sturdy enough to protect (Panasonic only provided pouch and plastic cover to protect foil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-For those who want a wet shaver, this shaver is not for you&lt;br /&gt;-Haven&#x27;t come across any others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Better than Panasonic. Worth the money if you want a dry shaver. Will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long but so far so good.</li>
    <li> My husband is loving this new razor!  Awesome that it self cleans, I don&#x27;t have wiskers all over my bathroom now.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shaver for 20 yrs. I had several different makers and different models like Panasonic,Remington,Wahl and ofcourse Braun. This one I like because it is quitter and shaves real good. I recommend anyone who wants to buy electric shaver to go for Braun Series 7.</li>
    <li> I had one once before and loved it. I replaced it with an inferior shaver and was unhappy. Now that I have another one I would say worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shave from an electric razor I have ever had. And the cleaning system is great. If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver in this range, look no further, this is the one. I like the fact that I can take it on short trips without the base as well...held a charge for over 4 weeks once without being plugged in (mind you I don&#x27;t shave every day, but still), and I can clean it with just water when I&#x27;m away from the base. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I use it on my head, and it shaves faster and cleaner than any other electric I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The other reviews on here rave about this product, but I fell as if these are users who have little experience with older foils. This shaver has some important pros but some important cons as well. I&#x27;ve been using it since January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- excellent battery life&lt;br /&gt;- can be rinsed under the tap&lt;br /&gt;- little to no tugging of hairs&lt;br /&gt;- motor seems sufficiently powerful&lt;br /&gt;-the different power settings are a nice touch. Occasionally I like using a lower power setting on my neck&lt;br /&gt;-does a decent job (not great, not as good as previous generations of this product) of catching grain in different direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does not capture cut hair very well. Your stubble will get all over your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;- Construction feels a little flimsy, at least for a premium product&lt;br /&gt;- The base is a flimsy looking and feeling product, I don&#x27;t like having it on my counter as a result.&lt;br /&gt;- the pop up trimmer is in a strange location. You cannot see where you are trimming when using it. It also doesn&#x27;t work very well, I still use my whal trimmer instead of this.&lt;br /&gt;- clean up is a little bit of a hassle. The foil release button doesnt work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I agree with some of the reviewers who compared this to the older, more powerful, braun foils.</li>
    <li> I have never owned better shaver. This product is great. I am using it for more than 2 years and the battery life did not change at all. I still recharge it after three weeks of use, considering the fact that my beard is very hard to shave. The other thing that I like most is that this shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin even on the hard mode like Philips&#x27;s product do. Next, I spend around 5 minutes to shave my face and clean the shaver, with Philips I spend 10 minutes to shave only. Only thing that I do not like at this point is that it is very hard for me to shave the part of my face that is next to the ears ... probably I have to practice more ;)</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;35 years ago my Father told me \\&quot;If Your going to use an electric razor - buy a Braun\\&quot; and so began a relationship with Braun products that up until recently has lasted close to forty years. I was always eager to try the new models, Braun razors were just one of those products that only got better and more innovative as time marched on. When Braun introduced the first cleaning/charging system for the 8585 model, I bought one immediately and loved it. When the Pulsonic came out I bought the 790cc and as you can see from my review below I adored it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What set Braun apart from every single other electric razor on the planet was it&#x27;s foil and cutting block - which really did last their promised 18 months. For those that remember the multi patented Optifoil was unlike anything else on the market. Instead of uniform, same shaped holes. The foil had a wide variety of different shapes. Circles, half moons, crescents, stars and so on. It seemed random in placement but there was a method to the madness  and you really ended up with a blade close shave.The foil and cutter (linear blades designed by Gillette) when it comes to performance the cutting block and foil is the very heart of any electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being both a head and face shaver, I prefer a wet shave with a DE (double edge) safety razor or straight blade. But the process is time consuming. I&#x27;ve tried other electrics over the years and they all have been sub par on most every level compared to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Proctor &amp; Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When P&amp;G bought out Braun they made some significant changes. The small appliances division was closed down. Manufacturing of the electric razors was terminated in Germany and resumed in China with the exception of the 760 &amp; 790cc which are still, at least for the time being made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P&amp;G scrapped the original foil and replaced it with the generic series 7 one. Now with uniform octagon punch holes and many without the center \\&quot; Active Lift\\&quot; strip now this once excellent razor shaves as well as any $40 piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most resellers of replacement heads both on and off Amazon feature a photo of the original foil and cutter but ship the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; P&amp;G version which is neither .You&#x27;ll also find no shortage of disgruntled consumers who detest this stripped down and terribly compromised version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun you knew, the Braun I knew doesn&#x27;t exists now in name only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have little doubt Max Braun who founded Braun on a promise of uncompromised product integrity and performance in the 1920&#x27;s would be appalled at the products now attached to his name. P&amp;G one of last hold outs regarding animal testing, has a long history of buying and destroying wonderful products and companies - they couldn&#x27;t have done a better job if they had set out and tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I&#x27;m breaking in a new Norelco Sensotouch 3D it&#x27;s a very decent razor but it&#x27;s not a Braun. But then again nothing is, not anymore - not even Braun itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun series 7- 790 Pulsonic is the only shaver left in the Braun line that&#x27;s still made in Germany - and the craftsmanship shows. Solid build quality, beautifully balanced and smart looking.The head of the razor pivots twice as much as any other razor in the history of the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has long been applauded for their patented micro thin foil. A random  array of different sized and shaped holes. On this model you get two floating heads - each one flexes and moves independently of the other. This helps the razor glide across any bumps or curves providing a gorgeous sense of conformity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades (made by Gillette) are fastened into a cutting block and cut from side to side beneath the foil. Much like a tiny pair razor sharp scissors snapping at turbo speed. In between the two heads is another patented Braun exclusive - the power comb.It&#x27;s an odd looking zig zaggizmo that runs back forth at very fast speeds. It lifts up stubborn, hard to reach hairs as well as any that may be trying desperately to hide from their impending doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a moustache, beard or goatee you&#x27;ll really like the pop up trimmer. It&#x27;s sharp, lightening fast and at an angle that actually lets you see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulsonic Technology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10,000 pulsations per minute. May seem like a gimmick - it did to me. But after two months of use I can assure you it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a method to the madness in that the vibrations cause the hairs to stand up for easier, closer cutting.The odd thing is there&#x27;s really no \\&quot;sensation\\&quot; on your face or if your like me are a head shaver as well. Put this puppy on the back of your hand and those pulsations shoot along the bones right to your fingertips - the feeling is like a painless electric shock. (don&#x27;t ask how I discovered this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Renew system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun claims the Pulsonic cleaning system is the most advanced and intelligent in the world. Based on my experience with it, I have to agree. There are two digital meters of \\&quot;bars\\&quot; at the base of the shaver. The left is \\&quot;Hygiene\\&quot; and the right \\&quot;Power level\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level of cleaning i.e.: economy, regular and intense is determined by how many bars have disappeared from the gage. Trust me I&#x27;ve tried to outsmart it. You can bypass the clean &amp; Renew system by washing the shaver (head only) under running warm water, place it back in the charging stand and get a different reading. But why bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Clean &amp; Renew system is like waking up to a brand new razor each and every day. I clean my razor after every use, that&#x27;s at least once a day and sometimes two. My first cartridge lasted five weeks before the indicator light to change it came on.The replacement heads should last 18 months, for head shavers like myself it&#x27;s half that. Replacement heads (foil and blades) retail for about $45 -  but has them for about half that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $269.00 for mine and am quite amazed to see the razor on sale on Amazon for less than $190.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely the smoothest , fastest and most stubble free shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced with an electric. I can spend an hour using my arsenal of pre shaves and creams, my Merkur 12C HD and 23C both loaded with new Feather blades (sharpest razor blades made)  and still not get as close and stubble free of a shave as I get with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you Get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The charging station with the Clean &amp; Renew system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Power cord (for razor and station)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One cleaning cartridge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Nifty carrying case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Users manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine also included a travel razor, the Braun Pocket-Go P-70.

    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Over all the best in Braun shavers</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually get a very good shave from electric razors but this one works much more nicely on me than any other electric that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s pretty close to a blade, but unlike a blade this razor doesn&#x27;t give me skin problems like a blade does (due to my \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I have to buy cleaning cartridges. I wish I could just refill it with isopropyl alcohol from the drug store, though something like that would probably be kind of difficult for Braun to accomplish. The cartridge thing doesn&#x27;t bother me too much because they aren&#x27;t that expensive; I&#x27;m just worried that one day they&#x27;ll stop making them.</li>
    <li> My wife Janet wanted to buy me the Braun series 7 pulsonic shaver. I&#x27;ve had a number of electric shavers including a recent Braun and always returned to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I insisted it have a return policy.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprize this one gave me a shave as close to a blade as possible without knicks, so have decided to keep it.</li>
    <li> the cleaning tank does not travel well...but once a week cleaning is ok.  other than that..  the product is great.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Braun 9595 shaver, but it was due for a new head, and the battery was starting to fail, so I decided to try the new model. From my standpoint, the big selling point of this shaver is the automatic cleaning using an alcohol based disinfectant, which reduces the risk of infection. The 9595 gave a pretty good shave--not as good as a blade, but about as good as I&#x27;ve gotten from electric razor. It did have one annoying characteristic--it was horribly noisy. With this model, Braun has managed to moderate the noise level without any loss in shave quality. Aside from that, it&#x27;s pretty near identical. The cleaning/charging base also seems to be the same, except for cosmetic differences. It takes the same cleaning cartridges, and I was able to use the new base to clean my old 9595. It came with a soft travel case that I don&#x27;t like as well as the old hard case--but since the new one fits in the old case, that&#x27;s no problem for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by all the \\&quot;advanced technology\\&quot; propaganda.&lt;br /&gt;I just bougth this shaver a week ago because my Philips Norelco needed it&#x27;s heads replaced..&lt;br /&gt;so I thought i would buy a much more expensive shaver whose head costs less to replace anyways.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would pay off in the end.&lt;br /&gt;But this shaver shaves worse than my Philips Norelco! I have come to appreciate my Norelco&lt;br /&gt;shaver since it shaves even better with it&#x27;s old heads than this shaver as new...even though&lt;br /&gt;this one is more than five times the price...literally.&lt;br /&gt;Wow...just wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also with this shaver you HAVE to shave over the sink. There is no space inside it to store the&lt;br /&gt;hair. This shaver would be fair if it was $20, not $200.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver. It gives me a close shave in about 5 minutes. Easy to maintain and clean. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband wanted and needed!</li>
    <li> This is not the first braun shaver I have owned,but this is by far the best. I am truely satisfied and would recommend it to any one that looking for a new shaver. Amazon saved me $60.00.</li>
    <li> Smart! ! My husband loves it. It was a Birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and high quality. I would highly recommend this product to my friend...Excellent!!</li>
    <li> I had never used an electric shaver before purchasing this product.  I shave my face and head, and it took a few weeks for my hair to adjust to the shaver.  But, once it did, the results were amazing.  the shave is not as close as I would like, but it is pretty good.  And, the shaver is portable.  I can slip it in my briefcase and take care of any shadow before important late afternoon or evening meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Brauns customer service is good.  My razor broke in several places and Braun sent me a new one.  Overall, I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor for my husband and he absolutely loves it! Now he says, shaving is no longer a chore!</li>
    <li> Best shave from an electric I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun for 20 years. It still works well. Only problem was the cleaning base unit which malfunctioned numerous times. Decided on the new Braun after research and personal satisfaction with other Braun products. Their quality is very good in general. So I bought the new series 7. Shaves very well. Close, comfortable and without irritation or heat from friction. I find the handling and grip to be comfortable too. The base unit and shaver have some bells and whistles that I find interesting and fun. I am pleased so far with this shaver, but you will have to swallow hard to overcome the price basis. Buy it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY BRAUN WOULD DOWNGRADE TO THE NEW SERIES 7 MODELS!! I HAVE BEEN MORE THAN PLEASED WITH MY 9585 PULSONIC FOR THE PAST 2+ YEARS, I ORDERED A REPLACEMENT FOIL AS SCHEDULED AND RECEIVED THE \\&quot;NEW AND IMPROVED SERIES 7 70S\\&quot; FOIL.... IT WAS TERRIBLE! DIDNT DO A GOOD JOB IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT! I PUT MY WORN OUT PULSONIC BLADE BACK IN AND IT WORKED BETTER THAN THIS! AND WHATS WORSE IS THAT THEY DONT CARY THE OLD PULSONIC BLADE ANYWHERE! I CHECKED ALL OVER! I CALLED BRAUN AND THEY ARE ALLOWING ME TO SEND MY PULSONIC 9585 BACK FOR MANUFACTURERS SUGGESTED PRICE WHICH WAS NICE OF THEM BUT NOW I AM LEFT WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH MACHINE TO PURCHASE TO GIVE ME THAT GREAT SHAVE I USED TO GET.... WHICHEVER ONE I DECIDE ON IT WONT BE A BRAUN...</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever! Doesn&#x27;t pull. Keep head from getting clogged up and works like a charm:)</li>
    <li> I have very rough facial hair and this shaver does an excellent job.  I&#x27;ve never found an electric shaver that can give me a completely clean shave (I end up using a regular razor to finish up), but this one comes closer than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Just received it and shaved for the first time with it yesterday! Beautiful electric razor as well as the charging unit. Also very easy to read and understand are the lights and what they mean. I have used all types of disposable razors my entire life and 20 years ago was the last time I tried an electric. For people that say this isnt as close as a blade, they don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. This shave is quick and every bit, blade close!!! I have NO irritation or bumps, especially on my neck and that was my main concern. I already love it and if you are on the fence about this, don&#x27;t be....it&#x27;s worth every penny!! Braun killed it with this one!</li>
    <li> My Pulsonic shaver&#x27;s trimmer broke so it would no longer retract.  I taped it down and continued to use it so when I found a series 7 shaver system on sale after Christmas, I snapped it up.  No matter how I tried, it left stubble at the base of my neck.  The locking button broke off within the first sixty days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Braun has a 60-day satisfaction guarantee so I&#x27;ll get a complete refund (in 8 weeks).  I&#x27;m done with Braun products.  In the last several shavers I&#x27;ve owned, the base station stopped working, the trimmer broke, and now the locking mechanism broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite honestly, the newer models simply don&#x27;t shave as well as the older ones.  I&#x27;m glad to be rid of it.</li>
    <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Braun Razors for many years.  My last shaver fell to the floor and broke after years of usage.&lt;br /&gt;The price was the big holdup for me, so I just bought a cheap shaver and got used to its roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this unit arrived today, I let it charge and tried it out... wow!  Smooth shaving!&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable quiet and just cuts through the beard without a hint of being rough... again, a VERY smooth shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a cleaning unit that says it will clean the shaver automatically if it gets too dirty.&lt;br /&gt;There are three \\&quot;speeds\\&quot; depending on how deeply you need it to shave.  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far, this is the best shaver i have owned, and i plan on keeping this one for quite awhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the price is high... but consider the garbage shavers you get when you spend $50... save for it if you must.. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> After charging the shaver I tried my first shave.  Fantastic results. Head mechanism pivited correctly and locked properly.  Inserted the shaver in the cleaning recepticle and all went ok.  Next morning while using the shaver I tried locking the head but to no avail.  Pivited the head in both directions and tried moving the slide switch to lock the head and neither position of the head would lock.  After reading a couple of other reviews I am not the only one with the problem.  I probably will not send the shaver off for repair and use it just as is.  My older Braun a 7526 Syncro never once gave me a problem. A follow-up on this review.  After one year of use the razor is shedding its finish.  The paint is flaking off more than likely do to daily use of the Braun recommended cleaner solution.  I emailed Braun and their only suggestion was to send the unit in for repair. I am not a happy Braun customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/4/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paint on the razor has flaked off on the inside of the cutter head housing.  It is so bad that it clogs the small port of the cleaning chamber. I am very disappointed in the quality of this shaver.  My older model Braun a 7526 is of much better quality and I will probably go back to using it and throwing the 790cc in the garbage where it belongs</li>
    <li> I had an old Remington that my grandfather gave me which must have been 20 years old when I decided to buy this.  The mobility and traveling case are great.  The battery lasted me for a week on one trip so no need to bring the charger base on short trips.  It is always clean, (I wait until the middle indicator is on before I clean it which is usually every two days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as close as a razor shave but still good for common everyday use.  4 instead of 5 start because of this (but what electric razor can do better, I don&#x27;t know.)</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  I travel a great deal so I need a close shave and a shaver that I can plug the cord into directly.  Many other shavers only charge via the stand.  When I&#x27;m home, the stand does a great job cleaning the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap, but worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my shaver.</li>
    <li> excellent works better than my norelco</li>
    <li> very good shaver.. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> I have had these razors for years. If you want the best,this is it.</li>
    <li> The shaving head is excellent and gives a nice smooth shave.  There is much to be desired in the sideburn extension blade; in fact it is useless.&lt;br /&gt;I still rely on my Norelco to trim sideburns and under nose.  Also sometimes the main shaving head will nick the lower part of the neck; again I rely on my Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved with blades, like the Mach 3, but wanted to try an electric. For camping and travel, a cordless electric seemed like a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The physical quality of the shaver is high, and the charging stand is nice. It of course looks great with the cool blue glow and the classic Braun tilt when placed in the cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t work. Pressing lightly on my face does nothing, pressing harder does a little, but not enough to leave the house without looking ridiculous. I have tried it a few more times recently, just to give it another chance, and have the same results. The last time, I was able to partially shave an area of my face, but there were two hairs it just would never remove. They weren&#x27;t weird mutant hairs, just normal hairs that I could have easily just plucked out, and of course remove easily with a traditional blade. If I have to get out a blade to finish up, it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if mine is defective, or if my hair is weird, but it&#x27;s useless. I should have returned it, but I kept telling myself I just hadn&#x27;t figured it out. It&#x27;s now too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since switched to an old fashioned safety razor, which is the best shave I&#x27;ve been able to do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still would rather have a working electric, if only for camping. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. This shaver is loud as a jet plane, and the vibration is bone jarring. And the shave is no better than my $50 Norelco.

    <li> As a longtime user of Braun shavers (20 years), each model was a significant and welcome improvement over the last.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous models shaved so well that my wife thought I used a blade.  For the 3 months I tried this model, I used my 4-year old 6000 series to clean up everything this expensive shaver missed.  People commented on my &#x27;one day&#x27; stubble the same day I shaved with this razor.  For shaving quality, this model was a visible step down from earlier Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although quieter than other models, there&#x27;s no audible confirmation of clipped beard hairs as they&#x27;re cut, so it&#x27;s harder to brush over an area and hear whether you got additional hairs you&#x27;d missed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are improvements such as the trimmer that folds nicely away into a stylish and rubber-accented grip. It also has a clean silver look with a nice blue LED accent. Although the base is too busy-looking for my tastes, it&#x27;s shaped well and looks sturdy for being made of plastic.  You honestly couldn&#x27;t buy a better-looking shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for a close shave, this is a huge step back for Braun.  Although their new shave head does a great job of retaining clippings and catching those pesky hairs that lay flat against your skin, the overall shave is far inferior to previous models.  Worse, the entire line of Braun shavers including the 3 and 5 series all use a variation of this inferior shave head as well.  As a result, I&#x27;ve turned to discontinued Braun shavers (6000 and 8000 series) and grudgingly turned in my longtime Braun fan-boy status for a move to Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;For those with soft beards, this may work well&lt;br /&gt;Gets hairs pressed flat against your skin very well&lt;br /&gt;Attractive and accurate charging level display&lt;br /&gt;Retains shavings better than earlier models (fewer flecks fall out)&lt;br /&gt;Quieter shaver (not as noisy) than others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Pop out trimmer isn&#x27;t as wide as previous models&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer has odd angle (hard to see where you&#x27;re trimming)&lt;br /&gt;Shaver looks ergonomic, but is hard to hold firmly in hand&lt;br /&gt;Shave head becomes unbearably hot after 10 minutes of use&lt;br /&gt;Unnecessary cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;Travel case holds shaver only, not charging cord&lt;br /&gt;Charging cord is bulky (huge head on outlet side)&lt;br /&gt;With cleaning base, takes up a lot of space on countertop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun provides a 90-day guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the shaver.

    <li> Best Braun shaver or any electric I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is the second generation Braun I have owned and they just keep getting better. They are efficient, comfortable and worth every penny. The self-cleaning feature is worth the upgrade as the razor feels brand new with every use. Though you do need to anticipate the additional cost of the renewal cartridges (4 for $21.00 US on Prime) the feature is well worth it. It will be awhile before I look elsewhere for my shaving needs.</li>
    <li> This is my 7th or 8th electric razor over the past 20 years. Braun O Braun where have you been? My first Braun and never again will I buy another brand. Fast. smooth, easily gripped and on and on. Nothing negative to say.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my husband and Have been very disappointed with the performance. Dose not cut coarse hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always balanced back and forth between Braun and Norelco. I have the tendency to leave them places when I travel, so my fix was to buy a cheap travel shaver and a quality shaver for home. I&#x27;m satisfied with by Braun purchase. Does the job and it&#x27;s a nice break from using a safety razor everyday. The device has a nice feel and does a good job. There&#x27;s only a few spots on my neck that take a little extra work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lot of bells and whistles to keep the average person entertained.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best electric shaver I have ever owned. It&#x27;s pricey but I think I got my money&#x27;s worth and then some. If You&#x27;re like me and try to buy the best You can afford then this fits in with Your inner shopper.</li>
    <li> best electric shaver i have ever owned. 76 yrs old and have tried electric shavers since i was 24 or so. most recent others have been rotary electrics. i bought those because of reported close shaves with comfort for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;my recent experience? give the rotary to someone else. i&#x27;ll take the braun 7-790cc hands down, 24/7 as they say. this time i bought a really expensive rotary at the same time as the braun. haven&#x27;t bothered with the rotary shaver since it arrived. it has been unpacked and never turned on. i&#x27;d return it except that i threw the carton, packing and wrapping away. much kudos to the braun; nice close shaves with a very minimum of discomfort. thanks braun.</li>
    <li> This is my second razor of this same model, it works great and i only have to replace the head like once a year.</li>
    <li> I had a older Braun shaver but this one wins hands down. Very fast and smooth. I like the shaver display on the base of the handle. The hygiene tells me to clean the shaver every seven days. I never have run out of battery power during that time. The cleaning system also recharges automaticly after the shaver is cleaned. I very pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> after months of contemplating a $200 shaving machine, and wether or not it would be worth the price. this thing is amazing. i usually used gillet razor to shave my face razor refills every month and half or so. but with this new braun series 7 , i wont need to spend money on those razor refills again. also, i have a shaved skin tight bald head, typically i used regular clippers and an old panasonic shaving machine. it used to take me about a good 30min to shave my entire head. With this new machine, 10min tops!. my head is fresh and clean everyday now, my face is clean and shaved, my girl loves how smooth this machine leaves my face. plus it cleans itself!!! i just feel stupid not purchasing this thing years ago, wouldve saved me hrs and hrs of chaving my head, cleaning and oiling. i read reviews and was thrown by some here and there, but i decided to try it out myself. no regrets here! this thing will be with me everywhere i go</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 19-yr. old son. He had been given one of those inexpensive electric shavers last Christmas, but when he first tried it he said he didn&#x27;t like it and preferred using a blade. But he later gave it another shot, and then said it would be great concept if it just worked better! I started looking into the expensive models, but I was leery of spending this much money on a shaver, especially if he might end up using the blades anyway. After reading other positive reviews, I took the chance. Turns out he loves it! It gives him a great shave and he doesn&#x27;t have to deal with the nicks and cuts anymore. And he thinks it&#x27;s the coolest thing that it self-cleans, although you do have to replace the cleaning cartridge every 30 uses. Very happy to see this was money well spent!</li>
    <li> Every time my husband uses this he says the same thing&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t believe how great this razor is, it&#x27;s like using a blade&amp;#34;. So after hearing this so many times I felt it only fair to review it for him. Although it was a bit pricey, he decided to give this brand a try after reading all the great reviews to replace a Norelco I dropped by accident(oops). Seems to be a worthwhile purchase! Leaves skin really smooth.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun shaver over the past 15 years or so and it&#x27;s the best yet.  Sure, the display screen isn&#x27;t as fancy as my 8595, but the cut more than makes up for it.  The new head design seems to collect 99% of the clippings too.  Not cheap, but if it holds up as long as my past units, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I know you probably think I work for Braun, but let me assure you - I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the Series 7 a couple days ago and I can say with certainty that this is the very best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I upgraded from the Braun Series 5, so I was already a Braun user. I had it for about five years, and only decided to upgrade because the original blade for the Series 5 was no longer available and the reviews of the replacement were not so hot. Although that bugged me somewhat, I decided to take a chance on the Series 7. It was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. There&#x27;s no doubt: this razor shaves as close as a manual blade. The shave is perfect. Even getting the hairs on my neck are no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is no razor burn. That was actually a slight problem for me on the Series 5, but it is gone with the Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the motor is very quiet and the actual shave is very smooth. There&#x27;s no tugging of hairs or any other discomfort that some electric razors have. Everything is just so smooth, even when I shaved on two days worth of stubble. Still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of upgrading, this is actually a case where it&#x27;s worthwhile. If you&#x27;re thinking of trying an electric for the first time, this is the one to go with. Yes it&#x27;s pricey, but worth it. When you add it up over time, it pays for itself. I just hope Braun keeps the replacement blade for this model available for a LONG time! I seriously don&#x27;t know how they could improve upon the Series 7. It&#x27;s basically the perfect electric razor.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Braun Series 7-790cc shaver and I must say it shaves alot closer then my old Braun razor does.  I would Highly recommend this razor and in my opinion Braun makes the best products.</li>
    <li> Because Amazon labels this product as \\&quot;hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases\\&quot; you cannot return it.  Just be aware.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a replacement to the older model of the same product series, which served me well over 5+ years.</li>
    <li> Paid a little more then I usually would for an electric shaver, but it performs better then my other shavers. No more pulling it apart to clean, or remembering to recharge. And it feels like a closer shave without going over the same areas several times.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the performance. I upgraded from a lower end Braun and it was worth the money. Quiet, smooth, and gives a great shave. I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t automatically clean when I plug it into the bay, but pushing the button is a minor inconvenience and saves on the cleaning fluid.I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Wow, I really like this shaver.  I had another Braun prior to this purchase for about 10 years.  I thought that shaver was pretty good at its job.  It was decent, the 790 is superior.  It is not a blade shave but it is close.  Have had this unit for about 2 months now.</li>
    <li> I bought an Philips Norelco 1250X/40 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor (Series 8000) about 4 months ago, and it left me with an uneven shave and irritated skin after trying for about 90 days. I started using a Gillette razor again just to compensate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 7 arrived yesterday, and I have the closest shave ever, without irritation. My partner is happy, my kids are happy, and I feel good about the system. I&#x27;ve placed a continuous order on Amazon for the cleaning cartridges - not necessary, but very convenient.</li>
    <li> Gets better every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband.  He loves how it fits his hand and the close shave that he gets. We love Braun products and are not disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have always used a regular razor all my life and never tried an electric razor. Im 25, so its been a long time using a blade. I did my research on electric shavers and found this one to be the higher rated (and most expensive one). But worth every penny!!! OMG, i used this the first time, and was blown away at how easy the shave was. It didn&#x27;t pull, and it got just as close as my razor blade. This is my new favorite toy!! Not to mention the self Renew and Cleaning system is awesome the way you just put it in and let it go to work. I highly recommend this shaver to everyone trying to search for the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors in the last 20 years.  This is the best razor that I&#x27;ve used.  Expensive, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> This gives a smooth and comfortable shave. Much better than the Philips rotary shavers!!!  I love the little cleaning unit too, saves me a lot of time!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 790 Holiday Edition from Amazon as a Lightning Deal for a steal of a price.  I&#x27;d looked into this shaver before, but felt that at near $300 it was listed for at the time, it was a bit too rich for my blood.  When I saw the great sale price, I jumped on it and am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first electric shaver.  I am a black man, which means that I, like many others have problems with ingrown hairs.  Since I was in high school, I&#x27;ve used balding clippers to shave.  Yes, this is painful and really irritates the face, but I like a clean look, so I&#x27;ve delt with the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m over 30 now, and over the years have become educated on many what I call \\&quot;male beautification products\\&quot;, but not the bar soap like crap sold in Wal-Mart that enhance the shaving experience.  Even after using clensers, shave oil, and cooling gels from Jack Black and others, I was still scared of a razor or typical electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My perspective changed when hearing about the Braun Series 7.  I felt that if the shaver was reviewed that well, it must be good enough to try, so I did and am more than happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shave every other day and take weekends off.  With my old clippers, stubble was always there just a little and the second day showed that I truly needed to shave.  With the Series 7, my face is smooth and my razor bump problem is minimal.  Good products from Kiehls, The Art of Shaving, and Jack Black help with that problem.  My second day now looks like my old day one with the clippers.  The Series 7 takes care of the shaving quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about getting a close shave with the Series 7.  I don&#x27;t know other guys experiences, but with my face, hair grows in many different directions, so to get a smooth shave I start off with the strong setting, then go back over my face with the other lighter settings, and hit the tough spots repeatedly.  Yes, this takes a little longer, but it helps you not miss any spots, but I&#x27;m only talking maybe 5 to 7 minutes to finish shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the Series 7; it works, and you can get a close smooth shave that is painless.  Because I only shave every other day, my refills last a little longer.  Only one Clean and Renew refill comes with your shaver.  Ordering the refills from Amazon is much cheaper than buying them in a store, and you can get them automatically ordered on a schedule that you set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like electric, or wish to switch, the Series 7 can&#x27;t be beaten.king maybe 5 to 7 minutes to finish shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the Series 7; it works, and you can get a close smooth shave that is painless.

    <li> Excellent shaver, I have to work it hard with my tough chin hairs.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moE4W4ME2SPVYL]]</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun shaver user for 30 years and this model beats them all.  The shave is quick and close.  Combining the foil and cutter head makes cleaning a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable shave better than razor</li>
    <li> I really like the Braun shaver. It is self cleaning. All you need to do is push a button and it cleans. I like the design of the shaver. It&#x27;s easy to hold on to. The only problem that I have with the Braun shaver is, i have to go over and over to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> The Braun 790cc works much better for me than a wet shave and is much faster. It is also better than my older rotary electric shaver. Everytime I used it so far, it was a perfectly close shave and I had almost no skin irritations at all. Minor cons are that it is relatively loud, it doesn&#x27;t get completely dry in the clean and renew station and the cleaning liquid smells not fresh anymore after 3 to 4 weeks, so you really should replace it every 3-4 weeks. Everything else is perfect. I have used it for 5 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I have a tendency to \\&quot;over buy\\&quot; and get disappointed by the results but that&#x27;s not the case here. The tl;dr version is that you can buy an expensive electric razor and get something that performs very well for the price. Just don&#x27;t expect it to be an all-in-one solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the 790cc for a few days now and think it&#x27;s the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned. Granted, my previous razors came off retail shelves at big box stores. So, my shaving evolution has been:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 3 blade Mach 3 razor. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but still irritated me. And, I&#x27;m lazy, so I wouldn&#x27;t do it every day.&lt;br /&gt;- Remington Foil (no idea, got from a big box store) gave me a vastly inferior shave compared to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;- Got frustrated, grew a full beard.&lt;br /&gt;- Shaved the beard, used a Norelco similar to the QT4070 and a 5 blade razor to maintain. I really liked the 5 blade razor but bas still lazy which lead to infrequent shaving.&lt;br /&gt;- Norelco busted, and I picked up a Wahl Groomsman Plus with many attachments hoping for a decent all in one product. Of course, the trimmer was good enough but the shave was less than satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;- Now using the 790cc for shaving and the Wahl for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the 790cc, it really does well on my stubborn neck hairs without leaving a sandpaper look. I flipped out the trimmer but it&#x27;s a bit of joke. If you have trimming to do, pick up a simple trimmer to keep near by the 790cc.</li>
    <li> I owned the previous iteration of this shaver system, I think it was the top of the line 360 Complete #8995, for about 10 years until the base station died and I decided to upgrade the full set, rather than just replacing the base station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does have some interesting new features including a more ergonomic grip, better battery charge and cleaning indicators, and a variable 3-speed design while maintaining compatibility with the same cleaning cartridges I already stocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, however, this model seems to be very finnicky about being perfectly perpendicular to your face at all times, whereas the previous one was quite a bit more forgiving. This one, brand new with a pristine cutting foil, likes to grab and painfully tear at hairs near the edges of the foil in a way the previous model would never do. Very painfully, in fact. It&#x27;s taking some getting used to. Other than that, it&#x27;s a fine shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about a month now and I can feel safe to say this shaver is the best shaver I have ever owned. I have been spying on this shaver for about two years but was reluctant to pull the trigger on a $200 shaver purchase. Now I kick myself in the butt for not doing it sooner. I am in the US military and therefore have to shave every day. Shaving everyday can be very tough on the face using a razor or even subpar shaver (which I have been doing for years.) The pivoting head helps the contour to every part of my face. It&#x27;s fairly quiet and even cuts the hair that lays flat on my face. The clean and renew base is cool but I&#x27;d even purchase the shaver if that wasn&#x27;t offered. Slap on some Lectric Shave just before using the shaver and your face will be baby butt smooth.</li>
    <li> Wow. Hands down the best electric shaver out there. Lowest price and fastest delivery right here on Amazon. Seriously, far and away the best shaver SYSTEM available anywhere. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 shaver is an outstanding product.  it makes my shaves much closer than my previous electric razor.  i would recommend this product for anyone wanting an electric razor</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked very well for me. Especially bad when shaving the neck. It doesn&#x27;t shave closely, and if I try to get every last hair I end up making too many passes and getting razor burn.</li>
    <li> First I had a Braun 8 Series. It was a good shaver for 10 Years. For the Series 7- 790cc I watched reviews on Youtube and was reading the reviews on Amazon. All in all this shaver is the best shaver I had. It gets every hair. It is a fantastic unit. Some say, it is to loud when you shave and when the Base is cleaning the Razor. This Shaver is not louder than my old one, put has much more RPM&#x27;s. On the cleaning cycle it is a bit louder than my old unit. I love this Shaver... in the beginning you have to get use to the long hair trimmer, how it pops up. When you put the Shaver in the Base, I was not shur, was it in the Base right, because you dropped  the Shaver in the Base, without looking it.  My old shaver had a looking button before you could turned on the Unit. I purchased the unit here from Amazon by Amazon. I like to thank amazon for the fast and most customer friendly service above and beyond. Buy from Amazon and you will not get disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best shave from an electric razor yet,  per my husband!</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I was used to shaving with &amp;#34;Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive&amp;#34; and since I bought the Braun 790cc I have never used the Mach 3 again. I have very sensite skin and with the Braun I can shave without any creams, lotions or any other &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34;. (Sorry, english is not my native language, so I do not know all the correct words for what I want to say.) With it I can shave quickly, daily and have a great result. When using the Mach 3 I could only shave every other day due to skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having experienced using an old school straight razor I feel that the Braun does not give me the same close shave, but then, neither did the Mach 3. For everyday use, it is more than enough and I don&#x27;t have the hassle of creams and cleaning up after. (The Braun cleans itself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one downside in my opinion, but it will not stop me from using the 790cc: The shaver head gets warm after a while. This is not really a problem, but as far as I can tell, if it stayed cold like other Braun models, it would be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Nice quality razor. I hooked it up and it began a cleaning and charging cycle. It worked really well on my first use. I have to check the instructions as there are a lot of personal settings that can be changed.</li>
    <li> As a person looking to get the best performance from an electrical razor I did much research and looked at basically every other top of the line electrical razors and none seemed more pleasing to my eye or as advanced with the many features it offers than this Braun. I was at first skeptical like many who read these reviews about this razor are, but after buying this razor I soon learned these bad reviews were wrong.I did not have any razor bumps after shaving for the first time and my face was \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot; also the self cleaning feature is AWESOME and very convenient.Another note is that the pop up trimmer works well and is best rated as an 8 out of 10.I honestly can say this razor can cut any type of facial/body hair and not just thin hair as many seem to claim.To get to the point this razor is probably the Best razor on the market and you will be completely satisfied as was I with this beautiful piece of equipment. AND hey,if not Braun offers a 60 day guarantee in the packaging so you can always get your money back. Hope this helps you skeptics out there!</li>
    <li> The shaver is slick with a lot of nice features.  My only reservation is the pop-up sideburn shaver; it is a little awkward to use.  I like an older model for that feature.  But the rest is great.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a gift, my girlfriend told me that I was always missing spots (with my fairly expensive remington 3xcircular blade electric razor\\&quot;. I kept telling her \\&quot;it is what it is, I am not complaining, and a shave is a shave.\\&quot; She bought me this and WOW!!! Before some major appointments, or when I want to look more professional I would use a Mach 3 straight razor... With the 7900cc my face is compairably smooth to a straight razor, I mean of coarse it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;quite\\&quot; the same, but pretty darn close! This Braun electric razor is so pleasing to shave with! And the foil&#x27;s!!! Sooo much better then those 3 blade electrics!!!! Plus it tells you when it needs to be cleaned due to the hygene indicator! It runs it&#x27;s cycle fairly quickly, even dries itself! And after all that IT HAS A FRESH LEMONY SCENT!! The smell isn&#x27;t over powering at ALL, just enough to make you think to yourself \\&quot;my that smells fresh and clean\\&quot;. I shave every day, and every day I clean it (even though the hygene indicator is down only 1 bar\\&quot;) I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about a month, and It still says the cleaning material is full! (the instruction manual say the fluid is good for 30 cleans or somethin before needing to switch it out\\&quot; - and there are 3 lights on the charging station that tells how much fluid is left) If you have the money to spend on the best electric razor of 2012, well - my opinion is \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; and this shaver is everything and more then what I expected! I recommend to everyone! THIS RAZOR IS AMAZING!!! Thank you to my lovely girlfriend! I hope this lengthly review gave some insight to someone, I do not have a single bad thing to say about it!</li>
    <li> This one has a good feel to the face as well and also cut close like a razor.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good shave this is the one.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s recommended by my friend and bought for my father as birthday gift. he likes it so much. great product</li>
    <li> Since I hadn&#x27;t owned an electric shaver in several years. I was skeptical. I am very pleased with the quality, ease of use and comfort.  It&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
    <li> Upgraded from an old braun freeglider 5710 that died after 5 years of continuous daily use!  I shave pretty much everyday.  After much research online I decided to go with Braun for the good reviews, brand name &amp; quality as I was happy with my old freeglider and the $50 Amazon credit back in december.  I&#x27;ve used the shaver for about a month now daily.  And clean it right after daily as well.  It&#x27;s been a month so far and my cleaning liquid indicator is still at the full level so I am hoping it will at least last another month before I buy a refill.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the shaver itself.  My old freeglider was getting very rough on my skin even though the shave quality was exceptional.  The 790 feels very smooth and I am done shaving in 5-10 minutes max.  However I have to say I am disappointed with the shave closeness as my freeglider definitely did a better job always right after a shower.  I&#x27;ve tried every possible scenario, pre-shower, post shower, pre-electric shave liquid but I can&#x27;t seem to get a really good close shave.  My skin feels smooth but when I look closer I can see stubbles in some of the most tricky areas like the neck and jaw areas.  To get a really good shave you have to pull your skin up real good and run the shaver back and forth at least 3 or 4 times.  Since I shave daily around the same time  I can easily tell the difference between my old freeglider and the new 790.&lt;br /&gt;To summarize:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good cleaning system.  Shaver feels nice and new after every clean.  Never tried running it under water.  Will probably do during my travels sooner!&lt;br /&gt;- Gives a smooth shave.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Shave quality is not as good as my old Braun freeglider.  this was a bit of a disappointment as I would have expected Braun to improve on the shave quality because that&#x27;s what makes a shaver good.  The cleaning and other bells and whistles are nice to haves but not what defines a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if&lt;br /&gt;1)you are getting a good deal on amazon&lt;br /&gt;2)you like braun&#x27;s quality&lt;br /&gt;3) your old shaver is dying and you don&#x27;t want to spend your gas money on blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the best shave quality then maybe there&#x27;s another shaver out there but I am going to stick with this one until it dies or fails..are getting a good deal on amazon&lt;br /&gt;2)you like braun&#x27;s quality&lt;br /&gt;3) your old shaver is dying and you don&#x27;t want to spend your gas money on blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the best shave quality then maybe there&#x27;s another shaver out there but I am going to stick with this one until it dies or fails..</li>
    <li> Nice close shave.  Husband likes it - now we will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Braun made a wise decision to compete in their lower-end lineup using Chinese labor yet still keep their high-end models made in Germany to ensure high quality. I have used Braun for decades after trying out Remington and Norelco models. The Braun provides a better, faster shave, especially when my beard is a few days long. The pop-up trimmer actually functions well and is easy to see. There is a built-in lock that holds the flexible head at about 35° to make it easier to get up close and personal in hard-to-reach areas like the sideburns and nose. It is easily activated and deactivated with one finger, even while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving now for 43 years, 36 of those with a Braun. The first two were made in Germany and lasted nearly 20 years each. I expect this one to last just as long. Blades are relatively expensive they are designed to last for 18 to 24 months. If compared to how many straight razor blades you would need for 18 to 24 months these blades are dirt cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, there is no better way to get a close smooth shave for such a low overall cost.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, but it does not seem to function quite as well as I would have expected. The cleaning system is a bit clumsy overly complex.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have</li>
    <li> Not even close to what I thought it was.  Just plain didn&#x27;t like it...sorry!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding shaver. Loved the floating head to reach those hard to cover areas.</li>
    <li> I know when I go this the reviews were mixed.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it was a great purchase!  Works better than my previous Braun (which I also still have and love...it&#x27;s my travel shaver).  The 790cc unit is such a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> My husband bought a Braun over 20 years ago and has just now&lt;br /&gt;had to replace it.  Braun makes an excellent Shaver.</li>
    <li> I have had a few Braun shavers before, so purchasing the latest offering from Braun really was a no brainer.  Their reputation is upheld by this product.  Everything works as it should: effortlessly, comfortably, logically, and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grasping the shaver in your hands one immediately recognizes the quality of the build and comfortable ergonomic design; the handle fits in different positions in one&#x27;s hand depending on the part of the face or angle required at that given point of shaving.  There is curved groove on the facing side of the shaver where the thumb sits quite comfortably (I know, I keep saying \\&quot;comfortable\\&quot; and \\&quot;comfortably\\&quot;, but they are the most accurate words to use).  Right where the thumb rests is also where one would access the trimmer; just a quick and effortless slide upwards and you are ready to trim your sideburns and then just as easily close it and continue shaving, all without having to lift the thumb from where it rests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is very easy, and it does so with aplomb.  The shaver runs smoothly over one&#x27;s face.  Once can choose to either take one&#x27;s time and shave carefully and get all those pesky hairs, or if short on time, no problem, just switch to one of the three optional electronic shaver settings and shave more quickly without hurting the skin.  It may not be as close, but it still shaves very close and will last most of a typical work day.  I could go on, but don&#x27;t wish to bore you with too many details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean and Renew system (as with my previous Braun shaver) works perfectly; it quickly, easily, and effortlessly cleans the shaver&#x27;s head, leaving it smelling wonderfully lemony, and charges the shaver completely to boot!  So the next time a want to shave, I look forward to the lemony smell and a clean head running along my skin.  I had a Panasonic shaver with its own version of a cleaning system, but it PALED IN COMPARISON to the Braun&#x27;s.  The cleaning solution cartridges for the Braun shavers aren&#x27;t too expensive and only need to be replaced maybe every other month (depending on how often you use it - myself, I clean the shaver only twice a week at the most even though Braun suggests doing so every day, but this really is not necessary)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is an EXCELLENT SHAVER that works very well without anything that would prevent one from having a comfortable (Oops! There&#x27;s that word again), close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, when I purchased this right here from Amazon, they had the best price ANYWHERE!  Thanks Amazon :)ren&#x27;t too expensive and only need to be replaced maybe every other month (depending on how often you use it - myself, I clean the shaver only twice a week at the most even though Braun suggests doing so every day, but this really is not necessary)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is an EXCELLENT SHAVER that works very well without anything that would prevent one from having a comfortable (Oops!

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun for a long time and wanted a new one.  This one is the best.  I get a super close shave very fast.  I&#x27;m completely impressed!</li>
    <li> The shaver came quickly and as advertised.  It seems to work well for my husband (leaves him cleanly shaven and silky smooth).  Only complaint/concern is that it seems to require cleaning more frequently than the prior Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> This replaced my 15year old braun.  The old one still worked well, but was showing it&#x27;s age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Norelco ($100 range) and it was pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent razor.  Good cut quickly and relatively quiet.  Much quieter than the Norelco.  Cleaner works very well.</li>
    <li> When replacing my mid-priced Panasonic 807x shaver after it broke, I wanted to try a different brand and got many recommendations for Braun as sturdy and amazing shaves. The difference between top of the line and the one immediately behind it was only $10, so I went with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a few days, Its great, but possibly not worth $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I like the battery readout. Its no longer roulette, with the Panasonic it would often just die in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cleanliness reminder is a gimmick but useful even if it just counts the shaves.&lt;br /&gt;3. The washing fluid is actually alcohol based. Panasonic had detergent soaked cartridges and I couldn&#x27;t tell when to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;4. Shave seems close enough, though I feel any one of them nowadays gets you a close shave. It gets the hair on my neck, though not with particularly amazing ease.&lt;br /&gt;5. Trimmer is fast, strong and effective&lt;br /&gt;6. Speed buttons is possibly a gimmick. How often would you vary the speed of your shave?&lt;br /&gt;7. I like the quick clean on the base. Comes out smelling lemony fresh in 30s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The base is massive. I think a better space-efficient design is called for which still keeps the same amount of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;2. Once you&#x27;ve plugged in the cartridge, you&#x27;d better not move the base around or the liquid spills. That&#x27;s bad design - can&#x27;t they invest in some gaskets?&lt;br /&gt;3. For this price, shaver should be wet/dry.&lt;br /&gt;4. The lock button only locks in one position. That&#x27;s not evident, and mine didn&#x27;t work, so I had to exchange the unit. Something must have broken inside it, which is a surprise because the metal switch implies sturdiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $200, I expect perfection. This is great but with a few flaws.</li>
    <li> I never used an electric razor before and was skeptical that this could give me a shave as close as my Gillette fusion but I was wrong. It gives a great shave and does not leave razor burn like manual shavers. Lastly this was 20 plus dollars cheaper than the same one at BEST BUY!</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Series 7 and I&#x27;m completely pleased.  I purchased one of the first Series 7 shortly after they were released, but decided to replace it, even though it works fine with no issues. (I sold it on eBay)  The new shaver head foil on the 790cc-4 is a bit different and I have to admit I like it better than the older design.  It also seems to flex more when shaving.  I also like the ability to choose the three different intensity settings, for the me the medium works just great.  I&#x27;ve seen quite a few bad reviews for this shaver, and I&#x27;m not knocking those who don&#x27;t like this shaver, but for me it shaves vry close, with no neck rash at all.  I came close to replacing it with the new Panasonic wet/dry shaver that was around the same price (their top of the line model)  but the head on that thing looked bulbous, and I just wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to try something new after having owned the Series 7 before and with very good results.  Sooo, with the Braun 60 day return policy in place, I&#x27;d say if you are on the fence, give this shaver a go, you can always get a refund, but for me, I&#x27;ll be keeping my second Series 7 and most likely be buying another Braun product when it&#x27;s time to replace this one.</li>
    <li> The noise is way too loud when shaving.</li>
    <li> Love love love this razor!  It actually gives me a closer shave than a wet razor.  I&#x27;ve had a Braun razor for about 14 years before it finally gave out so .. well worth buying another in my book!</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver is superb.Easy to use,smooth , no cuts.I have been shaving regularly now and saved from the cuts of the manual razor. Would recommend this who ever is looking for electronic shaver.</li>
    <li> very close shave, almost as close as a razor. Let&#x27;s be honest NOTHING shaves as close as a razor, or lasts as long then with a razor. Some people have very sensitive skin especially around the neck area of the face, for a lot of men this is a problem area as usually the beard is most tough in this area. Too much pressure trying to shave the stubborn hairs on the neck part can very easily irritate the skin and cause razor burn or rash. Lubrication is a big help in shaving, wash your face first with warm water and soap, then lightly dry it. Now the pores will be opened up more and this will make it easier to shave especially with an electric razor. Also try a pre-electric lotion this can help too.</li>
    <li> So much improved from my six year old model.  Good design, cuts close and comfortable.  Glad I spent the money now.</li>
    <li> What my husband needed for his shaver. Quick response. No problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I have a 7 year old 5 series Braun I passed to my wife after I changed the blade/foil for her legs etc.... I decided to upgrade to the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver, Silver and was blown away after the first use. I had to hesitate on leaving a review because I wanted to put it through the paces to ensure it was worthy of the 5 stars I gave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY coarse hair making it a challenge for any manual/electric shaver to get the job done and most importantly in a comfortable manner.  The 3 selections for light, medium and heavy beards (3 days growth) have proven useful with excellent results from closeness to comfort EVEN ON THE NECK.  I have a safety razor I use for extremely close shaves and the Braun can rival it without all the prep of a manual razor. The pulsonic works in my opinion to help transition the foil during a pass to help catch hairs that don&#x27;t want to be cut, reducing the amount of passes. The hygiene/battery indicator at the bottom appears to do as its intended (let me know when to charge/clean). Very ergonomic handle (Non Slip when wet) when held from any position. The charging dock is easy to use, simply place the shaver in the dock and it does everything else (Cleans, Charges and Heat Drys). It comes with a travel case and a little brush to clean the blade/foil with and........ well, what else do you want me to say? After 2 months of daily use it holds up as I had hoped. Its shaves close, comfortably, easily, warrantied for 7 years and purchased it for $170. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHAVER!  Piece of advice! Use Lectric Shave before use every day.</li>
    <li> Wha a great shaver but the gimmick of constantly buying cleaning cartridges takes time, shipping and make it a bummer.</li>
    <li> I like it, but not really sure it shaves any closer than the 3 blade brand that I have.  What I really like is the self cleaning feature.  All in all, I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> From the day I opened the package, the highly touted cleaning unit has not worked....at all.  The customer service at Braun sucks because now I have to pay to have the unit shipped to a service center four hours away and do without the shaver for who knows how long.  Considering the cost of these units, I say overpriced and under-deliver says it all!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend requested this razor for his birthday so I purchased it for him. He suffers from razor bumbs and heard that this product could help eliminate this over time. He has used it once and it was definitely the closest shave he has had.  I am happy that I got this for him. He seems pleased.</li>
    <li> good price on a very good Shaver</li>
    <li> very smooth and quiet, i love it so much, and it looks really very good.&lt;br /&gt;very very good good good</li>
    <li> Smooth lots of battery life, an all around great shaver.</li>
    <li> Great except the trimmer</li>
    <li> Nice close shave, really like the automatic cleaning process - a great time saver!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for our son. He loves it. Says it gives him the best shave he has ever had. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> best shaver i have ever used.i have a tough beard,but soft skin and cannot use regular disposable razors.too many cuts and irritation.this gives a close shave quickly with no discomfort.in fact this recent purchase replaced an aging and barely functioning previous version of this.i used it daily for probably 6 years,so figure out cost versus disposables.</li>
    <li> I took this shaver back because it just didn&#x27;t shave close.  Huge disappointment.  My 20 year old Remington micro screen with original screen and cutter shaved closer than this thing.  As did my 10 year old, ~ $30, Braun 100.</li>
    <li> Its an amazing razor simple to use and in 5 to ten minutes your done... Use it to dry shave... Noise doesn&#x27;t really bother me... Watch tv or something else for the major part of the shave and just use a mirror for the areas that need special attention</li>
    <li> A LITTLE PRICEY BUT AFTER SHAVING WITH IT I CAN SEE WHY. IT GIVES AS CLOSE A SHAVE AS A RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;THE CLEAN UP IS A SNAP.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as promised but it is comfortable on my face.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave as close as i would like...I has not been updated other than colors in a while</li>
    <li> I just bought this razor for my son&#x27;s 18th birthday.  The FIRST time he used it the locking mechanism broke.  Save yourself a lot of time and grief and buy another brand.  I have to take the brand new razor to a repair shop OR send it back to Braun and wait 8 weeks to get my money back!</li>
    <li> The product arrived in good order and it delivers one of the best shaves I have ever had. Great razor and with the personalized settings can deliver an optimal shave for most anyone.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]]The Braun Series 7 shaver is amazing. It gives my husband the closest cleanest shave of any shaver or razor that he has ever owned. It does not irritate the skin. I am so happy for him and of course me when I can kiss that clean shaven face! Thanks Braun</li>
    <li> This shaving machine has saved from skin irritation. Every day when I used my Gillette Fusion my skin was irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used it a couple of times my skin feels much smother and the irritation is gone.</li>
    <li> All my adult life I have used a blade to shave, but I wanted a foil shaver, I picked the 790CC Braun, this new shaver gives me different adjustment options as far as the areas of my face that needs to be shaved. The shaving is superb and just as good as shaving with a razor blade. The cleaning station is awesome, just put your shaver in it and forget about it. The shaver gets cleaned, sanitized, dried and charged. The shaver holds a charge long time and the indicators on the bottom of it let you know how much charge is left and the status of the hygiene of your shaver. Great shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a competitor&#x27;s model that was creating a lot of discomfort on my neck. While the 790cc doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close it still does an excellent job and no more razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with the shaver is the brightness of the light when it&#x27;s docked in the charger/cleaner base. Since there is an open walkway between our bedroom and bathroom it&#x27;s too bright at night. My solution is to leave the base unplugged until I want to charge or clean the shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  Well worth the price, and I have no regrets. Really happy I went ahead and spent the money.</li>
    <li> Anything is good, I like it very much. I got this for Father&#x27;s Day and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This one is German made.  Make sure you get the ones made in Germany.  Braun moved many of the cheaper models to china and there is a definite difference in the performance and feel of the product.  This one shaves fast and smooth.  The trimmer is awkward vs previous models but if it lasts 15 yrs like my previous one, I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver that I have ever owned.  It does not give me any irritation on my skin and not only that it is the closest shave I have ever received from a electric shaver.  I will definitely buy this shaver (Braum 7-790CC) again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, is the sound a bit big, clean shaven, and manual razor almost, but why does it feel with the shaved after, the beard grows faster than usual?</li>
    <li> Perfect........best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.......AND.......with a hygienically clean razor every time!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second Brauns Shaver, and the last one was Brauns 8585&#x27; and it has last me 5 years where I only have to change the head once.  I have tried many other brands before Brauns, and I can say that the other shaver really hurts my face after shaving.  Sometimes when the beard gets a letter longer, other brand like norleco and Philip which I have tried feels like it&#x27;s tearing the hairs out your face!  OUCH~~  But after I gave Brauns Shaver a try, I can tell you I love it, and here are the reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;1. It give a very clean and comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;2. Auto-Cleaning really helps, you will never forget to shave&lt;br /&gt;3. The look of this thing is great in your bathroom, it&#x27;s like a furniture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The cleaning Solution gets costly, but i will say it&#x27;s worth it&lt;br /&gt;2. The shaver is a little expensive: $200, but if you divide by 5 years, it&#x27;s only $3.50 per month. if you add the Solution and the shaver head you need to change, that will be around $7~8 per month if you use it for 5 year.  Well worth it since you do shave everyday, or a least every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend all to give this a try, and if you don&#x27;t like it, Brauns has a 30 or 90 day buy back guarantee~</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a panasonic razor I&#x27;ve had for years.  One of the problems I had with the panasonic was it would get wet inside and have smell musty.  I&#x27;d clean it and even experimented with spraying cologne in the water to keep it fresh but would invariably happen again.  I bought this with the thought that I would not use the self cleaning system because I don&#x27;t want to have to buy replacement solution for the cartridges.  After using it though and checking my razor it is amazing.  I checked into making my own refills but it would end up costing more than the $4 per refill and I&#x27;m sure they will last a while.  I&#x27;ve done about 6 cleaning cycles and the indicator still says the cartridge is full.  Even if you&#x27;re not going to use the self cleaning system I&#x27;d recommend the razor.  I use a razor every other day and electric on the alternate days because otherwise I get razor burn.  This razor is perfect for this purpose and does a great job.</li>
    <li> This is fourth different electric shaver I have purchased thinking it would be better and it wasn&#x27;t.  Takes forever to shave with this shaver and does not remove whiskers.  Have to go over and over same area again and again.  Hard to keep clean and definitely not the shaver to get.  Have resorted back to shaving cream and multi blade razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used - bar none. It shaves the wide open spaces quickly without the need to continually re-shave the same area.  It also gets into the small nooks and crannies very well.  Most surprising is its ability to handle those areas on my neck where my beard grows in a swirl pattern.  This has been a problem for every other shaver I have used.  The cleaning system is very thorough and presents me with a clean fresh razor every morning.  The Norelco I used previously would not come clean no matter how much I rinsed and brushed it. Frankly, after a while it was gross. The Braun is a much better machine in every aspect save one.  The blue light on the power switch remains on all night and it is bright.  Fortunately, this is not an issue for me thanks to the layout of my bedroom and bathroom.  Just be aware that it could be an issue for you depending on your floor plan.</li>
    <li> Terrific product, works very well.The Braun is a reliable brand this is our second in many years, very happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> Had 3 Remingtons , they were ok but couldn&#x27;t hold a candle to this Braun. Love everything about it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, I advise!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned hands down. The wash system works really well, gets all the hair out of the shaver.</li>
    <li> Works better and shaves closer than any of the many we have purchased before.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, BUT THE CLEANING CHEM IS FAR TOO EXPENSIVE, THAT WILL PUT ME OFF.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun 6550 for over 10 years. It is similar to this shaver but of course much older. I&#x27;ve replaced the head twice and the rechargeable batteries once. I like the shaver, but the motor is starting to lose steam and a replacement would cost more than I want to spend on an old shaver. I&#x27;m giving this history because I think that some of the men who are looking to buy this new shaver need to know what I am comparing it to. Preferences vary and I know some men who have always used rotary shavers and are not happy with anything else although they have tried. Rotary shavers hardly work at all on my beard. On me they pull, hurt, and irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal preference has been the oscillating type like the Braun so I come to this new shaver with a beard already conditioned to shaving with a Braun. I always thought the 6550 gave a decent shave although I had to work on it a bit and there were always some hairs on my neck that it could never cut. My beard is as wiry and thick as you will find. The hairs on my neck grow in a swirl pattern which are difficult to get and often after spending minutes trying to stretch my skin and making repeated passes to attack those few strays I end up with a close shave but my skin is irritated. Even then I still have to resort to making a pass over my neck with a razer to catch the strays that can&#x27;t be picked up with the electric. So that&#x27;s the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new shaver is like a miracle to me. It is not as noisy as the old Braun but sounds like it is humming at twice the frequency. When I touch it lightly to my face I can hear all the hairs being cut. Two passes with this shaver and the hairs are gone. I can keep on going for even closer shaving and without pressing on the shaver at all in about 3 minutes there is simply nothing to left for this shaver to cut. The cutter in the center of the head works wonderfully to raise and cut the hairs that lie against the skin. There is no irritation and the shave is as close as I can get with a razer but without any flecks of blood that I always get from shaving closely with a razer. This shaver cuts my beard superbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other little things to mention. Since this shaver includes the cleaning solution you can&#x27;t get it shipped any faster than UPS ground (ORM-D). So if you have Prime and you want it tomorrow it isn&#x27;t going to happen. It took a week to get to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base works fine. Yes, the solution is a consumable item and not very cheap but it really is nice to have a clean shaver. So what&#x27;s that worth to you? If it&#x27;s worth nothing to you, then buy the Braun a few models down that have no cleaning station. When I think of all the time I have spent fastidiously disassembling shavers to clean and lubricate them I think this new cleaning technology saves my time (which is money, don&#x27;t you know?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels great in the hand. The rubber coating on the palm side helps with the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous Braun had the floating combs and the tilting head that this new one has. However, the action on the old shaver was stiff. I would have to press way too hard to make the head follow the contours of my face and the cutters never moved up and down at all in actual use so far as I could tell. In fact, I used to just lock the head rather than try to put up with this poorly implemented feature. This new shaver improves on Braun&#x27;s innovations and these features actually work now. It takes only the merest shaving pressure to enjoy the benefit of the tilting head and floating combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair trimmer works fine for sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look closely at the instruction booklet and you will find the 60-day return instructions. It involves calling Braun and then shipping it to them with your receipt or printed invoice or what-have-you to prove you bought the shaver somewhere. It&#x27;s nice to know you can return it it if you hate it. It is truly \\&quot;to each his own\\&quot; when it comes to shavers. As I&#x27;ve said I can&#x27;t promise this shaver will work for you but it sure performs great for me.s. As I&#x27;ve said I can&#x27;t promise this shaver will work for you but it sure performs great for me.</li>
    <li> This shaver is expensive, but it is worth the money.  I have had a Braun shaver for years, and my old one finally wore out.  The 790cc relatively quiet and very comfortable.  It easily handles three or more days growth of beard, which no shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned could do.  I also like the fact that they cutters are now supposed to last 18 months, while those for my earlier Braun shavers only lasted a few months.  The trimmer is also better designed on this model, allowing for better visibility and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the shaver clean and recharge in the base every day, but I like the fact that this one can also be cleaned manually under a running faucet if needed.  This shaver appears to be very well designed and well made.  Based on my previous experiences with Braun, I would expect it to work well for several years.</li>
    <li> best shave in years, plus the razor heads are available for many years to come, unlike norelco who seems to put a product out and then a year later change everything so you can&#x27;t get the heads anymore or they are cheap knock offs and don&#x27;t work well,</li>
    <li> good investment, my skin feels great i thought it may not work because of some sensible parts on my neck and that it will take a lot of time for my skin to get used to it but no, first day worked great.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d pay this much for a razor but it&#x27;s very much superior to the Remington razor. A closer shave and no matter how hard I try, cannot give myself a razor burn that draws a little bit of blood like before.</li>
    <li> I brought this shaver about a month ago and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is by far the best shaver I have owned, it gives a fast close shave every time. I always thought all shavers were about the same, a good but just alright shave, well I was wrong. The Braun Series 7-790cc Shaver is the best shave outside of using a razor out there.</li>
    <li> Thank you again for yato understood my problem.</li>
    <li> The Shaver works great.  The Cleaner never drys I have to get the hair dryer to get it completely dry.</li>
    <li> I tend to obsess a bit over purchases and did a fair amount of researching about this shaver before deciding to buy it.  Several other reviews similarly say to buy this, you&#x27;ll love it and I want to add another comment to support this idea.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver about a month and think it&#x27;s great.  There is a label on the shaver reminding us that our beards take a couple of weeks to get used to going from blades to electric, and I have found that to be the case, so give it a little while.  That doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t get a close shave at first, just takes a little longer.  Now, the shave is fast, comfortable and easy.  I love the cleaner too and for those minor concerns about the trimmer being awkward, it&#x27;s no big deal.  I&#x27;m not sure how good a job it does, but I use a separate trimmer for mustache grooming anyway.  I&#x27;ve traveled with the shaver, held the charge great and didn&#x27;t have to clean it for several days and it cleaned up great when I got home.  Best parts are no more water, shaving cream and EXPENSIVE blades that are supposed to last up to 4 weeks, but start leaving &#x27;shaving zooters&#x27; after 1-2 weeks!  If you can afford $200 for a razor, buy this one, you&#x27;ll be delighted and wonder why you didn&#x27;t get it sooner.  Lastly, buying from Amazon is great and they have a great deal on the replacement cleaning cartidges.</li>
    <li> Smooth, very quiet, effective</li>
    <li> i have used several rotary head shavers in the past and had given up.  i have a fairly heavy beard and just thought forgetaboutit.  however, i was told by my barber about this shaver and decided to give it a try.  it works great.  i cannot go more than 2 days without shaving as it starts to pull as growth gets longer, but for every other day shaving it is easy to use, not irritating and works very well.  i would highly recommend this.  it would be great if it was a wet/dry, but dry works :</li>
    <li> this shaver is as effective and comfortable to use as it is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;for me nothing ever delivers as close a shave as a regular razor (or straight razor), something about runing the blade counter to the direction the hair grows. But I don&#x27;t allways have the time or patience to lather up and shave.&lt;br /&gt;the Braun 7 series is quick,it&#x27;s a mighty close shave, no redness whatsoever even around neck area, and it cleans itself. You just have to help it a little bit with your wrist and hold it close to your face, it takes on from there.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money to buy one I see no reason why you should not.</li>
    <li> This is a high-end product.Going from a blade to shaver does take a little getting used to. So after a month of using the shaver, i am very impressed with the whole system.I would recommend this product.(Using amazon is also recommended).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He has extremely sensitive skin when it comes to shaving, and has a heavy beard. With this shave he hasnt complained at all, and i have seen a reduction in the irritation that he get gets. He loves everything about and hasnt had one bad thing to say about it.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; ... pop it in the holder, press a button and it runs through a cleaning cycle in 30 minutes or so. Unlike several Amazon critiques which claim the alcohol cleaning solution evaporates well before the expected 30 day usage period, I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case. I&#x27;m wondering if maybe those folks don&#x27;t store their shaver in the holder every day, thus leaving it open which leads to faster than expected alcohol solution evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I only rate with three stars? Because it doesn&#x27;t come even close to shaving as close as a safety razor. Requires two shaves per day if I go someplace in the evening which requires a clean shaven appearance. That dreaded &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; is more like a stubble when my morning shave is with the Braun Series 7. It does as good of a job as any other premium electric shaver but certainly no better.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have owned. I have had a few different electric razors over the past many years and the last 3 of them have been Braun razors. The most recent was a series 5 that has served me well for many years and will continue to do so serving as my travel razor. This new series 7 is terrific. I am getting the best shave I have ever experienced. I like the clean &amp; renew system and have found it much cheaper to purchase the refills here on Amazon in packs of 4 rather than individually at the store. I expect this razor will serve me well for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. I have used braun for many years. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> comfortable, safe, affordable, super tough, clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am burnt rewriting the review cause its too long, too short, or too enthused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get one. they&#x27;re awesome. don&#x27;t need pre shave. the cleaning process lubes the blades for smooth cutting etc ...</li>
    <li> The perfect gift&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable, the quality is very good, made ​​a very decent gift.&lt;br /&gt;:) I am from Asia, I liked it, but I can not afford it, it is a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> After Norelco changed their head, I needed to find a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have found this first. It&#x27;s AMAZING! No pulling even if I wait 10 days to shave. With Norelco, 2 days and it was going to be a painful shave.</li>
    <li> Grand son said it gives a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Product is nice and does a good job shaving.Only complaint is not very durable. It was dropped and the locking mechanism broke but the razor itself still functions.</li>
    <li> This razor, as well as the rest of the Braun self-cleaning line, are great!  This is my second one in 5 years.  Although the replacement parts and refills are a little pricey as well, you get what you pay for.  Had to buy a new one after accidentally running over the old one with my car.  While waiting for this one to ship, I had to go back to shaving with manual razor, and I don&#x27;t feel it even came close to doing as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for half a century now (gasp!) and have used any number of electric (last, Panasonic,) and blade (last, Gillette) shavers; I have a medium, fast-growing beard, and my last e-shaver did not seem to \\&quot;like\\&quot; some thicker solo hairs on my face (we \\&quot;olds\\&quot; get those).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is very easy to use - large handle, so my large hand can grasp it firmly and give it plenty of control; articulated head, so it follows facial shapes and contours flawlessly; allows selection of heavier or lighter cut; has two graphs built into the handle bottom, one for remaining battery power and the other for degree of \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; (built up debris) in the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver makes less noise than my previous e-shavers, including my battery-powered travel Braun, and is so thorough it is much faster yet longer-lasting, At the end of the day, I actually have no more \\&quot;six o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; than, and on occasions less than, when I use a blade shaver. As well, the shave is non-irritating and smooth - the ultimate test is my wife&#x27;s hand over my cheek, and my beard passes that test flawlessly. Other benefits - no cuts, and I am presenting occasional basal cell carcinomatous areas on my face (skin cancer) so I have to be careful and not chop - the blades used to catch the occasional skin irregularity, and after surgery definitely had troubles with any scar area or skin variation; this shaver doesn&#x27;t bother or irritate and mows down whiskers without regard to where they are or whether they are the occasional thickened, wire-imitating resister - even the shirker hairs that try to lie down out of the way of the shaver do not escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a travel case (unfortunately, the case does not accommodate the charging cord), a cleaning and charging base (the cleaning fluid is apparently no more than 40% \\&quot;rubbing\\&quot; alcohol, perhaps with a small amount of lubricant? meaning Braun is taking the H-P printer path - pay high prices for refills, so search for sales), a two year warranty (extended a year with my credit card), cleaning brush (one can opt to clean with brush and water and some detergents, but they caution you not to brush the foil screen itself) and has what appears to be a durable, robust build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish Amazon had honored my Prime membership and had not taken nearly two weeks to deliver (and still had easier ways of contacting Amazon for customer service flaws)- but that&#x27;s about Amazon, not this truly five star product - the best electric shaver I have owned and had the pleasure of using. (If you have a very different beard than mine, your mileage may vary). I&#x27;ll update in a few months.les), a two year warranty (extended a year with my credit card), cleaning brush (one can opt to clean with brush and water and some detergents, but they caution you not to brush the foil screen itself) and has what appears to be a durable, robust build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish Amazon had honored my Prime membership and had not taken nearly two weeks to deliver (and still had easier ways of contacting Amazon for customer service flaws)- but that&#x27;s about Amazon, not this truly five star product - the best electric shaver I have owned and had the pleasure of using. (If you have a very different beard than mine, your mileage may vary). I&#x27;ll update in a few months.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for 10 months. On the plus side it has a very long lasting battery,quiet running and I like the cleaning system. I use this about every fourth shave  and clean with water on a daily basis. On the minus side it doesnt shave very close and you have to go over your face several times to get a good shave. My old Remington actually gives a faster ,closer shave for about a $130.00 less money. I believe that it will be a long lasting shaver and I havent had to replace the foils yet which I had to do with the Remington every three months. In closeing,I think it is to expensive for the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> First off, my one \\&quot;irritation\\&quot; with this shaver.  I does not come with a plastic protective cap for the foil.  There is a nice, hard sided carrying case that comes with the shaver.  There also is not a power \\&quot;lock out\\&quot; switch to prevent the shaver from accidentally being turned on while packed in your luggage.  Hopefully the hard sided carrying case will prevent accidental powering on of the shaver while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good part is that this model shaves better than any of the four previous Braun models I owned.  It is not quite as good as shaving with a blade, but it&#x27;s darn close (pun intended).  The comfort level is very good, even when shaving against the grain of my beard.  When I do that with a blade, I always draw blood.  Hair pickup is excellent.  With my previous Braun shaver, it could never quite get all the hairs on my neck.  The 790cc has no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, an expensive shaver, but so far worth the money.  Now, if it will only hold up for 5 years like my previous Braun, and if the Li ion battery will last longer than the NiMH batteries I always had to send off and get replaced every three years at the shaver service center with all my previous Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> I have had the Series 7-790cc for about 6 months and have never regretted the purchace. I get 98% the closeness of a razor shave without the nicks.  However, I have had to learn a method to overcome the depilatory effect if I don&#x27;t shave for two days or more. Using an acute angle the first pass shaves close enough so I can then use the company recommended 90 degree angle to finish the shave for a  very close shave without it pulling my beard. I highly recommend the shaver for a consistent close shave withoutthe nicks. The clean and renew system works like a charm for me even though it is a bit loud.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 other Braun Models, and this one is superior to both of them.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to worry about pulling hairs with this new shaving head, and it cuts well even when it&#x27;s under the chin and around the mouth.  The other two are okay, but this one really is a notch above them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 790cc for six months now.  On the plus side, the automatic cleaning feature is wonderful.  The refills are expensive though and they only last about a month.  Also, the center strip of the head does a good job of lifting and cutting the odd hair on the neck which escapes other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, this technology does not shave as close as my old middle-of-the-line rotary shaver.  This is especially true under the jaw and on the neck where no amount of pulling and stretching the skin seems to work.  In fact, I have given up trying to get a really close shave and just take whatever I can get out of this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this shaver does not live up to the hype of the other reviews on Amazon.  It works, and the self-clean is great, but I would say a fair price is more like $125.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this razor for a while but the price kept holding me back. This razor is worth every penny. I thought the cleaning system might be gimmicky, it&#x27;s not at all, and the shave is as close to a bladed razor as I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Best ever razor! Gets every single hair around my nose, which has been a challenge in the past.</li>
    <li> I love the close shave! I&#x27;ve used a Norelco all my life but I&#x27;m definitely getting use to this Braun product. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I decided to try out this razor longer than 30 days to see if it got better, but the shave is just not as close as promised and misses spots. Very disappointed after researching various brands, thinking this was worth investing in.</li>
    <li> I was using a rotary and was not happy with the closeness of the shave.  And my expectations were not unreasonable as an electric is no substitute for a safety razor.  However, the Braun Series 7 is an excellent shaver.  It does take a few days to get adjusted to it but now my beard does not look like 5 PM at Noon!</li>
    <li> This shaver is inferior to any Norelco/Philips shavers I used as far as close shaving is concerned. The quality of the product is way under par.  After three month of use the pivot lock does not function. They have no service centers in New York  and they do not provide for return mailers. I learned my lesson and will never ever purchase any of their producys.</li>
    <li> Never too late in life to get a new razor. Decided to get new Braun instead of replacing cutters on Braun 10 years old. New razor is excellent product - good design, good engineering with superbly smooth non-abrasive shave. Particularly innovative cutting system that works.</li>
    <li> After deciding to spend more money on a better quality shaver I did a lot of research. I compared prices. The Braun Series 7 on Amazon was my choice. I checked the prices for about 3 weeks(they tend to fluctuate)and when I was happy with the amount I purchased it.It arrived in a very timely manner. I read the instructions, especially about shaving BEFORE washing the face, and about letting your face &amp; whiskers get use to the shaver. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy &amp; satisfied with this shaver. Its a close shave,minimum time,&amp; best of all the stand cleans the shaver for me.I highly recommend this shaver .</li>
    <li> This was a gift purchase, so I cannot provide my personal details as to how this product functions. However, the feedback I have received regarding the performance of this product has been exceptional! He has basically said, &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, provides an extremely close shave, the cleaning station is efficient, and overall this has been an incredible razor.&amp;#34; Hearing how happy he is with this razor, lets me know that this was a product worth investing in!</li>
    <li> Replaced an older Braun shaver with this new unit.  This one is much improved and the shave is great.  I am disappointed with the side burn trimmer it is small and weak. I liked my older one better.  Also these blades seem to dull quickly and are way too expensive to replace. Wish I never had to shave again!!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a shave nearly identical to a close shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable and its pivoting head gets into all the nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning and lubrication system work well, and I always feel that I get a clean, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> that I tried this out figuring if it sucked I could get my money back with 60 day guarantee..... I love it!! Shaves closer than with a blade, and so far--knock wood--so easy.... Shaving no longer an onerous task!!</li>
    <li> Great razor! A little loud in chargeand clean cycle but, given the superb shave one gets, that is not important.</li>
    <li> Before I start off, it might be useful to understand the difference between electric shaving and shaving using the conventional razor for those who have not experienced the both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the razor, we usually apply some kind of a lubricant like gel or foam. Using the electric razor, I have found the lubricant to be optional. Using the razor we essentially wipe the blade over the shaving area, while using the electric razor I feel, it is more like a scrub. The scrubbing does not necessarily mean that the skin would get irritated more but for some people and brands of electric shavers, it does. If there is any skin irritation/burn 1% Hydrocortisone ointment provides relief in a matter of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying lubricant may also not always get you better results in all shaving zones when using an electric shaver. However, sometimes it does. If you apply a lubricant and shave with an electric shaver, the cleaning process may take you a little extra bit of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick note on the shaving foam vs. the Gels - For me the conventional foam yields better results than the newer gels. The cheapest Gillette shaving lather yielded better results than the much more expensive Neutrogena gels. Therefore, you may want to experiment especially before you settle for an expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, it might be useful to mention that I switched to the 790cc shaving system after having used Philips/Norelco-Razor for 18 long years. My facial hair is not one of the toughest but is oriented randomly enough to make my shave hard to do a perfect job especially using an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I classify my shave into four zones based on the hair types/difficulties I encounter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zone 1 - on the cheeks: Shaving is easy in this zone and I have been able to get close shaves by several means wet and dry/electric and razor shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Norelco were nasty on this seemingly straightforward job. The shaves were usually not perfect and if I tried to shave multiple times, the razor burn would be nasty. The discomfort went to the extent that I had to actively research and discovered the Hydrocortisone and it became a norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Braun, this area is a piece of cake as it should be and there is no need to apply steroids any more. Also notable is the fact that the number of scrubs it takes is considerably less than a Norelco - almost the same number of strokes is required as the conventional razor. Using a shaving foam/gel further reduces the number of strokes and the subsequent skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zone 2 - the chin &amp; below the cheeks: Hairs in this zone seem tougher but the reality is that the hairs grow closer to the skin to be harder to pick. For me the random orientation begins here. Here Braun is clearly superior to a Norelco and comes very close to the conventional razor in terms of the number of strokes and related skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure of application of an electric razor in this zone is considerably higher. However, with 790cc the increased pressure would not result in a razor burn. Any attempt to mimic the results of 790cc with a Norelco may result in severe skin burn and irritation. I would therefore switch to a razor with Norelco in this zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zone 3 - the moustache: My moustache is is sensitive and the lining with the upper lip if irritated would take considerable time to calm down. There also seem to be some random oriented hairs and then of course are the ones that are otherwise perfectly visible but hide along the nose when it comes to shaving! Along the nose, Norelco shaves the best as its circular cutters can find hairs better. However, 790cc did not lag too far behind if I allowed a few extra strokes, which is easy to do, as the burn factor is absent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;790cc is also benign on my upper lip lining, Norelco and conventional razors were outright nasty! On the flat areas my experiences were a mixture of Zone 1 and 2 with 790cc faring the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zone 4 - the neck: Even though 790cc does a much better job than the Norelco, I feel that the conventional razor is the champion of the shave on the neck. 790cc however does produce acceptable results with some foam applied. If you have to the time to shave pinched skin, you will get the same results as the razor. You may not want to try Norelco in this area since the resultant burn may last for days and the shaving might need a razor to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a word on the cleaning system. If you want the liquid inside it to last, always rinse the 790cc under hot water and shake it to remove water before you put the 790cc in the cleaner. I did find traces of shaved hair under the foil after a full clean cycle. I do clean the foil with a brush and detergent once every 2 weeks. If you tried to clean the cavity in the cleaning system every other week, you would find good amount of smudge there as well. I consider this normal. However, what I do not like about this system is paying for the cleaning cartridge every month. I therefore perfected an 85% rubbing alcohol, 10% glycerin and 5% lemon oil (all purchased from a drug store) concoction for my cartridge that seems to work well and save me the monthly charge. Do not use other forms of denatured alcohol as some of the preparations may contain potentially dangerous additives. Some people have reported that mouthwash also works well but I doubt that since the mouthwash are water based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well so much for the review. Hope you enjoy the 790cc!0cc faring the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zone 4 - the neck: Even though 790cc does a much better job than the Norelco, I feel that the conventional razor is the champion of the shave on the neck. 790cc however does produce acceptable results with some foam applied. If you have to the time to shave pinched skin, you will get the same results as the razor. You may not want to try Norelco in this area since the resultant burn may last for days and the shaving might need a razor to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a word on the cleaning system.

    <li> Works great! Almost as close as a blade, quick shave, less than 5 minutes and done. 100% better than my old foil shaver.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]]I have been using Norelco razors since high school.I am now 65. Every 2or3 years for all of my adult life I have purchased the latest top of the line Norelco on the market. Way back many years I did buy a couple of other brands to check them out, but they always seemed like they were yanking the hairs out one by one , so I always stuck to Norelco. The last couple of Norelcos that I have had didn&#x27;t seem to be better than the last. After doing lots of online research, and reading Conumer Reports I decided to try the 790-cc Braun. I was very skeptacle, but what the hey, you&#x27;ve got to try something different once in a while. I have been astounded at the difference. When people wrote that they got a shave as close as a blade, I fgured they were just rationalizing their purchaces. Well, they weren&#x27;t. The shave is remarkable. It is quick,confortable and amazingly close. There are some negatives. The cleaning-charging system seems a little funky and the travel case is very flimsy compared with the Norelco. Other than those couple of minor details I really believe this is going to one of my best puchases ever. One other thing. This is the first product evaluation I have ever done, so i hope this isn&#x27;t too long and has been helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years now and 99% of the time I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver because blades just don&#x27;t seem to work well for me.  I can tell you that in using this fine electric shaver I&#x27;ve received the best shave out of any other electric razor I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve been using the razor for about two weeks now and here are some of my thoughts on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First and foremost you get a very close shave.  Isn&#x27;t that what we all want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charging station that also acts as a cleaning mechanism (more on this cleaning device below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaver is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery Life: Can go many shaves between charges even after a thoroughly shaving each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The razor head is built very well.  I&#x27;ve never had any issues (though some have stated it can pull hair).  I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor that had a foil on each end and a foil/trimmer type mechanism in between two foils.  This works well for cutting the hair on the neck area or stubborn hairs that the regular foil systems can leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning system:  I&#x27;ve seen some people complain on the added costs for this cleaning system.  Yes, it&#x27;s true you must replace the cleaning cartridges.  The manual states that each cartridge should last for approximately 30 days with daily use.  I haven&#x27;t used the system long enough to see if I can get a full 30 days or 30 cleaning out of it on a single cartridge.  I&#x27;ve found that what works for me is a cleaning after every 2nd shave.  So that said I would think I could get at least 60 days between cleaning cartridge replacement.  I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if that will work.  There is a neat display on the bottom of the shaver that displays battery charge remaining and hygiene.  I&#x27;ve noticed that if I shave twice between cleanings the hygiene bar still shows at least two bars remaining.  When cleaned it&#x27;s nice to shave with a fresh feeling shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving speed.  The \\&quot;pulsconic\\&quot; technology really shines here and the pivoting head is a real plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The build quality of this razor is also phenomenal.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some of those other lower quality shavers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Razor trimmer is a bit awkward compared to other razors I&#x27;ve used.  First of all the trimmer is very narrow compared to others I&#x27;ve used and seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charging station is a bit noisy when the clean cycle first starts out.  Why is this?  One reason is the fact that the shaver turns on and off during the cycle and the sound of the shaver reverberates through the plastic cleaning enclosure.  This very small annoyance only lasts for probably the first 1/3 of the cleaning cycle and I can easily live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion it&#x27;s rare that I give a product an endorsement much less a 5 star rating. This product definitely deserves both.  I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge and purchased this fine Braun product.  I highly recommend it for all men that want a close shave, in fact, in my opinion this is a must have if you want a good quality shave using and electric shaver.  I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;ll be able to use this shaver for many years to come.gy really shines here and the pivoting head is a real plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The build quality of this razor is also phenomenal.

    <li> Very good shaver! Easy to use. Love it so much!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest shaver ever. It shaves much closer and smoother than the previous 7680 model I had. It also irritates my face much less. I would recommend it highly. I love all the luxury features that come with it. It is the Cadillac of shavers.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;Having purchased a Braun 340 in 12/10 as a gift for my son (who decided he wanted a cash gift instead) I decided to keep it myself. Having been a Gillette blade guy for the past 5 decades, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shave - near as good as a Gillette blade!&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to step up to the Braun 790. Having used it just one week I tell all that it AS close as a Gillette blade and without the nicks. No burning or irration either. Follow the instructions by shaving before washing your face and use a splash of electric pre-shave lotion and get ready for one of the best most comfortable shaves of your life.&lt;br /&gt;The quality and construction of the unit has also impressed me. It is manufactured in Germany - not China. My only qualm is the cleaning system that came with it (you have no choice as it is a package deal.) Since the razor is so easy to clean with either supplied brush or under running water, the cleaning system is superfluous. The cleaning system appears to me as a way for Braun to increase their revenue by forcing you to buy replacement cartridge cleaning solution for this razor and others in their product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/5/2013  A follow-up on my previous review. Guess what? My \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; station went south on me. It plugged up and would not drain. I attempted to clean/unplug it several different ways with no positive results. A replacement station costs more than $50 and I&#x27;m out of warranty. So buyer beware.</li>
    <li> About 5 years ago I upgraded from a Braun 5 series to a Braun 7 series.  The pulsonic microvibrations seemed like overkill at the time but I got used to them after about a week.  Two weeks ago I needed to replace my 7 series and went back to a 5 series (565) because of price.  Boy did I miss the microvibrations then!  The 565 acted like its battery was dying when it is put under the load of my one-day-old whiskers.  I had to move the shaver so slowly across my face or it felt like it was pulling the hair rather than shaving.  I ended up with a very close shave which made me happy but at almost 3X the length of time as my 7 series.  I was able to return it and purchased this series 7 and have been very happy with it.  This is what I expect from a quality Braun shaver and it did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I have used my Braun Series 7 shaver and found it very comfortable, gives a nice close shave and is simple to maintain with this automatic cleanser.</li>
    <li> BEST RAZOR I&#x27;VE EVER HAD. Very close shave and love the cleaning/drying feature. Only complaint is that the trimmer is narrow compared to my other Braun razor. I&#x27;ve shaved my head and a half inch blade isn&#x27;t wide enough for my head</li>
    <li> I received my Braun Series 7-790cc shaver system on February 11 and began using it the next day.  Everything was packed nicely into the box and it was easy to unpack and set up.  The first thing I noticed was that the power plug is huge!  Instead of using a plug that routes the plug straight down the wall or to the side, this sticks straight out - several inches!  This is the only thing I would change about the unit because in our bathroom, that gets in the way and even if it didn&#x27;t, it would just look bad.  I was able to correct this by using a Power Strip Liberator with a flat plug on the end, routing that down and hiding the massive Braun plug behind a box of Kleenex in the corner of the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from a Norelco rotary shaver system.  That unit was very old and needed to be replaced.  I opted to switch to the Braun for several reasons:  maintenance, battery life, quality of shave, and skin irritation.  Norelco may have addressed some of these issues in their newer models, but after experiencing drawbacks in all of these areas on three different Norelco shavers, I was ready for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week and a half to adjust to the new shaving system (foil vs. rotary).  However, once I was used to it, the Braun seems to provide a more close shave with far less skin irritation.  With my old rotary, I always had to use a facial lotion after shaving because my skin was irritated from the many passes necessary to get a good shave.  Although some areas require just as many passes with the Braun, my skin is no longer red and itchy after shaving.  The only area of my face that the Braun does not outperform the rotary on is right under my jaw line on the sides of my face.  Everywhere else, including my chin, appears to be getting a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does have three sensitivity settings that are easily changed by buttons next to the power button.  I tried these for a few days and then gave up - using it only on the strongest setting.  It might be helpful if this shaver is irritating your skin, but it isn&#x27;t for me so I just keep it on high.&lt;br /&gt;Many people have commented or complained about the Clean &amp; Renew Solution.  As I wrote above, I started using my system on February 11 and that first cartridge lasted until April 16.  I run through the cleaning procedure after every other shave.  According to the manual, the solution will evaporate naturally after about two months.  My first cartridge lasted that long with using it every other shave, so I see no reason to hold off on running the cleaning cycle beyond two shaves.  I would add that as the manual states, when the cleaning solution level indicator goes to red, you have no solution left and it will not even attempt to clean the razor - so plan ahead when it turns yellow and order more then.  I would also add that this system really does give a feeling of a renewed shaver and does an excellent job of cleaning the hair out of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with Norelco rotaries for about 16 years, I made the switch to the Braun foil system and haven&#x27;t looked back.ongest setting.

    <li> really nice one. and my boyfriend likes it.</li>
    <li> The New 7 model has more  improvements than the old 7 model. I believe Braun was able to fix all the problems.  Finally, you can say: \\&quot;This is Braun!\\&quot; the Charging station has different logic for the cleaning  cycle. The  Biggest improvement of the 7model  is the head fine adjustment.</li>
    <li> My bad.  Assumed this had a clipper on it like my old Braun.  For this kind of money it should.  Now this very expensive shave will get even more $ as I need a clipper.  Other than that, it is the best shave you can get from an electric.  Very smooth.</li>
    <li> I was a user of a similar Braun shaver for a couple of years and loved it.  It was the best shave I had ever found.  However, when it came time to replace the heads, I was lured away by a Panasonic: [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue]] due to the wet shave ability (see my review of that shaver under that product - I gave it 4 stars).  After 4 months of use, I just couldn&#x27;t get as comfortable shave with the Panasonic as I had been getting with the Braun, so I decided to return to using the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I figured I&#x27;d treat myself to this shaver instead of going back to my older Braun.  After one shave with this one, it&#x27;s just no contest for comfort.  The Braun is the clear winner on my face, plus I like the clean &amp; renew feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this one a solid 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The value gets to be questionable at this price, but certainly a good shaver.  Since I have to use it everyday I put the extra into this hoping to make life easier.  It gives a good shave if you pay attention, press harder to get closer.  Still not like a razor but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like one either.  Definitely quieter than a $70 Braun I have lived with the past few years.  If I haven&#x27;t shaved for 2-3 days this does make more of a mess, but cleans up fine over the sink.  Normal use I pop the head off after each shave and tap it out then I never have problems with pieces falling out during shaving.  The alcohol wash is kind of a nice easy way to clean it.  Just take the container out and put the cap back on when not in use and it lasts for a long time.  Overall this was expense but with everyday use it was still worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun Shaver.  I almost did not purchase the shaver as some of the reviews made me concerned.  I then read the reviews for the competitors and decided to come back and take a chance.  I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always found Braun shavers to work great when new.  In the past the problems started when it came time to replace the cutters and foil and the replacements never seemed to work like the original.  My last razor was a Braun 8985 and I tried the replacement parts recommended by Braun and the alternative ones recommended by reviewers at Amazon.  Neither worked well.  I hope the replacement parts for this razor work - I will find out in 12 to 18 months - but for now I like the razor a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job on the hairs on my neck - something my old Braun 8985 with the replacement parts was unable to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a more awkward shape than my old Braun 8985 in that it is larger and does not feel natural to hold - However as it does a great job I can put up with this.  The razor has a lot of new displays and features I don&#x27;t really need but are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a change in how the cleaning unit works.  In the old unit you put the shaver in and it automatically started.  With the new unit when you put the shaver in the unit recommends a cleaning type but does not automatically start - you have to press the button.  I suppose this is for people who don&#x27;t want to automatically clean every time to save the cleaning fluid.  The only issue here is that the instructions say the fluid evaporates over time and ends up needing to be replaced if you use it or not.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade as some stated, It shaves about like my ten year old Braun. Does a decent job for an electric razor but for the money I&#x27;m not blown away.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. The difference between the series 7 and my old pulsonic is incredible.haves very very close and very fast. Great shaver.</li>
    <li> It is so good that I nearly can&#x27;t live without the shaver.It is the best one that I&#x27;ve used.I like it very much.</li>
    <li> What a shave! The shaver is made in Germany and is excellent quality. Unfortunately the base is made in Hungry and is not well made. Both bases I received do not work properly. Amazon&#x27;s customer service is the best and have gone beyond any other retailer. Unfortunately the problem is in quality of the base, not the shaver or Amazon. If you want a fantastic shaver and don&#x27;t care for cleaning system you&#x27;ll be very satisfied, otherwise look for a alternative.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave!  Quiet.</li>
    <li> From day one and counting...best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric. Zero pulling ever, like shaving with a blade and just as close. Cleaning system works very well also. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and well worth the money.  Do your face a favor...buy it!</li>
    <li> Works great.  A very close shave, as close as a blade and a lot more comfortable. Only complaint is the need to purchase the &amp;#34;cleaning fluid packets&amp;#34; on a periodic basis. I guess you could do without those cleaning fluid packets and clean the unit manually.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco for about 6 months prior to buying this unit. I was looking for a nice unit with self cleaning, and it was up between the Braun 790 and the Sensotouch 3d models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase of the Braun. It is a much closer shave when compared to the, admittedly, lowend Norelco that I was using. I have never had such a close shave with an electric razor. My face actually feels completely smooth after using it.</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to justify spending this amount of money on a electric shaver, but, having finally done that I can say this is the BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER I HAVE EVER HAD!!  I have used other brand shavers and for many years another model Braun, but none of them compare to this one.  I don&#x27;t know if it really is the vibrating technology or something else, but this shaver does a great job of cutting close and making your face feel smooth, plus, it looks very sleek too.</li>
    <li> First off, I have had a few electric razors in the past. None of which I have liked, because they either didn&#x27;t cut close enough, or it would snag stubble and irritate my face. The series 7 is what Ive been looking for all my life! I hate shaving with a blade, cause that irritates my face as well, but the series 7 doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all. And I&#x27;d venture to say that it gives me a closer shave that my fusion did! All in all, I love this thing, and have recommended it to as many people as possible!</li>
    <li> The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! I&#x27;m not joking. This is actually ridiculous because I always thought that electric razors had to be inferior. My beard is pretty thick so I take 20+ min shaving in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using norelco  products for around 15  years thinking they were the best. The last one I had was the architect and it was pretty nice. I would replace the head ever six months or so at ~$35 and was happy. Then I checked amazon and they&#x27;re over a $100, which is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad had bought the braun 7 and liked it but never really told me how good it was. Its seriously the closest shave I&#x27;ve had since using a straight razor. I&#x27;m very glad I spent the $60 extra bucks on a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing.  Braun&#x27;s online questionare helped identify their best suited shaver for my needs.  Well worth the effort.  Ergonomic, powerful, stays charged a long time.  The best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver and I&#x27;ve owned several.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas but gave it to him about a week early. He loves it and uses it every morning before going to work. Before this he was just using disposable razors so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other electric shaver, but he seems to like the results.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy this years ago!!!!!!! AWESOME shaver!!!!!</li>
    <li> got a very good shave always used a blade</li>
    <li> HAD MY LAST BRAUN SERIES 7 FOR 8 YEARS, BOUGHT THE NEW SERIES 7 AND EVEN A BETTER , CLOSER SHAVE.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver a few months ago. I do not have a single complaint about it. No irratated skin, close cut. I am glad I spent the extra money and bought the best.</li>
    <li> hi,&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this wonderful shaver and I&#x27;m very much satisfied by this product. It shaves simply smooth more than my regular razor. I should have bought this item long back. Though it costs 200+ $ its worth it. My wife and my daughter could finally see the smooth skin on my face. :) No shaving foam or after shave needed! Its automatic cleaning unit is also another amazing thing. It cleans and delivers a fresh razo each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a 5 star for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Amazon delivered this promptly in a safe packaging! Kudos to Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of different shavers in the past, but I must admit that this is one of the best yet. It took some getting use to, now my face feels really good after a shave I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Really close shave&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> comfortable feeling.very good.790cc is a razor,i like it very much,especially to recommend ,fell very good,amazon services is very good.so the next in the shopping.</li>
    <li> Really great product.</li>
    <li> I have owned dozens of electric razors through the years.  None of them cut as close as a razor notwithstanding the fact that they all say they do.  This BRAUN 7 Series does NOT cut as close as a blade, but it is about as good as it gets!  And not having to lather up and rinse, etc., makes the small compromise well worth it.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves a clean shave!</li>
    <li> I just passed the six month mark using this shaver almost daily and wanted to post my experience. This shaver provides a VERY close shave and is a great replacement for the multi blade razors. I have tried electrics in the past and the blades would get dull within a few months, it would start to smell, and your face would start to hurt when the blades start to pull your stubble as opposed to shaving it. I have not experienced that yet with this Braun model. I do like the clean and renew function in the cradle and use it regularly. I have been through five clean &amp; renew cartridges in six months. Hopefully I can go a year before changing the blades. I still keep a razor around to get a clean edge on my sideburns occasionally, and I&#x27;m done with $3 /week for razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;** Update May-2017: I have been using this product for 2.5 years and it is still working great. Replace blade cartridge yearly and clean &amp; renew cartridges every 1.5 months</li>
    <li> Close shave, quiet, comfortable to hold. No negative aspects.</li>
    <li> UMMM... I am not sure if this really works or not... I will sometimes run it across my neck, face, etc... and it will not cut any hair... Other time it will.... This is disappointing given the BRAUN name and the price... Maybe I am using it wrong... would love comments on this maybe advice?</li>
    <li> 5 stars, a great shaver system. Wish I had purchased one sooner. Great comfort for my sentive skin and wire like beard. Battery lasts for ever and the automatic cleaning system makes maintaining this shaver a breeze.101 percent satisifated. Shorter shaving time and a closer shave. Their my be a shaver as good as this one, but none better.</li>
    <li> Used the Braun 7 series for about a month now and there is a big difference from my previous shaver extremely happy</li>
    <li> I was about to give up on electric shavers. The Braun series 7 restored my faith in Braun and electric shaver. The series 7 gives me a very close and smooth shave. I think it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> amazing!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a gift for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;convenient, clean, quiet.</li>
    <li> The Braun 790cc-4 is much quieter than my previous Braun.  The shaver itself is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base unit arrived with a faulty sensor - it thinks the cleaning cartridge is empty, so will not clean the shaver.  Fortunately my old cleaning unit still works so I can use that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON WILL NOT ACCEPT RETURNS OR EXCHANGES FOR THIS PRODUCT SO YOU ARE STUCK IF THERE IS A PROBLEM !!!!!</li>
    <li> So why am I giving it a 3?  The electronic cleaner won&#x27;t even turn on.  I have to ship it back to be repaired.  The factory should have inspected before shipping.  I was told by the company --after hour + of holding that I would have to ship it back for a repair.  Finally got company agree to pay for shipping as the electronic cleaner NEVER worked.  Very frustrating experience with this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - so I finally got the company to pay for shipping to repair it, but I didn&#x27;t pay for a factory reconditioned rather a new working one. I would just as soon have a brand new working one rather than a repaired one that was initially defective. That however is not an option with them. Not very customer service oriented company. Still love the shave even though it can&#x27;t be cleaned.</li>
    <li> This product is only average for me, I read reviews that praised it.  I find it nothing special for me.</li>
    <li> This review is from a long time Braun shaver user with a tough beard and sensitive skin (a bad combination).  A little long, but hopefully worth the read...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stared using an electric razor right at the time Braun released the Syncro.  The Syncro shaved fast, smooth, and quick, with little irritation, though it was a bit rough, especially on my upper lip.  I shaved with this razor happily for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always looking to improve, I would try each new top of the line Braun razor that came out after the Syncro, including the Activator, 360, and Pulsonic, all of which were terrible and I would go back to the Syncro.  As near as I could tell these razors were lacking because of the crazy blue center cutter with very sharp edges - the shave was not close at all and would cause my cheek&#x27;s to break out in red bumps which would not go away even after more than a month of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a few years ago Braun came out with the 390cc, a good looking razor that for the first time shaved as close as the Syncro, but more comfortably - they did away with the crazy blue center strip and improved in other ways I&#x27;m sure.  Strangely this model was the 3rd down the Braun shaver line, but shaved significantly better than the top of the line Pulsonic.  I secretly wished that Braun would take the great shaver head on the 390cc and apply it to the Pulsonic, I would be happy to pay more for the extra bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, the 790cc-4 (the \\&quot;-4\\&quot; is most important!)  has a similar head to the 390cc, only the 790 is a better all around razor.  It&#x27;s more powerful than the 390cc so you get a faster, smoother shave, yet is very close and every bit as comfortable.  It also works very well in difficult areas such as under the ears and on the neck (I suffer from difficulty shaving my neck which is all but cured with this razor).  I can safely say this is the worlds best electric razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is very easy to use and more than worth the cost of the cleaning cartridges which free you from having to clean the razor yourself, you can lock the shaver head for hard to reach areas of your face (though I never have found a real need to lock it), there are sensitivity settings (this really works, not a gimmick, though I just leave it in the normal middle position), you can wash the head with soft soap while traveling (haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try this yet but a welcome feature that was also on the 390cc), the pop out trimmer is more than acceptable, and the overall design it terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its like driving a Porsche across your face, shaving is fun again.  I&#x27;m so impressed I&#x27;ve also bought one for my father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the money, buy it and be happy.  Thank you Braun!n worth the cost of the cleaning cartridges which free you from having to clean the razor yourself, you can lock the shaver head for hard to reach areas of your face (though I never have found a real need to lock it), there are sensitivity settings (this really works, not a gimmick, though I just leave it in the normal middle position), you can wash the head with soft soap while traveling (haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try this yet but a welcome feature that was also on the 390cc), the pop out trimmer is more than acceptable, and the overall design it terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its like driving a Porsche across your face, shaving is fun again.

    <li> Had this for 3 weeks now and what an awesome shaver. I have always had other Braun shavers that I thought were pretty good. And they were,but...this one is the best that I have owned. I have a heavy tough beard and this plows thru it with comfort,precision and no irritation,at least for me. The price is a tad high,but do your research and try one of these. Far and away the best shaver that I have owned. After owning this a while....I do have a minor complaint. It takes a few passes to get the chin area. I do not know why, it just does. I still love the razor.</li>
    <li> Work pretty awesome and very convenient. I had a norelco that was top of the line but they changed the quality of the replacement head it&#x27;s pretty garbage now. Decided to go with this one and I&#x27;m totally happy I did.</li>
    <li> 2nd razor we&#x27;ve owned. First one outlived itself!  Could not have asked for any better.</li>
    <li> Worst shaver I have ever used! Just pulls and tugs my hair. Be careful because it will cut you and make you bleed. Save yourself time and money and avoid this product. !!!Beware, it cannot be returned!!!</li>
    <li> Having been an electric shaver user for over three decades, I thought it was time to upgrade from my 8 year old deluxe Panasonic unit. Looking at the various reviews, etc., plus trying an entry level version of a current Braun shaver [at a friend&#x27;s house during a recent visit], I took the plunge and spent the big bucks on the 7-790 system. I am happy to report that this shaver delivers on all fronts. It is solidly constructed, performs quite well, looks durable and the inclusive systems-clean up approach functions nicely. With a couple of months use under my belt now, I find nothing to criticize. The shave is close, comfortable and done efficiently. Perhaps after seeing how long the refills for the cleaning cartridges last, and then cost to replace, I might have a different impression, but for now...I am a happy camper. If your budget can handle the expense, treat yourself to an enjoyable, effective shaving experience with this Braun 7-790 system.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple different shaving systems, even lower priced Braun shavers, and nothing comes close to this one. It actually works on the neck and I have a sensitive neck. The only issue I have with the shaver is the trimmer. It does not trim very well. Other than that, the shaver has been amazing.</li>
    <li> After using this shaver system, I found I enjoyed every aspect of it. Unfortunately,  I need to use the cleaning system to be more helpfu. Not withstanding, I would recommend this shaver right now to anyone.</li>
    <li> good shave for electric ... probably the best I have used for an electric ... still have to touch up with razor , especially under the chin ... convenience trumps latter concern..KS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user literally for decades. So when it came time for a new razor I naturally started looking at the Norelco 7000 series. Based on the reviews I decided to go with the Braun. WOW! This is absolutely the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor. If you&#x27;re torn between the Braun Series 7 and the Norelco 7000, go with the Braun and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever from an electric razor and over the last 40 years I&#x27;ve tried Remington, Norelco, and even earlier Braun models.</li>
    <li> Good improvement over prior models.  For a foil razor, cuts pretty close.  Cleaning/charging stand mechanism works well and quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make it simple. This razor makes shaving seem more like just wiping the hair off your face. You won&#x27;t regret buying this one....</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very easy to use and the price was reasonable.  My husband loved his Christmas gift.  it&#x27;s a shaver system that self cleans!</li>
    <li> Bought this top-of-the-line shaver for my husband who needs to be clean shaven for his job. After reading other reviews, it seemed worth the big sticker price to secure him an outstanding product that gives a close shave without cuts or nicks or missed spots. The Braun Series 7 delivers. It is every bit worth the price and is matching his Gillette Mach 3 shave quality after just a couple of weeks. It took a few days for the shaver to adjust to his face (or vice versus) and he couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Braun. My only concern is about the need to purchase the Braun cleaning product. I appreciate the reviewers who suggested possible end-rounds for using the blue cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> Works the best of all the electric razors I have ever had.  Close shave, long lasting battery, easy to hold with lots of shaving choices.  Now for the real important info, my wife likes to use it  on her legs.  Which  means its gentle enough for her and that saves me money on buying a separate razor for her.  If I had to pick a negative I guess it would be that the first time you use it you have to be careful not to press too hard.  If you do you may end up looking like a teenager that just tried to shave for the first time.  Lots of razor burns and blood spots.</li>
    <li> My husband has always used a Braun razor.  It does a great job.</li>
    <li> its a little bit hard to shave around your neck, but it&#x27;s a great shaver overall. I have purchased 2 of these. the first purchase was great and everything worked perfectly. However, the cleaning station of my second purchase was not working and would always give me a red sign showing that the cartridge needed to be replaced, even when i placed a brand new cartridge. i contacted the seller and he instantly refunded me. i was on the phone with him for literally less than two minutes. i explained the issue, he refunded me, and i placed a new order. now i am waiting for the new order to arrive at my place. great product. i would totally recommend. and also great customer support. props to the seller, you did a great job</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shaver.  I get a great shave... very smooth and I have a heavy beard.  What else can I say.... It is pricey but the shave and convenience makes up for the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a 10 year old Braun shaver I was quite happy with.  I had to replace the old one as the battery would charge it for only 1 or 2 uses.  I did some research and found out it was the best rated shaver on Consumer Reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has out-performed others I have owned, including the older Braun and a number of Norelco&#x27;s.  I get a closer shave without any razor burn.  The cleaner unit works like a charm.  The cleaning liquid lasted longer than the estimated 30 days, so I was pleased by this.</li>
    <li> I have been using nothing but Phillips rotary shavers since I started shaving 25+ years ago. I generally buy their top model with all the features, but was not impressed with the last one I purchased a few years ago. It didn&#x27;t shave well, left me with razor burn (my young daughter kept on wanting to know why I was hurt)and never handled more than a couple of days growth. Sometimes after finishing shaving, I felt like I hadn&#x27;t done anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the last razor&#x27;s batteries were starting to die - it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and my cordless now had to be run plugged in. It was time to look for a new razor. Unhappy with Phillips, I decided to give the Braun 790CC a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best move I have made in regards to shaving. It is so much better than my rotary. On the packaging it states that it can take a couple of weeks if you move from a rotary to this type of razor, but I never had any problems. I no longer get any shaving rash, and this shaves as close - or closer than a blade, but without the nicks. Not sure why, but my \\&quot;5 O&#x27;Clock Shadow\\&quot; the next day is more even. The hairs stick straight out and are smaller, so even after a day, the results are far more impressive than my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun does like straight skin for the best results, and the shaver needs to be straight on, so you have to stretch your skin or hold your arm up higher than with a rotary to get it straight on, but the results are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen noted anywhere that this vibrates a lot when shaving. Using a rotary all my life, this was a big difference when I first started using it. But don&#x27;t notice it now, so just a transition issue. The trimmer also works a lot better than the old razor, being wider and appears to be faster, so cuts side burns neater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had saved some money and purchased a 760cc as the fast clean mode is never used, you can&#x27;t fast clean and then use the razor, the fast clean washes it, but doesn&#x27;t apply a dryer, so you would get the same result by using a brush, if you wanted to use it straight away. When traveling you can&#x27;t take the cleaning base with you anyway, as the cleaning liquid would spill, so you have to get use to using a brush if you are going to be away from home for 5 or more days anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One (undocumented) advantage, is when left in the cleaning base and the power on, the razor&#x27;s little blue light is left active. So it acts like a night light for the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in Australia and this Braun works well here. I just need a small adapter for the 2-pin plug, but there are no voltage issues. The box comes with one cleaning solution, which can&#x27;t be shipped by air, so getting it on Amazon (half the price compared to retail Australia) and to Australia is a big difficult, but is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this razor, and in 5 years time when the batteries don&#x27;t hold their charge - I will definitely be buying another Braun.would get the same result by using a brush, if you wanted to use it straight away.

    <li> I purchased the Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver 760cc Braun razor for my father who is in a nursing home.  After getting the razor and talking to the nursing staff, they said it may not be the best to have such an expensive razor in an unsecure area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So -- when I tried to return this nearly $200 razor UNOPENED to Amazon they wouldn&#x27;t take it back because the package contains flammable liquids!!!  Yes it does, the system&#x27;s cleaning solution probably has some alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent it to my home -- its a consumer product, but they wouldn&#x27;t take an unopened, factory sealed product  back or even give me full credit for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZUN didn&#x27;t state \\&quot;NO RETURNS\\&quot; in the email confirmation they sent to me after ordering the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never purchase from Amazon again.  I&#x27;m no longer amazed at Amazon - just unamazed and very shocked at their deceptive and heavy-handed return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had no problem taking my money and then mailing this \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; to my home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a large number of shavers over the years... most recently Norelco, Remington, Panasonic, and the Braun 360 complete 8595.... the Series 7 790 is hands down the best of them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general the Norelco and Remington I would describe as ordinary.  They get the job done with more time, louder, and tend to be rougher on my skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic has a good feel to it and a definite step up from the ordinary brands, but is a little unusual, heavy, and a little cumbersome with the huge head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Braun 360 complete, on first use I was very surprised about how it clearly was so far above the rest, zipping through a shave in a smooth way and having a fit and finish that was very high end.  The Clean and Renew is no joke and gives a crisp fresh feel every time and is really not very expensive when taken in context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped my 360 and broke the on off slider, so time for a new shaver... Braun was so much better in the past, how could I not buy it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe in spending the extra bucks on luggage, watches, and various other stuff.... but in shavers it pays off...  Same thing when getting higher model Brauns... why skimp $30 and give features when you have already committed to getting a great product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got the 7 - 790...  I put in the cartridge, charged it and tried it out..  and I have to say, the 790 is clearly a full generation better than the 360, which I didn&#x27;t think was possible.  It shaves in an almost surgical instrument kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myths:&lt;br /&gt;-Clean and renew is expensive: In use the $4 clean and renew cartridges last about 6-8 weeks in 5 day a week use.  I&#x27;ve seen crackpot ideas like refilling them with seabreeze (dumb as you aren&#x27;t putting the right cleaner lubricant on your expensive shaver and it barely saves any money).&lt;br /&gt;- An expensive shaver doesn&#x27;t stack up to a quality razor.  BS, this thing definitely gives a better shave than I ever got with a blade with a lot less mess or time and no cuts ever.&lt;br /&gt;- An expensive shaver doesn&#x27;t make sense with quality disposables being so cheap.  BS also, to get in the ballpark quality wise, you would have to be buying $3 each disposables....  it only takes 4 months of blades to pay for a new shaver and a year of clean and renew packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints:&lt;br /&gt;- shave a very dry face, before washing in the morning.  your skin expands a lot when moisturized, drawing your beard in and making in inaccessible to the shaver and showing a shadow much quicker as your skin dries out later, forget shaving in or after the shower&lt;br /&gt;- wake up first and shave at least 30 minutes later, not only will you be better at it, faces tend to be somewhat puffy from laying down and result in a poor shave&lt;br /&gt;- after shaving before putting the shaver in the base, pop the foil off and tap it a couple of times in the trash to get most (probably 90%) of the beard out.. it keeps the clean and renew fluid much cleaner and makes it last much longer as the base does a &#x27;thorough&#x27; clean much less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I&#x27;m glad I broke my 360 complete (if I had known these, I would have just bought the 790 anyway)&lt;br /&gt;- the fit and finish of the 790 is very very high.... like museum watch high.. ultra cool looking and constructed product&lt;br /&gt;- the shave quality is much better than the 360 complete... almost surgical in feel, hard to believe I know because I thought the 360 was about perfect&lt;br /&gt;- the 790, while having the same size head, has a much thinner and easier to hold body, the older Brauns tend to be a little beefy&lt;br /&gt;- it has push button on off.... the older ones had a combo switch / trimmer slider which always was a little awkward to use&lt;br /&gt;- the 790&#x27;s trimmer juts way out from the shaver allowing a much better view for trimming sideburns etc.  a HUGE advantage.&lt;br /&gt;- the 790 has a quick clean feature, so you can start a cleaning cycle without it taking the shaver out of commission for hours.&lt;br /&gt;- the hair lifting bar is very very good now at avoiding in grown hairs... if you have this problem, this shaver is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that is effective at reducing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one of the few products in the universe that doesn&#x27;t disappoint in some way.... buy it.ission for hours.&lt;br /&gt;- the hair lifting bar is very very good now at avoiding in grown hairs... if you have this problem, this shaver is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that is effective at reducing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one of the few products in the universe that doesn&#x27;t disappoint in some way.... buy it.</li>
    <li> I used to use an el-cheapo walmart $20 electric shaver that got the job done, but just barely. After a while, I got fed up with the electric, and switched back to a straight/safety razor. Enjoyed the closeness of the straight razor shave, but the hassle of heating the lather and prep work was quite tedious. I did quite a lot of research, and ended up with this razor. I have to say that it&#x27;s an absolutely great shaver. It took a good 1-2 weeks before my skin/hair got used to the new shaver... but this is about normal from what I read. The shave is pretty damn close to the closeness of the straight razor, which is damn impressive! I still have the occasional stubborn hair that doesn&#x27;t get trimmed by shaver, but they are not noticeable by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go with the 4 stars due to the fact that the cleaning solution does not last very long if you shave on a daily basis. Yes, they are cheap, but it really stinks how fast it runs out. My main suggestion would be to alternate using the brush to manually clean and use the auto clean sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no regrets. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This Braun series 7 comes with charger stand which i like.  It works really well and very confortable. Very light weight!  Solid price</li>
    <li> Works ok, My Remington was much better but they don&#x27;t make it anymore. I think I&#x27;ll be ordering a different Remington shaver.</li>
    <li> Love the razor!  It&#x27;s perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver recently and have been very pleased with its performance.  It is a huge step up from the previous Braun Shaver I had roughly 8 years ago, which was top end at the time.  The shaver notifies you when to clean it (as well as when to charge it), but personally I think its more of a money grab as tapping out the shavings and opening the unit and blowing on it clears away most of the hair in my humble opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would suppose over time, it is possible you will get a better shave and it will last longer if you follow the cleaning procedures.  The fluid to clean the shaver isn&#x27;t really expensive, especially if you are willing to shell out this much for a shaver in the first place.  And it really does a good job cleaning the unit.  Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this shaver to any guy.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with th Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver System.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver gives me a smooth shave every time. The Pulsonice cleaning system takes the worry out of keeping it cleaning and disinfected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m moving from a [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K  Men&#x27;s Shaver]] to this one, which I have been using for a week. I&#x27;ve been shaving electric for a while now, and my last buy was the Pana LA93. I was happy with the it when I got it last October, but it did have a few negatives. It was too big, too loud, and the cleaning station looked bulky and ugly. I did like the wet shave option, but in the end I found that a dry shave after a pre-electric splash worked the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;After weeks of dithering, I recently ordered the Braun 790cc-4. I was truly was amazed with its first shave! Granted that I have been using electric shavers for a while and I didn&#x27;t need those 15 days to &#x27;get my skin used to&#x27; this shaver, but still, my shave was super smooth, including in those hard-to-reach areas under the neck. My pros and cons  are:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1- Shaves closer than the Pana (mind you, the Pana shaves quite close too, but not as good)&lt;br /&gt;2- Not very noisy&lt;br /&gt;3- Good solid feel in the hand, compact&lt;br /&gt;4- Clean and Renew makes it &#x27;new&#x27; every morning&lt;br /&gt;5- Fast shave, mine takes only 3 to 4 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1- No wet shave option&lt;br /&gt;2- Need to buy monthly refills of cleaning packs.&lt;br /&gt;Moving from an earlier Braun to the Pana was a great forward shift, as the shave was close to a blade shave. But the Pana is too big in my hands, and it was difficult to shave in those hard-to-reach places like below the nose. Shaving with this Braun 790cc is a breeze, and I can&#x27;t make out the difference between a blade and electric shave anymore. I would prefer not to have a monthly expenditure stream for the Clean and Renew cartridges, but bought in bulk, they aren&#x27;t that expensive really.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> Everything I&#x27;d hoped for. My 5th Braun, but not because I wore one out or it didn&#x27;t work. Just upgrades over past many years! The cleaning system is worth the price. I can get whiskers with my Braun AFTER I shave with a blade. Of course, I no longer even bother with a blade.</li>
    <li> I had been using Braun model Series 5 shavers for many years, but the closeness of the shave has not been of good quality over the last year, year-and-a-half. So I decided to try an upgrade to the Series 7 Pulsonic Shaver System. Boy what a difference! Not only is the shave much closer with the Pulsonic, it automatically cleans itself after its use in preparation for the next shave; without any daily effort by me! True, it does require replacement of the cleaning fluid every 45-60 days as it dirties, but the system automatically alerts me when replacement is due. And the replacement is virtually effortless by sliding out the old cartilage and sliding in a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best buy I&#x27;ve made in a long time, particularly since it was through the cost saving afforded by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old and have had terrible trouble shaving ever since it became necessary.  I&#x27;ve tried every multiple-blade razor, previous electrics, and most recently have trained myself to use a straight razor (cutthroat) but nothing produced irritation-free reasonably-close results - until now.  The Braun Series 7 790cc actually allows me to shave EVERY day and reasonably-closely at that.  This is a first in all my years.  I have a heavy beard and now no longer have to manage my life partially around how and when to shave so I maximize my time in public clean-shaven.  Truly this product is a life-changer for me.  Thank you, Braun!</li>
    <li> The short of it: Best shaver on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 2 years. I use it every single day. People can&#x27;t believe I use and electric when they ask. It cuts very close, but no rash. I do clean it after every use with the included cleaner. At first I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the performance, but once I did a little looking, I found the correct formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must shave BEFORE you shower, wash your face or apply any type of lotion. Every morning I get out of bed, shave, and THEN shower. Additionally, I shave my whole head, not just the beard. So my shaver has gotten quite a work out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about two months now and have had no problems.  It provides a close shave with no irritation.  It&#x27;s compact and easy to hold in your hand.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it takes perhaps a slightly more time than the previous unit I had which was a triangular 3 blade style.  However, the shave results are better.  The cleaning cycle is nice, I didn&#x27;t think I would use it much but it provides a clean smell and seems to last whitewashed a long time.  I haven&#x27;t had to change it yet.  So far, I have nothing negative to say about this razor.</li>
    <li> very good shaver. very sharp, not noisy and not hurting the skin.&lt;br /&gt;the cleaning system is not easy to use though.</li>
    <li> I was a manual razor user for more than 40 years. Recently (within the last three years), I became an electric razor customer. I am very happy with the transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Braun Series 7 about 2.5 years ago. I replace the blades once a year (18 months is recommended) and use the Braun cleaning solution. Everything works great.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have bought MANY middle of the road priced electric shavers, but was unable to get a smooth comfortable shave. I usually returned them near the end of the try it and we will buy it back period, or pass it along to a friend or family member later if I didnt return it.&lt;br /&gt;Upon insistance of a few friends around 3 years ago I bought a Braun Series 3-370.&lt;br /&gt;It did better than any electric I had ever had, gave a comfortable shave but still not as close and smooth as I thought it should. I still have it and use it from time to time, but went back to the blade for daily close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;But I decided to give an electric one more try, and to buy the top of the line to see if it would give me the shave I wanted. Im very glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;Clean smooth comfortable close shave right out of the box. No break in time for my face....Great razor, worth the price...&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah...The cleaning system is a fantastic device, keeps the razor as clean and ready for use as it was the very first use..</li>
    <li> I wanted this shaver because of the high reviews and high rating by Consumer Reports. After shaving with it exactly twice, I am ready to return it. Both times that I used it, I felt my facial hairs being pulled. It is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no way to avoid spilling the cleaning solution. Even if you carefully put it into the base, some will spill out onto the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my Panasonic ES8228 for about 5 years and I think I will stay with Panasonic. I never felt any pulling with my Panasonic thanks to the more powerful motor, so I will shop for a newer Panasonic model.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 3 year old Braun Electric Razer.  This is the finest electric razer I have ever used.  It gives spectacular results and is the best shave I have ever had off of an electric.  You will not be disappointed in this product, just buy it and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> An improvement over my previous Philips 8845 rotary. I received a used Braun 3612 single foil shaver which did a better job on softer neck hairs than the rotary. I now use the twin foil 790cc which is even closer and the self cleaning feature is fantastic. You can do without the LCD display and buy the 760 which does the same fantastic job as well as buy the clean and renew cartridges in bulk to save some cash. No buyers remorse whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver last week and received it yesterday. after one days use,i am getting a better shave than my previous shaver, which was a Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit that the noise of the shaver is louder than the Philips, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. anyway its an awesome shaver all round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend other men, who are after a shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver for about 20 years. I had always used Norelco, but after mine died, I decided to try a new brand. I have a tough beard, and used to get razor burn all of the time. This shaver gets close and does not cause irritation.</li>
    <li> This product was well worth the money!  This is my 6-7 Braun shaver over the last 17-18 yrs.  Very smooth shave, easy to handle, awesome cleaning unit, great battery life during shave!  Must have, if you value your shave like I do ... premature gray guy!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Truly remarkable shaver.  Exceeds my expectations.  I have not used an electric shaver for over 20 years.  This is truly a revelation -- close and smooth shave with comfort and no hassle.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re bald by choice like me, you&#x27;ll go broke buying foils</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Braun and was very impressed how close of a shave I got, closer than an average razor. I brought this razor mostly due to the fact I have a very sensitive face and suffer from bumps after shaving, after a Co-worker who has the same problem told me he uses the Braun. I&#x27;m the type that has to shave everyday just because if I skip one day I will break out in bumps once my beard starts growing, and I have a pretty thick beard. I have also used a rotary razor in the past, but that gives too much pull on facial hair that it made my \\&quot;bump\\&quot; situation worse. Compared to a rotary the Braun is so smooth and close, no tug and pull here. The best part is I don&#x27;t have to replace cartridges every week and buy \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin shave creams. A pre-facial scrub with warm water, a dry pat down you&#x27;re ready for a dry shave...which i could never even do before  again terrible beard bumps ). I brought this razor fairly cheaper than amazon&#x27;s price, and that is the one of the  reasons I finally brought it but had I known how great of a shave it would give me I would&#x27;ve brought a long time ago. If you suffer from sensitive skin and bumps + razor burn get this you will not regret it EVER. By the way the self cleaning system keeps the shavers cutting abilities like new every time, so it doesn&#x27;t get dull after a few shaves. I would rate this product 6 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and have NEVER used an electric shaver... I read many reviews and conducted my research and purchased the Braun 7 Series.  I have dark brown course hair.  When I shave with a 5 blade shaver, I would normally have a shadow by the evening and thus, never thought an electric shaver could give me a blade type shave... WOW.. I was wrong, this shaver shaved me smooth... Yes, I still got a shadow by days end, but no worse when I used a blade.  It is very convenient, easy to use and easy to maintain.  PLUS... I don&#x27;t care if I have to freshen up a 2nd time at night, there is no shaven cream and no water.  It&#x27;s just a quick shave and you&#x27;re ready to go... Perfect..</li>
    <li> This seemed to be the number one rated shaver according to multiple sources I checked before my purchase.  I do find in comfortable and the cleaning system works well.  However it does not give as close a shave as the electric shavers I have used in the past.  I have given it the three or more weeks they say it takes for your face to adjust to the new razor, but I still don&#x27;t get a close shave on my lower cheeks or neck, even on the setting for closest shave.  In addition, the product manual instructs to shave before washing ones face, which is different than I have done with prior shavers.  I find that if I ignore that advise and shave after washing my face it works better, though still not as close as other shavers.  Still not sure if I am going to keep it or return it and get a rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> Could not be be better</li>
    <li> I had a Braun 15 years ago that finally gave life.&lt;br /&gt;I now bought this Braun Series 7 790cc and I am even more happy then my previous one&lt;br /&gt;first the shave is so close I love it&lt;br /&gt;second I travel much and this shaver kept 1 charge for 2 weeks travel&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shaver for strong beard</li>
    <li> I have be a Philips shaver guy for years.  I needed a new shaver and due to reviews, recommendations, etc ... I tried the Braun.  It has now been nearly a year and I am delighted with it.  Stays clean, gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE Amazon shopper, and i use the Amazon reviews for EVERYTHING I buy, even non-Amazon purchases. I believe there is no better way to get honest opinions on items before purchasing them. This is my FIRST review submitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent the past few years trying several different electric shavers. I hate to think about the money I&#x27;ve spent but if I look underneath my bathroom sink the cabinet must have at least 4 shavers that have just not impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months ago i stepped up to a Norelco 3D wet/dry shaver. shaving with gel it did a pretty good job, but not great on my neck. dry it was just miserable - after shaving dry my face was irritated and still felt like i had a half-day&#x27;s growth. So the 3D went back to Norelco undere their guarentee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just 3 days ago i ordered the Braun 7-790. It arrived yesterday, and this morning I took it for a test drive - WOW is the best way to describe it!!  I went to my wife and just kept saying \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; to her and rubbed my face up on her cheek and she said WOW also! As I sit here at my desk at 8:07am writing my first product review, I keep rubbing my face and neck and can&#x27;t believe how smooth it is. ZERO irritation, FAST shave - seriously, i spent maybe half the time shaving as i have in the past! and my neck and jawline are SMOOTH! They never got smooth with all the other shavers. My wife said - \\&quot;That&#x27;s a great example of getting what you paid for\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly impressed with this shaver. Everything about it screams quality. The Norelco 3D had a cheap feel and look about it. the Braun looks, feels and performs like a very high quality expensive piece of machinery. Right down to the very nice hard travel case it comes with. I&#x27;m excited to have finally found an electric shaver that performs so good. If you&#x27;re considering this shaver, definately give it a shot. Yep, it&#x27;s higher priced, but most men will agree that you can&#x27;t put a price on a smooth comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> A little on the expensive side but is a great shaver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of remmington for the last 10 years. I finnally switched to this razor to try something new, and boy was I impressed. Close shave, easy to clean (cleans itself), and very quiet (at least to other shavers I&#x27;ve owned). Great durable product, that&#x27;s easy to travel with as you don&#x27;t have to take the base with you. You can just bring the cord for longer trips. Also compatible with European 200V, which was very important to me.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son. He loves it and now I can get my old Braun back.</li>
    <li> very good.my husband like it very much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a few months away from 60 and have spent my life alternating between electric razors and regular blades. It&#x27;s a sickness. Lately I&#x27;m back to electrics. I used one of the panasonics and found the head was simply too large. Back to my umpteenth Braun. I&#x27;ve also used Norelco&#x27;s and the inability to define is too frustrating.  This is clearly my favorite shaver.  It works well no matter the length of your beard and the head is exactly the right size.  The cleaning solution part is nice too. When they first came out with that on one of the older models, I found it too gimmicky. I&#x27;ve changed my mind. It does help to maintain the shaver. I&#x27;m sure that I will continue to alternate manual versus electric because I get bored easily, and there&#x27;s a time and a place for each, but this is the best electric out there.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7-790cc shaver performance beats the old Braun standard my quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long beard mowing, trimmer, hairs, all well handled,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% great recommendation!</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a little over one month and it is broken. It does not lock in position. I paid enough for this product to work much longer than one month. I would not purchase it again. Obviously.</li>
    <li> Give a very close shave in a short amount of time, but it does need to be cleaned frequently so don&#x27;t stray to far from the base.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a very similar Braun that lasted me nearly three years - and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Same high quality I expect from Braun, like it even better than the previous one - won&#x27;t hesitate to recommend.  My only hope is the cleaning stand lasts better than the previous series.</li>
    <li> Very good performance</li>
    <li> I have searched a lot to get a good shaver which can easily cut my tough beard. I am pleased with the built quality and the way it easily slides on my chin and face. I highly recommend this shaver because I don&#x27;t see any flaws with this shaver. Happy to buy this shaver.</li>
    <li> One of the more expensive Braun&#x27;s but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This has more power and flexibility than lesser-priced models.&lt;br /&gt;It also fits more comfortably in the hand.</li>
    <li> This shaver makes shaving easy. This is honestly the best electric shaver that I have owned to date. I am very happy with its performance and recommended it highly.</li>
    <li> I just love shaving with this shaver. Always comes out perfect.  Very Easy to clean and use. I also love the travel kit and charger.</li>
    <li> The razor is Ok, but I expected more. I am still not able to shave closer that I want in the neck area. alter paying all that money, I am sincerely&lt;br /&gt;disappointed with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dennis J. Dubsky U.S. Navy retired</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Series 7-790cc a few weeks ago. It works great and the shave is super close and does not irritate my skin at all which my old razor used to do.</li>
    <li> Have had my Braun Series 7 - 790cc for 2 months now. Unbelievable close shave. As good as any razor with no cuts. I have had several Norelco rotary which I thought were pretty good. My last on was the Norelco Arcitec which was one of their most expensive products. Never totally satisfied in the 5 years that I have been using. So when it was time to get a replacement head, I decided to give something else a try. Like any new electric razor, it takes a couple of weeks to get the perfect shave, but after only a couple of shaves, I was getting a much closer shave than I ever got with the Norelco. Sorry I waited so long to order. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  It cuts closer than my older Braun.  I especially like the instant read battery and cleaning level on the end of the shaver.  The swivel head really makes it easy to get close shave.  The cleaning base makes the unit really easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> My son generally shaves his head with a regular razor.  I bought him this for a Christmas gift based on the reviews and he really loves it.</li>
    <li> Misses tons of hairs, not very thorough at all as described. Even fully charged, it skips over lots of hairs.</li>
    <li> The best electric razor I have owned. Takes some time to get the shave you want, but you can get a very good shave.</li>
    <li> Works better than my old Braun.  The trimmer could be better angle wrong for trimming.  Shave very close.</li>
    <li> This product arrived well packaged, in perfect condition, and works very well. We bought this item because of it&#x27;s favorable rating on Consumer Reports.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver when my trusty Panasonic finally gave up, and what a step up it is!  I used to shave with the electric, jump in the shower and \\&quot;finish up\\&quot; with a blade, but that is not necessary with the Braun.  Super smooth shave every time, no burns or irritation.  The trimmer is precise and very easy to use compared to other electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best part is the automatic cleaning system.  Push the button and next morning the shaving head works and feels like it is brand new.  I have found cleaning every other shave works great, your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver will very likely be Christmas gifts for my father and father-in-law!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> i come from china,zhis is shaver is fomes.used is better!&lt;br /&gt;i like this one.it &#x27;s feel well ,i will buy more to my friend</li>
    <li> Wow! This thing is really good! Here&#x27;s a quick review for those that like reading into their products, but don&#x27;t want to read a novel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-powerful&lt;br /&gt;-Very close shave!&lt;br /&gt;-adaptable (shaved my face and I shaved my head too so far! Both great!)&lt;br /&gt;-cool features for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;-moderately quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-initially expensive (still cheaper/easier than buying razors all of the time)&lt;br /&gt;-requires annual maintenance (not so bad)&lt;br /&gt;-30-45 minute clean cycle (w/e, I do it once a week before going to work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy! Customer service is great from what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews so if you don&#x27;t like it then they&#x27;ll *probably* refund it or replace it.</li>
    <li> Wow! What a revelation. Going from a rotary shaver which broke down and no repair shops within 200 miles, this shaver was as close to a blade shave the first time I used it and has gotten even better, with time, if that&#x27;s possible. All things considered, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am sure for others, this is a great product.  It is personal issue for me. The shaver just wasn&#x27;t great for my face.  I ended up going back to a manual shaver.  That being said, as a shaver, I think it is pretty impressive.  The self-cleaning mechanism was what I really wanted.  The cleaning packs are of course another continual investment that you have to make.  I agree with other reviewers that there is likely a way you can concoct your own solution.  I don&#x27;t think it is work the price.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves it! Totally worth the price. No more need for shaving for my man.</li>
    <li> If you have in grown hair, the product does not work well</li>
    <li> great shaver so far. Cleans easily and for two weeks has been very sharp.</li>
    <li> Good razor. Only issue is the pop up trimmer is a bit on the flimsy side. But the cleaning station is a nice option to have and does a good job.</li>
    <li> Great product!! My husband loves it</li>
    <li> Best by a mile over my Norelco.  Easy to use and provides close shave.  Trimmer is adjustable.</li>
    <li> Still working 4 years later, but apparently the head is supposed to lock into place.  Mine never did, but still a good shave.</li>
    <li> I am an old man, at least according to my wife and kids...am not sure how that happened, one minute I am young and vigorous, the next minute an old man is staring back at me in the mirror...but I digress. I have always used a Norelco shaver, but since I am now an old man, I decided to shake things up and bought this Braun. Wow! I really like it. Should have switched years ago. Shaves close and is easy to clean. Like the sanitizing do-hickey also.</li>
    <li> My Husband Had An Older Braun Series And Loved It, So When Hi Finally Gave OUt (After 7 Years) I Wanted To Het Him Another One. Braun Is The Best Shaver System I Have Ever Seen Or Got Anyone. My Dad Will Be Getting Thos For Christmas!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned by far!  I was very hesitant to buy a foil one because I&#x27;ve mostly used rotary ones and have sensitive skin.  This razor is awesome!  It has 3 sensitivity settings to adjust to your skin.  I am now having the fastest and closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  With my old rotary shaver, I had a five o&#x27;clock shadow at 1 pm...not with this bad boy!  It gives you a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service to ask should you leave it charging all the time (no unplug it when fully charged) and should you let batteries drain all the way down (yes, once every 6 months) and I got an English speaking lady who knew the answer to both questions immediately and said enjoy your razor...it&#x27;s the best ever and we&#x27;re proud of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative...and it&#x27;s only a slight negative is the recurring costs of the clean and renew system.  I&#x27;m only cleaning mine once a week and it&#x27;s doing great though.  You can of course just clean it with hot water.  I&#x27;ve had it a month now and love it!  I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for two weeks now, having replaced a Panasonic 8249 (which I was never happy with).  The 7-790 is providing me with the closest, smoothest shave I have ever experienced from an electric shaver.  I have also found that the shaving head runs a lot cooler than the Panasonic&#x27;s after extended use.  If you have a thick, fast growing beard, I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver. The only problem is the neck area. Its hard to get a good close shave with this shaver at the neck area.</li>
    <li> OK for a shaver, not really all that special</li>
    <li> This shaver is a very good investment.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this product I wanted a shaver that would do the job. I read what this shaver does and believe me, it does everything I was looking for. If you purchase this shaver, you will not be sorry. It is the best shaver on the market. It really does the job. I use it on my face and also on my head. The cleaning feature of the shaver can&#x27;t be beat. It really does a wonderful job cleaning it. Thank you Braun and also Amazon for a wonderful shaver. I am glad I purchased this shaver from Amazon because I save money.</li>
    <li> Replaced my six year old Braun 3 series. Lots of features and give a great shave.</li>
    <li> I tried this shaver for 1 month and really wanted to like it. But the shave was not close at all and the shave never got any better with time. I have a light beard (nothing special) and have been using electrics for about 15+ years (previously using the Braun 7526 which worked better than this razor). I will give the shaver 2 start because it is a very comfortable shave. I am now using the Panasonic es8243 and could not be happier.</li>
    <li> To start off I have had 3 braun shavers up to this one since i started shaving. also two rotary styles that people gave me that i hated.  Foil electric is just the way to go. The last braun i owned was the cheapest of the brauns i have owned, it was a series 3 wet/dry.  Every shave took a minimum of 8 minutes and the battery life was never great and i always had some hairs left behind.  plus no cleaning station.  I LOVE the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the 790 im lucky if i can stretch a full shave to 3 minutes.  I have WAY less irritation because of this even on the most intense of its 3 settings.  The very first shave my skin felt incredibly better then my braun 3 with a new foil cassette.  Even much nicer series 5 i used to love before it got smashed on accident (and replaced by the series 3 which i hated from day 1).  The cleaning cycle on this new 790 is fast and the readout of battery life/hygiene is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive read reviews where people have some small personal cons or dislikes but there is nothing to dislike unless you want to get picky and look for something.  The shave is close, fast,  WAY less irritation than many other foils and it has a solid construction and feels study and sleek in your hand.  My last braun shaver was big and bulky in comparison which wasnt good at all, maybe felt sturdier but not better.  also the side shaver is \\&quot;different\\&quot; in its angle but if your facing the mirror to clean sideburns its actually nicer because you dont have to flip the shaver around to use the trimmer.  I think that is a plus because being morning groggy and shaving i have dropped a shaver while turning it around to flip out the trimmer and when the foil hits something its ruined instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure how you could be disappointed with this shaver.  Maybe if you expect a razor style shave you will be disappointed but if thats what your looking for no electric will ever meet your expectations.  I was hoping that this 790 would be equal or slightly better then my cherished braun 5 that i missed and this 790 is leaps and bounds better so i couldnt be happier.lightly better then my cherished braun 5 that i missed and this 790 is leaps and bounds better so i couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> Bought it for father&#x27;s day gift.  My husband said he never knew his face could feel so smooth and nice with a great shaver</li>
    <li> It shaves as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> The hygiene segments will only restore themselves when the shaver has been cleaned in the Clean&amp;Renew station which causes me to question if the hygiene meter is actually detecting the cleanliness of the shaver.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver, my friend have same one, and really like it. So I decide to buy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after first shave I realized that head lock is not working at all, and moving razors are not working properly (only one side is reacting while you moving the shaver head). Got a Canopy 2-Year Personal Care Extended Protection Plan as well.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to contact Amazon, no response from for more than 3 days. Just would like to know if I can return it back by this 60 days return policy?</li>
    <li> I had hopes of a shave equal to a razor and while this is the best electric razor I have tried it still doesn&#x27;t measure up to a razor shave. Also it is a bit too large for a travel razor.</li>
    <li> requires several passes to get smooth shave. had to make several passes to get clean shave whar more needs to be shed</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun series 7 shaver because I wanted the best shave possible in zero time. A smooth close shave &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34;! As I shave I listen to quality humming in my ear. A 1st class product compared to the Remington shaver which I returned after a 30 day trial and poor shave that took way to long.</li>
    <li> Long term Braun user, loved the 5790 for the last 9 years, so I bought the 7-series 790cc.  The moment I turned it on, I knew I had been had.  I&#x27;ve used it for the last 7 weeks to give it a chance.  And I am loathing..  No.. hating it more and more every day.  Pinches, pulls, rips hair from my face, and takes entirely too long to shave - just a few of the problems.  Every day I find a patch which just isn&#x27;t smooth, even after spending entirely too much time on that problem area that it refuses to shave. I am now relying on my $20 AA Braun travel razor in the shower to clean up.  If I skip a day or two of shaving - forget about it, this shaver takes an eternity to take it down.  Also, the shaver just won&#x27;t get close enough to remove the hairs right under my nose, nor will it pick up the straggling hairs on the front of the lower neck.  What gives?  After reading the reviews I opted for the 790cc even though I have very thin/sparse facial hair, the motor still seems to struggle.  Is it the pulsonic system that&#x27;s restricting a full sweep of the bar from side to side and pinching the death out of me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer is such a poor design.  The angle on the trimmer makes it entirely too awkward to use.  It continuously slams shut whenever I use it.  It extends perpendicular to the unit and does not have a locking mechanism on it.  I use the beard trimmer to take some length off my sideburns from time to time, but the angle of the trimmer pop-up causes the shaver head to gauge into my haircut.  While the shaver head does have a locking mechanism on it, it is utterly useless and doesn&#x27;t rotate the shaver out of the way anyhows, and I scalp into my haircut regardless.  And to make this worse, the razor also will not allow a detailed edge.  So, I&#x27;m left with sloppy sideburns as I just can&#x27;t get a clean detail no matter what angle I try.  The beard trimmer can not be angled to clean up the hairline on the back of my neck either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shield/razor and bar on this unit are in a self contained all-in-one casing.  The screen can not be miss-seated.  And it is not damaged.  Its simply a bad design.  The hair aligner on this unit is spaced too far away from the screen which may be causing the blasted pinching.  Either that or its this pulsonic system not allowing a full sweep of the bar across the screen.  Regardless, this razor is simply junk.  Cheap Chinese garbage at that.  You&#x27;ll know it as soon as you get it in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 content years with my last Braun shavers, but not this one.  Seriously unhappy with Braun for this $200-$300 purchase.  And with all this blasted pinching, I fear using my own razor every day.  I read the reviews before I made this purchase, and thought maybe these other people are not used to an electric shaver, and with hesitation I bought it anyhows.  Now regretting this purchase just like the others here.  I would be unhappy if this razor cost $30 much less $200. I am surprised Braun put their name on this box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun, we had a great relationship over the years, but recently you have changed.  Regardless, I am no longer interested in you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning solution smells real good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is such a waste of recycled plastic, that I am thinking most of the supporters of this razor must be Braun employees guarding their bad investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be making a purchase of another razor from a different manufacturer today.  I won&#x27;t ever go back to Braun shavers after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  8-7-2013:&lt;br /&gt;I had just found out that Braun offered a 60-day money back guarantee.  I had purchased this unit exactly 2 months ago today 6-7-2013.  It took 1 week to ship, so I have been using it for exactly 7 weeks and 1 day.  I requested a money back refund from Braun, which Braun has denied even though we are on right on the 60th day.  After I informed them of this amazon review, they offered to send a replacement head to help with the pinching and lousy shaving.  Braun expects 3 weeks for delivery of the new head.  I have no reason to believe the existing head is faulty, nor that the replacement head will fix just some of the problems with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is important is that Braun is not abiding by their 60-day money back guarantee.  Yet, if the head replacement helps, which I do not expect that it will, I will return to amazon and edit this review about the pinching and lousy shaving of this razor.  If there is no update to this review within 4 weeks, this razor has been disposed of in the trashcan and Braun has not done anything for me.  Steer clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After Braun received link to this review, Braun emailed me a week later and approved the return of the razor.  Braun offered to refund the money so I took them up on the offer and returned the unit.d a replacement head to help with the pinching and lousy shaving.  Braun expects 3 weeks for delivery of the new head.  I have no reason to believe the existing head is faulty, nor that the replacement head will fix just some of the problems with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is important is that Braun is not abiding by their 60-day money back guarantee.  Yet, if the head replacement helps, which I do not expect that it will, I will return to amazon and edit this review about the pinching and lousy shaving of this razor.  If there is no update to this review within 4 weeks, this razor has been disposed of in the trashcan and Braun has not done anything for me.  Steer clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After Braun received link to this review, Braun emailed me a week later and approved the return of the razor.  Braun offered to refund the money so I took them up on the offer and returned the unit.</li>
    <li> This razor does a vey good job. I had an older model and I recommend this to anyone wanting a new razor.</li>
    <li> I had the Braun 3 series before and it was nice. All I have to say about the 7 series is wow.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!  Coarse and dense hair is more easily removed with this device than I ever imagined possible.  The automatic maintenance cartridges are expensive so avoiding their use is advisable.  Electric razor lubricating/disinfecting spray after a rinse in the sink is, if not better, cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun shavers for years.  This one gives me the best shave of any electric I have owned.  It is also far and away the most expensive.  I used it for 5 days and the lock mechanism, which locks the head in one position, failed.  It is poorly designed and I have little confidence that when I have it repaired, it will stay repaired.  Amazon will not let me return the shaver because the product contains \\&quot;hazardous materials,\\&quot;  which means it came with cleaning fluid.  Of course, having opened the cleaning fluid I would not return it with the shaver anyway.  Amazon is a great company with excellent service, but this rule does not make sense.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using another model Braun for four years, replacing the head annually.  This razor gives a very close shave and has been great.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shave yet.  I will not go back to a disposal razor again!  The new pulse technology is great.</li>
    <li> Braun makes the best shavers - hands down - this updated version is wonderful and smooth - what I don&#x27;t like about Braun is that their batteries are not consumer changeable - I have an older model that  won&#x27;t hold a charge and had to buy this one or be tied to the wired connection, which is a pain.  Come on Braun, give us a user changeable battery and then I will give you FIVE stars!</li>
    <li> I been using this guy for about 2 years now and I still have the original blade inside.  It shaves like a champ!  The cleaning solution I only need to change about every 2-3 months.  I tried the norelco 3 rotary blades but it didn&#x27;t shave that well on my neck.  This guy is a breeze to use and while it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade of course, it gets me through the day without a 5o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of a facial hair so that might explain my longer usage without changing blades.  It is expensive but the cost of having to use blades and shaving cream over time would add up.  I&#x27;ll probably use this for another +15 years at least.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaver. It doesn&#x27;t spit whiskers all over like my old one and the cleaner is really great.  Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shave I have ever had. I read a few reviews where people complained of it not cutting to close, if anything it cuts too close for me, because I get razor bumps. This things cuts just as close as shaving with a blade against the grain. I just can&#x27;t use it every day because of the razor bumps I get, but if I use it one or twice a week it&#x27;s great. I am extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> Horrible razor, no matter how hard I tried, wouldn&#x27;t shave beard unless went over same space 4-5 times. I have tried to get this razor to shave my light beard for over 6 weeks, but no matter how hard I try, wouldn&#x27;t give a close shave. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to go back to my safety razor.</li>
    <li> great shaver, better than expected.</li>
    <li> Gives a better shave than my older  Braun. Light weight, fits my hand a very good product. If there was one neg. and it is nit picking, I miss the LCD display of total number of shaves.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad as a present and he absolutely loves it! says it works great and gives a really nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> i choose it because consumer report rated high. how ever it cuts your skin. no i would not tell a friend too buy it</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of trouble with electric shavers due to thick hair and wild grain. This one works great. I also have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t get razor burn.</li>
    <li> Again, it&#x27;s also a Christmas gift for one of my friends. He likes it much better than my previous Braun. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot. Easier to clean.</li>
    <li> The 790cc pulsonic shaver system is very good, but I buy it not the best price. Love it but unhappy.</li>
    <li> This shaver was such a disappointment!  We paid over $200 for something that does not work as advertised.  I bought it for my father who is aging and has trouble holding and using a regular razor.  My expectation was that it would provide a smooth shave - not at all!  I&#x27;d return it immediately if my dad hadn&#x27;t thrown away the box...</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used period. It takes a few days to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; the foils but after that it shaves super fast and amazingly smooth. Even during the break in period it still shaves super smooth but just takes a little longer.</li>
    <li> Requires 30 min or so to understand features but it is an excellent shaver that shaves close and without irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this system one week now and it is superb. I bought it to replace a 7-yr old Braun system that had done yeoman&#x27;s work the entire time. I replaced the cutterhead and the foil system a couple of times on the old one, but the batteries were winding down and it wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore due to the power loss. I expect the same or better service from this one--a step up in model. I can report that it does shave me closer and more comfortably, is quieter, and the cleaning cycles seems shorter and with less noise. So far, so good. To borrow a line from Phil, &amp;#34;I am happy, happy, happy.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not as close of shave as I expected and not as quick as I wanted. also bulky with base. Would have liked a longer cord. Forces you to set it up in the bath room.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a straight blade.  probably compares well to other electrics but I bought it to compare to straight razor and it is a fail.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun 350 for decade and now update to 790cc,which is comfort and convient. You can now ignore the long beard cut by scissor. The ultrasonic handles everything.</li>
    <li> The razor does an ok job.  Leaves plenty of stubble behind on my face.  Not that close of a shave.  It does not cut my face like a safety razor does so that is a plus.</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift to my husband and so far it works well. Very quite and gives nice shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor.  It provides the closest shave I can get with an electric razor.  The only drawback for me is that it is not as fast of a shave as the Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1280x and it also doesn&#x27;t shave as well with anything longer than day old stubble.  I do like the cleaning station that comes with the shaver because it does a great job of cleaning the razor but I am not a fan of having to have replace the cleaning cartridge every month or so because of the added expense.  My solution to this is simply to remove the cartridge after each cleaning and recap the cartridge so the solution does not evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you want an electric razor that provides an extremely close shave (closest to blade in my opinion) and don&#x27;t mind that it might take a few more minutes of shaving time to get there then purchase this razor.  If you want a razor that is quite faster in terms of shaving time and does a great job on longer stubble but is not quite as close of a shave (admittedly the difference is negligible between the two) then purchase Norelco Sensotouch 3D.</li>
    <li> It had been 10 years since I&#x27;d used an electric when I decided to give this Braun model a try - while I love the closeness of a blade shave, I was sick and tired of neck irritation. Does the Braun Series 7 shave as close as a blade? No. Is it better than any Norelco or Remington I&#x27;d tried in the past? Yes - by a factor of 10! Provided you&#x27;re willing to shave daily, this razor will provide a near-blade closeness while being amazingly gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say: if you&#x27;re planning to switch to this razor after using a blade for an extended period of time, use the Braun for a month or so before making up your mind on whether you like it. Certain facial hairs (particularly those on the neck) need to be \\&quot;retrained\\&quot; before you&#x27;ll get optimum closeness. Be patient - I can almost guarantee you&#x27;ll be happy with this razor if you give it time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I&#x27;m quite happy with this purchase. Having done the math, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m paying any more to use the Braun 7 than I was to use my Gillette Fusion blades - if you&#x27;ve purchased razor cartridges at the supermarket recently, you know how expensive those darned things are! Even paying for the Braun cleaning solution (which does a great job maintaining this razor, by the way), I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m paying that much more than I was while using a traditional blade. I wholeheartedly recommend this solidly built German electric!</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver I have owned.  I am 70 years old and I love the shaver. I bought one of my friends the same shaver for Christmas and he loved it.  There are no cuts on my face when I shave with Braun.  No small pieces of toilet paper to absorb blood.</li>
    <li> This electric razor shaves as close as a blade razor with no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Good and easy to use. Clean and fast shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors for years. I was tired of replacing the blades all the time...they just didn&#x27;t last. Finally, I decided to switch to Braun. I will stay with Braun. The blade lasts longer and it shaves close. It cleans easy.  I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a customer changing from a razor shaving to electric shaving and hence this review can be a little negative.&lt;br /&gt;When you shave with a razor you are used to 1 glide of a razor and clean shave, but that is not the case with electric shavers, you need to use it like can eraser, I mean like how we need to keep on rubbing till it is erased same way you need to keep on rubbing till it is clean shaved.&lt;br /&gt;With a razor you are used to gliding it mostly in 1 direction, but with the new electric shaver you need to go up and down just like how you rub.&lt;br /&gt;First few shaves with the electric shaver can be a little frustrating as you are not use to the rubbing method of shaving. The other important thing is that when you shave with a razor you are sure that all the hair will be removed if not very smooth but still to the level that they are not visible. But with the electric shaver you need to shave and then check if the hair have been removed. So getting used to checking your shave is something that you get used to after a few shaves and then you get use to it. The other tip would be to keep your shave rough when shaving with an electric shaver, it is not like a razor where it is recommended to wet and soften your shave before shaving. So more the rough hair, more smoother the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above has nothing to do with Braun Series 7- 790cc shaver, it is mainly to do with changing from razor shaving to electric shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Series 7- 790cc this is a good shaver and the shave is quite clean, when you compare it with a razor shave it is still not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;it is a bit noisy to start with, saving on the neck line can be difficult specially when you are in a hurry. Shaving with a razor is much quicker compared to Braun Series 7- 790cc, it atke approx 4-5 mins for me to shave with my Braun Series 7- 790cc. It is a dry shaver and hence cannot be used while bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I personally find it quite okay after 2 months, maybe cause I have paid so much for it. If I would have not bought it, I would have reverted back to razor shaving.e cause I have paid so much for it. If I would have not bought it, I would have reverted back to razor shaving.</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m 33 years old and I my beard is in the middle I think, not to less not to much.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my face every 3 days. It took me many years to change from a normal shaver to an electric one, and it was a wonderful change. When I used the normal shaver I shaved my face from the top to the bottom and the electric let my face better than that way.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have this machine my life is easier and I enjoy shaving my face!&lt;br /&gt;This a very good product!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used.  I bought this one to replace the same model that worked great for 4 years and finally gave out.  It got a lot of use.</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN USING THE NEW BRAUN SERIES SEVEN SHAVER FOR A MONTH NOW. FOUND IT VERY GOOD. THE SHAVE IS CLOSE AND SMOOTH. HAD A BRAUN SHAVER BEFORE AND THIS IS FAR SUPERIOR. ONLY ONE THING IS THE SIZE OF THE ATTACHED TRIMMER. MY SERIES 5 SHAVER HAD A TRIMMER WIDE ENOUGH TO CLIP MY SIDE BURNS ( ABOUT 2 INCHES). THE SERIES SEVEN TRIMMER IS ONLY ONE INCH OR LESS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE A NICE EVEN CUT.</li>
    <li> dose a great job for me and i have have had a lot of electric razors</li>
    <li> After using a rotary razor for the last ten years I switched to a foil. Noreclo in an attempt to force customers to buy their new razor by switching the replacement head to a cheap product or pay $250.00 for a real head, succeeded with me.  But, instead of their&#x27;s, I bought a Braun and it is fantastic. Very close shave but a bit of a pain dealing with the cleaning system. Great trimmer.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Braun 8595 that I had been using for the last 6 years with the Series 7 790cc-4. While the old razor was still working, I just wanted to try a newer product that I hoped worked a little better. I have very sensitive skin, hard stubble and quite frankly hate shaving, I was hugely impressed with the 7-790cc-4 from the first shave. I have been using razor for two months and the shaving performance has been very impressive. Stubble removal is very effective on one, two or three day&#x27;s growth, and unlike the 8595 the razor doesn&#x27;t heat up a lot. My skin has been definitely felt less irritated after each shave. Shaving time per shave feels shorter that the 8595, but unlike the 8595 the 790 doesn&#x27;t provide a timer (I estimate my shave takes about 3.5 minutes). The LCD cleaning and charge indicator is definitely a step down from the 8595&#x27;s, and is a basic block design but works well enough. The cleaning system is as effective (but quieter) than the 8595, the cleaning cartridges are exactly the same. The razor&#x27;s build quality is excellent, it feels very solid in the hand and the rubberized grip on the rear of the razor is very secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great improvement is the carry case, which is now a zip closing fabric type case that appears to be far sturdier and should last longer than the older plastic cases that always seemed to crack on the hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Braun has certainly improved on its previous models and created a great electric razor that provides an excellent close shave. The razor is not cheap, but I believe it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun shaver for over 15 years and while it was still running fine, I felt the battery life was beginning to diminish a little.  So I debated on whether to invest in another expensive shaver again or go for a cheaper one that I could buy at Walmart.  After much internal debate, (mostly about the money) I decided to stick with the Braun Series 7-790cc.  I want to tell you,that was the best decision I think I have ever made!  This shaver is just phenomenal and will give you the closest shave of your life and do it so smoothly.  It has three different face settings that allows you to adjust it to the sensitivity of your face and get as close a shave as you want.  It literally will give you a closer shave than a blade razor will and in half the time and no cuts! Lastly when you are done you put it in it&#x27;s charging cradle and it automatically cleans itself.  Absolutely the best shaver I have ever owned and if it lasts as long as my last Braun it will be with me for a long time!</li>
    <li> The Braun 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System Silver is not cheap, but if you are someone that shaves everyday this might be a good investment for you.&lt;br /&gt;A tradesman would not buy a regular tool to use on a job every day, the potential of risking loss time and future business does not support the rationale.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, to spend a few extra dollars on a razor with good ratings could result in a happy customer. This model does have extra bells &amp; whistles but I like the self-cleaning and self-sharpening stuff. The razors fits into my hand well with a slip resistant grip, it is one of the quietest razors I ever used. The foil head is pro-rated to last for eighteen months and the charging system will tell you when to clean the unit and when to replace the foil. All this and I take it into the shower to shave every day, time is money. I hope this info helps you.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best, most comfortable shaver on the,market.  Price was 60% of competitors&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This shaver represents a BIG shift for me! I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotary shavers for about 50 years now but they really cheapened the rotary heads, so I tried an oscillating shaver. Does that seem like a &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; thing? No! To a stubborn guy, this is an earth-shifting change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m glad I did. So far ( about a month now ), the Braun is terrific. Smooth close shave, no pinched skin or pulled hairs, and the cleaning/charging station isa real treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell, but I&#x27;m a happy camper right now!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;self cleaning system&amp;#34; does not work!</li>
    <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;no shaving cream, no razors, no hot water, virtually no maintenance!</li>
    <li> A little too large, but basically good stuff.</li>
    <li> Simply the best electric shaver I have used. I had also tried Philips. There is no comparison between the two.</li>
    <li> Did my homework and almost bought a lower-end Braun shaver, even though the 790cc was what I really wanted and thought I could not afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the 790cc for an incredible price on Amazon and I grabbed it.  Item was exactly as advertised. Seller shipped it immediately, but UPS lost/misplaced the package and it sat in a one of their store-front depots for a week, unnoticed and unprocessed. (Note: This is NOT the seller&#x27;s fault!)  When I contact the seller about this, he/she was surprised and went to UPS and together they found the package and it was finally shipped.  I received the package in a few days.  (Thanks to the seller for their extra effort!  The seller even discounted the shipping charge because of UPS&#x27; delay.  Nice touch!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 790cc shaver is amazing - with not extra effort on my part, it is like 1000s of hungry little blades against your skin, cutting every hair/stubble it touches, leaving your skin very smooth with not residual beard. The ergonomic shape is easy to hold and is less likely to slip out of your hands (like some of Braun&#x27;s older shavers.  Also, due to the 790cc&#x27;s efficiency, it only takes me 1/2 as much time to shave -- an additional benefit I didn&#x27;t expect, since no one had mentioned this in the reviews I read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Braun electric shavers for 35 years and have never had such an experience.  Braun&#x27;s products keep getting better and better.....and the 790cc is a winner.  Thanks Braun.</li>
    <li> Close as a blade.  Works on your noggin, too.</li>
    <li> So, this electric shaver is MARVELOUS!!!!  I do not use this word often... but it really is!!!  I bought this as a recommendation from my ex girlfriend , who told me to start using electric shavers... and as I was using cheap shavers... this was a godsend!  lol  It&#x27;s cleaning mechanism is perfect... it shaves me the way I want a shaver to shave me.  (lol... sorry, too many shaves... lol)  Anyways, I would recommend it fully to anybody.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver , worth the money</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this shaver and uses it every other day. Just wish the cleaning supply was cheaper</li>
    <li> This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten,I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver since i started shaving.  You get what you pay for.  Its pricey but worth it.  This better than I ever expected.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheapper than china but can&#x27;t clear good</li>
    <li> It does a good job.  I like that it can clean itself.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. If you&#x27;re worried about it shaving down as close as a razor blade, don&#x27;t be. The Braun Series 7 - 790cc provides an extremely close shave without the risk of any irritations or cuts. The same can not be said for your average manual razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the cost of this shaving system fool or scare you away from making the purchase either. Think of this as an investment with an upfront cost that will depreciate well over time. You only have to replace the foil every 18 months or so and you can purchase refills of the cleaning solution (did I mention that this shaving system comes with awesome self cleaning functionality?) via Amazon in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: If you&#x27;re ready to step up into the big leagues and leave your razor blades behind, purchase a Braun Series 7 shaver. If you&#x27;d like to save some money, go with a previous model or year.. but I&#x27;d recommend the 790cc because the hygienic cleaning station is a fantastic asset.</li>
    <li> The razor works very well on my old sensitive skin and the cleaning system assures me of a clean razor every day.</li>
    <li> this product is prefect, I never see a item is better than it. I will recommand it to my friends as soon as possible.By the way,the shopping experience with amazon.com is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have never had a good electric razor. I am in the army and currently deployed. So I wanted to try an electric razor to avoid the bathroom rush to shave every morning. First use, I was amazed at how close of a shave it was. It actually excited me :). It was as close as I can get taking my time going against the grain with a leading brand straight blade razor. I have sensative skin and it caused no irritation or discomfort at all. I love this razor and will never go back to a blade. The cleaning system is quick and very convenient. I push the button and it does its thing. Was very excited and it surpassed every expectation I had. The lcd screen is also very nifty I leave it on the charger so no use in the battery but the hygene lets me know when to let it clean. Deffinately would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This shaver is almost as good as a razor, which is very impressive. I am very happy with my product</li>
    <li> I switched from a rotary shaver and was nervous about this shaver because of its price. The price was a bit more than I was looking to spend. However, I heard such good feedback about this device I decided to give it a try. (Amazon has a great return policy, which was my backup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it does a terrific job of shaving my face. Most people have a grain to their beard, but my facial hair doesn&#x27;t seem to work that way. So I&#x27;ve always had a problem with electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why, but this shaver catches all of my facial hair and cuts it cleanly. I&#x27;d say my one little nit is that I can&#x27;t tell when it has cut hair. With my other razors, I could feel it clip a hair, but not this one. So I can&#x27;t listen for when I&#x27;m done shaving; I have to feel my face to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how solid the device feels. It moves easily on my face. It catches those funny hairs under my nose and the hairs on the sides of my neck. It just does a terrific job all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the supplies cost (the cleaner), but I like having a clean, lubricated shaver every day. And the consumables cost is about $4.00 a month; that&#x27;s not bad at all for the benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with it and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a tech geek, so one of the reasons I bought this shaver was because of the neat lcd display and the cool blue lights on the shaver and the base. It did not disappoint, it looks great and feels solid in my hand when I&#x27;m using it. It&#x27;s well built too, it has stood up well over the past year through countless business trips in the sturdy travel case it comes with. One nice feature is that you can recharge it with the power cord alone and not the base if you&#x27;re traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system does an excellent job, and the life of the cleaning cartridges can be prolonged if you remove them after cleaning and replace the plastic cap on them so the solution doesn&#x27;t evaporate (I&#x27;ve only had to change mine twice over the past 8 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does an excellent job alone, but if you want a really close shave, use Lectic Shave to pre-treat your beard. You can buy a bottle at Target for a few bucks.</li>
    <li> When you buy the best I find that I am seldom disappointed. The shaver holds a charge for over a week and it&#x27;s the fastest shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> It provides a very close shave without little to no irritation.  It is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned that didn&#x27;t require me to touch up my neck with a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is also very robust; it got me through a two-week National Guard training exercise on a single charge.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver on the market.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a clean, close shave quicker than other Braun&#x27;s I have owned.  It also has a more powerful and quiet motor/system than other shavers.</li>
    <li> MY OLD RAZOR WAS SO WORN OUT THAT I WOULD NOT SHAVE EVERY DAY.  MY WIFE COMPLAINED.  NOT ONLY IS MY SHAVE NOW BETTER THAN I EVER HAD WITH AN ELECTRIC, IT IS ALSO COMFORTABLE AND I SELDOM MISS A DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE CLEANING PROCESS KEEPS IT IN TOP SHAPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS BRAUN.  IF IT LASTS THE PROJECTED 8 YEARS WITH ONLY CHANGIN TO NEW CUTTERS  EVERY 18 MONTHS IT WILL REALLY BE FANTASTIC ALWAYS.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the Braun Series 7 shaver.  The product arrived on time and in perfect shape.  It shaves very close to my skin, about as close to the same effectiveness as a razor.  The cleaning system is also excellent, as it is easy to use and works great.  I am extremely happy with this shaver and would recommend it if you are looking to buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about getting an electric razor, but have been very happy with the braun 7.  It actually gives me as close if not closer of a shave than when i was using the gillette fusion.  The only exception is at the bottom of my neck, which can require a few extra passes of the razor to get all of the hairs, but overall, i love this razor, and have been completely converted!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been impressed with Braun shavers and the new Braun Series 7-790cc is better than previous shavers I&#x27;ve owned. Very close and smooth shave every time and it&#x27;s quite, too. It&#x27;s a well built solid product and I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a great electric razor. Price is a little high, but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Obviously use for shaving.  Fast shaves &amp; fairly close shaves although not as close as a razor.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Bruan Pulsonic Shaving System for over two years. It works great for me. Just remember that shaving head must be kept flat with the skin for it to cut. Since the cleaning fluid is mostly alcohol,and alcohol evaporates in open container,if the cartridge is left in the cleaner I notice that it barely lasts a month. To save on cleaning fluid, I remove the cleaning cartridge about 5 minutes after the cleaning cycle is complete (to let the cleaning fluid drain back into the cartridge from the wet shaver head) and tightly close it. I only reinsert it into the cleaner when I am done with shaving and ready to have it cleaned. This way the cleaning fluid usually lasts for about month and a half. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve accumulated quite a few electric razors over the years, with the three most recent being the new models from Norelco, Braun and Panasonic. So, thought I&#x27;d do a comparison to perhaps help those who are debating between these high-end models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first let&#x27;s get a basic question out of the way: do you have to spend this much to get a good shave from an electric shaver? Absolutely not. Lower-end models such as the Braun Series 5, the 7000 and 8000 Norelco series and the Panasonic ArcIV are great shavers. What you get for the extra money is a slight improvement in the shave, a bit better design, and a few somewhat useful bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality - all are very nicely put together. The Braun feels the most substantial; the 3D feels the most &amp;#34;plasticy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound - the 3D runs very quietly; the Braun and Panasonic are far more &amp;#34;buzzy&amp;#34; but not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall feel - for me, the Braun feels the most comfortable to hold. Easy to grip even if your hands are wet. The Panasonic is a close second. The 3D feels the most awkward. Not horrible, but not all that comfortable either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: closeness - this is a tough call, with the Braun and the Panasonic both providing very close shaves. The 3D does a pretty good job, but my face does not feel as smooth as with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: speed - the 3D is the clear winner here. Just mows through my beard, with a total shave time of less than 3 min. The Panasonic takes about 4 min for a good shave; the Braun clocks in at about 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: neck - this is the most difficult area for most shavers, and all of these models left a few errant hairs here and there. The 3D did the best but it comes at the expense of some irritation (see the next note). The Braun and Panasonic are about equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave: comfort - Braun is the winner for me, followed by the Panasonic. Zero redness even in the more sensitive spots (jaw line and neck). The 3D left me with some red spots on my neck. Nothing severe, but it is clearly a notch below the others on the comfort meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave - this is limited to just the Panasonic and the 3D. I&#x27;m not a big fan of wet shaving, but both of these do a very good job. The Panny works best with a very thin layer of gel-type cream; the 3D works best with a heavier lather (I got good results with Edge). Both provided close shaves, with the Panny a bit more gentle than the 3D. But, the 3D did a better job on the neck and jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: Just tried the new Remington Alphagel shaving cream and that works very well with both the Panny and the Norelco. The scent is a bit heavy (menthol) but the no-foam consistency is a perfect match for a wet electric shave. Much better than any other shave cream I&#x27;ve tried. I reviewed the Alphagel if you want more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maneuverability - this is where the Braun really shines for me. I have a mustache, and edging it with the Braun is a piece of cake. The 3D takes some practice, but it can do a decent job. Worst by far was the Panasonic - the huge head makes it very hard to create a clean edge around the &#x60;stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auto cleaning - I love the cleaning station from Braun. Works well, cleans well, and the razor comes out lemony-fresh. The Panasonic cleaning station is OK, but is louder, takes longer, and the water-based cleaning solution is not as effective. I can&#x27;t comment on the 3D station since the model I bought didn&#x27;t come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual cleaning - both the Panasonic and 3D are very easy to clean manually. They actually don&#x27;t need the auto cleaning station (although it is handy for storage for the Panny). The cutters are removable from the 3D (unlike the Arcitec models) for extra cleaning every so often. The Braun can be cleaned with water, but it&#x27;s hard to get it very clean since the cutter block is a single unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots more that I could say about these razors, but this review is already way too long. If I had to pick just one, I&#x27;d go with the Braun. While not perfect, it excels in several areas and feels the best. It also offers three settings (gentle, normal and intensive) that vary the speed of the cutters, a feature the other two lack. I find that very helpful. Plus, replacement heads are easily available and often discounted (as are the cleaning cartridges). But, the 3D and the Panasonic are also very good shavers and will get the job done. If you are willing to spend the money, any one of these would be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have the Braun 790cc-4 since I was able to get it at a fantastic price (on another site - sorry Amazon!) on Black Friday. But, under normal pricing situations, the 760 is cheaper and a better value. They work the same, with the differences limited to color of the razor, type of read-out on the handle, and the fact that the 760 lacks the &amp;#34;quick clean&amp;#34; feature in the cleaning station. None of these are really significant, so if you go with the Braun, pick the one that is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you have to learn how to use an electric razor properly to get a good shave. Some quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Don&#x27;t press hard - use an easy touch. If the heads are getting warm or hot, you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;2) Shave against the grain when using a foil; shave in circular motions when using a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;3) Stretch your skin taut when shaving your neck&lt;br /&gt;4) Wait at least an hour after getting up before shaving (everyone&#x27;s face gets a bit puffy when sleeping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Update June 2012: Thought I&#x27;d post an update after 1.5 years of use. No complaints at all - works as good as the day I bought it. I&#x27;m also pleased to report that I have not yet had to replace the foil. Although I have several shavers, this remains my favorite, and I have yet to find another shaver that provides the same blend of solid build quality, ease of use, and outstanding shaving performance. It&#x27;s still a 5-star razor in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Update August 2013: Still working like a champ!  Zero problems with functionality; fit and finish still looks very nice. I did end up replacing the head a couple of months ago, and it was surprising how much of a difference that made. I didn&#x27;t really notice the foil and blades wearing since it occurs so slowly, but really noticed the improvement with the new head.  I&#x27;m not going to wait so long to replace the head next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Update July 2014: Humming along without a problem. I did find that the head can be cleaned very well if I use an ultrasonic cleaner. Not nearly as quick and easy as using the cleaning station, but if you find yourself without any cleaning cartridges (as I did), an ultrasonic cleaner gets the head very clean.  That method of cleaning does not add lubrication as the Braun cleaning fluid does, so I give it a quick spray with Norelco shaver spray after an ultrasonic cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Update May 2016: Zero problems to report. Getting some wear on the silver parts and the handle has taken a ding or three due to getting knocked about while traveling, but the shaver continues to put in a good day&#x27;s work without complaint. However, I recently had the opportunity to use the Panasonic ES-LT7N-S. I have to give the edge to that as my current favorite. It is new, so the price is still way up there, but Panny fixed a lot of the issues/complaints I had with their other high-end models. If your wallet doesn&#x27;t complain about the price of the Panny ES, it&#x27;s well worth considering along with the Braun 7 series.s review is already way too long.

    <li> ok let me give you guys some background, I have a fast growing beard and sensitive skin, even with the best razors and shaving gels my skin is red after shaving. I have actually hated shaving because of this and will let me beard grow because of it. In the past I have tried Norelco products and hated them all. My skin would feel terrible after the shave and the circular Norelco product would pull my hair/burn my skin. I know all manufactures of electronic shavers state that you need to let your skin break in the product and ask that you try the product for 30 days but even after 30 days, Norelco products gave me the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence shaving was something I did not look forward to and did as little as possible (once every week/ two weeks) and only did so because my beard would not look good when it got long. Enter Braun - I felt I should give this a try because I was tired of my look with a beard. I was skeptical at first and shaved without any creams the first time and actually had a good experience as smooth a shave as with any razor I have used (and actually with a razor I had to scrape to get as close a shave - not so with this razor you get a close shave with ease) and quicker than ever too. I have tried shaving daily and most is 4 days after a holiday weekend) and achieve the same results. My wife actually loves the smoothness (she no longer complains that my beard scrapes her) and I notice my bosses at work appreciate my new look. I also love the clean shave system. Once a week (full program) seems to be good enough (sometime I use the program 2xs a week) and the shaver feels/smells great after the process. The shaver is also easy to clean under running water and does not take much counter space. Its pricey but worth it probably costs about the same as shaving with the Gillette Fusion razors (utilizing one a week which costs around 3 bucks each) for a year and a half (the say you need to replace the shaving mechanism every 18 months) when you consider the clean system replacement costs. If you have sensitive skin and want to shave daily, get this razor.ou consider the clean system replacement costs. If you have sensitive skin and want to shave daily, get this razor.</li>
    <li> I rarely hand out 5 star reviews but I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with this 7 series...I bought it to replace a very old Braun (at the time their top of the line like the 7 series is now) which I think I had for over 12 years and still worked but the cord was a bit frayed and it was time for some modern technology...the 7 series is unbelievable...I have a very thick fast growing beard that requires daily shaving and this thing does the trick with virtually no irritation and virtually no extra passes except for around my neck area...I am not a shaverphile so I don&#x27;t know about all the nifty technology built into this product but I do know the thing is awesome and because it is a Braun will last forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco product person for years, the Braun is far superior! I have had great results with the 7 series. Shaves have been a close as I remember with a blade years ago. It is especially thorough where the beard seems to grow in different directions. I probably spend more time shaving because the result is terrific.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at the Naval Academy and typically electric shavers are avoided because chiefs and the like will chew you out during uniform inspections for poor shaves. It is faster (also not requiring a cleaning of the sink afterward) and more comfortable. Before I would change fusion blades once every 2 weeks to keep the shave close enough. I may even be saving money in the long run. \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; is also a big selling point for me.</li>
    <li> great,comfortable.I love it.I really love it. cheap,it is really a good  product.The most comfortable thing I have used.I love it 高端大气上档次。</li>
    <li> I have tried other electric shavers in the past.  I always had to go back to a blade due to skin irritation.  Not anymore.  I have had this shaver for about a month now.  I wanted to give it a try before my review.  I have had zero skin irritation with this shaver.  I have yet to notice the shaver getting hot with prolonged use.  It is a little noisy when it self cleans but that&#x27;s to be expected when the shaver turns on.  All in all, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years and it was time to replace my 5 series and Amazon had a great deal on the 7 series so I purchased one. The cleaning base was DOA, it thought it was half full when no cleaning cartridge was in it and then when you put the brand new one in it still thought it was half full. Hit the clean button and it acted like it was going to clean but then immediately said the cleaner cartridge was empty and stopped. Put the cartridge in my old 5 series station and it was perfect. Since it comes with a alcohol based cleaner you can&#x27;t return it to Amazon so you&#x27;re pretty screwed unless you get warranty which is pretty lame for something right out of the box and never got to use.</li>
    <li> so far best electric razor I have ever used</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t have some item to protect the product,the product is right in the box with nothing,it will hurt the product.</li>
    <li> My significant other is just delighted with it.  Had another pretty much like this one for over 5 years and could not imagine using any other kind.&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Gave me shaving bumps. Trying to return as we speak.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Highly recommend! Cleaning station works great.</li>
    <li> Very good. High reviews. BUT, the 5 blade Panasonic ES-LV81-K is a much better shaver. Having had both the Braun and the Panasonic, the cleaning systems on both the Braun and Panasonic are essentially the same, however, the use of water base in the Panasonic, permitting the used cartridge contents to be simply emptied into the sink and is septic safe vs. the alcohol base used in the Braun cleaning station, which makes it more environmentally difficult when disposing of cartridge contents. Overall, not a bad shaver system, by any means, but, the Panasonic system is better than the Braun.</li>
    <li> So far I am disappointed in the shaves I have received.  I don&#x27;t know if I should use it dry or wet.  I was told by someone they get better the more you use it.</li>
    <li> This is the first serious electric shaver I&#x27;ve had, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It works extremely well, and the self cleaning system is marvelous. The only complaint I could have about it is that the trimmer is harsh on the skin, but that might just my particular case. There isn&#x27;t much to say except that it&#x27;s truly a great product.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a Braun that I&#x27;ve used for the last twenty years (that had been maintained with replacement blades, batteries and foils).  However it was getting tired, so I got a new Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the disposable washing solution, but after seven months of use, I do feel it&#x27;s worth the expense (when bought a Amazon&#x27;s price for refills) to keep the shaver clean and lubricated.  I use the solution every three days or so, and not daily, and find I can stretch the solution to two months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave with the Series 7 is the best I have ever had, and when combined with the Lab Series preshave lubricant, the shave is as close as to what I think a razor shave might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;lock\\&quot; button to lock out the pivoting head when using the trimmer, suddenly broke off, after seven months of use.  I called Braun customer service, who gave me a list of authorized local service centers, where I will bring it in for warranty repair.  Hopefully this shaver can last at least half as long as my previous Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> It is notable that I have been shaving for some (almost) fifty years and have tried electric shavers from time to time, always either giving them away after one attempt or relegating them to a drawer and losing track of their final resting places.  They we&#x27;re (mostly) unused, unliked and lost to history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try once more given the outrageous cost of blades and the inconvenience of needing to soak my beard and apply shaving gel or lather of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good decision.  This Braun 790 model shaves close, gently and cleans automatically.  A giant leap forward from my previous experiences with several other brands AND I bought the high end models of them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver because it performs as claimed and that is a rare thing currently.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to like this given the very high ratings.  Now that I have been using it for four months, I don&#x27;t understand the level of ratings given how this consistently misses areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend more time shaving with this than with a good disposable quad blade, as I must cross over the same areas multiple times at multiple angles, pulling the skin with my other hand vs one or two swipes with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am not particularly fussy, nor do I have a heavy/thick beard, but when I find that two or three days later I HAVE TO use a blade because it cut no hair whatsoever in areas, this is a problem.  Most problematic areas are around the neck, but even along the jaw up to top of ear is a problem - and that is largely \\&quot;flat\\&quot; surface.  And forget getting a clean edge to your goatee...even using it sideways, the goatee has a shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to save time shaving, but I don&#x27;t get a complete shave to the point that on the second day I am not \\&quot;work place presentable\\&quot;, that is a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> This shaver will give u a very close shave. Almost as close as shaving with a razor. Noted i said almost.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t anything new I can really say that hasn&#x27;t been said before.  I&#x27;ve owned my Braun Series 7- 790cc electric shaver for over three years, and I&#x27;ve had nothing but good luck with it.  Even after over three years using the original head, the shave is still as close as ever; the cleaning system also works extremely well.  If you&#x27;re looking for an excellent electric shaver, this is the one.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This machine is very well designed, and works very well, previous to Braun Series 7-790cc, I owned the philips 1290x, which I though, was the best shaver one could own, now I know better, Braun Series 7-790cc, leaves the philips 1290x in its dust.  Braun is a beautifully designed shaver which works very well, the shave is smooth, fast, and easy, all the nooks and crannies of your face are cover and some more, the shaver head needs to be replaced every 18 months, can be cleaned fast and with some simple actions, I defiantly like the cleaning system...It is hard to find fault with this machine, may be if they could somehow get rid of the plastic cartridge in the cleaning system, where we one would not need to throw the plastic away...My score of the Braun Series 7-790cc, Pulsonic Shaver System is 10/10....</li>
    <li> I had a Braun a few years ago and really liked it, but this Braun is 10 times better than the on that I had.  I love that I am able to adjust the intensity of the shave for different parts of my face.  Overall the best I have used.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to give an electric shaver a try, and after reading the Amazon reviews I selected the Braun Series 7 790cc. I have used it for a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It gives me a decent shave. Certainly it is no where near as close as my Gillette Fusion Power razor, but now that I have gotten used to it I find that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave faster than I did with my razor&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need shaving cream and expensive replacement razor blades&lt;br /&gt;I get no irritation on my neck using the Braun where as I did with the razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated the unit as 5 stars, but it does not get all of my neck whiskers as easily as it does the rest of my face. I find myself having to make many more passes on my neck then I&#x27;d like. Yes, I stretch my skin and use the directional techniques that are recommended but it still comes up short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily equate to a better shave, the device feels good in my hand and it gives the impression that it is a high quality product. As a comparison, my son bought a Norelco rotary sensotouch 3D at about the same time. The costs are similar and it also gets good reviews. To me it feels cheap and it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d feel comfortable bringing on a trip with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a quickie test we decided to swap our electric shavers for one shave a week ago and afterwards both of us preferred what we had bought (I the Braun, he the Norelco). I thought the Norelco felt cheaply made and I didn&#x27;t like that the cleaning solution gets poured into an open reservoir vs the Braun cartridge system. We both agreed the Norelco was slightly quieter, and that the Braun made shaving a little bit faster. He thought the Norelco shaved him closer, I thought the Braun shaved me closer. We both agreed neither beat the Gillette Fusion razor for closeness, but between the two of us and our blade use the two electric shavers will pay for themselves in about a year&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These conclusions are certainly not the result of a scientific lab experimentation of shavers in a controlled manner, but they do represent our real-world personal conclusions.he result of a scientific lab experimentation of shavers in a controlled manner, but they do represent our real-world personal conclusions.</li>
    <li> Years ago I had a Braun saver and I would wear a hole in the foil and would have to replace it 2 or 3 times before the cutters. I went to the Philps for 6 years, but was not getting a close shave so I went with the Braun 790 which turn out the best shaver I have ever had and the cleaning station is a bonus...</li>
    <li> the shaver exceeds my expectations. I have been using it for the last few weeks and so far no complaints. I have not ran into one problem with it nor anything I can think of to improve upon it. it&#x27;s everything you expect in a top of the line shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have been with Norelco for years but they stop making replacments at a resonable cost for my current shaver so I switched.  Its a nice shaver but I just don&#x27;t seem to get the shave from this as I did my Norelco.  I think its the way my hair grows.  I already tossed box or probably would have returned.  Thus I keep trying to see if after a month it improves.  I let you know.</li>
    <li> After being on this earth for lets say a couple generations I finally switched from a razor to electric after using my sons shaver (we won&#x27;t tell him). After a couple days of having my face get used to it, it is Great. Especially around the holiday and so many parties to attend I&#x27;m not walking around with tissue paper on my face. For those of you (I really mean your wives) who don&#x27;t want it on the bathroom counter I had the same concern and issue (well she did) buy by putting the charger/cleaner in another inconspicuous room (say under your home desk for example as long as you have kids and or animals who do not have access to it of course) helps keep the lady happy. You could always charge it over night on the counter and keep the station in the closet during the day. I prefer not to afraid of spilling the cleaning solution with moves in and out.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic for a month now and love it. I have been using a Braun for over 7 years and the old one gave me good service. This one is quieter than the old one but gives a closer shave, and I like the idea of using a warm water rinse when traveling instead of carrying the alcohol base around.</li>
    <li> I Enjoy this system i do have to mix in conventional shaving on occasion because this system will only cut hair that is so long.  but it works great for a quick shave</li>
    <li> Owned many Braun 3 units, was very happy. Was about to buy another and saw a review of the 7. Previously, I thought the 7 was a 3 plus some gadgets. I was wrong; it&#x27;s a much better shaver. My beard is very difficult to shave. The 7 does a great job, considering. I don&#x27;t know how I could be happier. Lasers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the criticism of the pop out trimmer in a prior review. I use a separate beard trimmer, so no worries.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, de tecnolog&amp;iacute;a innovadora, f&amp;aacute;cil de usar y practico. Quiz&amp;aacute; el reservorio del sistema de lavado deber&amp;iacute;a ser un poco mas peque&amp;ntilde;o. De cualquier manera estoy muy conforme con la afeitadora</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Excellent shave on face, even with a few days of growth. This is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used (I have had several over the years). As a person that very easily gets facial irritation, having a good razor really can improve your quality of life. I feel that this product has done that. I used to dread shaving before work everyday, because I knew that several hours later I would have red irritation that would be painful to the touch. I tried may different traditional razors as well as countless shave gels and creams. The Series 7 has eliminated about 90% of the discomfort I was dealing with, all while cutting my habitual shaving time in half. The one downfall to the product, in my case, is it&#x27;s ability to provide an acceptable shave on the right and left bottom side of my neck. This is probably due to the fact that the hair seems to grow in a circle in this location on my face. But in order to finish the job each morning I have had to resort to the traditional razor, but it is minor and only takes a few small circular strokes to finish the job. In any case I am still very pleased with the product and would recommend it too friends and family.</li>
    <li> This shaver requires multiple passes over the same area to remove most of the hair. My foil started disintegrating after 7-months of use. I clean the head after each use. This model shaver (790cc-4) is overpriced considering the poor overall performance &amp; reliability.</li>
    <li> The item was defective. Shaver head lock swithch does not work. Unfortunately Amazon.com does not accept returns for this item. Everything else was just fine.</li>
    <li> This Braun 7-790cc Braun shaver is the best thing since sliced bread. I used a razor for years never an electric one. The manual Gillette razor was getting to irritate me so bad I had to do something so I got this Braun shaver. That was the best move I could of made. No more rash, smooth shave, cleans itself no mess,and cordless to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye Shaving cream, preshave oils,and hairs in the sink forever....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to manual Gillette razors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> the price is cheap, ok</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all of the things I liked about my 12 year old rotary razor, but this is still a good razor.</li>
    <li> A smooth, comfortable and close shave.</li>
    <li> Best shavers bar none. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s back end. I love the self cleaning setup. Always fresh.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. The price of the Braun and reviews led me to believe I was getting the best, not so. The shaver with its settings for your type of beard doesn&#x27;t seem to make any differerence, it will not give you a close shave! The cleaning station works okay but it will not throughly clean the shaver. I am in my seventies and have used electric razor for some time and this Braun is no better than some of the others I have owned. Save your money and take a good look at the other shavers available.</li>
    <li> Great overall! Only thing that hasn&#x27;t went smoothly is the cleaning process. But other then that, it works amazingly great.</li>
    <li> Shaves closer than soap and razor blade; less mess.</li>
    <li> I have been a longtime Braun user (+10 years) and then switched to a Panasonic which I really enjoyed other than the cleaner it came with.  I returned to Braun when I decided to give the Series 7 another go.  I don&#x27;t have heavy stubble, and shave after a shower using pre-electric daily.  Since switching back to it 3 months ago I have been thoroughly disappointed in how badly it yanks my whiskers out if I go more than a single day between shaves.  This is more than enough time for my skin to become accustomed to the foil and razor head, yet I still don&#x27;t get a close shave and never know when it will be a painful morning of shaving.  I don&#x27;t know what has changed with the Pulsonic, but it&#x27;s for the worse.  I can&#x27;t recommend this razor at all any more.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months now, and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t expect to go over your face one time and get everything, as no electric shaver is going to do that.&lt;br /&gt;But if you go over tough areas a few times you will get it easy. Also the self cleaning feature is nice. I use it with shaving cream so I wash a little after to get that off, but the self cleaner also lubes it and what not..</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for over thirty years and this is the best one I have ever owned.  Its much quieter, gives closer shaves and ins more versatile than the others.  One can tell it is a quality product by the way it looks, feels and performs.  I would heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> a good shaver with good performance however the noise level is high</li>
    <li> Shaves great absolutely loves that it cleans itself and does a good job</li>
    <li> I miss not having an edge trimmer.  Need several passes to get a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Shaves closely without irritation for a smooth, smooth shave.  When it cleans and lubes, it does do with German engineering perfection.  Treat yourself!</li>
    <li> I have this shaver now for about 3 years, it still works like on the first day. I recently took shaver and charger cable on a 2 week vacation. Never needed the charger cable and this after the shaver has been 3 years on charge continuously. So the battery is still in perfect state. The cleaning system works perfect, always shows you the state of the fluid (3 levels) and the clean state of the shaver itself. After 5 or so shaves it is on read, reminding you to start the cleaning process which takes about 20 minutes. This is shaving culture at its best.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to my best friend.</li>
    <li> Great piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks got this Braun back from the warranty repair facility. Repair order said they replaced the \\&quot;Drive Unit\\&quot;.  Feels and shaves like a completely different unit. FAST, SMOOTH, CLOSE,COMFORTABLE, and takes off all the neck hairs like my 5000 Series used to. I have to conclude my original unit was defective when originally purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Read my Original Review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Doesn&#x27;t even merit 1 star. Would return it if I could. NOT the same \\&quot;German\\&quot; Braun of years past. The Braun Shaver Company is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Procter &amp; Gamble, which acquired Gillette in 2005. This explains a LOT.  As with too many American companies they throw their money into Hype and Advertising to the masses rather than product integrity. Read the Review by: By dugn on August 27, 2010 here on Amazon. Very accurate info in a REAL Review.  Remember two things , 1 If you bought a NEW shaver it&#x27;s because your OLD shaver is BAD, even a marginal shaver will Appear great next to your old and tired one....when your first get it.  And 2 - about a lot of 5 star reviews, did you know you can Hire a \\&quot;Review Farm\\&quot; to manufacture glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is NOWHERE as good as the 5000 series or my old 6 year old Remington 200 which I am now using again (with new blades) because the Braun has been sent in for repair. Takes way longer to shave than the 5000 series and leaves neck hairs. My opinion: A $20 shaver in a $200 Box.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, that was my original review Before the Drive Unit was replaced under Warranty. Now it&#x27;s an awesome shaver!</li>
    <li> Quality shave. Seems much more powerful than previous model. Second Braun I have owned. Will not hesitate to buy the next model when this one goes bad. Previous one lasted 3 years before i dropped it. :P</li>
    <li> Previous rotary electric razor would leave me with razor burn up and down my neck even after replacing with new heads. The Braun shave rivals a straight razor in closeness. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Probably the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. For years i could only shave every 3-4 days w shaving cream i tried everything even the cheaper electric razors. Finally this came into my life and I am getting all the hot chicks.</li>
    <li> Overall its a great electric shaver, and use it to cut my hair and gets me a close shave with no irritation. fast charging and excellent cleaning system. I love how smooth and clean my skin feels and no irritation, finally i find an electric shaver that gives me a fast shave, with no trouble removing hard to reach hair and no skin issues.</li>
    <li> Good product. The only thing is the dead seems a little cheap and could break is dropped. Works great though. Excellent shave.</li>
    <li> This is the way to go. I have studied this. Nothing better. Comfortable and clean every time. Do clean it every time. Buy the replacement fluid here on Amazon... best price in all the land.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE it...........</li>
    <li> Best electric shave yet! Gets really close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few days since it arrived and I thought I&#x27;d give my first impressions. The thing is easy to set up, charges very quickly and feels good in my hand. I&#x27;ve been a long time blade user and I wanted something faster for during the week when I&#x27;m working, so I can get out of the house quicker. Although the instructions warn that it can take 2 weeks to get used to electric shaving, I was pleasantly surprised that the very first shave I had was impressively close (and passed the partner touch test also). I have very thick hair and get stubbly very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, I still think blade shaving is closer, but this is just fine as a day to day shaver and I&#x27;m impressed by how far the quality of these things has come along since I last tried.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system seems to work well and leaves the shaver with a nice lemony scent, though I&#x27;m grumpy that the cleaning solution is not that cheap (as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s just alcohol and some scent). However, it&#x27;s nice to know the shaver is clean every time I want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;So, the shaver itself is an easy five stars for me. I&#x27;m knocking off a star because I feel that the cleaning cartridges are overpriced for what they are (especially when the shaver is not cheap in the first place). This was overall though a great purchase, and I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review. Head lock button broke after 2 months. Currently getting the run-around trying to get this repaired. Seems from the Internet that this is a common problem and shouldn&#x27;t be happening with a shaver that&#x27;s this expensive. Removing a star from my original score.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Product, best I ever had</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m yet to try it completely. But for a first shave I was not very impressed considering this is an expensive one for me.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job on my face....but as with any electronic shaver..you&#x27;ll still have those spots that aren&#x27;t totally smooth....would buy agian though</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver at a great price.  Amazon has the cheapest price.  Husband loves this.  This shaver is highly rated in consumer reviews.</li>
    <li> Product seems hi-fi in the way it functions and so many buttons. It is tough and can pull a few hairs initially but if you do it carefully, then it is worth the trouble. Nice overall, could be smoother and safer though.</li>
    <li> comparing this to other electric brands such as remington and norelco this shaver is great. It gets a really close shave and barely irritates the face or neck unlike the other brands. This shaver really does cut close it cuts closer and more consistent than  shaving with a fusion power and the good ol&#x27; straight razor. Been using it regularly everyday for the past few months and i must say i am impressed, definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> It is the best shaver I have ever used. The closest shave every time with out fail. No reaction at any stage and I have sensitive skin. With very short or slightly long growth, it has done a great job every time.</li>
    <li> the Braun 7-790cc is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had or could hope for. I&#x27;ve had all the other types and several other Braun and this one stands way out ahead of the rest. [...]</li>
    <li> Nice features and self cleaning options.  It is easy to use. I am used to a blade for years so the difference in it not being as close of a shave has taken some getting used too.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my son He is very happy to have it. Does all that it says, close shave, strong on battery, lite weight</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years. My beard seems to be getting tougher each year, and I have been spending a lot of money replacing Norelco heads. Two weeks ago, I read reviews of shavers, online and in consumer magazines. The Braun Series 7 is rated highest. I bought the most expensive Braun razor--and it has not disappointed. It cuts much faster than any of my 6 Norelco electric shavers. And the Braun gives the closest shave. If the shaving head lasts a reasonable duration, I will be extremely pleased with this razor. There is a warning with the razor that it takes two weeks for Norelco users to adjust to the Braun. I did not find any adjustment period. I selected the closest setting and have liked this terrific, albeit expensive shaver. Is the Braun 7 shaver worth the expense? Absolutely.</li>
    <li> Very close shave, and incorporates a handy LCD display to see where your at with charging and the cleaning of the unit. Very comfortable to hold and use. Only downfall is the docking of the shaver in the cleaner unit. It requires to be placed in a certain way where the old 360&#x27;s for instance could be just dropped in and would line itself with charging contacts. Overall I would give this shaver a 9/10. Amazon was also far by the cheapest way to purchse this unit. Great value shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and the first time e used it, he loved it! He came to me and said \\&quot;feel how smooth my face is this is awesome\\&quot;. He has a problem with ingrown hairs on his neck and this shaver has reduced that problem drastically!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the new Series 7 for about a month now. It replaced and older Braun that I was having head issues with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver does a nice job, charging and cleaning times seem to have decreased. I like the bar graph displays on the unit. And the head adjustment seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial cost is a bit high but if the foil heads last the 18 months as advertised it should be cost effective in the long run.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my son, he love it it really make all his expectations, great product we recommend it</li>
    <li> Ive been using Braun series shavers for about 8 years.  Most of them have been the lower grade series, finally decided to go with the Series 7 and have not been dissapointed.  This thing can get a VERY close shave every time, even in the hard to shave areas.  Quiet shaver too.  I would recommend this to anyone that shaves daily and wants a razor smooth shave everytime.</li>
    <li> I have probably used at least 5 different electric shavers but the Braun is the very best. I have use the blade and shaving cream but the closeness and convenience with the Braun gives me a very close shave.  I recommend this shaver to anyone who wants the very best.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver, I used it several times, very nice and useful.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner also is good.  A + +</li>
    <li> this was the best surprsie and it was so good that we gifted one to grandpa and bought another one, expecting it soon... :)</li>
    <li> This shaver is a solidly built product that works quite well. It is safe to use and the cleaning system is convenient.</li>
    <li> Reluctant at first because of the price the product exceeded my expectations...  Highly recommend the Braun Electric Shaver.  The cleaning system also works well and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> This shaver has a heavy solid feel in your hand and looks and feels well-constructed.  I still wish it did better in the shaving dept. I swear, I don&#x27;t even have a thick shadow, but I still find myself grinding away with every shaver I try on the patch under my chin and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is nice but it can be a money sucker unless you know my trick!  Here&#x27;s what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Only clean it once a week with the solution.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Keep the solution cartridge capped during the week when not in use so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate away.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Once it&#x27;s time to clean, uncap, and clean.  Then recap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will allow your cleaning solution to last much longer thereby saving a lot of money.  SNAP!</li>
    <li> Before purchasing the Braun shaver, I was a Norelco guy. For the past decade, all of my shavers were from Norelco. I have owned about 4 Norelco shavers in my lifetime and each one died on my in 2-3 years. My last one died on me last year and I decided to try something new. I read several reviews on the Braun Series 7 - 790cc shaver and was very interested. After having the 3 circles of Norelco for so long, it would be interesting to see how these straight lines will do. After using the Braun for about a year, I have converted over to Braun. It shaves better than the Norelco and I love the self cleaning. The solution to clean the shaver might seem a little pricey but each cartridge has last me about 3 months so it&#x27;s not too bad. I am hoping this shaver will last more than the standard 2-3 year cycle I have experienced with the Norelcos. Only time will tell. In the mean time, I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone in the market for a really nice shaver and doesn&#x27;t mind spending the extra few $$$.</li>
    <li> ordering the shaver was a great experience to the good and using the shaver was another great experience,thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased a lower level Braun in the summer and it was horrible.  I upgraded to the series 7 and I could not be happier.  Spend the extra money and get the best shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor works well, the package is also very good. I bought this one for my father, he likes it.</li>
    <li> Works great The shaver is good quality and looks like it will last for a long time very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Bought it for my hubby after his Series 5 busted.  He loves it and uses it daily on the way to work.  It comes with a nice travel case and the cleaning station is very &amp;#34;smart.&amp;#34;  My only complaint is the neck/beard trimmer sticks out at an awkward angle. I am only complaining because I trim hubby&#x27;s neck weekly.</li>
    <li> I had a rotary shaver before, I&#x27;ll never go back. This darn thing even cleans itself :-)</li>
    <li> Good quality and look shaver, especially price</li>
    <li> I have this for a few months now, I get a real close shave and feel like I&#x27;m using a brand new shaver each time.</li>
    <li> This will be the 3rd Braun shaver I have bought my husband in the 28 yrs we have been married.  My husbands dermatologist recommended this brand above all the others out there.  It works well for all types of beards and does not irritate the skin.  It works great on men with Acne or Rosacea as an example.  No razor bumps or irritations.  My husband uses the cleaning cartridges to clean his razor and it keeps it nice and clean.  He has recommended this razor to friends who couldn&#x27;t believe that an electric razor could give such a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> worst shave I ever had. Thanks for the refund</li>
    <li> its perfect battery last long more than any expectation , shaving is fast and smooth&lt;br /&gt;but i didnot try the cleaner yet</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun razors for the last 10 years or so.  I prefer the shave better than others.  Braun razors are not cheap to maintain but the results are worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic shaver. It works great when I keep on a schedule and trim up ever day or two, but if I go four days without using it then I have to spend forever going over and over my face to get the stubble. I&#x27;ve been told this is pretty normal for electronic shavers but as this is my first I&#x27;m not really sure. I do like it. I wish it was able to get a little bit finer shave next to my sideburns without having to push out the trimmer part, but I guess that&#x27;s the nature of electrics.</li>
    <li> Much better than my previous rotary shaver, and the cleaning cycle keeps it fresh!! I simply love it and so will you.</li>
    <li> Having used a rotary shaver for several years, the switch to the Braun was a pleasure. The shave is closer and with less repeated strokes over the same area of skin.  The weekly cleaning and charging device is easy to use. Although, leaving it in the charger after you leave the bathroom might startle your wife, as it goes on an off in an unpredictable pattern.  Overall, a definite step up from other electric razors.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best...bought one for myself, and one for my oldest son</li>
    <li> I have tried a few electric razors, and have always just gone back to the normal gilette.... Even that would hurt and leave ingrown hairs. Now with this new razor I But I actually enjoy shaving!! Also I get more kisses from my wife! It is the smoothest electric shave I have ever had. And was well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for six months on an almost daily basis and overall I am very pleased with it. The one complaint I have is that, as other reviewers have pointed out, it can be a bit tricky and frustrating to get all the neck hairs depending on how they lie on your neck. I&#x27;ve found that going nice and slow, using plenty of light, and going at the tricky spots from multiple angles pretty much resolves the issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other recommendation I have is regarding the &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Renew&amp;#34; Cartridges. At first, I&#x27;d just shave and put the razor in and let it completely clean it (as the manual suggests). While it did a nice job of cleaning it, after I while I noticed the nice, lemony fresh started getting a bit gross. It basically recycles the cleaning fluid so over time it accumulates the hair and skin cells and just starts getting smelly. In addition, this uses up the fluid rather quickly and the cartridges are not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution (no pun intended) is to simply pop the razor head off after each shave, give it and the razor a quick rinse, shake them out and then place it in the charger and let it do the clean. This makes sure it gets sanitized and lubricated but doesn&#x27;t accumulate near as much of the hair and skin cells, therefore reducing the smelly factor to nothing. All the way through the life of the cartridge, it still smells nice and fresh. As an added bonus, it makes the cartridges last a lot longer. I can easily go 1.5-2 months without having to change cartridges and again, they still smell nice and fresh at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would totally recommend this razor and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Folks, don&#x27;t let anyone fool you. There is no electric razor that will shave as close as the state of the art Gillette razors. It&#x27;s just not possible. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t very good electric razors. I believe this is the best of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually the 3rd Braun 7-790cc that I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve got a really bad habit of leaving them on hotel bathroom countertops. I&#x27;m really trying to work on this. I had my first Braun razor for about 4 years, changed the head twice and was totally satisfied. Over the years I&#x27;ve owned Remington, &amp; Norelco brands but none have equaled this Braun model. I think the key is the speed at which this one vibrates. Very easy to use with minimal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I need really close shave I keep a Gillette handy. But for typical daily use this Braun is more than sufficient.</li>
    <li> If you have any facial hair, this may not be the best razor for you.  I found it to also leave more stubble than my Norelco X1250, which has it&#x27;s own issues regarding replacement heads, etc.  I bought the Norelco 9311 (still waiting) and will probably give the Braun to a family member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: August 18, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I have received the Norelco and have used both razors intermittently.....(days apart) .....the Norelco clearly gives a closer shave (I have a fairly thick stubble)  Separately,  the &amp;#34;lock mechanism&amp;#34; on the Braun has already failed for what thats worth.</li>
    <li> The real test is the shave - and this is the best result I&#x27;ve ever had from shaving with an electric. On rare occasions I&#x27;ll use a blade for a special occasion and a blade is usually much closer than most electrics - but I&#x27;ve been okay with a slight sacrifice using an electric in the past. My face right now feels so shockingly smooth, I&#x27;d swear I shaved with a blade this morning... So the proof is in the pudding - and I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this shaver if you&#x27;re partial to electrics.</li>
    <li> have not had any ingrown hairs yet so I&#x27;m hopeful only had it 2 weeks so we will see</li>
    <li> This is the only electric shaver I can use without getting a rash</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers over the years but this one is the best. It shaves closely and quickly without irritation. You get what you pay for. The Bruan shaver works best for me when I use an electric razor pre-shave.</li>
    <li> In comparison to &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; Philips electric shavers, this Braun model&#x27;s battery gets depleted speedily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to have a clean shave, i need to use my older Philips shaver to do the bulk of he work, THEN use this Braun machine to do the final sweeping !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is inconvenient and hard to use !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst investment EVER  !!</li>
    <li> I have been using a rotary razor for 30 years and always had issues and irritation:  this is my first foil razor and I just LOVE it.  I have been able to share more closely than wit rotary and never experienced irritation anymore:  i have stopped using after-shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rasor is great quality, feels right in the hand, self-clean, and works great.</li>
    <li> Good razor, received the goods after a lot of packaging, packaging is very good, the quality is also very good, with a very comfortable</li>
    <li> looks great nice design my problem is I need to use it three times be for I have a clean shave</li>
    <li> love braun so much. works great</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other brand.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I have had in a long time. Fairly quiet when running. Very nice, and worth the price!</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I have bought; shaving is a breeze, well worth the higher price and the easy cleansing unit  keeps it at top operating condition-highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Braum series 7 is the best , so is the price.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this new electric shaver, I kept reading the reviews and was skeptical about buying it due to the amount of money it was. I can say now that, I am so happy I purchased this Braun series 7 electric razor. It has been nothing but amazing since the first day, smooth clean close shave, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and it&#x27;s so easy to use! the best part is once you&#x27;re done, set it back in the dock and let it clean and charge. If money is the only thing questioning you about buying this, invest in this product and you will not regret it at all!  I recommend this to everyone, I am so happy I bought this product. Best electric razor I have used, and I have been through so many to find the right one!</li>
    <li> Its only 1/4 price comparing our Jingdong wedsite shoping with newly style one.itsworth to buy.</li>
    <li> Great shaver but the trimmer is not as good as the one that was one the 15 year old Braun shaver it replaced.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old Braun electric razor. I asked friends for their suggestions and I read various reviews. I wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted any kind of a cleaning system since it seemed to be  a unnecessary add-on. After using this razor now for a month, I&#x27;m amazed at its shaving quality and appreciate the entire system as a whole. The razor shaves closer than my Braun 5000 series ever did.the cleaning system does its job, cleans out any debris in the shave her head, and provides a fresh lubricated razor every time.  I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system every day but generally about 2-3 times per week.</li>
    <li> Money well spent on this one.  Still going strong after two years.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of Braun shavers over the years (I think this is number 6 or 7) - I have to say that after my first shave with this I was impressed. Best shave with an electric I&#x27;ve ever had,  Braun or not. My wife even came into the bathroom to ask what the fuss was about (she heard me ooh and ahhh while shaving). Why only four stars? I travel a lot and and don&#x27;t always have the base available to me, so I remove the screen top and tap out the debris after every shave. This is the first Braun I&#x27;ve had where the &amp;#34;screen top piece&amp;#34; feels flimsy and cheap when removing and inserting. Most times I&#x27;m either afraid I&#x27;m going to break it or I&#x27;ve put it on incorrectly - I haven&#x27;t broken it, but I have needed to readjust it when I &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34; it was on correctly, and it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;snap in&amp;#34; with a firm, secure, satisfying sound or feeling. Again, great shave, the battery life (so far) seems exceptional, just that one little complaint.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. He never found a razor like this, it works very well. He&#x27;s very happy ... and me too!!! Thank you Braun and thank you Amazon for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> GOOD ，I LIKE It VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me A LOT OF FUN,I&#x27;LL RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!NICE NICE GREAT</li>
    <li> I have tried many electric shavers and this is the first I have found that does a great job and does a great job on the neck line.</li>
    <li> Shave is great but cleaning base has a very large footprint and it is very noisy in during the cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shaver did not like electric shaver before but this one is great.</li>
    <li> I had held on to my previous Braun razor for 20+ years. I should have upgraded a long time ago. This razor is much faster and easier on my face. I have been very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> This is the first real electric shaver I bought after using blade razors. I have a tough beard that grows in several different directions. I am now on the 3rd replacement head. No matter how many passes I make in several directions, this does not shave me as close as a cheap, multi-blade razor...even without cream. The trimmer I find useless. Interestingly, the foil attachment that came with the Conair multi-attachment trimmer shaves me closer (at a cost of $30). The $20 Braun Mobishave I bought shaves at least as close.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about spending this much on a razor, but I am very happy with it. It is a BIG improvement from my rotary Norelco. The results are just as good as my Gilette razor. My eyes are not to sharp in the AM. So this Braun is perfect for Mr. I love it.</li>
    <li> It shaves very clean.. it&#x27;s very good and well designed. The hand feeling is very good. Both of us love it!</li>
    <li> I have previously owned a Braun shaver which died after years of use.  I cannot blade shave because I cut myself to shreds and hate the post shave pain from sensitive skin.  After my last Braun I purchased a Panasonic shaver, but I was never quite happy with it.  The Braun 790CC shaves very well for an electric shaver and my skin feels smooth afterwards.  I am still not convinced that this shaves as closely as a blade.  However, it is as close as you will get without the pain and mess associated with blade shaving.  I cannot recommend the Braun highly enough.</li>
    <li> Read my review here - it&#x27;s the newer model of the 790:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PTE2VUNO951V/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00BWRLJ6O&amp;channel&#x3D;detail-glance&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760901&amp;store&#x3D;hpc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer model is now waterproof and costs about the same!</li>
    <li> My husband likes his new Braun.  There is one thing that is harder to use than the older one and that is the clippers for shaving his neck and side burns.  The way it is turned is MUCH harder to shave his neck after a haircut.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model to this (Series 700) for going on 10 years that I got as a gift from my wife.  It has served me well and continues to function.  A lot can change in 10 years apparently since this shaver gives a much closer shave in one pass than the old one (and I thought the old one was great)  Coupled with the waterproof enclosure and long shave time from a charge (and very quick charging to boot) This thing is awesome.  The one function I miss is the built in trimmer from the old model.  I didn&#x27;t think about it when I ordered but I often would use that to square off sideburns and clean up my neckline.  I&#x27;ll need to use something else for that now but given the tradeoff for an incredibly comfortable and close shave that this provides it was a small price to pay.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Gives a good clean shave without any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality and well built. Would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Stuart Dos</li>
    <li> This delivers the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  Very easy on the skin also.  I can&#x27;t really comment on the battery life because I always keep it on the charger.  I shave every other day and put it right back in the cleaning unit.  I love the no hassle features on the cleaning unit.  It will automatically sense what type of clean the razor needs and as soon as you push the start button, does it&#x27;s job well.  I&#x27;ve yet to use it in the shower, but all the reviews I read leading up to my purchase has been right in line with the review I&#x27;m leaving so I have no doubt that it would perform perfectly.</li>
    <li> I thought i had to buy the newer version since I did have older model and it did so-so job on my beard but this one is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have always gotten close shaves using regular disposable razors. Every year I have spent money throwing away many disposal shavers after 2 to 3 shaves. So,I figure that instead of throwing away money on disposables, I would bite the bullet and get an Electric shaver.  In the hopes that the electric shaver would pay for itself over a period of time.  Years ago, I did own a small electrical razor and I was never quite satisfied with the results. So, when looking into purchasing a new electric shaver, i did extensive research and asked friends and family and the occasional store customer what they owned and what kind of brand electric razor they would recommend to get the closes shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After combing through many online reviews including on Amazon for the best shaving brands .  My extensive search led me to the  Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System.  I have been using it now for several months and I must confess that it did a better job than the old electric shaver but it wasn&#x27;t by much. I still don&#x27;t get that close shave that I desire.  To be candid, I don&#x27;t think there is a machine that exists out there that can give you a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In respect to the design, the machine and the storage unit are very elegant in style and it does a great job in cleaning itself automatically.  Although, it can get pricey changing the blades and buying the refill cleaning cartridges.  But if you are looking to get a good shave that is better than most.  Then I recommend this machine for you. It is easy to use and and very easy to maintain clean.  it is better than most of the electric shaver out there in the market.</li>
    <li> Bought this 2 years ago. Best shaver ever. can you believe it I retire and buy a new shaver? This one is pricey but to me well worth it. If you have a brand that has worked for you over the years don&#x27;t change. I used a braun from 1986 til this upgrade. The best for me!</li>
    <li> I like it vrey muchI like it vrey much。It&#x27;s very beautry.Thank you very much.I will buy some one next time.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  F.Freel</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning System:  Originally, I&#x27;d seen the cleaning system as frivolous luxury, but it isn&#x27;t really that expensive, is used every day, and contributes to hygiene and general pleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn/mustache trimmer that flips up stopped working almost as soon as I got it, which was very disappointing coming from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The intensity/nearness setting seems to keep getting changed toward &amp;#34;senstive&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; even though I&#x27;m not trying to change it.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving so much I grew a beard for the winter, it was great not having to shave everyday. A beard really doesn&#x27;t suit me so I had to go back to a daily shave. I can honestly say I love this electric shaver, it does all it says it can. I get a nice clean shave, without the nicks and cuts of a blade. I can shave the night before and not really concentrate on it. The cleaning system works so every few days the razor is fresh as new. If you hate shaving and the past electric razors you tried were not up to the job, give this Braun a try, you will be glad you did</li>
    <li> Well i got this shaver and it worked onece, went out of town for two days came home and it didnt turn on and now amazon wont let me return it says it&#x27;s a fire saftey issues well give me a freaking break like i cant toss the cleaner . what a joke not sure who the bigger one . amazon or brAun .</li>
    <li> The first self cleaning Braun I purchased had a charge arm that would lock it into the cleaning base, the plastic latching piece in that broke so I started using a rubber band to charge it. When I saw this unit with no arm I thought all the trouble were behind, I was wrong. Three months after purchase the locking head lever stopped locking it, so I continued using it in swivel mode. Now the locking button disappeared, I finally located it in the bottom of the cleaning base. Both the old and the new were taken out with a thin plastic piece that broke off. I left the razor in locked head mode. The closest I can figure the vibrating in the cleaner base caused it to break. The trimmer on it is all but useless since it opens in the middle of the shaver at a ninety degree angle to the razor, very awkward to use the trimmer.  I lived with that but I could not live being burned twice by cheap craftsmanship and had to say something. Moving on to another razor company next time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a Panasonic self-cleaning shaver that had stopped working after almost 8 years of constant use. The reason why I decided to switch to Braun, was because the cleaning system on my Panasonic had to be replaced 4 times due to leakage. After the 4th replacement started leaking, I gave up and cleaned it myself for the remaining years that it was in service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 790-CC is a nicely designed shaver and its ergonomic handle makes it a pleasure to hold while in use. I had fully expected to rate this shaver 5 stars, but after just 7 weeks of use, I&#x27;m giving it 2.5 stars instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When working properly, I would have to say that this shaver does a good job, not a great one. After reading all of the 5 star reviews, which influenced me to purchase this shaver, I find myself dismayed, as the shaver doesn&#x27;t deserve such high ratings. As mentioned above, the ergonomic handle makes it feel good while shaving. The problem is, the shaver doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave unless you spend at least 10 minutes using it each time. I&#x27;ve tried all of the various settings, as well as running it across my face lightly, moderately and pressing down fairly hard. The optimum way to use the shaver is to run it across your face lightly, and at different angles. At times it helps to stretch out your skin and then run the shaver against it. Despite doing all of the above, in no way does this shaver come anywhere near as close as a blade does to providing the user with the optimum shave. Since I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews about how close the shave is supposed to be, I&#x27;m really disappointed in the job that it does on my face. I was preparing to go out to a formal event, and wanted to look good. After using the shaver for 15 minutes, covering every possible angle and pressure on my face, the closest I could come to a blade wasn&#x27;t close at all. Running my hand across my face after using the shaver, it was evident that a blade wins by a long shot. In fairness to Braun, I would like to state that no shaver that I&#x27;ve used to date provides a shave that&#x27;s as close to a blade. This seems strange to me, as some 40 years ago, the owner of Remington shavers claimed that their shavers \\&quot;Performed as close as a blade, or your money back.\\&quot; I guess you can say anything in advertising, whether it&#x27;s true or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun, AKA P &amp; G advertises that this shaver is, and I quote \\&quot;Shaver Built To Perform ~ Perfectly smooth skin with shavers tested to last 7 years.\\&quot; Well perhaps they got the 7 correct, but in my case the years should have said weeks. Yes, after just 7 weeks of use, the cleaning base failed. In addition, the locking mechanism on the shaver itself no longer works. The locking mechanism is meant to be used to keep the foil/cutter in a stationary position, thus enabling you to better access the area above your lips, and the lower neck area. I really didn&#x27;t find that this helped at all, so I only used it once or twice. Even so, for it to stop working after 7 weeks is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reputable company would make sure that the customer is pleased with their purchase. (Braun ~ P &amp; G) is not such a company. I called them up to explain that the cleaning base had broken. I also explained that the locking mechanism on the shaver itself had failed. I asked them to send me a replacement cleaning base, and that I could live with the broken lock on the shaver itself. To my dismay, they refused to honor my request. I was told to send the base to their repair department at my own expense. I explained to them, that the shaver comes with a 60 day money back guarantee, and tried to get across the point that if they would simply send me a replacement base, it would cost them less than having to give me a full refund on my entire purchase. They still refused. Not wanting to send the shaver back, I contacted Amazon, and unbelievably, Amazon sent me an entire new shaver and base at no cost. They told me to throw outthe defective unit, as it was a non returnable item. Amazon deserves kudos for their exceptional customer service. Unfortunately, this does not change my opinion on the mediocre performance of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has been making this shaver since 2009 or 2010. You would think that after that period of time, they would have gotten all of the kinks out of the system. The bottom line is that this is an overrated shaver. It is prone to premature failure, doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near as close as a blade, and Braun/P &amp; G has atrocious customer service. I truly hope that a company will come out with a shaver that is really as close as a blade, and also come out with a self-cleaning system that is designed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I use an electric shaver in order to save time. If it&#x27;s going to take me 10 - 15 minutes to get a shave that&#x27;s not as close as a blade, I might as well use a blade. It would seem to me that in this day and age, where virtually anything is possible, a company should be able to come out with an electric shaver that not only equals the performance of a blade, but does so in less time. They should also be able to produce a product (shaver &amp; cleaning base) that&#x27;s designed to last. In my opinion, if we can land men on the moon, and send spacecraft to distant planets, we should certainly be able to design the perfect electric shaver. I&#x27;m rating the Braun 790-CC at 2.5 stars. Had mine performed as advertised, I would have rated it 4 stars, the highest I would give to any electric shaver that I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Verdict: Shaver, when working as advertised ~ B-/C+ ~ I would not rate any electric shaver higher than this.&lt;br /&gt;  Shaver ~ In condition that mine was in after 7 weeks ~ D&lt;br /&gt;  Braun customer service ~ F&lt;br /&gt;  Amazon Customer service ~ A+the defective unit, as it was a non returnable item.

    <li> This is a good shaver, but I had similar results from shavers costing 1/2 as much.  I was hoping for a closer and quicker shave than what traditional razors provide; instead it came with some less than satisfying features. The automatic cleaning system built into the bulky charger is unnecessary and expensive, as the cleaning liquid has to be replaced.  All it really needs is to be washed out now and then.  However, you are still stuck with keeping the big black blob because you can&#x27;t just plug in the shaver directly. I&#x27;d give it four stars if it were cheaper and without the charging/cleaning station.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a close shave and it cleans itself.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Braun 5 shaver from Today&#x27;s Bite.  They called me to let me know they had sold out but would upgrade to the Braun 7 shaver at no extra charge.  That is what I call customer service.  I would not hesitate to order from them again.</li>
    <li> Best electric shave I have ever had. I loved this razor.  I have taken good care of it for the 18 months I have owned it, but the cleaning base has now stopped working. Not sure that a Braun will be a replacement option.</li>
    <li> When my husband mentioned he&#x27;d like a new shaver for Christmas I only had to check to see what was the latest  Braun had to offer. This is only the third Braun he has ever had because they last for ever ( replacing the blade cartridge periodically is required) Of course you get what you pay for so I knew they&#x27;d be pricey.I Googled to compare pricing and found  it was between $269.99 and $289.99. Amazon and Walmart offered the best deal at $204.99. I waited a day or so to make my final decision on whether to buy in town or over the Internet . I got on to amazon  a couple of Mondays before Christmas and unbellievablly found the price to be $159.99 plus a $50 in store credit ( to be given 30 days after shipped). This was awesome and my husband loves his new  shaver. So Braun once again delivered on their best shaver ever and Amazon came through with flying colors! I still can&#x27;t believe the deal I got @ Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I previously owned a couple of Braun electric razors, the latest being the 7650 model.  I didn&#x27;t expect much of a difference coming to the 7 series however I am pleasantly surprised.  The neck hair feature works as promised and the overall shave is improved.  Overall I have to say I very pleased.</li>
    <li> Priced this product in most places for over $200.00. Caught it at 159.99 on Amazon and purchased immediately. Received it very quickly with standard shipping. The new razor works incredibly well. Just a great shopping experience, always is on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for many many years. I am just upgrading my old one and as usual very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I was skeptical about receiving a close shave, but oh boy does this shaver get close. Some spots feel like I got a closer shave than using a razor. My neck used to hurt while shaving and felt very sensitive, but with this shaver I can go over the same spot multiple times and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I Don&#x27;t get any painful tugs or pulls that other shavers have given me in the past. I don&#x27;t get any irritation at all after a shave. The shaver has a great lemon scent after it goes through a clean cycle. This shaver is well worth the money. I recommend this shaver to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked fine, but no better then a Remington MS2 390 shaver that is half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would  never have purchased the shaver through Amazon had I known that I could only return the&lt;br /&gt;shaver directly to Braun and would have to wait several weeks for my refund.</li>
    <li> The razor itself works well, but not great. It sits in the cleaner at an odd angle that is a little difficult to hit on the first try. They could have done better with this. Check the other reviews for alternatives to Braun&#x27;s pricey cleaner refill cartridges. The recipe I tried works fine.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing, super fast and lets you skip a cleaning our 2 if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace my 4 year old Braun so I went with the 790cc.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is the smoothest yet. (I have a very course beard)&lt;br /&gt;Also very fast; I use \\&quot;lab Series\\&quot; pre-shave which is the very best in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;These razor cost a little more but in this case you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a new Braun buy the 790cc you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Braun 7 series and 8 series shavers.  Both were great shavers.  The Pulsonic is even better!  I would definitley recommend this to anyone looking for a good shaver.  It is pricey, but worth it.  If you&#x27;re patient enough you can find it on sale for a price that&#x27;s equal to that of the competiton.  Just know, though, that this is a far superior shaver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year now and no complaints. I will definitely keep buying this brand. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a amazing shaver. it worth each cent. The shaving is smooth, comfortable and durable. Only problem is you need to buy the blade, every 18 months, and cleaning cartridge, every 40 days, under intensive use.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun electric razor.  My previous one lasted 10+years and the one before that lasted about 6 years.  This 790 is by far THE BEST one I&#x27;ve had to date.  Razor gives me a clean close shave especially on the neck where my previous one struggled a little bit.  It feels good in the hand and holds a charge great.  I use the cleaner/charger every three days and both have been flawless.  Definitely wuld recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This razor works amazing and does such a great job! after shaving with it, there is no \\&quot;rash\\&quot; or anything of the sort for me. i dont know about your skin, but this razor works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Worked well right off the box, even with one bar of battery life left&lt;br /&gt;2. very close shave with NO irritation on the fastest speed mode&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cheapest price a for a NEW 790cc series&lt;br /&gt;4. No complaints yet</li>
    <li> quick logistic , Good tasted, healthy infant food, package perfect.&lt;br /&gt;we are all in belief of in this famous international brand</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas one year.  My son had one prior to my ordering this one.  Really a good unit.</li>
    <li> It delivered as promised, a clean shave and a clean razor.</li>
    <li> Gives a fast close shave but I dont like the way the side burn edger comes out.  Hard for me to cut with the angle.</li>
    <li> My years old 360 Complete had been used so much the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  So I got the latest Braun shaver to replace it.  It&#x27;s even more awesome than my old 360.  It gives an even closer, more comfortable shave.  The side opening trimmer takes a bit of getting used to, but that&#x27;s pretty easy.  They&#x27;ve improved their self cleaning system as well.  Now the razor turns on while it cleans to help get it even cleaner.  I love my shaver.</li>
    <li> Overall a very nice shaver aside from the occasional pulling of a random whisker.</li>
    <li> Not good for shaving your head unless you want to be bald bald bald. Not what I wanted. You&#x27;d have to first shave with clippers then use this.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Norelco for years. This new Braun series 7-790cc blows the Norelco away! Love the Braun.</li>
    <li> This seems like a nice shaver, solid and very well built, and certainly much quieter than my previous shavers (which for several iterations now have also been Braun), which is very good.  But after a month or so of use I have found it consistently erratic in performance.  It shaves very close and even reasonably rapidly when/where it wants to, but elsewhere it can take 10 or 15 passes and sometimes even then still leaves that area stubbly.  No rhyme or reason -- different areas/types of areas every day, though the flat smooth region just below sideburns (maybe 1/2 inch square in area) is definitely likely to end up left stubbly.  Mysterious.  And annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I miss the olden days when my simple, plain Braun shaver just cut the whiskers and in one or two rapid passes over entire face the job was done.&lt;br /&gt;Now the shavers are bulky and complicated and don&#x27;t perform as well, but are much slower to get to the point you are sure they don&#x27;t perform as well.&lt;br /&gt;I still have one older shaver (Braun) that works that fast high quality way -- I think it might be some kind of series 3.  (There&#x27;s a reason it isn&#x27;t available to me for normal daily use but only occasionally, in case you&#x27;re wondering why I don&#x27;t just give up on newer shavers and just use that one.)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaver that was best for African American hair (it&#x27;s very curly) and this works perfect!!! awesome piece of machinery . it gives a close shave , easy to clean and comes with an awesome little carrying case :-)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Close and comfortable shave.  Can&#x27;t believe low Amazon price for this model.  This is my third 7series Braun.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new Braun but would like it to be easier to clean....but the best he&#x27;s had thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my husband, he was not pleased with the performance, it still  leaves morning stubs on his face. Decided to return item to Amazon but they pointed out that this is Hazmat non refundable item.  I would not recommend this item to anyone.  If it was possible it wouldn&#x27;t get the one star it received.</li>
    <li> Excellent little system.</li>
    <li> This shaver did much better on my husbands neck and beard area than the shavers we have been using.  We love the self-cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> The shaver head  lock does not work and I have to send the shaver back at my expense to a repair center.  i have to waste the disposable sterilization cartridge, also at my expense.  The shaver is a week old.</li>
    <li> Switch from a round head and very happy with the close shave even the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
    <li> Still using this as my daily shaver.  Replace the cleaning solution as you need to.  I&#x27;ve found that rinsing the razor/head under water before cleaning it helps quite a lot.  After about a year I did have an issue with the base getting clogged to where the solution would not drain properly.  A few q-tips and I was back in action.  So far I think the longest I&#x27;ve gone without a shave and had no issued shaving with this razor was 3 days.</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my boyfriend. He wanted a shaver that was easy and conveinent. I had no idea what to get because this isn&#x27;t my thing, but he loves it and it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Came in good timing and hasn&#x27;t had any problems, worth the money!</li>
    <li> Cuts very well if directions are adhered to 100+%.. Would not use on high setting if you have sensitive skin...burning sensation in sensitive skin areas..Care and use booklet needs to be written more clearly with specific elaboration on how to use and how to adjust to improve performance...I ue it with electric shave pre shave lotion and have never tried to use dry.</li>
    <li> This is the third one that I&#x27;ve purchased over the past 10-12 years and it&#x27;s the best because they&#x27;ve added a heater to dry the razor after the rinse - a nice touch to be sure.  I like it.</li>
    <li> this is a step up from the first Braun that I had. It is clearly superior. Does not pull as much. A good clean shave. I have stopped using the expensive disposable blades</li>
    <li> This machine saved me from razor burns and irritated skin. Definitely recommend it to anyone having issues using razors.</li>
    <li> Winner - I can&#x27;t believe that anyone would give this a 1, 2 or 3 star rating.  Simply absurd.  Hard to imagine any way to improve this shaver.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my son, and he&#x27;s been using this product for months, and loves it.  I&#x27;ve had an older model for years and still very happy with this product</li>
    <li> i have had alot of shavers and this one so far is my favorite. the charge holds for several uses at least and its smooth and awesome. i love the self cleaning feature that it has. only down side is when it charges, its loud. so dont charge it at night while trying to sleep.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, works great for me no irritation or ingrown hairs like i get with a razor and I shaved dry with this. But note that the description says that it is 100% waterproof it&#x27;s not the product manual it states that it should not be used in the shower or tub and should not be submerged. If your looking for wet/dry the model you want is 799cc. So I got a refund for this one and I&#x27;m waiting for the 799c.</li>
    <li> closest shave ever, pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver replaced older Braun shaver had done a good job over the years but had a major failure and repairs would have been costly.  Performs better than older shaver so it is an improvement over older model.</li>
    <li> Everything if claims to be. I went from a 300with a Norelco 3d in between. I might have stuck with the norelco if the cost of the replacement head was more realistic.</li>
    <li> This Braun Shaver System is a replacement to an older model that wore our after 10+ years of use.  It gives a very comfortable and close shave.  I love it</li>
    <li> It shaves very well.  I did not realize you needed to clean it everytime you charged it.  The liquid cleaner spills when not kept upright, which I found out when we moved from one place to another.  Mess.  Greta Solomonson, who helps her husband shave.</li>
    <li> the shaver is good, no complain about it, but the cleaner/renew is fast to consume and expensive. is there any cheaper one just to refill the used container?</li>
    <li> My husband has had trouble with his razors in the past, but he loves this one. the only problem I see with it, is that traveling with the whole unit might be a bit difficult.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband.  He has very, very sensitive skin.  He was delighted by this razor and finds that it is very kind to his skin.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product, not heavy and  weight is just enough.I want clean shaven and this product helped me to achieve it. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain at all, all ran smoothly.</li>
    <li> Works great and am very satisfied -- gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Nice features.</li>
    <li> Best shave I ever had by electric shaver. Am still experimenting with .</li>
    <li> It does a clean shave quickly and is very easy to clean. It is the best shaver.</li>
    <li> I have always used either a safety razor or disposable razors.  I have owned other electric shavers in the past including some from Norelco and was never satisfied with the results- they all left some amount of hair.  This razor is different, I have had it for a few weeks now and I am extremely impressed.  The quality of the shave is excellent, it leaves your face feeling very smooth.  The hardest part (and most annoying) about shaving for me has always been above upper lip; I don&#x27;t like having a moustache.  With any blade type razor I always had irritation in the area due to needing multiple passes to get that smoothness.  With this one, there is no issue at all.  I get a very clean shave and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning process is a bit loud but not an issue, I would say its to be expected given the process involved in it cleaning itself.</li>
    <li> Gives a clean shave once your beard breaks in. After use the shave can last for about 3 days where before I had to shave every day</li>
    <li> Shaves and feels great! The look is pleasing. Charging base is nice and its my first self cleaning razor.  Neck hairs on me are always flat and tough and this shaver does a decent job at getting them. My shave is over in just a couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only flaw...the pop up/out trimmer is in a place that when trying to use it in a mirror, it&#x27;s in a blind spot because of how low they put it. That&#x27;s why it gets 4 stars! Have to see what I&#x27;m trimming, ya know?</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Good bye razors. This electric razor doesn&#x27;t get as close as a classic razor, but I don&#x27;t need it to. Shaving with this is such a pleasant treat compared to the old method of shaving cream and blades and the shave is close enough for all but the pickiest of people.</li>
    <li> As some backstory: I have a ridiculously difficult face to shave. Prone to razor bumps and with hair that has no real grain and kind of grows in swirls. No lotions, creams, razors would give me a close shave without givning me an uncomfortable and unsightly burn on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told not to use electric razors, but that was a long time ago and figured that they must be better and more reliable now than they were 10 years ago. After going through a rotary electric razor with some improvement I decided to splurge on the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 1 week of my skin getting used to the foil shaver I saw dramatic decrease in the amount of razor burns/bumps and this still left me with an INCREDIBLY close shave. Comparable to a multi-bladed analog razor. And with the charging station the blade is always clean. The razor itself is really nice and has 3 settings for blade speeds to use to help decrease irritation for your skin and also has a lock for the pivoting foil head that helps especially under the nose and just under the jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have to shave every day for my work, this item has been an incredible investment and now that I have been using it for about 1 year I don&#x27;t know how I got by without it. If you have similar problems as I do with sensitive skin/uncommon grain to your beard/razor burn I would HIGHLY recommend this razor</li>
    <li> gorgeous,,,,,,,,ok ok ok ok love this razor no more comment needed wawa just do it wtf  gimme a break ahhhhhh</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Way closer shave than my last Braun.  Like the waterproof feature, perfect go shower use.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun shaver for many years now. This upgrade to Series 7 is really nice. It&#x27;s much nicer. It shaves better. It is much quieter, It cleans quiter. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Have been using electric shavers over thirty years, and this might be the best.  If you read the directions, I found it odd to shave prior to doing anything to my face in the morning.  But what little I feel left while in the shower, I run the razor back over it once I am out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY happy and hope it lasts as long as my old Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun System 7 razor for over 3 years now. I have a Van Dyke (Goatee) but shave the rest of my face including my entire head. This is the best razor I have used in the 15 years that I have shaved my head. There is no irritation and the closeness is the best that I have found from an electric shaver. I get approx. 1 year out of the heads before needing to replace. Yes the cleaning process is loud but it does a great job, I do take the head off and tap out any loose stuff and put the head back on before placing the razor in the cleaning/charging station. Wish that the cleaning solution would last longer. I would recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing, as I&#x27;ve loved my older 7000 series Syncro model bought about ten years ago.  I even considered buying some parts to bring the Syncro up to newer standards.  However, this was money well spent, and as long as it lasts long term, this is a great step forward.  In reading the reviews, some have reported it as very noisy.  Compared to my Syncro, this is a little quieter.  It&#x27;s a different frequency, a little higher, but not as loud, so when I shave early in the morning I am not bothering anyone else.  Someone did comment that you don&#x27;t have as much audible feedback as it chops through stubble, and that is true, and does take some getting used to, as that used to be my indicator to move on to another area on my face.  The cleaning system is a little different than I&#x27;m used to because it has the quick clean and more thorough options, but otherwise, it&#x27;s great.  The station on the counter does not take up more space than my Syncro one, in fact I think it&#x27;s a little narrower in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others noted problems with the lock mechanism breaking on the head.  I haven&#x27;t had this problem, and I&#x27;ve locked it several times just to see and ensure it&#x27;s working, but I actually don&#x27;t use that feature typically when shaving, I find that allowing the head to float serves me well, even in tough areas like neck and upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shave is faster, closer, and all around better.  The price here was on Amazon was very competitive with others I found, though they don&#x27;t let you return it to them like normal products, if you needed to.  I am guessing this is because of the alcohol cartridge which technically requires special shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great step forward.  In my late thirties, this is now my third Braun razor product since late high school, and each has lasted me about ten years before moving on.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll get the same longevity from this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note - I read some reviews that said that you must ensure you get the 790cc-4, with the \\&quot;4\\&quot; on the end being critical.  I found no way to really ensure this on Amazon, but I ordered based on my past positive experiences with Amazon and that is exactly what I received - the 790cc-4.you get the 790cc-4, with the \\&quot;4\\&quot; on the end being critical.  I found no way to really ensure this on Amazon, but I ordered based on my past positive experiences with Amazon and that is exactly what I received - the 790cc-4.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ronson and Braun shavers for 47 years and the Series 7-790cc Pulsonic system is the best I have used.  It does a quick job of shaving and is very comfortable.  The design makes it extremely difficult to nick yourself.  I didn&#x27;t think I needed the cleaning system, but it saves me a lot of time and keeps the shaver in ready condition.  I highly recommend this shaving system!  Amazon&#x27;s price is hard to beat for the shaver, cleaning fluid, and shaving heads.</li>
    <li> I will be going back to a multi-blade razor.  Waste of that much money.  Was terrrific for a week, then turned into crap like every other electric razor.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 790CC is a nice shaver, but that is all.&lt;br /&gt;It still takes longer to shave with Braun than with Gillette. No Braun cooltec technology in top-notch shaver. Yes, I do not have much irritation after shaving with Braun, but still there is not much difference between my 15 years old ancient shaver and this one. Gillette is still doing a way better job.&lt;br /&gt;What I like in Braun – I can use it in my car, cleaning station is working great, does not irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;What I don’t like – slow, multiple passes required, no cooltec, generally mid market solution – nothing special to make WOW sound.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever Braun shaver I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is extremely clean! I shave max twice a week. Usually I would use the long hair cutter first and then the regular shave head. With this one, the long hair cutter is quite small and better for detailed contouring. The regular head includes a cutter for longer hair and it works perfectly! Extremely fast and deep shave!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon price was great!</li>
    <li> What a great way to get a cup of coffee.  I found out that you can get two cups;maybe even more but I stopped at two cups as the water was almost at the bottom.  I would have liked to ow where I can get the small packets of coffee].  I&#x27;ll check the grocery stores such as Lowe&#x27;s or Walmart.  It also saves the amount of coffee I use to spend for regular coffee/</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  We were out of the country and did not return to our home and the razor until May 1.  We were only home a short time and left the country again...bringing the razor along.  When we arrived at our vacation home, my husband was excited to get it set up and give it a try.  It has never worked.  Since it was purchased in December, there is no recourse.  My husband contacted Braun, but 30 days is 30 days.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and found myself drawn to this model.  My last shaver, which started to smoke on the charger, was also a Braun which I got when these self-cleaning model came out back in the early 2000&#x27;s. (maybe 2002) The old one did its job with a couple replacement head, but finally gave up.  The tough bullet to bite with this new one, is that it cost more than some of my first cars:-)&lt;br /&gt;It was a lot easier to take when I fired it up for my first shave. Very comfortable (no comparison with old one), and it actually gets the whiskers along my jaw line. (I had to use throw away razors to get them before)  I can&#x27;t fault the razor for being too expensive and give it less stars. It really works!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this everyday, he thinks it is great.  And I don&#x27;t have to buy razor blades anymore.  He says it give a really close shave /</li>
    <li> Awesome razor! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> What an improvement. I had my last Braun for a long time, but I wished I upgraded sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old. Tried my first electric razor at 17. I&#x27;ve never had a decent shave from one. Tried every brand and different types. Recently told by my Doctor to use an electric. This shaves as close as any blade I&#x27;ve used. Yes, I said blade. I bought mine at a liquidator for half price and after using it I would pay retail for it if I had to. Amazing. Best purchase in years. Highly recommended. Especially if you&#x27;ve never been able to get a great shave from an electric.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. It&#x27;s the 4th Braun I&#x27;ve owned over the years and it&#x27;s by far the best one I&#x27;ve used. Clean shave without any irritation or stubble shaving ending up on my shirt.</li>
    <li> Easy to care for and great close shave!</li>
    <li> It feels more sturdy...comes with the cleaning and charging station....at half the price of the panasonic I just returned.  Great!</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality razor, very comfortable, trusted brand Braun Germany,buy very cheap,Exactly what I wanted, very good!</li>
    <li> Ok, ladies, if you want your man to shave more often, get him one of these!  I got it for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he is now shaving every day, I never thought that was possible.  Of course, he just got it, so it&#x27;s &#x27;a new toy&#x27;, but I&#x27;ll enjoy it for as long as it lasts. :)  This shaver takes care of itself - shave, put it back into the dock and walk away.  The extra cleaning cartridges are about $5.00 each and each lasts for about a month.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Great price excellent value</li>
    <li> he uses it regularly over the road and at home&lt;br /&gt;keeps a good charge&lt;br /&gt;convienent carrying case&lt;br /&gt;good product&lt;br /&gt;sleek design</li>
    <li> Comfortable shave.  This thing keeps sharp and the cleaning solution is cheap and works wonders. Hairs are never pulled, gets in really close to the skin (I use a preshave liquid), you have to work hard to nick yourself.  The pivoting head helps, I have a really angular chin and it travels right up it nicely. The cleaning cycle, which takes around 30 minutes I think, and shaver are loud though so if you&#x27;re up early you&#x27;re going to have to manage with it. It&#x27;s a very convenient addition to self clean and dry. The 3 settings for the motor, light/medium/heavy or in colors white/light blue/dark blue, cause an audible change in motor speed. I use one cleaning cartridge in about 3 months, with light shaves every day with some exception.</li>
    <li> Nicest electric razor Ive ever owned. I usually prefer a manual razor but this thing gets the job done and pretty well none the less. Electric razors always seem to give a rougher shave for me but this one gets close and doesn&#x27;t leave stubble.</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars just for the fact that I get absolutely no skin irritation after shaving. I had been using a manual razor my whole life and would always end up with the little bumps and boils afterwards. I literally tried all kinds of shaving products from pre-shave oils to post-shave lotions and nothing worked. I had tried a cheap Norelco electric shaver about 5 years ago and that didn&#x27;t help either so I thought I was doomed. I finally gave this Braun a shot after reading reviews about Braun quality. I wanted to get the best out on the market. I found the best and this is it! Just follow the instructions about shaving before showering and you should be good. At least that&#x27;s what works for me. I also use a pre-shave alcohol (like Lectric shave) just to dry out my skin more before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guy shaves pretty close and is pretty comparable to a manual razor. I was pleasantly surprised. However, it will take more than a couple passes to get that close shave. I&#x27;m just happy that there is no irritation afterwards.</li>
    <li> This shaver system is somewhat expensive, but well worth the price. I had tried other shavers, but quickly went back to my &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; method of shaving. This one does not shave as close as a blade, but comes very close. If the highest speed is selected, it even does a great job on the neck area. Also, it will give you a very fast shave. The complete system is great as it will clean the razor automatically. I read the reviews on Amazon &amp; elsewhere &amp; it is rated # 1. Amazon delivered it quickly with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it. The first shaver that does not give me a RASH..  Very happy with it and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past...they just did NOT shave well.&lt;br /&gt;But this Braun is amazing. I use it on my face &amp; head excellent all around.</li>
    <li> Still the best electric for me. Close shave. Does not fully insert in the cleaner without extra effort. It will not charge if you don&#x27;t hive it a little extra push into the base. Old version dripped in much more smoothly.</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver. Handles well and the flexible shaver cartridge bends and conforms to your face allowing for a seamless and smooth shave. The cleaner is one of my favorite features, you may need to run it more than once but it will leave my shaver like new every time.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned, so far.  I have owned some of the older Braun models and some Panasonic (these are also excellent electric razors).  This one, though, has been giving me the closest shaves and the least problems as far as pulling hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to get it, it performance beyond my imagination, it is easy to use than the Philips, scraping the very clean, I would recommend it to my friends, they come here to buy recommendation, I hope next time to buy it at this price .</li>
    <li> The foil on my old razor went.  Instead of spending $60 for a new foil and blades, I decided to replace with this and I should have done this forever ago.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I used a Norelco for years. I wondered if the extra cost of this was worth it. The answer is Yes. It shaves very close. I enjoy having its self-cleaning. The shaver feels and smells clean every day. Periodically I open it up and use a tooth brush with hot water to give it an extra cleaning. Each cleaning cartridge lasts me about 45 days.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old 7 760cc finally gave out on me the flip trimmer finally stopped working but the battery is still going strong.  I thought about trying the norelco sensotouch 3d however the price is about $50 more because braun has a $40 coupon at present.  I have also read that the 3d recommends that you unplug the clean/charge base when done shaving so as not to ruin the battery NOT COOL.  The braun manages the battery and will not let it overcharge.  The only drawback I have found with brain shavers is that the neck is a difficult area to get an even shave unless you spend extra time.  My old 760 cc I would have to use the trimmer every single shave to get one or two stubborn hairs.  This new braun seems to be an improvement as I have not had to use the trimmer in the couple shaves I have done.  The very first braun I tried 6 years ago before they switched to the triangular foil I returned because it simply would not cut neck hairs.  There is a progression with the bruan shavers.  The one thing I like about the norelco shavers is I think they have a superior head design hitting each hair at several different angles with every pass,  however their build quality is questionable.  I would say that the shaving closeness is comparable with all rotary or foil razors.  If you want a close close shave use a blade however you are also scratching and irritating your skin,  not good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this gadget. I have super thin facial hair. I mean like ghost hair but I have a lot of it. This shaver manages to cut it. I have used others that leave a lot more hair behind. It leaves some but it is easy to go back over the area a few more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one so so feature is the trim blade. It is too close to the shaving head so when I needed to do shaping around my chops the first time I accidentally nipped the hair on the side of my head. Easy to avoid if you pay attention but I would prefer if the top blade stopped or the trimmer was a bit longer.</li>
    <li> FYI to potential buyers:  Amazon doesn&#x27;t take returns on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My electric shaver died this morning and a Google search on the best shaver quickly points to the Braun 790cc-4.  Even better was that Amazon sells this item for a great price, and I can use my Prime membership.  However, Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns on this item, and the manufacturer 60 day money back guarantee sounds like a long and painful process (according to other reviewer posted here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this item for the same price on the Walmart website, free shipping, without the returns restriction.  I have to pay $12 extra in tax, but that&#x27;s a small cost in order to avoid a headache in case I need to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this great shaving machine to move from regular razors to electric shavers. What a move. It took three shaves for my skin to adapt to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried previously 1 or 2 of Braun basic shavers and they did not work. This definitely is head and shoulders above other shavers in the market. A marvel of a Technology. Its 10,000 micro vibrations help capture more hair. The other shavers did not provide me with a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A guarantee for a smooth clean shave. On top of that a German reliable shaver and to top it, the cleaning system is amazing. It saves time and guarantee a hygiene shaver at al times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I love it! I would suggest cleaning the razor at least once a week. Target sells the cleaning pack for about $12, so it&#x27;s worth it. Cheers!</li>
    <li> This shaver is great. It gives a clean close shave in half the time of using a razor. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my husband approximately 3 year ago and he has love the shave better than any other he ever owned which was several.  The head was getting worn from using daily, so I went on Amazon to search for a replacement head.  I decided that it would seem to a good idea to just pay the extra and purchase the newer model since that last one lasted 3 years with nothing replaced.  That is a better value than buying disposal razors for 3 years and not getting the super smooth shave.  This is a winner!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaver system.  The cleaning feature of the system is very nice.  I have used this system for several years, and will purchase another when the current unit fails.</li>
    <li> I always used Braun as a shaver. This model is better than what I had before but it is not perfect to deserve a 5 stars</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver that provides a nice, close shave. I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years and always wondered if I&#x27;d get a better shave with the Braun style shaver. Now I know, and I won&#x27;t be going back.  Well worth the extra cost, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> He loves it! The best razor he has ever used! Extremely close shave and it cleans itself! This is a really great product!</li>
    <li> Very smooth and quiet. I have used Braun razors for many years and this is miles beyond any previous models.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I believe it&#x27;s as good as any electric shaver can get. It doesn&#x27;t pull on any hairs or snag on my beard at all. The only reason I gave it a four is because the final shave itself simply isn&#x27;t as close as a razor, which I don&#x27;t believe any electric can really do. Overall for an electric shaver, it&#x27;s a great product. The self cleaning system makes it effortless to keep in good condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few days since it arrived and I thought I&#x27;d give my first impressions. The thing is easy to set up, charges very quickly and feels good in my hand. I&#x27;ve been a long time blade user and I wanted something faster for during the week when I&#x27;m working, so I can get out of the house quicker. Although the instructions warn that it can take 2 weeks to get used to electric shaving, I was pleasantly surprised that the very first shave I had was impressively close (and passed the partner touch test also). I have very thick hair and get stubbly very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, I still think blade shaving is closer, but this is just fine as a day to day shaver and I&#x27;m impressed by how far the quality of these things has come along since I last tried.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system seems to work well and leaves the shaver with a nice lemony scent, though I&#x27;m grumpy that the cleaning solution is not that cheap (as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s just alcohol and some scent). However, it&#x27;s nice to know the shaver is clean every time I want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;So, the shaver itself is an easy five stars for me. I&#x27;m knocking off a star because I feel that the cleaning cartridges are overpriced for what they are (especially when the shaver is not cheap in the first place). This was overall though a great purchase, and I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> After much research and having this shaver for over a year, I love it.  I have very thick facial hair and I&#x27;m very happy with the results of my shave.  I don&#x27;t get as many ingrown hairs however if you have facial hair like I do, I do recommend using the cleaning system more often.  I usually get two shaves between washes.  I sometimes have to use a regular shaving on my neck to get some hair that this does&#x27;t pick up (we&#x27;re talking just one or two random hairs).</li>
    <li> Love it. It does such a nice job.</li>
    <li> Bought this a year ago and it is still working extremely well.  I&#x27;ve used a Braun shaver for over 20 years and I would highly recommend them. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with any version that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Great shaving experience, close smooth shave, fast and no skin irritation. Self cleaning is painless. Only downside no side-burn  cutter.</li>
    <li> This Braun electric shaver is, Hands Down, the best electric shaver I have ever used. I have a thick beard that grows in several directions. After a day at work with plans to go out for the night I need to shave again. I was hooked to the soap mug and brush with the best new razor on the market for years. I was using the best 5 blade razor out there and the process to get a perfect shave took a long time not to mention the money it cost now a days to replace the blade refills that only lasted maybe 3 shaves.$$$&lt;br /&gt;I tried quit a few electric shavers over the years until the Braun Activator 8585 Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Electric Shaver which works really great although just didn&#x27;t do the job for me, my 16 year old loves it.&lt;br /&gt;The Series 7 Pulsonic system does it! My third shave with the 790 was better than a normal razor shave Iv&#x27;e been getting. Be sure to do the maintenance after each shave and this shaver will do the trick. I recommend this electric shaver and give it a 10 out of 10 plus Amazon had a sale on this Braun Series 7-790 and I got a good deal on it. [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]]</li>
    <li> shaves fast, close and reasonably comfortably. Replacing an older Braun that died (after 11 years, much longer than they&#x27;re supposed to last). This model is lighter and easier to hold. Unlike others, I find the pop-up trimmer works fine on the sideburns.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for 35 years. Best shaver I&#x27;ve had. Cleaning system works great. Never had a cordless shaver that had sufficient power until this one.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve purchased. It shaves perfectly as if you were using a razor to give you that baby butt smooth skin. 100% satisfied. impressed. recommend it for people who want a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver after trying out a different braun shaver that I was really impressed with.  This one is horrible.  It takes forever to shave (like 15 minutes) because it misses so many hairs that you have to keep going over the same spot.  Even then, I constantly find whiskers that were not cut in the 15 minutes of shaving.  Also 15 minutes of shaving with anything is going to irritate the heck out of your skin. I usually have no problems with razor irritation, but this shaver is horrible for irritation.  After 1 week of using it I&#x27;m back to a traditional razor.  This shaver is not even close to being a reasonable shaving solution.  It&#x27;s far from being the best braun shaver available, so certainly not even close to being the best shaver on the market, despite the price.  Also, the cleaning system is just a gimmick to lock you into purchasing the braun cleaning solution, which comes is a weird non-refillable container.  I&#x27;d chalk this up along with that portable mini-disc player in 1997 as one of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  It&#x27;s clear that many of the reviews on amazon must be fake, because it&#x27;s inconceivable to me that anyone could like this shaver.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun shaver model 7505 for 12 years and it was not very good at shaving neck hairs. I decide to try the new 790cc thinking it might be better in that aera, but it is not.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do. Biggest issue for me was the hairs on my neck..this does a better job than my last one, still not as close as a blade (but its the nature of the beast). Battery life is nice and the best thing about it, is that there are basically no hairs that fall all over the sink. Not sure where the hair goes but it looks like its pulverized into a super fine dust almost. Love it.</li>
    <li> Have used Braun electric shavers as long as I can remember, well built, good design and good function.  Like the latest interation of their 7 Series shaver as it runs much more quietly than my older 7 Series that I bought back in 2007, the drop in noise level makes the old 7 Series sound like there is something wrong with it.  Nice shaver, would recommend to anyone that uses an electric.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for nearly fifty years. I was in need of another shaver and mentioned it to a friend of mine.&lt;br /&gt;He suggested a Braun as he is from Europe and this is very popular in that part of the world. I took his suggestion. The results, great. This shaver is the best I have used. If you are in need of a great razor that shaves better then any other check Amazon. For the best buy,check Amazon!</li>
    <li> In the past electric razors never worked well on my face.  This is the best one so far although it still misses a few areas so I need to use a razor.  Like the way it charges and automatically cleans the head</li>
    <li> I am still trying to get used to the Braun Series 7 as my rotary still seems easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Although my research seemed complete, the need to purchase a liquid solution to clean the razor and the seeming loud noise it makes when running causes me to do more research prior to future purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I loved a Braun prior to my Rotary so perhaps that love will resurface after using this powerful razor... hopefully sooner than later.</li>
    <li> If this thing lasts more than 5-6 years like it says in the warranty it will be more than enough for me. I made a small calculation. If I use regular shaving stuff like foam, aftershave, razors, and other small things the amount of cash that I&#x27;ll spend on all of them for 6 years will be the same as the amount of cash I spend on this Device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sellers are not stupid! They sell good products at the maximum price the customer can provide!</li>
    <li> I think the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver System is great.  I have a medium heavy beard and I consider the shave close enough for me.  It&#x27;s not as close as the old safety razor I used for years, BUT it sure is easier, less messy and results in no bloody cuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, I used a philishave 3 rotary shaver before this change.  The Braun shaver gives a slightly closer shave than the old shaver, can be used cordless (I used it for 6 days without need to recharge it on a recent vacation) or with the cord in, and has the cleaning system which also keeps the blades lubricated.  The shave is close, it&#x27;s particularly good on the face, but it loses a star as it takes a bit more work to get the neck smooth, and because I think it may be costly to maintain (I got 5 years of life out of the philishave blades, but the manual says to expect about a year out of these baldes and the cleaning / lubricating liquid needs to be replaced approximately monthly).  It has 3 levels of intensity, I messed around with the different levels but found the normal mode (middle intensity) worked well.  The trimmer is very precise and the the shaving head has a lock out if you don&#x27;t want it to pivot.  Overall a very good product, I&#x27;m just waiting to see how much ongoing costs will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I have now been using this for about 6 months, and the cleaning solution lasts 1.5 to 2.5 months (lasts longer n the cooler months, probably due to less heat evaporation).</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver to replace a 5 year old Braun razor.  I really didn&#x27;t expect much of a change in performance.  Wow, was I wrong.  The new razor gives an amazing shave in a third of the time of the old system.  I&#x27;m not very sure about the sideburn trimmer yet, but the quality of the shaving blade makes this the ultimate shaver.[[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]]</li>
    <li> It is not easy to spend this kind of money on a shaver in this poor economy but if you can afford it do it. I have tried norelco, panasonic and other various types of shavers that have always left me wanting a bit more from them. This one will not let you down. The shave is quite smooth just like a razor without the blood splatters all over the place. The automatic cleaner is great too keeps the shaver in tip top shape for every shave and there is no excuse for not cleaning it since you don&#x27;t have to. I recommend this shaver to anyone that feels the wrath of the razors like I do. Money well spent</li>
    <li> Nothing but the best.  The Item preforms as expected,  thats why I purchased another one.  I have had three over the years.</li>
    <li> I got this based on very good experiences with Braun shavers before - my previous 7000-series lasted more than a decade until the battery just gave up. If you&#x27;re in the same situation - get your old one fixed and don&#x27;t downgrade to the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is kind of ok. It is a clear step down from the previous model in shaving result, ergonomics (why the tiny buttons when they had a very nice mechanism before) and an awkward flimsy feeling long hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station is a disaster. If the shaver feels cheap now, that&#x27;s nothing compared to the plastic station. It sort of worked for a few months (sometimes failing to complete the cycle), but now at maybe ten months in it fails completely even with a new cartridge, only going between orange and red for low/empty cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like the whole things was designed just to get you to buy refills. Frustrating, because the previous ones felt like such solid engineering.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I ever had.  In the past I had to use a razor in order to get a 24 hrs clean shave.  now I can do it faster with the electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a large cleaning system which I&#x27;m not sure that it does much except increase Braun sales of cleaning fluid cartridges.  You probably can get the cleaning done with the plain brush (included) and water.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great machine.</li>
    <li> After 5 cleans the cleaning station no longer works. Same thing happenend on a prior Braun razor. Braun requires you to ship everything back including the razor for Warranty Repair/Replacement. This process takes 3-4 weeks to complete and the shipping is on my dime for their poor quality product. Crazy, just replace the $20 plastic part! Not very forward thinking customer service.&lt;br /&gt;The razor works fine but not worth the nearly $200 price tag. Last Braun product I ever buy.</li>
    <li> As advertised, great shaver</li>
    <li> Fantastic, except for the under the chin and neck area, where it takes several minutes and attempts to remove all the hair.</li>
    <li> While this is a decent shaver it gives a poor shave. One must press hard against the face and even then it produces a second rate shave compared to a Gillette. If I could return it I would.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Shaver, my last one lasted 11 years with very little maintenance.  This shaver is great.  Would never buy anyother brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from in-grown hair and razor bumps all my life.  This shaver is a blessing.  No irritation what so ever and gives a smooth shave.  Customer for live!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  Love&#x27;s it!! Nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Seems like it always needs to be cleaned according to the charging station. Bad on neck... Leaves it super bumpy, but nice close shave on face.</li>
    <li> I am bald.  I live in Sacramento. There is a severe drought.  That being said I wanted to find a way to shave face and head without water.  I have shaved face and head in the shower for years but realized that I was using 10s of gallons of water with each shave!  I first tried the &amp;#34;The Bald Eagle Smart Shaver thinking it would best suit my needs.  It is a rotary shaver like a Norelco.  Not only did it give a poor result, just like every Norelco I&#x27;ve every tried,  it broke after only two shaves. I returned it. After looking up alternatives, I discovered this Braun (pronounced brown).  This is a special shaver apparently designed for Amazon customers, as I was not able to find it at Walmart, Target or any of the usual retailers.  As usual, it came quickly and charged quickly.  Voila! With a little bit of Lectric Shave my face and head were done rapidly and without any chafing, burn or discomfort.  The shave is 95% as good as with blade in the shower!!  It is simply the best shave for your time and money.  Not only is shaving quick and satisfying, the Pulsonic cleans itself!  After 50 years of searching for a simple, clean shave, here it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best shaver I had used. U can use everyday that  it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face. Use it ok.</li>
    <li> So far....working great!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun series 7 for about a week.  I had been a lifelong Norelco guy.  Last Norelco was a wet/dry mid priced version that did not shave me very well; lots of skin irritation and missed hairs.  Tried a shaving gel.  That helped a bit but still did not do the job.  I do not even need a pre electric product with the Braun.  The shave is much closer than the Norelco with absolutely no irritation.  It was a true pleasure to apply after shave lotion without the burning from skin irritation.  One big negative of this system is the high cost of the cleaning solution.  This is another case of sell the razor at a fair price and to get people to spend mucho more than the razor costs on liquid refills over the lifetime of the razor. I beat the system; excuse the pun.  I purchased an ultrasound cleaner (about $25) on Amazon plus a small plastic bottle of Braun razor oil.  That is a million times cheaper than refills.  I retired from the health care field (DVM) a year ago and used to use my office ultrasound cleaner to do my shaver heads, jewelry etc...Just add a drop or two of soap detergent to the ultrasound container.  Overall, I am extremely impressed with the Braun.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve had many electric shavers--a variety of brands--and have found the Braun shavers to have the best feeling of quality: solid and durable. This particular shaver has given me the closest shave yet, and I like the idea of the cutter/foil cartridge; the replacement cost is an improvement over the cost of previous replacements for the cutter and foil. One area I&#x27;d like to see them improve concerns the noise level of the shaver and of the cleaning system (though, to be fair, the cleaner is loud for a relatively short time). The cost of cleaner refills is also high, but I see that another company has come out with a more reasonably priced refill. Aside from the two somewhat minor quibbles, I do recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT, BRAUN ARRIVED A MY LIFE AND I WON&#x27;T LEVE. I USE THE BRAUN SERIES 7 ALL DAYS.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that my shaver broke, not even 2 full years of use. It stopped charging and I had the battery replaced. It worked for two more days with the new battery. Looks like is something wrong with the electronics board. My first Braun worked three years. I expect a longer life cycle when you choose an expensive model. Otherwise, I was very happy with the shaver. I guess I&#x27;m done with Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> Well all I can say is no more rotary shavers for me. This is simply the best shaver ever. I use it on my head as well and it does an excellent job. Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> Gizmodo ([...] gave this shaver such glowing reviews that I decided to buy it.  I found that it has a hard time getting at all the hair in places like the neck and jawline with 3 passes.  It performs well on my cheeks but I still have to use more than 3 passes to cut all the hair.  I often have to finish with a razor get all the leftover hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He is black and his facial hair tends to grow in thick, curly and irritates his skin. This razor has been a godsend! There was a noticeable difference after the first shave and his skin has gotten better with each one after. Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I am an 87 year old male and I recently purchased this razor. It is a good razor that provides a good shave. Best of all electric shavers I have tried so far. The cleaning unit is a bit on the noisy side but since you have finished shaving it doesn&#x27;t bother you. I would reccomend this razor.</li>
    <li> It feels like I shaved with a razor blade, the shaves are close and comfortable. Product was shipped on time, and matched the description</li>
    <li> My son was very happy with the Braun Series 7</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  It allows you a smooth and close shave.  Has good battery life.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said. I love this razor. It does everything I need and more. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The Braun 790cc is a very good shaver. It is easy to hold and to maneuver. It has 3 shaving modes and I use the one for sensitive skin. It works well. The trimmer comes out at a right angle to the shaver, and for me, it is awkward to use and takes off points. Much has been written about the cleaner. I don&#x27;t particularly like it, but I do use it twice a week. It is easy to cap and uncap the cleaning solution tank. When not in use, I store the cleaner and solution under the counter. Most days I rinse the shaver under hot water. I use one cleaning tank for 3 months. Before buying the Braun, I had a Norelco for many years.  I decided to switch, and I am glad that I did.  On the bathroom counter, I put the Braun in my old Norelco stand. Braun does not provide anything but the cleaning tank which is large, and there is no plastic cap to cover the shaving head. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few years ago on a whim because i hate shaving with a razor and this looked good. Its the only electric razor ive used though so no helpful comparisons here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and has a little bit of weight to it which makes it feel stable in your hand. It also doesnt shake around much. The grip is nice also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a meter at one end of the razor which indicates hygiene. When that meter gets low you are supposed to use your razor station to start the cleaning process which uses some type of special cleaning liquid. This tends to evaporate very quickly. To save on that cleaning liquid cost I just don&#x27;t use it all. To somewhat clean I usually just pop the razor end, turn on the razor, and then hold the two parts together. this kind of vibrates all of the cut trimmings out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t shave for three days straight the razor may seem kind of plucky. To help reduce the pulling sensation, I use the razor with the grain of the hairs on my chin and then I go sideways actually and then I go against the grain to finish it up. Ive noticed a lot less pain this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont drop it too many times though. I dropped it one too many times and it started to shake violently while turned on. It also became very loud and poppy like a push lawnmore sounds. It still cut hairs though. Repair cost me about 65$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good enough razor that i bought a second.</li>
    <li> This razor is a really nice unit. I love the intense shaving setting on it as this setting shaves under my neck and does not seem to irritate it like other razors have. The one razor that did irritate under my neck was the Norelco Sensotouch. Shaving under my neck would cause it to become red and sore but not with this shaver and the intense shave setting. I find too that I can use a lighter touch when shaving and this razor will do a very decent job. You will never get a very close shave with any electric razor. For a close close shave, a manual razor will accomplish this every time.  I do like the option of being able to put the razor in the cleaning station for a complete cleaning/renewal of the razor. I have not tried all the features of it. It may be a little expensive but it is worth it in my opinion. Of course, all razors work differently on different people so this model may or may not be the one for you.</li>
    <li> ...self-cleaning, sharp for a close shave. Couldn&#x27;t be better unless, of course, it were cordless. Would be nice, but still an excellent gentleman&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> I HATED cleaning my old razor. This takes the part I hated the most about shaving away. It works really well and keeping it clean helps give a good shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;My friend likes it very much.&lt;br /&gt;It can works very well and his jaw feels really good.</li>
    <li> After over 10 years of service, I finally decided to retire my trusty Braun 7526 in favor a a new Braun.  I initially picked up a 3 series in a local store on sale, but returned it unopened when I saw I could get a 7 Series on Amazon for about $30-40 more...and the reviews indicated to me the extra money was worth it...I will, after all, use this thing at least 5 days a week for hopefully many years to come.  Here&#x27;s my take:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Close shave, no irritation on my sensitive skin, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;- Charge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;- Not messy...shaver seems to trap most all the \\&quot;stubble dust\\&quot;...which is a huge improvement over my 7526...that thing left dust all over me and the sink every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (which I consider all to be minor in nature):&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not a fan of this model&#x27;s pop-out trimmer.  It&#x27;s long and awkward to use, and IMO doesn&#x27;t trim as well as the 7526 shorter slide-up trimmer did.&lt;br /&gt;- While it&#x27;s a pretty quiet shave, it makes a much louder racket when being cleaned in the base.  Kind of annoying in the early morning when others are sleeping, you can hear this thing being cleaned all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to need a lot of cleaning--I am very curious how it estimates hygiene/cleanliness...seems to only reset while cleaned on the base.  While travelling, I occasionally clean the head myself with hot water and the brush...but that never raises the clean-meter on the shaver.  Not really a con, just gee-whiz for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: it gives a nice shave, I like it.  all the other stuff is gravy.</li>
    <li> Downsides: takes up a lot of counterspace with a big hunk of plastic. EXPENSIVE-- you&#x27;ll need to pay for the liquid on a regular basis for the life of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Upside: Provides the illusion of cleanliness, mainly via the smell of rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY: do you think product development in this case was driven by the engineers, or the bean counters? This is a textbook case of a brilliant way of milking the customer for YEARS after the initial purchase. Don&#x27;t be a sucker.... your shaver does not need to be sterilized like a surgical instrument before each use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s possible that this is one of the best electronic razors, and maybe they will never work for me, but I purchased this so I could do a quick shave every morning and make things easier than shaving with a razor blade.  I had tried relatively inexpensive electric razors before and they never really worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this thinking that a nice expensive electric razor with some really cool features would make a difference, especially since it had so many positive reviews.  After a week and a half of using this, I am pretty disappointed with this.  I have a rather thick beard that grows quickly, but this takes FOREVER to shave my face.  I clean it every single time and it still just doesn&#x27;t seem to go very quickly.  It&#x27;s slower than using a razor to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, I shave very carefully all the way across my face, and it just misses hairs all over the place.  I have yet to get a very clean shave from this product.  I was hoping for a lot, and have been fairly disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> Some years ago I stopped using a Braun razor, which I had paid about $30 for, in favor of a safety razor, with which I could&lt;br /&gt;get a closer shave. I now , sometimes, desire the convenience of not having to lather my face to shave so I chose to purchase&lt;br /&gt;another electric razor. I chose another Braun, top rated electric razor for $200+ and do not get as close a shave as I got with&lt;br /&gt;the old Braun which cost considerably less. I know costs have gone up for everything but many things have improved.&lt;br /&gt;The new Braun has a cleaning device, that you can order refills for from Braun, which is a not needed extra. I suppose&lt;br /&gt;this justifies the added cost??? At any rate, if my memory is not deceiving me, I am not getting as good a shave with this&lt;br /&gt;new Braun as I did with the old Braun.</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard beard to shave.  Always used a Norelco but this shaves much better.  Hard to beat the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Not as close as a blade but still very good.  No skin irritation, runs quiet, charge lasts a long time, smooth running, a great product.</li>
    <li> Very useful razor, though not very portable, but in the living room is also very convenient, is worth having is very charming</li>
    <li> I have been using my Braun for about a month, and to date it has been the best razor I have owned.  The razor itself is solid, well built and easy to hold.  One can both see and feel its quality.  I have a light beard, and for me the shave is as good as that attained with a blade and far more comfortable, especially in the area of the neck, which is always tender.  I have owned two other Braun electric shavers; this one is by far the quietest and most comfortable to use.  The cleaning station is also well constructed and leaves the shaver clean and smelling fresh for the next shave.  So far, the only criticism I have is that the travel case does not have room for the charging cord, which has to be packed separately during travel.  Other than that minor discrepency, I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is now the second Braun shaver that I have owned.  I was very happy with my last one until it finally croaked.  I upgraded to a series 7 this time, and for the most part, am very happy with it.  It gives a nice smooth shave, even better than my last one.  The one issue that I have is with the trimmer.  This feature could have simply been left off of the razor.  It does a very poor job of trimming, and is in a very awkward position.  That being said, I would still take this unit over a Norelco any day!</li>
    <li> The side lock button popped out.  I can&#x27;t put the spring bar back in----seems like a really cheap way to secure the side lock button.  Bad engineering by Braun.  Now it&#x27;s a hassle for me to waste MY TIME to get it fixed under warranty.  If I would have bought from COSTCO, I would have simply returned it broken as is  -- no questions asked and no hassle!</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve had that actually cuts the hair.  For the last 25 years  I&#x27;ve used those rotary razors that pull out more hair than they cut...  This is the best shave ever!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend seems to love it.  Close shave without the razor everyday.  Love the self cleaning feature.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I started shaving like most guys I guess when I enlisted in the Army at 18 back in &#x27;65. Back then we used the double edge safety razor we were issued and received the standard amount of nicks and cuts during the learning curve. Fast forward several years to civilian life and my new Mother in law (May God forever bless and keep this wonderful woman) presents me at Christmastime with the latest and greatest \\&quot;New\\&quot; gizmo ever created for a man, a Norelco Rotary Shaver, designed and engineered to eliminate nicks and cuts forever. Sounds great on Madison Avenue but in all practical applications, it doesn&#x27;t work on Main Street. Every time I yelled \\&quot;Ouch\\&quot; in my bathroom it seemed that I received a \\&quot;New\\&quot; set of replacement blades or a completely new Norelco Model as a Birthday or Christmas gift. no B.S! I&#x27;ve got a box in my garage with about 15 different models of that Rotary Razor and they all stink in my opinion but what else was I supposed to use? Fast forward to a couple of months ago when I&#x27;m reading the reviews of this \\&quot;New\\&quot; Braun Pulsonic. I&#x27;m now in my late 60&#x27;s and I&#x27;m not impressed with Corporate Adjectives but I will listen to what more than just a few real guys are saying about this Braun Series 7 razor.  So I decide to take a leap of faith. Heck, at my age and after all the nicks and cuts I&#x27;ve suffered over the years, I&#x27;ve earned a treat. If you&#x27;re truly tired of the beating you&#x27;ve been taking every time you put your current razor to your face, then give this baby a try. And one little piece of \\&quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth\\&quot;. I splurged for the complete system but you really don&#x27;t have to. After shaving you place your razor upside down in this holder that keeps your razor charged and clean at the same time which is kind of neat. There is a cleaning cartridge hidden in the base that gives your razor the once over after your razor is placed in the holder. It whirs, clicks, blinks &amp; buzzes and goes all R2D2 on you but it&#x27;s just a toy in my opinion. I got suckered in and smiled to myself while I played with it for the first time. In truth though I&#x27;m a more practical guy. After shaving I just pop off the little shaving cartridge and give it a few little blasts from a can of compressed air over the top of the razor &amp; the shaving head, replace and go. By the way this little baby also comes with an ultimately cool hard sided travel case that I use to store it in when we go out of town for a few days as well as the wall charger. Otherwise, I leave mine in \\&quot;The System\\&quot;. One other note that you married guys will bust a gut over. My wife thought that this entire gizmo sitting on the top of my vanity was so cool that she knitted a Silver &amp; Black (I&#x27;m a Raiders Fan) Cozy for it. It&#x27;s actually pretty slick and keeps it from getting splashed and hit by all sorts of flying whatnot from bathroom activity. (Maybe I should start taking orders)....To close...I purchased this razor August of &#x27;13 and have used it almost daily ever since. It&#x27;s the finest razor I&#x27;ve ever owned by a mile. It slides easily over my face and neck removing my whiskers quickly and cleanly without nicks, pinches or cuts especially on my neck. It&#x27;s sort of a men&#x27;s dream come true.led to myself while I played with it for the first time. In truth though I&#x27;m a more practical guy.

    <li> Lot smoother &amp; faster shave than my old Series 3.  Not cheap, but I feel it is worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> My father had purchased one of these several months back. I am more of a traditional razor person and have never used an electric. My line of work requires I am clean shaven daily. I decided that I would give this a shot as a backup plan. Upon arrival I had my first electric shave. It wasn&#x27;t impressive however, the instructions say if your new to electric shaving that you need several shaves to truly adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about my third shave it seemed to provide a closer and more comfortable shave. I use this during the week for a quick shave before work. The fact that I can place it in the charger, push a button and have a clean and ready to go razor is a huge benefit. No mess. I still feel that you cannot compare to a good quality safety razor experience however this is a great daily go to for when time dose not allow.</li>
    <li> A very good shaver with no pulling.  Comfortable feel.  The cleaning system is also a big positive for this shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver has a strong motor, smooth foils, and a good charging base. Though nothing is as close as blades, I have found this gives the closest shave from a foil shaver I have ever had. The cleaning system takes a while to complete it&#x27;s cycle but, unless you are OCD and want to clean it in mid shave, that is not a big deal. The indicator that tells me how close it is to needing a clean cycle is very accurate and useful. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for well over 1 month and have not yet needed to change out the cleaning fluids. Definitely worth the money I invested into this shaver!</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever bought. I have had Norelco&#x27;s and Panasonic razors in the past but if you want a great clean shave, go with the Braun. I have had it for a few months and it seems to give the best closest shave. I love the idea that it cleans itself. Just push the button and let it go. A little noisy when it starts its cleaning process but still a great electric shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> I had a series 3 shaver for 3 years and was ready for a new shaving head. It seems like it was starting to lose power so I decided to upgrade rather than invest in another foil head. I was amazed at the difference. The 790 just glides over my face. It gets closer than my old razer ever got. The only negative thing I can say about it is the trimmer blade extends out 90 degrees from the handle. It&#x27;s more difficult to use because the razer gets in the way of seeing the blade and what I&#x27;m trimming.</li>
    <li> The item is very good, but it is too bigger to me! I use it very good. The long time I can use!</li>
    <li> Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve owned a non-rotary electric shaver and this is a great one to have!  I have sensitive skin and my facial hair can be a bit thick and stubborn.  This shaving system makes light work of my facial hair regardless of what day of the week it is or how thick or thin my facial hair is.  And I really love the self cleaning system!  Definitely a bit of an investment but so far it has been more than worth it!</li>
    <li> I cannot say much since there is over a thousand 5 stars reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will compare, and review this product from another shaver perspective. A shaver from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Before this shaver, I had Braun Cruzer 6 Face Shaver. You would pass the same spot over, and over multiple times to get the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While with Braun 790, you would make a few passes for a quick clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cruzer foil is aggressive on the skin, while 790 is more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun 790 has a movable head, which is VERY useful when shaving between the neck, and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price difference is high, and that&#x27;s why I went with a cheaper foil shaver &amp;#34; Braun Cruzer 6 Face Shave &amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t really give me a great shave. Yes, it was a decent shave. Not all hairs were shaved equally, the shaver struggled at some places, and the shave at those places weren&#x27;t smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While with Braun 790, the shave was smooth, and clean. It was better than the cheaper shaver that I will not go back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shaving for couple times a week with Braun 790, in the long run, it will pay itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for it&#x27;s clean, smooth, comfortable, and faster shave, than other cheaper products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 UPDATE: 03/07/2017&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 4 years, and it works with no dramatic battery wear.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even notice any issue with the battery.&lt;br /&gt;I did a test. Turned on the shaver, let it run, and it stopped after 2 hours, and 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, did the same test on the other shaver, same as this one, and also gave 2 hours run time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver. I have a thick coarse beard and this Braun gives me a close shave every time. I hate to shave but this shaver makes it more tolerable.  Highly recommended,  you won&#x27;t be sorry if you decide to buy it.</li>
    <li> after using blades for 40 years I finally got my Braun.its fast clean shaving and and gives a great shave it is the best</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. It was a good choice and I knew nothing about electric razors. The reviews posted were helpful.  My husband uses it everyday and his shave looks great with zero skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts a lifetime. Cleans itself and let&#x27;s you know how clean it is. When you turn this bad boy on it damn near jumps out of your hand with torque. I shave every day, with NO irritation. I&#x27;ve had the same blade and cleaner for 3 months now. Cons- can&#x27;t take the cleaner on trips, unless you save the cap to the cleaning liquid! So save the cap..</li>
    <li> Works very well; better than any of the Norelco shavers that I have been using for years. Still not as close as a razor shave. I&#x27;m not crazy about having the buy the fairly costly cleaning solutions. The Norelco head is removable and you can run it under water.</li>
    <li> I had the one underneath this one I thought it was good until I got this one this one&#x27;s been great had it for about three months now love it</li>
    <li> not as good as expected</li>
    <li> Best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> best electric I have ever used. Will never use a blade again.</li>
    <li> As much i want to say i love this product after using it for about 4 years i can&#x27;t give it 5 stars or 4 stars for one simple reason. The sliding button that locks the shaver head into position fell off about a month into owning this product. i never bothered to send it back and after 4 years i haven&#x27;t had any other problems. its a great shaver but for the price, the buttons should not be falling off 4 weeks into owning the thing. good product, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> A very good shaver at a good price. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks and very happy with the performance.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. Gives a the best shave of any electric shaver I have ever owned. Worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as the first replacement for my old Braun Activator.  I&#x27;d gotten used to the LCD and the cleaning charging stand, so I had to have those features again.  The 790cc&#x27;s advancements over the Activator included a new faster motor, a different foil system, and the ability to select different skin &amp;#34;sensitivities&amp;#34;, which correspond to how hard the shaver would attempt to shave your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaves are very close, and definitely no irritation on the sensitive level.  The unit is sure easy to clean.  The LCD on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t tell you as much information as the old Activator&#x27;s; number of shaves and how long are not displayed.  Just battery level and hygiene of the head (which is more a count of times-used-since-last-cleaning).  Not a real problem, but just mentioning it FWIW.  Certainly didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real design problem with the 790cc is the trimmer.  It is well-concealed, popping out over the power button.  But it has an awkward angle of use, and is also a bit flimsy due to the mechanism.  If you have a lot of edges that need defining (say a mustache, beard or sideburns), this is not the all-in-one tool you&#x27;re looking for.  As that was my situation, off I went to look for another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the other ones have plain shaved as well as the 790cc.</li>
    <li> Good product. Nice hi tech design and feel.  It does the job but it does not feel sturdy like the Braun Series 5 shavers from 10 years ago.  The charging station feels flimsy as well. You need to jiggle the shaver slightly to get a good contact.  I never had to do that with the 8995 shaver I had before.  The beard trimmer is also extended outwards too much and does not provide good control during precise trims.  This is supposedly a better product and while it does a fine job, I have a feeling it won&#x27;t last as long as my last Braun did. Wish they cut down on the fancy design and put more in actual build.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had hands down.</li>
    <li> i have to shave w/ panasonic 3D if i skip a day shaving w/ braun. i really dont like that i have to continually buy liquid cleaner refills. thats why i own an electric razor , not to  bleed away money.  the braun takes too long to get good results .  ill buy another rotary and avoid foil shavers forever now.</li>
    <li> Really good razor but IT&#x27;S NOT WATER PROOF. I washed just one time, water got in and I never worked again.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected....I have used ellectric shavers all my life and this was the most satisfying of all !  It was less time,less faceburn and much closer.  The upkeep cost for cleaning convenience is not out of line in my opinion. I cover the  shaver/cleaner unit with  my newspaper&#x27;s plastic cover when not in use to slow down evaporation......it helps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t bother with the fancy cleaning/charging machine, but the shaver itself is great.  It holds a charge for at least two weeks and gives a very nice comfortable shave.  All the men in my family have used these Braun shavers for years and we wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I am almost 90 and I started with electric razor (Sunbeam).  This one beats them all because it shaves closer.</li>
    <li> This shaver is perfect in every way. Gives a real close shave and feels great in hand. My last Braun lasted 13 years with little maintenance.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THESE FOR GIFTS. THEY ARE WELL LIKED AND WORK GREAT. MAKE SURE YOU BUY THE CLEANER FOR THE CONTAINER AS YOU NEED 12 FOR A YEAR. SHAVES GREAT</li>
    <li> This was gift for my boyfriend and he&#x27;s like a kid with a new toy. He loves it. Good quality!...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Smooth/quick shaves, no irritation. Elegant shaver and base, cord detaches for travel -- but a charge lasts long enough for several shaves. Minor nuisance, liquid cleaner cartridge in base can spill so I keep reminding housecleaner to keep it level. Cartridge is good for 30+ cleanings so it&#x27;s a minor expense -- buy &#x27;em in four-pack, maybe $20.</li>
    <li> Its like no other shaver my husband has used. It give a close shave without cuts, its warm when you put it to your face, and it cleans itself.  He really thinks its the cats meow.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> After 40+ years as a Norelco user, I decided to try a Braun shaver. So far it is doing a better job, is comfortable and I am a happy guy.</li>
    <li> 舒服高大上，第二次购买了。价格合理125买的。&lt;br /&gt;comfortable Luxury,Large,Level up.Reasonable price 125 to buy.Thanks to the Amazon, to buy the cost-effective shaver.Would recommend friends to buy</li>
    <li> NOT WATERPROOF retrned for 7-9-797. overall a great razor-just wanted the latest options</li>
    <li> What an exquisite shaver! The ONLY one that ever gave me a virtually same quality shave as a Gillette blade would! Every time!</li>
    <li> This will be my 3rd Series 7 and they seem to only last about 3 years.</li>
    <li> Too many bells and whistles; I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for 40 years, and have never had to have that cleaning apparatus.  Seems it&#x27;s just an excuse to raise the price, and sell cleaning fluid.  But the shaver does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> High quality shaver with a great cleaning system. Better than Panasonic and Philips. I have used this basic design from the 5 series up to the 7 series for a number of years and very little goes wrong. The only maintenance it neeeds is the head cleaning; thi is done by the base cleaning, and if you travel it is supposed to be cleanable by running the head under water, however I have not done that because the base is very good for cleaning. You get some cleaning tools with the unit, and they come in handy for dry( as in , not wet) cleaning the shaving head</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Compared to his previous Braun, this one is not as durable.  It uses too much of the cleaning solution as though it was manufactured to make you have to buy more unnecessarily.... Otherwise, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my husband, as his thick stubble &amp; skin tend to not play well with disposable razors. Seems to work pretty damn well, his skin has improved overall since it&#x27;s not taking a beating anymore. I would buy again &amp; recommended.</li>
    <li> For the price shave should A one</li>
    <li> Great product. Good price</li>
    <li> Love this electric razor, really close shave and good quality</li>
    <li> I have owned a ton of electric shavers being in the Army ( we have to shave everyday ) and I would always irritated my skin going over it10 times. Well I sucked it up and bought this guy hoping the more expensive one would work, and it does work awesome I don&#x27;t have to go over my skin a ton of times so I have way less irritation and it feels like a razor shave. Best part is the thing cleans itself and charges right in the base and when I need to take it to the field it came with a case and can be charged out of the base as well.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and spend the money it&#x27;s worth it and your skin is worth it.</li>
    <li> STILL NOT AS CLOSE AS A BLADE RAZOR; BUT, A VERY GOOD SHAVE FOR AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.  ALL IN ALL, A GOOD PURCHASE AND WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  MY WIFE HAD PURCHASED A SERIES 3 BRAUN FOR ME AT TARGET AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.  WITHIN ONE (1) WEEK AFTER RECEVING THE SERIES 3, I WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE THE SERIES 7 THROUGH AMAZON FOR ONLY $3.00 MORE THAN MY WIFE HAD PAID FOR THE SERIES 3.  OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE SINCDE RETURNED THE SERIES 3.  I CONSIDER IT TO HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD  PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say..., It&#x27;s wonderful !!</li>
    <li> It shaves closely, and without irritation, and feels like a very high quality device.  Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> Great shave as close to razor as I would like.  If beard is over 2 days you can actually feel the pull and cut.</li>
    <li> Awesome, one of the best in the market</li>
    <li> This product works even better than expected. Given the brand-name I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised!</li>
    <li> Very happy after staying away from electric shavers since the Nixon administration.  Great feel in my hand and a surprisingly close shave every morning.  Love the easy daily maintenance and cleaning with the touch of a button.  Quality appears to be very solid.  Price was right.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, but takes awhile longer (than other reviews suggest) to get the super close shave that I like. Still, much quicker than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. The auto cleaning is great. It is loud but it takes as long as a shower after shaving does so theres no real impact. I&#x27;ve only had it for three weeks so as long as it gives a consistent shave for a few years I&#x27;ll be satisfied that I got good value from it.</li>
    <li> I just replaced a similar Braun shaver I got as a gift TEN years ago. Finally decided to purchase a new one and this 7 series is also a great shaver and great price. Of course you must maintain the shaver. I cleaned the old one and replaced only the blades as needed over the course of ten years of ownership and the shaver definitely was worth the price. That is why I again chose to purchase a Braun and went with the 7 series. I look forward to ten years of worry and hassle free ownership with the 7 series as well.</li>
    <li> I always use manual shaver, this time I thought to try electric one, I brought this from BJ&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t see amazon prime selling it. and it was cost 199$ :)&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is Excellent, and startup did not took more than a minute for newbee like me.&lt;br /&gt;I thought to give a try on next morning before bath, I tried dry one and it did well job on face. excellent I did not feel I did that close shave with this machine... Excellent Job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I starting it on Neck, oh god it was such a bad that I have to use my shaving kit back, it did cut here and there on my neck. It was written on box to try for week before get a use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use it for couple of more time may be 2 week see how it goes and then update you again.</li>
    <li> Suitable size, very beautiful, quality is good, I like it, you also worth having, if later still have a good discount, I will continue to buy</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I ever owned. I was quite happy with the Braun 550, which I&#x27;ve been using for about three years, but the 790 is clearly superior. I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it!</li>
    <li> When my old shaver had bit the dust I decided to research what the best electric shaver to be had. The reviews indicated the Braun Series 7 was the way to go. The reviews were right on. This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve gone through about every brand out there. When it comes to this shaver you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought two Braun shavers back in 2000-2001 - the 7570 and 7526 models, both with cleaners. One for my son (16 yrs old at the time) and one for myself. My son has since moved out and uses a blade, so I still have both of these shavers and they still work after about 15 years. The amazing thing is the batteries still hold enough power in both of them to last for a week worth of shaves, especially after one sat dormant without charging for a few years and it still works great.. I do change the foils and blades every year or so. I just saw one of the Cooltec models in the store today on sale and bought it, so I guess I&#x27;ll be retiring these two shavers and use them for backups or traveling. I highly recommend Braun shavers, they are not perfect in every aspect for everybody, but you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth in longevity in my experience.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaved for my son and he indicated that it did a good job.  The cut was close without irritation.  We would recommend this unit to everyone looking for a self cleaning shaved.</li>
    <li> Been using Braun for years. Love my new Braun 7 Series. Excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> The 5-stars is really for Amazon and not so much for the Braun. Amazon is simply the finest company on the planet. My first Braun had a defective foil piece which made shaving painful. A defect causing hair to be snagged and pulled rather than cut. Like shaving with pliers. Anyway, a two minute chat with Amazon took care of everything. Amazon is awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure the dry function of the cleaner base ever worked properly.  At any rate, the base has stopped working altogether.  Replacement &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; (read-not under warrantee) is &amp;#62;$60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking to replace the whole shebang, and I am extremely dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I have bought several fairly expensive shavers for my husband and all have been dismal failures. This one is different. He actually likes it and it does a much better job than any of the others we have tried.</li>
    <li> This product automatically maintains the cleanliness of the shaver. One will eventually need to buy a replenishment of the cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few months- it could be that I&#x27;ve always bought razors for under $100-- but this was definitely worth the (discounted) price I paid for it ($150). While I wish it was completely waterproof- this is only a minor setback. The only other complaint I have is about the pop out razor. Its kind of in an awkward spot and I prefer the location of it on the back side like my older Braun razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system leaves you with a million dollar shave after each cleanse. I don&#x27;t clean it as often as it suggests (pretty much after every time I use it) as the cost of the cleaning fluid is pretty steep- but I do clean it about once a week and its been working out well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. Not disappointed with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has now been almost two years since I&#x27;ve been using this product and it is still going strong. I now see the price has actually risen quite a bit, but honestly this shaver is worth it at almost any price. Every time I use this razor I&#x27;m amazed by the closeness of the shave and the lack of razor burn that I would occasionally get with other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these two years I have finally changed the razor head, like it suggests (every 1.5 years) and the shave is as good as ever.  As for the cleaning pods, I still don&#x27;t use them as often as it suggests but every time I do it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m using the razor for the first time.  I cannot recommend this razor enough due to the relatively low price and the quality and feel of the shave. You get closeness of a manual razor with the comfort of an electric one (without fear of razor burns, cuts, etc.)  I often forget, but the razor even has a speed or &amp;#34;roughness&amp;#34; setting so that when shaving in sensitive areas you can turn down the razor so that it won&#x27;t do any damage-- I&#x27;ve found that in doing this you have to go over the area quite a few more times, but in exchange for the safety of sensitive areas it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mention on review page for the cleaning fluid there are a few tips that help the solution last longer (5-6 months, versus 2-3) and will help you have that million dollar shave every time: &amp;#34;Each [Cleaning Pod] lasts about five months, sometimes longer, although I don&#x27;t use them as much as Braun suggests I should.  For me one long/deep clean a week, and the quick clean when I feel it&#x27;s needed keeps the razor working fine. Like other reviews have suggested I have found that placing the cap back on when your not using the cleaner does help it last longer, but I feel the MOST IMPORTANT step to making it last is to rinse all the hair out of razor and let it dry a bit before you use the cleaning dock. Using the cleaning system with a razor full of hair only dilutes the cleaning solution and makes it not clean as well.&amp;#34;review page for the cleaning fluid there are a few tips that help the solution last longer (5-6 months, versus 2-3) and will help you have that million dollar shave every time: &amp;#34;Each [Cleaning Pod] lasts about five months, sometimes longer, although I don&#x27;t use them as much as Braun suggests I should.

    <li> After reading many reviews for electric razors, this one was always on top, or near the top of the list.  I had always been a fan of Braun razors, but I received a Gillette as a gift a few years back so I struggled the last few years with an electric razor that I always had to follow up with a blade.  When that one died, I decided to go back to the Braun brand.  Man, am I glad I did.  This razor does an amazing job, it doesn&#x27;t tug on any facial hair, I don&#x27;t have to follow with a blade razor, it&#x27;s quiet and I like the ability to adjust the closeness of the shave.  I am once again clean shaven and a happy camper in the morning.  The ability to keep it clean is nice too.</li>
    <li> Does not meet up to expectations of this hyped up shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought this at a very strong recommendation and took the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand back to the store.  So Sad I did that!  So this cleans itself, big deal, you pay for that and a lot!  Here&#x27;s the thing...the cost of the cartridges is not worth the money in comparison to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand that is wet/dry and does a great job and gives a much closer shave WITHOUT the irritation.  Should have sent it back...I am sorry I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for 30 years from norelco to Remington and this is the best razor ever.  It&#x27;s fast and shaves as close as a blade.  I never used a blade,  but I can tell you my face has never been so smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
    <li> Looks like a nice shaver but does the task of shaving poorly. If you go over the area of your face that you want to shave smooth ... by the time you have some semblance of smooth... the razor has created a burning feeling  and has irritated your face. My prior electric razor was a Norelco and it gave a much closer and Smoother Shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because is has a cleaning cartridge that has alcohol in it ..... they WILL DELIVER IT TO YOU but Won&#x27;t let you return it !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;VERY SELECTIVE MEMORY that BENEFITS THEM $$$ NOT YOU !!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3 1/2 MONTHS !!!! from the date I mailed it back to Braun ... I got a debit card with credit on in ... which can&#x27;t be used for cash...&lt;br /&gt;I spoke with them over 2 weeks ago they told me the money was on the way to me allow 10 days for it to get to me !!! It was the US Post offices .....&lt;br /&gt;SCAM TO MAKE MONEY ON YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY !!!</li>
    <li> Closest shave I have ever gotten and does not irritate my face!  The battery lasts forever!!!  Very light weight and powerful.</li>
    <li> This is a great machine, works great in your face, no redness in your face and neck. I called the perfect beauty face</li>
    <li> 18 months on and still works like new.</li>
    <li> My husband has an extremely tough beard and it grows fast! I have looked for yrs for something that would work on his face and the Braun Series 7 did the trick!! Now instead of spending 20 mins in the morning shaving with a razor he is done in just a few mins! The cleaning system is amazing and saves a lot of time also! He loves it and so do I! Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does ok... Under chin neck area a little difficult as well as the side burn area. Outside of that its a fine razor..</li>
    <li> Good close shaving and always clean and sanitized. Great buy!i recommend this Braun model to anyone want to have a good close shave!</li>
    <li> THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE ALL TIME BEST ELECTRIC RAZORS I HAVE EVER OWNED.  FIRST TIME I USED IT AND I GOT A CLEAN AND CLOSE SHAVE IN JUST MINUTES.  I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHERS BEFORE AND THEY HAVE BEEN OK BUT THIS GAVE ME ONE OF THE CLOSEST SHAVE I HAVE EVER GOTTEN WITHOUT USING A REGULAR RAZOR.</li>
    <li> does not shave me very good</li>
    <li> For my beard, this razor is much better than the equivalent Panasonic.  It gives a closer shave and has an easier cleaning system.</li>
    <li> 3rd one I bought. Best on the market</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for several months now and love it. I don&#x27;t like having to buy the cleaning cartridge every so often but I do like having a clean shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Braun shaving system! I stil have the other one(7 years old) This one gets so close, it&#x27;s almost like a razor shave. Only thing I would change? The trimmer is a little flimsy, can&#x27;t really use it like the previous one, but I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun.  They improved some design features (e.g. The old one had a name on the back which got rubbed off from the cleaning solution - this one looks brand new).  This one is quieter, sharper looking, cleans and recharges faster,  and the carrying case is better.</li>
    <li> After using Braun series 3, I just love this one. As a person who doesn&#x27;t like shaving generally, now I do enjoy shaving. Feel very little irritation on my skin afterwards. It definitely does better shaving. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and a few spots that are really prone to ingrown hairs so electric shavers have never seemed to work for me. I decided to give it another try and bought this after a lot of research and I&#x27;m quite happy I did. This shaves without much effort and has never caused any skin irritation. Even if I wait a few days with my coarse hair, this thing shaves it like a pro. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 40 years and I have never had a better shave than with my new Braun Series 7.  It has been great, easy to use and a great close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Braun Brand.  Creates a clean close shave and I love the self cleaning feature.  The battery hasnt died on my yet but I like the fact that you can use it as a corded shaver when plugged in.</li>
    <li> works great! comfortable and close shave. cleaning, charging station is quick. very pleased with it. better than the series 5 I had.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver a year ago to replace my old Series 5 Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is nicer than the Series 5 with minimal skin irritation if any and a satisfying close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit this shaver could never be as close to a manual blade to the face, but I do enjoy not having cuts to my face.</li>
    <li> I read a very favorable report on this item in Consumer Reports.  The shaver is extremely easy to use resulting in a smooth &amp; comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve used this item for ~1 month. And yes I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Braun 790 shaver. I waited a while before I purchased it reading reviews and looking for a sale price. I was hesitant to spend the money and didn&#x27;t care about the cleaning stand. What a mistake since I could have had a close shave and clean shaver for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for the past 15 years and had several models during that time. I was always happy with them and didn&#x27;t see what I would get out of this model. What I got was the closest shave and no more manually cleaning my razor making a mess. Quality is very good and the cleaning stand works great. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a close and comfortable shave and a nice clean shaver. It takes a good design to impress a Design Engineer and the Engineers deserve congratulations on this one.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever had.  Electrics still don&#x27;t shave as close as safety razors.  Cleaning system is nice.  If you don&#x27;t like the mess of shaving cream, etc., this is for you.  It takes a couple of weeks for your face to get used to the electric shaver.  It&#x27;s a trade off.  I don&#x27;t like shaving, and I dread this electric shaver less than a safety razor.  For me there was no pulling or burning and especially no cutting my face.</li>
    <li> Of all the electric razors I&#x27;ve owned ,this  one provides the closest shave. I particularly like the mechanism which locks the blade system at a specific angle. Also very nice ergonomics.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to pay so much for an electric shaver, but after doing so, I have to say it is by far the best shaver I ever used, very close to&lt;br /&gt;a shave with razor blades. You also have to figure out how to use the base which cleans and charges it, and there is a continuing expense for&lt;br /&gt;cleaning fluid on occasion. But it does a great job of shaving with less effort than anything I ever tried.</li>
    <li> after of over six decades of electric shaver usagea it&#x27;s by far the closest sshave I ever have felt. I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> It works very well.l never knew a shavers could do a wonderful job on my head. It does just what I want it 2 do.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago to replace an old 5 series shaver.  It gives a much closer shave and is really nice to use.  I don&#x27;t clean it every day (seems unnecessary) and I have taken it on vacation and didn&#x27;t clean it or charge it for 3 weeks and it still worked fine.  There&#x27;s no pulling (I cannot use a blade because of that) and it&#x27;s quite a fast shave as well.  I like the pop out trimmer; if the eyebrows get a little wild (I hate getting older in some ways) you can clean them up (be careful :-) ).  No hesitation in recommending this seems very durable.</li>
    <li> I have had other Braun shavers, and this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve had by far.  It gives a close &amp; comfortable shave, and the combination charger/cleaner keeps the shaver ready to use.  Because it&#x27;s always clean, it doesn&#x27;t get whisker debris everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the indicator light for changing the cleaning cartridge does not work properly.  It always says the cartridge is fine.  It never progresses to show the fluid deteriorating or that it needs to be replaced.  I shave with it every day, and after a few months, I just replace the cartridge using my own judgement.</li>
    <li> The biggest question: How close/comfortable is the shave.  Well, to be brief, it&#x27;s really close, and really comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selling Points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning System:  I got really OCD about putting dirty razors on my face, because I felt like you can never really properly clean a razor before this.  This was the solution, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 Sensitive Shaving Modes: I&#x27;m really sensitive on my neck, so I usually put the razor in the most sensitive mode there.  Still gets a great close shave, don&#x27;t even notice the difference in that sense.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Braun 7505 shaver (with sideburn trimmer) with an OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE Braun Series 7 (790 cc) Pulsonic shaver and cleaning system that has a liquid-crystal display and LEDs.  The Pulsonic definitely moves much faster, but … Unfortunately, after a little over a year and a half the tiny plastic and nylon parts in the sideburn trimmer catastrophically failed leaving a couple of flapping plastic sliders.  After about two years, the center cutting head for longer whiskers failed catastrophically in a shower of tiny parts.  So now I have a Pulsonic that only shaves very short whiskers and does not trim sideburns.  I still have the old 7505 which is perfectly fine, but slower, that I use for trimming sideburns and shaving after more than 2-3 days.  I then finish with the Pulsonic. The old 7505 is a nice straight-forward design but is slower.  It would have been great to have the Pulsonic motor built within the simpler and solid design of the 7505.  One wonders what possesses the Braun designers and engineers to come up with those ridiculously over-engineered and complex shavers that are so failure prone.  I had a suspicion that the sideburn trimmer on the Pulsonic was going to fail when I first saw how it works because it was obviously laughably and stupidly complex.  Hey Braun designers &amp; engineers … WAKE UP and design for longevity!</li>
    <li> Friends get satisfied. Razor shave is clean, sounds great, but in the acceptable range, picked everything is satisfied, if need be, I will choose it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun electric.  It&#x27;s also the best yet.  I&#x27;m more of a minimalist so it took some research and a little leap of faith to splurge for the higher end model.  I was also a bit skeptical of the &amp;#34;cleaning station&amp;#34; - just more consumables to maintain.  But this is indeed a great system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives a nice close shave.  Very comfortable overall (one exception later).  It seems to vibrate at much higher speed than previous models I&#x27;ve had - this is evident in the audible pitch and in the way it feels.  It&#x27;s smooth and reasonably aggressive in its trimming action so that overall your shave is pretty fast.  I find that it does a good job not leaving &amp;#34;stragglers&amp;#34;.  One noticeable issue is that if I have grown a mid-length stubble (for me thats 3-4 days), this model seems to catch the odd hair with a painful pull more frequently than others I&#x27;ve used.  So if you have a couple day old beard going (not too long, not too short) you need to slow down a little.  Not sure if thats the foil design or what, but it&#x27;s a noticeable thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer works well, is a bit smaller (width-wise) than other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had, and it flips out (not slides up) so that it&#x27;s perpendicular to the shaver body.  That has it&#x27;s advantages in that it stays well clear of the shaving head and you can be a little more precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation&lt;br /&gt;Simple, one button on/off operation.  Battery and &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; indicators are on the bottom.  Big plus is the battery life.  This thing will run for a week on a single charge.  I leave it out of the charging cradle during the week and only charge it when it gets low (just to prevent battery burnout - not sure if it&#x27;s that kind of battery).  The cord that powers the base can also be used directly with the shaver for travel which is a good design.  Comes with a nice travel case, but the case is so form fitting to the shaver, you can&#x27;t fit the power cord in the case with the razor - that was a bad design decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self-Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK here&#x27;s the special thing about this model - the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removable head is a more complex part than the simple 2 piece foil and blade of prior models.  This is one piece.  It removes easily and seems to readily release most clippings that it collects with a few taps on the side of the sink.  The shaver seems to go immediately from &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Dirty&amp;#34; in pretty much one or two shaves.  So basically it wants to be cleaned multiple times a week.  I usually run the cleaning cycle once every two weeks to conserve the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cycle is really nice.  There is a self-contained alcohol/sanitizing solution that slides into the base.  The cleaning cycle washes the cutting head with this solution, runs the razor, and dries it.  Your shaver indeed comes out feeling and smelling like new.  It&#x27;s a noticeably smoother shave after it&#x27;s done.  Your mileage will obviously vary depending on how often you run the cleaning cycle.  The cycle itself seems to take 30 minutes or so - so don&#x27;t plan on cleaning this right before you need to shave - you put it in the dock, press a button, and walk away for a while.  It cycles the razor several times with a drying cycle in between.  I&#x27;ve never really waited for the whole process so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it will go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver&lt;br /&gt;Feels good and works well&lt;br /&gt;Holds a Charge&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning station is a nice feature (from a skeptic) but will increase your expense in maintaining/operatingt was a bad design decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self-Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK here&#x27;s the special thing about this model - the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removable head is a more complex part than the simple 2 piece foil and blade of prior models.

    <li> I previously had the 5 series and wanted to upgrade only because I lost it and couldn&#x27;t find it. The 7 series is certainly worth it. The new design and options/functions are easy to use and saves a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  I have been using it for the past 6 months.  Nice clean shave.  The lemon fresh cleaning agent is good.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this and the base was broken, the tank indicator showed almost empty when it had a new tank. When the razor was put in to clean, it started cleaning and 5 seconds later, the tank indicator turned red and the cleaning stopped. I tried 3 different  tanks - all same result.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun name no longer means quality.  I would not buy a Braun product again.</li>
    <li> The new razor doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my cheaper and older version of the Braun.  It feels good, but several passes are required with considerable pressure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as my Phillips Norelco stopped working. This is my first time using Braun and i am very disappointed with&lt;br /&gt;the product as it make lot of noise and while shaving the blades or trimming area get heated which makes me irritated.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product as i am feeling uncomfortable. I am back to my Phillips Norelco</li>
    <li> great shaver- their shavers are always the best-would never have any other kind . I am 88 years old and would not use any other. Bob Anderson</li>
    <li> I have always shaved with a blade but for medical reasons I have to use an electric shaver.  I had an upper-end Norelco shaver. I am older and retired and don&#x27;t have to shave every day. The Norelco reminded me of an &amp;#34;Epilady&amp;#34;, catching longer whiskers and pulling them out.  The Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver is smooth and effective.  I also love the sink top cleaning system which is &amp;#34;hands off&amp;#34; and keeps the shaver clean, lubricated, and ready for action.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for one of my grandsons and he liked it so well his brother wanted one too.  They both think it is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Not perfect but good a bit expensive.so I shave with my old Braun the get a closer shave with this. The reason is that I want to save the blades as the replacements are expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the BMW 7 series of shaver for an executive shave.  Yes, it has a cleaning mode, an LCD charge and hygiene meter.  It is a little on the overkill, like top of the line model that you marvel at the LCD and then pick it up because it feels like some high tech taser.  So what, how does it shave?  Even though it might need a few passes, it is a very close shave.  There are so many features that I don&#x27;t even know where to start, but just press the power button and shave away.  The trimmer is a bit flimsy unlike my old 7505.  Actually, my 7505 still works, but the wierd charger broke (looking on Ebay).  Yes, it is better than my 7505, but only the shaving part.  The head vibrates very fast and the cutting block moves quickly so I don&#x27;t even hear or feel it cutting.  My 7505 - I can feel and hear it cutting.  These things are getting too complex.  When I took off the foil and cutting block, I don&#x27;t see where the stubble went.  I don&#x27;t think I can clean the cutting block without disassembling the block.  Maybe that is why they have the cleaning system.  Actually, the holder helps prevent wear on the plug by charging the shaver, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Compared to my now working 7505 (found an old plug on the Bay)- I feel that my light scruff does not need the 790 shaver, but will keep it as a backup to my aging 7505.  The cutting block on the 790 seems to be attached to the foil, so please take care of the foil.  My 10+ year old 7505 that I bought on Amazon as a refurb still works great.  It&#x27;s slower motion actually feels better for my light growth than the high strung 790.  Plus, I cannot undervalue the importance of the 7505&#x27;s better trimmer.  I can trim side burns and even get away with a haircut longer by using it to trim my hair.  The 790 cannot do this as well or maybe I&#x27;m not used to it.  My 7505 after 10 years has still only needed about 3 foil + cutters over the years and only because the foil got punctured by some jealous girlfriend.  Braun makes the best shavers bar none.  When my 7505 finally dies, the 790 will suffice.shavers bar none.  When my 7505 finally dies, the 790 will suffice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how close a shave I get from this shaver. The cleaning base/charger works really well too. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he really likes it. He has very thick stubborn facial hair and he loves how smooth this product leaves his face after a shave without the cuts and bumps.</li>
    <li> i buy it to china，it very cheap ，it is very good ，i hope it can directly send to china！thank u！</li>
    <li> I was able to try both Brauns 790cc &amp; 799cc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me &amp; my brother got the Braun 7 Series I got the 790cc last month &amp;&lt;br /&gt;my got the 799cc Brauns newest one for xmas 2013 &amp; the main difference it&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;wet/dry shaver you can use it with all types of shaving cream &amp; use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see the fuss about shaving wet when I already get an awesome shave doing&lt;br /&gt;it dry.  They both did an awesome job just as good as the fusion blades &amp; better then&lt;br /&gt;my Norelco.  I had a Norelco shaver for years &amp; It Just broke Its becoming to expensive&lt;br /&gt;to purchase Blades for my Fusion &amp; I did a lot of research &amp; purchased the Braun 790cc-4&lt;br /&gt; instead of the 799cc they look alike work the same with same blades except the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun 799c cost 325.00 &amp; the Braun 790cc-4 cost me 175.00 with 2 year warranty for 205.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Look same but the 799cc has a couple differences but not the worth paying 150.00&lt;br /&gt;more &amp; they both of the do the same job shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun 790cc-4 175.00 is cheaper both use the same blades&lt;br /&gt;Braun 799c 325.00 ---  150.00 to 175.00 more &amp; its the same shaver but it wet/dry &amp; a extra cleaning cycle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative side of the Braun 7 Series - which is no big deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Braun Series 7 790cc4 - you can clean the inside when you disconnect the foil blades&lt;br /&gt;  but you can &#x27;t manually clean the blades like the Phillips 3D you will&lt;br /&gt;  always have use the base with the cleaning solutions cartridge installed&lt;br /&gt;  to really clean it &amp; lubricate the blades.&lt;br /&gt;2) Braun have slight louder buzzing sound&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives Sides&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shave results - Awesome just as good my fusion&lt;br /&gt;2) Holding it gives you more flexibility in you hand like your holding a regular razor in your hand&lt;br /&gt;3) Setting Levels for Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;4) Fast Cleaning &amp; Cleaning solution has Nice Lemon scent better then my Norelco Jet Cleaner&lt;br /&gt;5) When the charge is down &amp; you can still connect the power cord &amp; plug it in&lt;br /&gt;  to shave but the new Phillips Norelco 3D they need to recharge on the base to work again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to save money you can make your own cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;just look on google &amp; here some websites below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - The Electric Shaver Guide - [...]&lt;br /&gt;2 - [[ASIN:B00BLV5WJQ Refills Braun Clean Renew Cartridges]]&lt;br /&gt;3 - [...]&lt;br /&gt;4 - The 790cc don&#x27;t have to purchase shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;5 - Braun Replacement blades are all in stores - the Phillips will cost you more to replace blades &amp; may&lt;br /&gt;  be hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money &amp; purchase this Braun Series 7-790CC4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hacker10cord &amp; plug it in&lt;br /&gt;  to shave but the new Phillips Norelco 3D they need to recharge on the base to work again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to save money you can make your own cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;just look on google &amp; here some websites below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - The Electric Shaver Guide - [...]&lt;br /&gt;2 - [[ASIN:B00BLV5WJQ Refills Braun Clean Renew Cartridges]]&lt;br /&gt;3 - [...]&lt;br /&gt;4 - The 790cc don&#x27;t have to purchase shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;5 - Braun Replacement blades are all in stores - the Phillips will cost you more to replace blades &amp; may&lt;br /&gt;  be hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money &amp; purchase this Braun Series 7-790CC4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hacker10</li>
    <li> It is very good shaver ever!!!!  my husband loved it! definitely I recommend it! For sure u will love it too</li>
    <li> 99% of a close shave compared to a razor blade but less of a mess.....shaving every morning for work got me tired so I tried this Braun and I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as replacement for old 74 series shaver and was not displeased.It is much more quite than old</li>
    <li> I still use it periodically when I travel but clearly not worth the money</li>
    <li> The Best electic shaver I ever used.. Powerful and clean close shave</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Husband love this! leaves his face feeling fresh, no cuts, no scars. He shaves his face under 3 minutes with this machine. The only downfall, It is a little loud when it cleans itself.</li>
    <li> Have only had it for 10 days. Steve Harvey of SteveHarveyTV.com recommended it for shaving head. So far it is doing a lousy job. Talked to a Braun rep. She said need to give it 3 weeks to get used to hair. I will try it for another 10 days and report back.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Series 7 for many years and have no complaints.  It is reliable and provides a great, close shave.  I bought a new Series 7 after 6 years because the pop-up trimmer broke.  The shaver still works fine, so I take it with me on my travels.  I could probably get it repaired, but appliance repair costs are often quite expensive.</li>
    <li> Grandad loves this! Has an &amp;#34;industrial &amp;#34; look to it. My nephew wants one too! Sent to my father in assisted living.</li>
    <li> does not do a good job for this price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clipper broke right after warranty expired. Company did not help nor care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lousy product &amp; customer service.</li>
    <li> been using remington shavers for 40 years but the last two I bought just didn&#x27;t seem to shave the way they used to.  i&#x27;ve never paid more than $60 for a shaver before.  got a panasonic for $100 that didn&#x27;t shave any closer or faster than my remington, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Braun a try.  I like it!  It&#x27;s quiet and gives me a noticible smoother shave much faster then any of the remington&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had.  And I really like the cleaning system.  just plug it in an go.BUT....  THIS IS AN UPDATE. I REPLACED the cutter/foil in 2015 through Amazon for about $35.  they recommend replacing every 18 months.  but now (Jan 2017)  replacements are priced at near $100!!!!!  I cannot find any explanation for this.  I can buy a new shaver for about $170!</li>
    <li> Select the Braun Series 7 790cc shaver, I go through contrast, some of my friends bought a Philips, Panasonic shaver after use has a different feel when using the Braun after seeing a friend, I think it is high , the atmosphere, the grade, of course, it&#x27;s a limited edition, but personally think that the standard version has been enough for me to use. I used to use a Philips, has been with me more than a decade, of course, to the purchase of carefully selected, use my experience is that the fuselage rigorous modeling, design work fine, clean and beards removed after use, of course, it&#x27;s cleaning and replacement parts are also very convenient, so I recommend it to everyone, you can enjoy it, and finally I have to say German products are very strict, of course,the United States is the top row of the sale.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a 360 Complete (model 8995) when its foil was damaged in transit, as I was lead to believe the Series 7 would be an improvement. When it was new, my 360 Complete would often leave my skin feeling irritated due to the closeness of its shave, and I was actually looking forward to returning to something similar as it meant smooth skin all day long. To my dismay, my 790cc does not cut nearly as close my old Braun did. It takes multiple passes on my face and neck and still doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my 360 Complete did when it was new. Also, the pop-up trimmer is also a step back and is now borderline useless. I suspect many of the positive reviews of the Series 7 are coming from first-time customers or switchers from other brands. I&#x27;m now left to decide whether to return my new shaver to Braun since Amazon won&#x27;t accept returns on it.</li>
    <li> This razor really works! I have had other electric razors of a different brand they weren&#x27;t near the quality of this one! Such a smooth shave!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying the 7-790 shaver. I have tried several electric shavers over the years but have remained a loyal norelco rotary shaver user. Having read the reviews from previous norelco users who were very happy with the 7-790 I took the plunge. I have been using the new shaver for about 3 weeks and am very satisfied so far. The razer has a great solid feel to it and gives a very close shave. When I would not shave for 2-3 days over the weekend I usually would then shave with a blade. With the 7-790 I am able to shave after a few days growth and get a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, price was fantastic, works great. I was ordering this as a gift for my father to replace his old Braun shaver. I priced it everywhere and the best I could do was $379. I got a great deal, there was even a $40 coupon to use at check out. My father is beyond happy. It is a great shaver. The service was fast and efficient, delivered on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace my 8585 which lasted me over 8 years. For anyone else looking to do the same this is your shaver</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver since sliced bread. I never have to clean it, I never have to charge it, I never get razor burn, I get the closest shave ever from an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Not quite as close of a shave as a razor, but much better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
    <li> I had a 6 year old (or so) Series 5 razor and the 790 is way better.  It does a much better job cutting and I do not have to keep going over the thick and difficult parts of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you not pay full price. I shopped around and used a coupon from Braun to get this with tax and shipping for less than $175.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. It&#x27;s easy to use, seems to do a good job in shaving. Seems hard to clean sufficiently.</li>
    <li> Well....I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco rotary head shaver for 100 years (maybe not quite 100, but close) and this is a new world for me.  Best and closest shave since I stopped using a razor (and no nicks or cuts).  Can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.  Maybe the less expensive models would have performed very well, but this one would be impossible to beat.</li>
    <li> not as well as i thought.a little down😔</li>
    <li> I should say - really love it. Highly recommend to any man who wants (who doesn&#x27;t?) fast, clean and comfortable shaving.</li>
    <li> High Powered motor that won&#x27;t bog even with shaving a beard off. The long battery life also put a smile on my face.</li>
    <li> If you only have 2-3 days of growth, it does work fairly well. Anything more than that and you need to preshave with a close hair trimmer. Wish it would have done better in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still misses the same hair on my neck that my $39 walmart special remington missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it doesnt seem to irritate my skin as much as the remington. Do like the cleaning based which is handy.</li>
    <li> Well I did a lot of research before deciding on which shaver to invest in. I already planned on spending top dollar for a high quality shaver. I seen lots of good feedback on the Braun 790cc so i decided to take a shot. My jobs require me to be thoroughly shaved and I cannot do razors. I always suffer irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I just finished using my Braun for the 1st time. I must say it did give an awesome shave. Why a 4 star you wonder? Well first of all it did take me about 15 min or so to fully shave. I had about a weeks work of growth. My facial hair is pretty thick so that can be a factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt really comfortable. Very flexible on the face in hard to reach areas. It preformed really well. The cleaning station is awesome. Very easy to set up and function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as price. I feel like I made more for the technology behind the product and the cleaning station rather then paying for a fast efficient shave. I ended with a very smooth shave. All hairs removed. It just took some time. Not really an issue just thought it state that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your on a budget then shop around for more reasonable shavers as far as price. Although the Braun 790cc is a great pick for a shaver to give you great results. Also the sensitivity option is awesome. Set to adjust to more tuff and sensitive skin. A great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased. All I would love to be different is the price. Maybe 150-180 would be a bit more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun for the great product. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> i love the braun shaver.. the normal razors just are not for me, i can&#x27;t shave 2 days in a row with a shaver.. this is my 2nd braun shaver and i am as happy with this as with the previous one. recommended. the metal foil thing does not need as much replacement with 790 as my previous one.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the lowest maintenance of any electric shaver my husband has used.  He LOVES it.  He just lifts it out, gets a really great shave and then places it back into the holder.  The machine does the rest.  The refill with the cleaning fluid slides under the bottom and needs replacing about once a month.  The refills are becoming less expensive as this wonderful shaver becomes more popular.</li>
    <li> Based on all the positive hype, I was very excited to get this razor and try it out.  It was intended to replace my very first electric razor I received 12 years ago when I was 19.  Unfortunately I am quite disappointed and here&#x27;s why.  When shaving any area of your face, you have to push hard and continuously circle the area to cut all the hair. Even so, it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough and will leave you with course stubble.  The device has some middle blades that are supposed to cut flat lying hair, but have not worked for me.  They just do not clip the flat hairs on my neck.  I&#x27;ve had nasty razor burn on my neck since I started using this razor. I&#x27;ve tried using Lectric Shave before hand, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help. It also says I cannot return this product because it&#x27;s considered hazardous material.  Overall, my time spent shaving has doubled, while the results are far poorer than with my previous decade old, $40 electric shaver.</li>
    <li> With such sensitive skin I have always struggled to find a good shave. I used manual razors for over a decade but even the best ones still resulted in razor burn and I get acne too and the occasional in-grown hair. I also want a close shave. I tried the expensive ones and the cheap ones; nothing worked. I decided to bite the bullet and invest in this product. I absolutely love it and to me, it&#x27;s worth every penny. I shave every 1-2 days. I never get razor burn even if I put it on the close shave setting and use it on my neck. I get the close shave I want without any of the irritation I&#x27;ve been putting up with for years.</li>
    <li> I use a shaver for my head and face, and Braun&#x27;s system has never disappointed.  Faster than the Panasonic model I tried, sturdier, and the foils don&#x27;t disintegrate after 3 months.  If you are serious about shaving with electric razors, this is your shaver.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am happy with the product, but it is very difficult to get the hard to reach areas. I have to go over it at least for a minute to get every thing. My shave now takes 20 minutes, and it sometimes does not get a few pieces. I now use a combination of razor and this.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> WOW just WOW&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the top shavers i have ever used. Very close shave, WET or DRY, EZ to use. I would give 5 stars but its not as cheap as id like. &amp;#34;But i will say u get what u pay for with this shaver&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Best thing I have bought ever :) 100% recommend!!! Don&#x27;t buy without cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;And Braun Series 7 is better then Philips</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using manual razor blades all my life due to the close shave they provide. I&#x27;ve bought a few electrical shavers in the past (including the Braun 5 Series) but none seemed to work for me. Either they didn&#x27;t cut low enough or I would end up with hairs below my chin that needed a second pass with a manual razor. The Braun Series 7 has finally taken care of such problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying the smooth shave I&#x27;m getting with this machine. Took it with me on vacation to see my family and they were all surprised that I was getting such a clean, smooth shave with it. I&#x27;m loving every minute with it. It takes a little longer time to shave with it vs a manual razor but the added benefit of no irritation is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a breeze with the added dock and 18 month before replacement of foil will definitely save me a good chunk of money in the end. It&#x27;s the best Electric razor I have ever gotten because it just works with no added frustration.</li>
    <li> I buy three the shavers before for my friends as a gift,and they all like it,and this time I want buy a new one for myself,so I make a order in the website ,and it is sent quickly to my hand.But to my suprise ,the shaver is used,not a new one!The seller should point it out in the website to avoid mistakes as this.</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun electric razor I&#x27;ve had in the past 15 years.  Replaced only because the battery on my old one was dying after a long run. I was torn between getting the 5xx series and the 7xx series, but this is well worth the money. It literally mows through my beard for a great close shave.</li>
    <li> I received this electronic razor for my birthday last year. I used to hate shaving because it just took too much time. Not with this. The actual shaver feels very well built and fits comfortably in my hand. The head can pivot or can be locked into place and there are 3 settings. To my surprise, there is a trimmer you can use by sliding up the grooves above the power button to keep your sideburns at a certain length or to line up a beard, mustache, or goatee. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product very much and would highly recommend it. Less irritation, no shaving gel and the battery life is phenomenal. After a year and a half, I still haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet and the cleaning system makes this shaver so easy to maintain. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey balances with an exceptional razor.A nice clean comfortable shave. Would definitely recommend to family to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my husband&#x27;s old shaver.</li>
    <li> good machine, reliable up to certain degree, their are some new models get to market more powerful than series 7</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a v-e-r-y long time electric shaver user (30+ years) with fairly heavy beard growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros on the Braun Series 7 - 790cc:  Initially, an excellent shave.  (Though, strangely, future screen &amp; cutter block replacements never resulted in as close a shave as the original blade, but still a pretty good shave. You&#x27;ll find many similar reviews on the cutter block replacements). If I wrote this review in the first several months after purchase, it would be a 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to. This one lasted less than 2 years before the silver started flaking off the &amp;#34;shoulder&amp;#34; area of the razor and, I suspect, into the cleaning module. Now, when a new cleaning cartridge is inserted, the sides of the cutter block are coated with a thick, black, not-very-clean oily substance that must be wiped off by hand before every shave. The oil slick is reduced somewhat after about 2-3 weeks. If offered to buy an extended warranty by Square Trade or similar, strongly consider it. My last two Braun top-of-the-line models had fairly short lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous model Braun&#x27;s lasted a bit longer for me than this one before they too broke down, usually the problem being with the cleaning system malfunctioning.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months - I shave every day - and I still love using it. It still takes me multiple passes and multiple shave &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; to get a smooth face (similar to my older 75xx Braun) but when I am finished my skin is much smoother. It&#x27;s sound is a lot softer and less harsh than the old unit and it catches most or all of the clippings inside the cutter head. Cleaning unit is a very nice touch - just drop the shaver in and push a button. Congratulations to Braun on creating a fantastic machine. I cannot imagine improving this device.</li>
    <li> Braun products, as always of high quality. Shaved deep and leaves skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver recommend it to everyone who wants to look good.</li>
    <li> Gives a much closer shave than my previous Braun 8600 which was many years old, and lasted me so long that I had to buy another Braun. Feels great to hold, doesn&#x27;t use too much cleaning solution, I believe this shaver is as good as the real thing once you get your technique right.</li>
    <li> I have been using the series 7 790cc for about two months now and I can honestly say that the results from using a two bladed or even five bladed razor do not compare to the series 7.  I use the series 7 every other day and I clean it with the solution once a week, then with the brush and water the rest of the time.  It holds a charge for about two weeks of use and the shave is close each and every time. This is my first electric shaver that I have used so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to. It just reached the point where, as a black male, I was just tired of ingrown hairs.  The ingrown hairs are mostly all gone and I don&#x27;t see them coming back anytime soon. I was told by a couple of friends that this was the shaver to buy and I personally would recommend the series 7 to anybody who is a first time buyer.</li>
    <li> Great razor, replaced 10 year old Braun series 5 that I loved, but thought it was about time to update. Glad I did this is a great razor really does a great job, much better and faster than my series 5 even when it had new heads</li>
    <li> Used for two weeks.  Best shave for electric razor I have had.  Not as good as blade, but very good.  Cleaning system is very nice.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver and while the others were both awesome, this one makes them both appear lacking. I had been debating between the 790 and the 799 which were only about $60 apart, but when I found that Amazon had a $40 instant coupon for the 790 the choice was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor and not only does it gives a great and close shave, even at it&#x27;s lowest setting, it is gentle on the skin and the battery lasts for much longer than previous models, and even when it dips below half charge it doesn&#x27;t slow the blades like it would on older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went on vacation for 11 days shortly after it arrived, and although I took the cord to charge it I never actually needed to plug in it and the battery was still showing about half a charge even though I had shaved at least once a day during out trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, which is a minor issue for me but could be a larger issue for others, is that the trimmer sticks out at a 90 degree angle to the razor which makes it awkward to use, to me at least.</li>
    <li> Great.  Very close shave...</li>
    <li> a remarkable piece of shaving technology that lends the owner warm and fuzzy feelings regarding the tedium of daily facial maintenance. Bravo.</li>
    <li> Sad, that everything these days is made from plastic. I had a Braun shaver about  10 years ago that had lasted for years. As I recall it was not plastic and felt solid and heavy in my hand. It also gave the best shave I had ever experienced. This razor I just purchased is not even close to that old razor. Not worth almost 200 dollars. I feel sorry for the people that got took for 300. It&#x27;s above average money for a completely average product.</li>
    <li> Always been a blade man however the Braun Series 7-790cc has made a believer out of me. You get a very close shave without any irritation. Would highly recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking to make the switch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Series 7 since 2001, and only NOW did I have to replace it, as the battery was dying. I could have shipped it off for a new battery, but opted to buy the replacement- which is just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> One bar of the battery indicators failed. Planning one return it</li>
    <li> So far, the best shave by far!  Very happy with performance on my tough beard.  The head is easy to remove to wash clean, and&lt;br /&gt;then the shaving head goes into a cleaning solution (included) to keep it clean.  Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Does a quick and great job!</li>
    <li> I do not have much beard to work on. But still need to shave every morning. This shaver does not work well with short hair and it vibrates too much. My hands feel numbed after shaving...</li>
    <li> Have had Braun shavers for years...  This one has all the bells &amp; whistles that one expects, but  -  has a tendency to prick the face, particularly when shaving upward on the neck towards the chin.  This is quite disconcerting .</li>
    <li> THe best of the new electric razor on the market and new parts are very reasonable to purchase on line</li>
    <li> Just switching back to an electric razor. Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Very simple, very clean, good shave. Recommended to all...</li>
    <li> Easy to use with the adjustable settings on the shaver especially for sensitive skin.  Easy to clean and washable.  great.</li>
    <li> I want them to shave, so they are each getting this shaver for Christmas. Younger son had an earlier model Braun for the past four years, but was ready for a replacement. Older son is switching from one of those three-headed monsters. They are both sporadic shavers even in their mid thirties, but I think we are going to be seeing more baby smooth cheeks in the future.</li>
    <li> The experience is awesome ever I used. Seems no actions made but actually Beard disappeared. The washing system seems a little hard for beginner.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other products previously, but this one was good and met my requirements. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> First shaver I used was the Gillette Mach 3, and then it was Schick Quatro, then I got a Braun PocketGo as a gift and couldn&#x27;t go back to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point I decided that I couldn&#x27;t continue using a travel shaver forever and I was time for an upgrade so I researched which shaver to get. First decision was Braun or Panasonic. Because I was already using Braun and I trusted their manufacturing workmanship and I&#x27;ve known other people who use Braun I chose Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 series is rather pricey - at almost $200 it was breaking my budget so I waited to save up for a couple years to make sure that this wasn&#x27;t an on the whim purchase. Finally the price dropped to ~$150 with a coupon and gave me $40 Amazon credit so I made the the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the excitement after receiving the package I felt they did a great job making it a luxury item with their packaging details. The box was created to make sure that no one could repackage it to return. The product is in a plastic clear box and inside is a black cardboard box with details of the razor. Inside is styrofoam protecting the razor and its dock  as well as a travel case  and a small brush. The travel case and dock as in a plastic bag and the razor is in shrink wrap plastic. The cleaning solution is on the bottom of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a proper razor for the first time I was blown away by the difference it felt from using a travel shaver to a luxury shaver. There is absolutely no pain in shaving now. Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and the pivoting from this razor makes every angle easy. The trimmer is also a plus for sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this beast is a snap because you can easily remove the foil and wash it with water or use the dry brush. You can also throw it in the dock and push the clean button and it auto cleans the razor with an alcohol solution. The clean is loud but who&#x27;s going to stand in the bathroom all day? Also.. wouldn&#x27;t you go to work while it&#x27;s cleaning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dock is easy to set up. Just plug in the adapter and it is on. Push the lever on the side and put in the cleaning solution when it lifts up and push the dock back down and it&#x27;s ready to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom LCD is pretty great with a meter to show the battery and hygiene. I don&#x27;t know how it measures hygiene but it feeds this info back to the dock and lets you know if it needs cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that this is the top of the line Braun shaver. There are bells and whistles that aren&#x27;t necessary and shouldn&#x27;t be considered as such. For the price you will get extras but if you don&#x27;t want to spend that much and still have an amazing shave I would recommend just going with Braun Series 3 or 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example&lt;br /&gt;LCD screen vs LED?

    <li> My husband has the older version of this and was in much need of an upgrade. We can always trust Braun for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> One of the best shavers I have used. Would definitely highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality shaver.</li>
    <li> For starters, I&#x27;m in the military so I&#x27;m pretty picky about my razors as I need a nice shave everyday. As my face is very sensitive and my facial hair is coarse, I usually try and stay away from traditional shaving with blades, as it causes too much irritation.  I received this razor as an early Christmas present from my wife because she was tired of hearing me complain about my current electric not getting the job done as it use to.  I haven&#x27;t owned a recent Braun product, sticking mainly with Philips Norelco, as they got the job done for me well enough.  I just used the Braun 790cc this morning for the first time after letting it charge over night and this is what I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love:&lt;br /&gt;The 3 power settings: Intensive, Normal, and Extra Sensitive.  As stated above, irritation has been a problem for me after dry shaving, and this razor has seemed to have solved that problem.  I turned the power setting down to Normal for my face and jaw line, then swapped over to Extra Sensitive for my neck line.  Not only did this razor give me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric (comparable to a blade), but I also had zero discomfort, irritation, or redness after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display:  Nice, clear, easy to read information on the battery charge and dirtiness of your razor.  I think the placement of this display is perfect, right at the bottom of the razor so when it&#x27;s sitting in the charging station/cleaner, you have an easy view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Hair Trimmer: Not sure how many people actually use these features on electrics, but I use it everyday to trim up my sideburns and around the ears.  The trimmer on this razor works better than my previous razor by far, only requiring a quick aim and cut. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleaning station: I&#x27;ve only every had one razor before this one with a cleaning station, the Norelco Sensotouch 2D.  While that one did what it was suppose to do, the Braun station has a few extras which I like.  First being the information LEDS on the base which show you approximately how many more cleans you got left from your current solution, and the type of clean your razor requires. It&#x27;s broken down into \\&quot;programs\\&quot;, which the unit will automatically select for you.  Another feature is the Quick Clean, which allows you to press the button and have a nice quick rinse. This also omits the drying cycle. The cleaning solution also makes the razor smell like lemons, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and feel:  This razor is very ergonomic, very comfortable to hold and use.  The one thing I just hated about my Sensotouch 2d was the shape.  It was so awkward and bulky, made shaving a chore trying to keep a good grip on it.  The Braun 790cc is just outstanding in this department.  Haven&#x27;t tried it wet as of yet, but I don&#x27;t see why having slippery hands would make this razor less easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: An easy decision of 5 stars on this product.  I&#x27;m very happy my wife picked this up for me, because I probably would have gone out and eventually gotten another Philips, never knowing about this razor (not to say the 3d wouldn&#x27;t perform). The overall comfort level, smoothness of the shave, ease to hold and use, and power settings make this razor my favorite to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love:  I&#x27;m sitting here racking my brain to find some sort of flaw in this product, and thus far, I can&#x27;t. I know nothing is perfect, but for my needs and personal tastes, this razor exceeds in every category.  If I were to get real out there, I&#x27;d complain about the noise level. This razor likes to buzz, nowhere near as quiet as my 2d.  That comes with the territory though, and not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, I&#x27;m writing this review after the first shave I&#x27;ve done with it, but I don&#x27;t foresee my opinion changing.eing the information LEDS on the base which show you approximately how many more cleans you got left from your current solution, and the type of clean your razor requires.

    <li> i love it!!!Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver.!!ding ni ge fei ,xie gan duo zi,kao a !wo ri ...</li>
    <li> Let me first declare an interest: I have been using electric shavers since the early sixties: mainly Braun (probably around eight to ten), Remington (about three) and Philips (don&#x27;t start me....) My earliest Braun was a Sixtant - which I still have somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the models I have consistently found Brauns to be the best designed, have the best build quality and to give the easiest and best shave. Remingtons also provide a smooth shave but are big and clumsy to handle, and difficult to get under the nose for those last few annoying bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box the 790 cc looks well made, solid and is easy in the hand. The clean and renew unit feels a little flimsy, but with careful handling will probably last the course. The flip-out sideburn trimmer is frankly hopeless: once tried and then best forgotten. But then I have a Waal trimmer for that function, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shaver for several weeks before committing my review to \\&quot;print\\&quot;: every shaver seems to require the owner to use it for some time before performing to its best, even when one has shaved electrically for years. However, I have to say I find this one a little disappointing: for all its easy handling and - one has to say price - for me it isn&#x27;t quite up to the standard of shave of many previous models. Or, indeed, my last $25 Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does get under the nose. It does feel comfortable in the hand. Its motor sounds powerful, and doesn&#x27;t tire after a few shaves. It just doesn&#x27;t give me the really smooth finish that I was expecting from a unit which retails here in Australia for a RRP of AU$599 (which is why I got mine from Amazon...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what the three levels of shave button/indicator do - beyond changing the motor note and the pretty LED colour - escapes me; I see no discernible difference in the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling is that too much design attention has gone into the clean and renew facility at the expense of the shave itself. The cartridge system works like magic: lights show how much fluid remains, how grubby the foil is and recommend a cleaning plan. All well and good, but it would be nice if the end result was a better shave, which isn&#x27;t the case. It&#x27;s not a bad shave - don&#x27;t get me wrong on that - it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s no better than earlier models and slightly worse than some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather like the manufacturers of printers, who nowadays give them away and make a fortune on the ink refills, Braun charge heavily for the cleaning cartridges and for the all-in-one foil/cutter heads. The cartridges can easily be refilled (Google is your friend) but the head design means that you are paying a small fortune for its regular replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: will I keep this shaver? Yes, I will, but if and when it comes to replacement time I will carefully review what is then on the market..

    <li> I used to be a big fan of wet shaving, and then I joined the army and found myself having to shave every morning. Suddenly I started to get skin irritation, ingrown bumps, and my face started to get really bad. I decided to try an electric razor because I heard it would help a lot with the problems I was having plus I would save money on razor heads. Needless to say, my first experience was not a going great at all – the shaver grabbed and pulled the hair rather than giving me a clean and easy shaving experience. It never left my face feeling smooth and for some reason it always left hairs uncut. I went from shaver to shaver and just couldn’t find the right one for the job, until he recently I stumbled across the Braun Series 7 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System. I now am kicking myself that I hadn’t found it sooner – my reaction – BOY what an incredible finish it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 7 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System uses Pulsonic Technology to churn out a crazy amount of vibrations (I think it’s nearly 10,000 per minute!) to ensure more hair is caught in the working parts. On top of this, Braun’s trademarked ActiveLift system cleverly raises hair that’s flat against the skin for cutting – I think this is where my previous shavers were going wrong. This ActiveLift system works most effectively in those tedious areas such as the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s more – the Braun Series 7 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System has a further trademarked system, namely the OptiFoil, which essentially gives you that perfect finish. It works in conjunction with the Pulsonic Technology and the ActiveLift system to capture even more hair than normal and cutting hair so close to the skin. My first shave using this trio of magnificent features left me in awe – I couldn’t stop rubbing my hand over my face, to the point where I was late for work!</li>
    <li> Thanks all.&lt;br /&gt;Three days later,price down %10 or more.&lt;br /&gt;You know,&lt;br /&gt;if your have price protected..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks cctv1 .cctv2. Thanks china.</li>
    <li> Worse shaver I have owned. It is Loud and I got a lousy shave from it. I would never buy anotrher onw</li>
    <li> I am replaceing a 5 year old 3 Series and find this new one to be so superior.  Close shave, easy to use.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and it is completely comfortable. The biggest downside is the cost of the shaver and the recurring cost of the cleaning solution. But it&#x27;s probably worth it. This is my second one of these as I left one in a rental car and never saw it again.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned a Braun series 3 for almost ten years and it was finally starting to go(sounding like a Harley) so I decided to upgrade a bit..  This shaver is amazing!  I can shave against the grain with a weeks work of growth and there is ZERO tug and pull.  I always loved my old razor, but this one is light years more advanced.  Closest shave you can get with an electric, and so much more comfortable than traditional razors!</li>
    <li> Our son found this to work perfectly- his beard adapted from the start.  He is very impressed with the closeness of the shave, and will not return to using a manual razor.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband this razor for Xmas, he had been using a razor blade for years now, He suffered from dermatitis in the creases that come down from the base of the nose to the edges of his mouth, and around both sides of the nostrils which of course he didn’t shave. After the first shave with the Braun and his skin cleared up completely of the redness and scaling. He thinks the reason is because the razor actual  removes the whiskers at incredible high speed. The razor that he used before was an old 3 headed rotary type that he had for years, and used only when he traveled or needed a quick shave. The problem with it was it took for ever to shave and he had to constantly keep passing over the same area over and over which would eventually irritate the skin. Bottom line it is the best Xmas gift I have given for awhile, except of course my love.</li>
    <li> What can I say, does as advertised. My afternoon shadow doesn&#x27;t appear until much later. A very smooth and comfortable shave. I&#x27;m glad a purchased this.</li>
    <li> My son has trouble finding razors that give him a close shave without causing irritation.  This razor doesn&#x27;t disappoint- it delivers a close, clean shave with minimal effort.  He loves this razor!  Amazon was the best price around on this product.</li>
    <li> My old Braun, which I reallly enjoyed, finally gave out after many years of service (the trimmer broke). This shaver is even better. The head runs faster, and if I take the time, it gives a very, very close shave. The only downside, and minor at that, is the trimmer. On my old razor, it popped straight up above the shaving head where it was easy to see what I was trimming. On this shaver, the trimmer pops out to the front (on a hinge instead of sliding up) where it can be more difficult to see what I&#x27;m trimming, such as when trimming a mustache, because the razor body can hide the trimmer from view.</li>
    <li> good price,good design and good working,everything is perfect.even my dad is like it too,after one day he tried it.you should buy one to your self,too.</li>
    <li> i like it, it give me a fresh face, and shave clearly, you could take it travel easily, maybe you will like it</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Five Series 8985 cc and decided to upgrade to the new Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver System. I am glad I did. This shaver is the supreme shaver any man should have. It is very smooth and gentle on the skin and never pulls your hair. The result after shaving with this electric razor is outstanding. You feel reborn because your skin feels younger. This is an extraordinary product that I recommend to any man who is very serious about shaving himself perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Ako Doffou, CFA&lt;br /&gt;Stamford, CT, USA.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he HATED it. I wished that before I ordered it from Amazon, they would&#x27;ve told me that it was not eligible for return (due to being a hazard or danger when shipping back??) It was also not shipped 2-day prime, due to this, which I wish I&#x27;d have known. My husband hated the shave it gave, and said it was worse than a regular straight razor. Also, he much preferred the wet/dry capabilities and manuverability of the Philips Norelco 1250X/46 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor, which we replaced this with. I had to sell this on ebay since I could not return it and lost money on it this way - very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t owned many shavers in my life as I&#x27;ve always used the blade, but this shaver is incredible, I can&#x27;t say it shaves as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. Close enough for me to give up the razor blades, I can&#x27;t compare it to any other top shavers, but I can tell you that I&#x27;m VERY impressed.</li>
    <li> Importation of the product was complicated, but shaver is perfect for me. It filled my extectation with a soft cut</li>
    <li> After reading most reviews I decided to give this shaver a try. Extremely happy I did this shaver is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> To not disappoint myself i chose to get the best in thr market and boy was i happy i did...i dont really have much of a bush barely grass haha.just very little fine hair and this shaver is still able to give such a smooth and clean shave. Very easy to maintain and clean too. If youre looking for a electric shaver look no further</li>
    <li> I try so many shaver all of them make me alerji or dry skin. But this one i&#x27;m using one month i don&#x27;t have any problem. i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is my first electric shaver  (used barber clippers and a straight blade for the last 5 years) so i dont have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;- Very close shave(compared to my straight edge blade) not bad&lt;br /&gt;-self cleaning&lt;br /&gt;-works the same wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;-beard trimmer is excellent with lining beards, mustaches, side burns, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;-takes a while if you have a full growth(not shaving five days or more) to have a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;-self cleaning liquid replacements(to be fair i have used it about 4 times and  indicator light still says cleaning liquid is full)&lt;br /&gt;-my facial hairs are thick and it takes a few times over for it to shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it on sale in amazon about a $100 of mrp and i&#x27;d say its worth it but at full price--na,</li>
    <li> I was sent a faulty item that also had missing parts - it was obvious that it had been tampered with previously - unfortunately amazons policy is that they cannot accept a return on personal care items so I have no other choice but to return the faulty item to braun. All Amazon did was refund me 21 bucks which is meagre when the shaver is not fir for purpose - basically been sold a lemon and now feel like a lemon!</li>
    <li> good,very convenient,i like it so much.ho ho ho hi ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho</li>
    <li> No irritation on my sensitive skin. Look forward to tomorrow morning so I can massage my face with it. Buttons on the side of power button control the intensity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday because his old shaver was terrible, leaving random patches of hair all over his chin. Since he&#x27;s started using this, I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic decrease in stray hairs and he&#x27;s had much smoother skin south of his nose. Pretty good stuff!</li>
    <li> close shave and holds charge a long time.i hava a old school braun that i bought 10 years ago that still works .this braun kicks ass.i would definatly recommend this braun 7 series.</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen. This razor has got to be the worst one I have ever owned. Close shave-forget it. I have shave over an area four to six times before it is any where close and then you can still feel some stubble. I do not feel this razor is any where close to being the razor I thought I was buying.</li>
    <li> bought it for my husband as a gift. he loves it so much!it clearly bring him happiness and convenient~he said no more pain after shave and more efficiency that using shave cream~</li>
    <li> I use to think Norelco was the closest shave.  No more, hands down, this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I especially enjoy the self-cleaning and lubrication feature.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve found an electric shaver I actually intend to use regularly.  I&#x27;ve stuck with using blades for decades because the electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried in the past simply didn&#x27;t do the job as I wanted it done - but this one does.</li>
    <li> Great electice shaver, I&#x27;ve had several over the years, this is the best</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver I have purchased in approx. 15 years. Shaver gives a very clean shave and is easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Braun shaver with a cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;EVERY ONE ends up breaking. This one is not even a year old yet and&lt;br /&gt;already the unit leaks fluid. The little ring that holds the cartridge in always pops off.&lt;br /&gt;I put it back on but it still always leaks fluid now. I have to keep the system in a plastic container&lt;br /&gt;to catch the leaking fluid. These units are not cheap and this is my 4th experience with Braun and&lt;br /&gt;all 4 have never lasted very long. The system ends up just being a charger and the cleaner part ends&lt;br /&gt;up not working. From now on, I&#x27;m just going to buy the shaver and skip the cleaner system.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pain to box this thing up and ship it back for repair. How do you charge the shaver then?&lt;br /&gt;The concept of this is great but the performance is not.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. My husband uses it daily to shave his head. He never had an electric shaver before and contemplated getting a braun. I took the chance and got it for him for father&#x27;s day. So easy and quick to use and he loves this shaver. Great price on prime also.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by a friend and all I have is praise for this device. For something you use every day, go for a nice model and you will not regret it. I clean it every day and it is fresh for the next time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the solution has been used up, be sure to clean out the part where the razor sits. There will be some stuff in there you will want to clean out before putting in a new cartridge.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this and I hated it. It took up so much room on our bathroom counter AND it was noisy (while it self-cleaned). It would self clean randomly at all hours of the day. I could not stand this thing! I did not say anything to my husband about how annoying it was because if he liked it, it was worth it. However, I asked him if he liked the shaves he was getting with it, and he said NO! The razor was about as good as his last $30 razor. This razor is total junk!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shaver. The only reason I did not give it the 5 starts is the docking station. I use dot own a previous model 5 series. When you placed the shaver inside the docking station, it fitted right in. In this model, you nee dot push it in, it will not slide on its on. It appears a small nonsense, but it is a flaw in German engineering. The shaver itself works great.</li>
    <li> In my opinion I might say that the Braun 7- 790cc pulsonic is the closest electric shave that is out there not just that but it&#x27;s also very sensitive to your skin!</li>
    <li> Even though the razor head has a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; on it, the lock doesn&#x27;t work.  As a result the head flips back and forth missing beard growth on curved surfaces unless you (awkwardly) hold your thumb against the razor head while shaving.  I returned the razor for a replacement, but the replacement has the same flaw -- a lock that does not lock!  The redesign of the lock would be quite simple, so it&#x27;s difficult to understand why Braun appears unable to fix this problem.</li>
    <li> love this shaver, the best</li>
    <li> I really expected more from this new model but my old braun model 8000 series  still perform about the same as this new model.  I will sugges just replace your old braun shaver with new foil and cutter and save yourself from getting this new model with the optifoil.  if you have to purchase a new shaver i will suggest buy the new 8000 series with the optifoil foil and cutter .  big disappointment i expected more from this model.</li>
    <li> No other electric razor have given me a such a close shave as this one. I had a top of the line Philips before this, but the shave wasn&#x27;t even close to what I get from this and it lasted about three years. I&#x27;ve used this now for about two and a half year, changed cassette once, cleans it every other day, and it&#x27;s still awesome. I brought the charger when I went for a one month trip, but I could have saved me that extra hassle. When I returned home, I still had plenty of battery left. I will have this until it quits working on me, then I&#x27;ll buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I should begin by saying I am a lady. I have previously used a ladies electric shaver but have never been really happy with the closeness of the shave (legs). The Braun shaves my legs and underarms equally well. There is no irritation and I get a close shave.</li>
    <li> gives a very good shave and the self cleaning mechanism keep it fresh and smelling great.  Best electric razor i have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shaver and my husband loves it!  It even cleans itself!  :)  Not cheap, but well worth the money and received it quickly!</li>
    <li> I had another Braun shaver for many years and was quite satisfied.  HOWEVER --- my new shaver has exceeded my expectations greatly.  I love the close shave feeling and I expect to have this shaver for many, many years to come.  For me, it was worth every cent of the purchase price !</li>
    <li> This Braun replaced one I had over 20 years !! This is the best shaver out there and selecting the right depth helps sensitive skin like mine. The cartidges are pricy, but you can buy refill solution. Also, they have improved the shaver because you can choose when to clean it, since it is not automatic when needed. I had purchased a Norelco befor this and it tore up my skin so much I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor.  Cleans easily.  The auto cleaner works great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy lots of the cleaning cartridges on Amazon, they&#x27;re quite cheap here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the flip up trimmer for a few days of growth, and make another quick pass with the main razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt cut the hairs quite short enough to get ingrown hairs, and slices them properly to boot.  Provides the perfect balance. No more razor burn, but still a pretty close shave!</li>
    <li> Good shave but do not get close to a mustache.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is in a pitiful location making it impossible to see at times. I hope you didn&#x27;t pay the person that designed it much and hope that he/she will not be involved in future designs.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor maintains it&#x27;s charge cleaning. Unit is a bit bulky.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the sea of 5-star reviews. I don&#x27;t have much to add, only that all those 5-star reviews were right. This razor is great.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I have no complaints and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco.  The head chattered and pulled my hair, so I replaced it and that solved the problem.  After 1.5 years of use, I have switched back to a conventional razor.  This unit can&#x27;t work around facial hair, can&#x27;t shave my upper lip properly, can&#x27;t trim sideburns properly, and saves no time over a razor as you have to shave the same spots over and over and still the shave is not that close&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is far superior, a Gillette razor is better still.&lt;br /&gt;BTW the Braun beard trimmer is a good product and I am ver satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 other electric razors. This is the best so far. I get the closest shaves in all the areas i had problems with previously.</li>
    <li> After about 6 years using Philips Norelco, I moved to this model (Braun 790cc) and what a difference it made in my daily shaving life. This is a much superior product. You can feel it as soon as you hold it in your hand and the shaving is super clean, no chafing of skin whatsoever. The self-cleaning feature is also really cool. I debated whether to go for it or not but ultimately went for it and that was the right call. Not only you get to enjoy a clean shaver in your hand everyday but also the self-cleaning helps to extend the life of the shaver in long run. Like somebody else had said, just throw the dross out manually by lightly tapping before putting in the stand to clean it. That way the cleaning solution lasts longer. Go for this model, you won&#x27;t regret it. I waited too long to change and the suffering with Norelco was not worth it.</li>
    <li> The shaver is good , my husband loves it...but I noticed that the price reduced just few days after my purchasement...</li>
    <li> Closer shave and more comfortable than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried.  Follows the contours of the face well.  Shave would not be confused with a good Gillette blade for closeness, but it is convenient.  Now here&#x27;s the down side.  It worked well for the first year.  After 1 year, it got much noisier and ran rougher.  After 3 years, it ground to a halt.  Don&#x27;t confuse this with the good German workmanship that the name used to imply.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this and said he can totally tell the quality of the shave. I think it&#x27;s one of the best thing a man can have.</li>
    <li> Very close shave . Simple operation very convenient. I love all features. The close shave stems from engineering accomplishments and speed of operation.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. This is the second Braun I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;m not going back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, easy to use, you can clean it easily, comfortable etc. The only thing is that it didn&#x27;t give a super close shave like a straight edge razor but close</li>
    <li> I have been using a $45 Norelco for 2 years. Pretty good.  I wanted to splurge and treat myself to a higher-end shaver.  The results: my $45 Norelco is 300% better than the expensive,so called higher-end Braun!!  Why??  I had to continuously finish places where the Braun didn&#x27;t touch!  Yes, the Braun shaved close - BUT ONLY IN PLACES!!  The $45 Norelco is damn better at lose shaving my ENTIRE face!!  I&#x27;m returning the Braun after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using an older Braun shaver, and the 790cc is an improvement . I don&#x27;t give it five stars because the pop up trimmer is a little awkward to use. Overall, a nice shaver.</li>
    <li> SHAVES ME BETTER THAN ITS WELL ADVERTIZED COMPETOR</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job!</li>
    <li> The best razor ever. I always broke out, no mater what razor I used. Electronic or not. Have had this razor for over a year and are just now ordering new replacement cassette for it. I use it dry and clean it once a week, shaving 5 times a week and have had no problems with it or any irritated skin since I have been using it. Awesome product and well worth the money!! Would give 10 stars.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this shaver.  I am unable to get razors right now and this was the best alternative.  I&#x27;m liking it so much more because there isn&#x27;t any mess to clean up and it saves me money on buying razors every month.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like, thank you</li>
    <li> I think that the cleaning station is unnecessary, and wish I had opted for just the shaver and case itself...but all-in-all, the deal was great, and the shaver performance, charge, and blade movement is wonderful. I agree with previous reviews, that the flip-up trimmer is not as easy to maneuver, however, due to the length and width of the shaver piece that flips up. Still, very pleased with this shaver performance.</li>
    <li> After one month of use i can say it is the worst shaver system i ever had,Shave head becomes unbearably hot after 10 minutes of use.This razor did a worse job than my 10+ year razor. No matter how hard I pressed the razor, or increased the &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; button, there was still stubble left.In addition to taking longer to shave AND leaving way too much hair on my face, I started seeing bumps. Big nasty ugly bumps which I was trying to avoid in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;DONT Buy THIS ITEM NEVER!!!,  TRY SOMETHING ELSE</li>
    <li> Not the best shave in the world.  I spend more time then I would lathering up.  Right now it takes about 3-7 minutes to shave each day.&lt;br /&gt;At least it cleans itself.  This is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for about a month and my routine is to shave once a day and then go over it with a razor every 3 to 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I have never been a fan of electric shaving gear so maybe I expect too much?</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about 4 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong! I change the razor head about once every 12-18 months and it gives me a super close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing i do to get a great shave every time is buy a cheap bottle of Lectric Shave, which is an electric shaver preshave that stands up your whiskers for an easy and super close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a few other major brands in the past and this one has been my favorite out of all of them. The self cleaning mode is a godsend and really does a good job of keeping it clean. The razor has different sensitivity modes and the foil shaver head cuts very close with no razor burn or cuts. The side burn trimmer pops right out and does a great job of evening out sideburns and trimming them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a lot to spend on a razor, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for something that you&#x27;ll use every day as a staple of your getting ready process. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Happily, is gives me a closer and smoother shave in comparison with Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Using the self cleaning method, however, registers three lights.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning with hot water is the same.&lt;br /&gt;Hygiene level is one bar using either method.&lt;br /&gt;Either I have a defective shaver or it really doesn&#x27;t make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Great battery life and close shave!</li>
    <li> Good products were purchased inexpensively.</li>
    <li> improved accessories e.g cleaner fluid ;Same old shave!&lt;br /&gt;Bites longer hairs</li>
    <li> I finally retired my old Norelco shaver and bought the Braun Series 7 based on review and the cleaning system.  The problem is it just doesn&#x27;t shave very well. It takes twice the time to shave verses the Norelco and I still don&#x27;t have a very close shave.  Quite honestly I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the speed this thing shaves and also the closeness.  Would buy again, but then again in 10 years something else will be on the market :)</li>
    <li> I rarely review any products, but this was BY FAR the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had so I thought I&#x27;d pass the word on. The Braun replaces my 5 year old rotary shaver that I was never really happy with (each shave would take about 15 minutes, the stubborn hairs under my chin and into the neck area required many passes through). I was a little uncertain about getting a shaver this expensive but wow was it worth it, this baby only takes like 5 mins and is definitely a lot easier to use. It got the hairs under the chin quite easily which is the first shaver I&#x27;ve had do that. Highly recommend for anyone looking to upgrade from an older electric.</li>
    <li> My husband really liked this gift.  Nice clean shave too.  Automatic cleaning seems to be working well too.  It&#x27;s only been a few weeks so can&#x27;t comment on how well it holds up.</li>
    <li> This shaver is good but I bought it because some reviews said it was great for shaving your head with.  Unfortunately I found this to be incorrect.  While it does shave my head, and cuts really close, it takes longer than it would to just use a blade.  I have to go over the same spots numerous times to get that smooth feeling.  I also have a goatee and I cant get the shaver to get close enough to it in order to have a nice, clean cut look.</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave.  Cleaning station does a perfect job of keeping the razor fresh.  Only down side is trimmer is a little odd</li>
    <li> I owned a series 5 for years.  So, when it finally came time to replace the cutters, I opted to upgrade.  I read all the reviews and then bought one.  I must say that I was overwhelmed by the performance of this model.  It shaves as close as a blade.  It blows the series five out of the water!!  The only thing I would change is the pop up trimmer. I really don&#x27;t care for the position its located in. Maybe I just got used to the old one, only time will tell.  But, I think that the series 7 is the best electric shaver i&#x27; ever owned!!ve</li>
    <li> This will pay for itself over the course of a year. Gives a great shave, not quite as close as a blade, but close enough. The cleaning base and ability to replace the cartridge ensure that this will perform at a high level for years to come - my Braun tooth brush is going strong after 10 years - I expect to still be using this shaver 10 years from now.</li>
    <li> After wasting money on three other shavers that were of poor performance, I finally found this one that is outstanding. I would highly recommend the Braun series 7.</li>
    <li> Good value price rate. Germany made. The price here is just one fifth of the price in China. Great choice!</li>
    <li> Almost as good as a razor, easy to use, no razor burn or discomfort&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;Nice cleaning system</li>
    <li> I previously owned a predecessor to the Braun Series 7.  It worked well, but I purchased a Panasonic after three years, thinking that the Panasonic may be superior.  In fact, it worked no better than the old Braun, and the Panasonic was louder and its cleaning cycle was longer and louder than the Braun&#x27;s.  When the Panasonic cleaning unit died after about two years, I went back to the Braun.  Its performance is excellent, and it is far less noisy than the Panasonic.  I also expect the Braun to last much longer.  Added bonus: The cleaning cartridge is the same as the old Braun&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> have purchased other models of braun shavers before and have been very satisfied. this one had the most features of any that i have purhased before. the price on this website was better than the others i had checked. this brand works well and i would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well.  Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from husband.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Braun shavers for the past 20 years, and I&#x27;ve personally watched the incremental improvements with each successive generation of technology. The battery in my 9 year old series 5 recently decided to stop working. Internet research revealed that the battery is super-glued to the circuit board, making replacement impossible -- which really pisses me off. Nevertheless, I reluctantly bought another shaver, as there was absolutely nothing wrong with my old one. The cleaning feature works as before (and uses the same cartridges) with 2 differences: the cleaning process now ends with a heated drying cycle, and allows for a quick clean, bypassing the heated drying (the majority of the cleaning cycle). The shaver, however, is quite different from the previous designs. The body of the unit is a sculpted/circular shape, unlike the rectangular bodies before -- similar to the rotary shavers. It feels very comfortable in the hand, and is easy to grip due to the textured material on the sides of the body. It has a very substantial feel, and a good weight and balance to it. The pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t extend up vertically, but rotates up from the front of the body. The foil and cutter block are now integrated into 1 unit called a cartridge, and can&#x27;t be manually taken apart if you want to clean them by hand. How does it shave? It shaves twice as close as my old series 5 did when the foil and cutter were brand new. I would dare to say that it shaves almost as close as a blade. -- and this is the first electric shaver that I would say that about. The shaver reeks of quality -- both in design and construction. The noise and vibration are similar to my old series 5, which is fine with me. I was never bothered by either, although some other folks here feel different. If you need a new shaver, I would give this one a close look. I was lucky and got an instant $40 rebate, which made this a no-brainer. I will mention that I was also looking at wet/dry shavers by Braun and Panasonic. The reason that I didn&#x27;t go with those (everyone unanimously agrees that the shave is better and closer when done wet with gel than dry) is due to the fact that those models can&#x27;t be run off a cord if the battery dies, for safety reasons. When you&#x27;re on the road, or if the battery goes, you&#x27;ll be without a working shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update 7/22/2014 **&lt;br /&gt;This shaver continues to impress after 1 month. Every shave has the same closeness. This machine really does shave as close as a blade -- no joke. The cleaning function works even better than before. I don&#x27;t bother with a preliminary manual cleaning before running a cleaning cycle, as I always did with my old series 5. It kills me to spend so much money on a new shaver, but this thing really does shave like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** update 11/08/2014 **&lt;br /&gt;The best shave I ever had. Every time I use this machine I find myself murmuring \\&quot;this is an amazing shave\\&quot;. Shaving time is now cut in half due to not needing to reshave previous areas as much. Blades and cutter seem to be holding a good edge with use. The cleaning fucntionality works really well. Nice.un and Panasonic.

    <li> I bought this for my husband.  It was very expensive.  He says it does not perform any better or shave any closer than his much older and simpler model of Braun electric.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> so good.I wil be back.</li>
    <li> I am bald and shave my head and face every other day.  This razor gives a pretty close shave in a short amount of time.  I would advise anyone that uses it as much as I do to change blades every 3 months or so instead of the recommended 6 as it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Very short and simple:  This shaver has a fair shave, not anywhere even close to my Philips 1280x/42.  The Philips cuts much better especially when I haven&#x27;t shaved for a number of days.  With the Braun, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get all of the hairs to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Braun less than 15 times and the part that locks the head in place broke off.  Now I can&#x27;t lock out the head from pivoting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still under warranty, so I called Braun  customer service.  They gave me the number for their factory service center in Massachusetts.  I called the Braun service center and spoke to what sounded like some teenage girl.  She had an attitude and really didn&#x27;t portray a feeling of care or concern about my issue.  I eventually got all the information that I needed to ship the 790c in for service.  We shall see.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy a Braun brand again.</li>
    <li> He states his shaver has a use of ease and he shaves in less time then other shavers he has used.  The cleaning process is amazing.  I enjoy watching this also.  The shave itself is so good his face and neck feel like silk.  There has been no irritation from shaving with this shaver.  He says he is more than satisfied and looks forward to his next shave.</li>
    <li> Most expensive in Braun Series, really worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it a lot. Good gift for father as well.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and value for money</li>
    <li> One of the best shavers I have ever owned.  Shaves very close without razor burn.  Heck, even my wife immediately noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have had from an electric, but it takes me longer to shave in the morning than my last electric. I have to go over certain areas more than once</li>
    <li> excellent quality and performance</li>
    <li> It does excactly what it is supposed to do.  It works great both ways dry or wet.  The cleaning system is great,  it cleans it up pretty well and leaves with fresh smell.  I wish it could clean the same way with wanter refill too.  Those catridges are not cheap!!!</li>
    <li> A little loud but all Braun &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; shavers have this going against them.  Shaves really well, but still doesn&#x27;t hit those areas that all electric razors don&#x27;t get to.  The cleaning cycle takes a tad too long, but this feature is really nice!!  If you are planning to shave and pack your bags, allow for about an hour to complete.&lt;br /&gt;Braun is a class leader in this area and these last a long time.  In fact, my old Braun shaver was getting close to 8 years old when I replaced it.  No issues with it, I just wanted something newer and with the cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> Much better than Norelco. Smoother shave and closer. Give it five stars. Handy carrying case that is very useful. powerful motor . recommend to all.</li>
    <li> Been buying electric shavers Norelco/Braun, back and forth for years, plus I use a blade. Even tho this is pricey I find it the best shaving solution next to a blade. No more flipping flopping sticking with Braun, worth the money</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun 790-CC now for about 6 months. It is the best shaver I have ever owned. I love the close shave that it gives, although no electric shaver can match a razor. That being said, It is probably the closest shave you will ever get from an electric shaver. It has a good feel to it. Smart shape. Well designed. It took me a little bit to get use to the flip-up side burn cutter but it works very well. My favorite thing about the shaver is the automatic self-cleaning. Shave, slide it into the cleaner, push the button, forget it. Done. Cleaned and ready for the next shave. Sometimes I run it under the fauset to wash out the head before putting it back into the self-cleaner... especially if I had a two or three-day beard. No matter, it shave the same and cleans the same. Love it. I&#x27;m on my second cleaning fluid refill. This after 6 months. I don&#x27;t consider that too bad. I have a light beard and shave ever day except once in a great while. You may use more fluid if you have a heavy beard and it takes you a little longer to shave. I recommend also buying a 4 pack cleaning fluid refill kit. Not a bad price and will last... my guess is about a year. I was a little concerned about the cost of the refills but now that I have the shaver and have used it for a while, the convenience of the self-cleaning unit has completely out-weighed my concerns about the refill cost. But thats me. I figure... you do this every day for the rest of your life. Make it a pleasant experience... and it is. I&#x27;m so glad now that I shelled out the money for the best. I thank Braun and Irish engineering for making a great product.</li>
    <li> My old Braun was out of order, so I bought it. After a few weeks I think it is as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> Have used braun shavers for many years, but decided to upgrade to the latest version. Still a superb shave and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older braun with this model.  One word &amp;#34;outstanding&amp;#34;  I even think it uses less cleaning product than my older model.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun for 5 years but the cleaning process stopped working. The new shaver is fabulous. It gives a great shave, much better then my older model. I would recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> it  is easy to operate.very nice.i love it very much.so light and the color is my best love.good Braun 790cc.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in a long time. I got this for those times when I want to do a quick touchup. I still swear by a blade but this does a very good job. It comes in handy when I am going somewhere and I don&#x27;t have time to deal with a nick. You know. That time when you forgot you put that little piece of toilet paper on that cut. This shaver has come a long way from the last one that I had. I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in probably 20 years so I have nothing to compare it to but I like this one.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for 3 different models and over many years--This shaver is the best one of them all!! Great new features and the availability to set different types of sensitivity is awesome !!</li>
    <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the 3 series and i like the trimmer a lot better when it slides up on the 3. However the cleaning system is great which makes the whole product worth it. Definitely recommend if you want a shaver with a cleaning system as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple norelco electric razors and haven&#x27;t been terribly impressed with the closeness of the shave, so I thought I&#x27;d spend a bit more money to try this higher end razor 3 weeks ago.  I have not been disappointed!  This razor provides me a shave that rivals my old shaving days with a manual razor but no irritation.  The only negative I can give to this is that when you clean it it can be a bit noisy, but just leave it uncleaned for the day after a morning shave and press the button to clean when you get home from work in the evening if you don&#x27;t want to bother your wife with the noise in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hands-down the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor!</li>
    <li> The shaver is well built and should last for years.  However, I don&#x27;t know that I will have the patience to use it for years.  I do not have a tough difficult beard, yet it does a very poor job of shaving and often completely misses hairs.  I have to inspect very closely and do multiple passes to get any kind of decent shave.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s product is really good and works well!!~  I have bought it as a gift for my dad, and he like it very much!!~</li>
    <li> I love this Razor, I had one of the earlier versions for years and years ........Maintained, as directions stated and switched out the cutters as noted. So, I decided to buy the latest and greatest  ............ I noticed something very weird, TECHNOLOGY DOES EVOLVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for the best price and found it here,this is the best shaver money can buy I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really gentle on your skin. Recommended for those who have sensitive skin but I expected more from this best seller, it leaves some stubble.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It cleans its self, and cuts great! Im completely happy with this product. I got one for my dad too!</li>
    <li> The cleaning pod has actually gone longer than I thought it would too. All the reviews say the blade goes for about a year or so. I&#x27;m very pleased with it, and hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> have had this for a year. I had a phillips and a panasonic shaver previously. This one shaves well but  not that much differently. The only positive is that the shave is FAST&amp;#62; I can be done  in 5 minutes. Average clean shave as far as electric shavers go. Cleans really well with its pulsonic system. No complaints thus far...</li>
    <li> Does not provide the close shave I expected from the highly rated shaver. Previously used safety razor and now unable to do so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Series 7-790 now for close to 8 months and am extremely satisfied with it. I&#x27;ve got a pretty thick beard and while I&#x27;ve withed for the convenience of an electric--especially when traveling--I never found one that would give anywhere near the closeness of a blade. The Braun 790 changed all of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like that it sits in its own charge stand after use, and then both cleans and re-charges the razor. It always comes out smelling fresh and it seems to remain sharp. Braun says to change the cutting blades every 18 months or so. In the 8 months I&#x27;ve been using it, I have noticed no loss of sharpness. The cleaning cartridges can also be bought on Amazon.com at a pretty steep discount--making daily cleaning affordable and simple. I&#x27;d recommend buying a 4-box at the same time you get the razor. I only wish I had tried this electric earlier. I don&#x27;t ever see going back to blades.</li>
    <li> My 8595 finally died after 7 years of distinguished service. To replace it, I first tried a Series 5. I was not happy with the shave: it was not close enough and as I tried to make it closer my skin got really irritated. Then tried the Series 7 and am very pleased with its performance. The shave was very smooth and comfortable. The design is very ergonomic and fits very well in the hand. Charge and cleaning times are also quite good. Can shave 5-10 times on a single charge with little reduction in power.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on line. I never had an electric shaver and I wanted the best one even if it costed more. Braun Series 7 had the most favorable comments. I am using the shaver. I still do not know much about it but I have seen the shave is average. The battery is last longing.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my husband - he loves braun razors and needed an upgrade and this fit the bill.  We have had this for over a year now and NO complaints- worth every penney</li>
    <li> I have used Braun Shavers for a good number of years. I purchased this one after my eight year old Braun just plain wore out. Frankly I am disappointed by this razor. In my opinion it does not give as close a shave as any of the previous Brauns I have owned. It takes quite a bit of time to get a clean shave on my neck and chin. Perhaps my beard is getting tougher as I age? No, this razor does not live up to the Braun reputation and in my opinion really not worth the price. Really not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I decided to switch over to an electric shaver after shaving with gillette razors my whole life, and I am very happy with this. It gives me a surprisingly close shave, which I didnt expect from an electric razor. The cleaning system is nice and easy to use. The razor is very comfortable to use and my face feels much more comfortable compared to using a razor. I did a lot of research on electric razors, and just decided to get this one since it looks to be the best shaver on the market, and I am very happy with my decision. This is worth the money if youre looking for a great shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a verygood shaver!</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Will shave both very short stubble and longer. Gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the series so far.</li>
    <li> Once again Braun improves over a prior model.  This one cuts even closer than my last one that lasted over 6 yrs.  In fact, old razor still works, but the base finally shot craps.  With sale price of this one, it was not much more to buy this one and get new warranty.  Unfortunately, this one has different contact location and a revised power cord so none of my old cords will work with it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  but didnt want to take a chance and returned it to get the next level up which is fully waterproof</li>
    <li> my boyfriend say good</li>
    <li> This shaver met my expectations.  It gives a close shave, fast, which saves me time.  But it is pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> I never ordered this!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it a month and am very satisfied with it.  This is my second Braun shaver system.</li>
    <li> Quality is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun shaver before, but this model shaves faster, closer &amp; has better features.  My face hasn&#x27;t looked &amp; felt this good in a while.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, the closes shave your going to get with an electric razor. Feels comfortable very little pull hardly any at all. Usually with the cheaper models it usually tugs and pulls on your hair but not this one here. The build quality of this is very nice, the razor has a little weight to it and is definitely not cheaply made. This is a good razor especially for the price that it&#x27;s currently selling for.</li>
    <li> Great！Dad like it. It‘s easy to use and clean. And the Shaver is apply to the people who have to much beard, like my deal dad.lol</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been very good.</li>
    <li> Great shaver - the hubby loves it!  It doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as a razor shave does, but he is overall very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for many years,  and this one is the best yet. It shaves as close as a blade razor. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Great shave, cleans easily...I liked my old Braun, I love this one.</li>
    <li> I had an old rotary shaver before and it worked fine for about ten years.&lt;br /&gt;With this shaver I find the hair removal is more efficient it and takes about half of the strokes of the old rotary.&lt;br /&gt;The auxiliary blade works well&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the recurring cost of cleaning cartridges,  after a few months I realize they work well and seem to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using my original cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy!</li>
    <li> This razor is even better than my old Braun. Gives me a much closer shave than even a regular razor. Very happy with it and hope it lasts as long as my old one.</li>
    <li> My man is thrilled with this shaving system</li>
    <li> Very pretty and useful.i like this one</li>
    <li> Shaves close and smooth.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband. He would always get sore spots on his neck after shaving with other razors. We have tried a lot of different other razor brands. After the first few shave with this razor, he never gets sore spots! It works amazing. I also like that is has a self cleaning feature. The only downside is you have to keep buying the cleaning cartridges, but they lasted us about 6 months and they aren&#x27;t too expensive. A great razor!</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Best cut of any I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, works great. The best shaver I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 7 shaver for several days now and each time I use it I am more impressed with the closeness of the shave.  The automatic cleaning system is amazing.  No more brushing and blowing out whisker stubble from the blades and foil.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using electric razors for 38 years and this is the best. Closest shave and most comfortable. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Like all of my previous Braun shavers, this 790 performs great-- shaves close and is very reliable. It was delivered several days ahead of schedule and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have 3 Braun shavers that I have used over the years.  This one is the most expensive and the best for a fast and close shave. It also does an excellent job on the corners of the nose and mouth, something none of my previous shavers were good at.  I highly recommend it for power shaver users.</li>
    <li> Used daily to shave face and head with great results.  Tried Norelco and the Series 7 Braun far outperforms it</li>
    <li> Nice Features But Poorer Cut Due To Different Head &amp; Cutter</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my prior Braun did. Seems to need a lot of maintenance time in the&lt;br /&gt;cleaner, and I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard at all.</li>
    <li> Top of the line electric shaver. Gave it 4 stars simply because I still have issues on my neck. Can&#x27;t get all the hairs, slight irritation, but I have sensitive skin. A little pricey too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money! Rub your face raw trying to get close shave around neck area!</li>
    <li> After nearly 50 years of shaving I purchased a Braun Series 7. I have used cheaper electric shavers ($50 to $70 range) for many years and never really had any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest $70 shaver stared falling apart recently after 5 years of loyal service, so as I was looking/reviewing the current models of electric shavers, the Braun Series 7 was consistently rated near the top. As a side note, I have tried rotary type electric shavers in the past and found they didn&#x27;t work for me so I decided to stick with a foil type shaver (every person is different in that respect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Braun for a couple of months now. Overall, I like the Braun shaving experience just fine. Does it shave as close as its cheaper competitors? For me, the answer is no. But It does a great job on a two to three day growth of beard, doesn&#x27;t irritate my face during and after shaving and I have gotten used to/learned to like the cleaning and charging system. In fact without the cleaning system I believe the Braun Series 7 shaver would become pedestrian, at best, in a short time because of the rather complex shaving head assembly, which is impossible to clean thoroughly with only a brush etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot of money to pay for an electric shaver and I&#x27;m not sure it is money well spent just yet. How long it lasts/holds up to daily use, how often I have to replace shaving head assemblies and replace cleaning kits will ultimately determine if it was a good purchase or not.</li>
    <li> My old Braun Razor lasted about 15 years, and I hated to see it go, but this Series 7 is even better.  I highly recommend it, for both quality and longevityl</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love, I&#x27;m a female not a guy by the way lol. Yes, females should definitely get this! It is such a close shave and no razor burns or cuts or pain or pulling, or shaving cream or after shave, just really, really, really close shaving and smooth skin. Definitely worth the money. I have very sensitive skin which gets cut easily by razors and other electric razors but his Braun.....WOW :) lol. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it :)</li>
    <li> it works great only thing i will say it gets to hot or i would have given it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I lost my first one traveling and bought it a second time. Awesome product but I hate having to keep buying cleaning cartridges</li>
    <li> One of the best electric shavers I have used.  The automatic cleaning system does a great job.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Decent shave for an electric shaver. Easy to maintain and clean.</li>
    <li> Handles any growth of beard gently and thoroughly. Sensitive skin loves this razor.</li>
    <li> Was initially skeptical about the cleaning system that comes with the shaver but found it very useful. The battery life on the shaver is great and the shaving itself is very comfortable. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit pissed off since Braun changed screens.  The old one was amazing. I actually still have it and swapped out the new one for it.  HUGE difference.  I&#x27;m going to cry when it goes.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a replacement for my old Braun shaver of 5 years.  It was on the high end of price, but the quality shave is worth the money.  The flip up shaver works great on my ears and sideburns.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The product does and excellent job of giving a close, comfortable shave. The self-cleaning feature is excellent and provides a sense of shaving with a new razor at every shave.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and have been shaving with a blade for the last 50 some years. I purchased 2 other electric razors in the last couple of years but none offered the feeling of even a marginal shave. Then I got this. While it does not replace a blade, it doesn&#x27;t take the same amount of time that shaving with a blade does nor do I cut myself as often. It is an acceptable compromise. Recommended without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I received the shaver as a gift and now&lt;br /&gt;I can retire my thirty five year old&lt;br /&gt;Remington shaver.&lt;br /&gt;My goal now is to live long enough to&lt;br /&gt;retire my Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daddy.He said the shaver convenient to use and clear. It is an happy shopping trip.</li>
    <li> I like my shaver very much for an electric shaver.  I use it mostly when I travel for the convenience but when I want a really close shave, it is back to my old and trusted wet razor.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, the only disadvantage is expensive solution to clean it and the solution used up quickly. Hence 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I have an interesting story to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a Remington, a Norelco, a Panasonic, and 2 Brauns -- this series 7 and a series 3. You can see my review of the earlier shavers here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LX6UQLJZ5JCP/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0021AG0Z6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all that I saw the Braun series 3 390cc on sale cheap, so I got it. See my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RE663YC47H4M9/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001VEK1E4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I liked my series 3 so much, I decided to splurge and get the series 7 790cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, after using the 790cc for 2 months, I&#x27;m going back to the 390cc. I think it gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 790cc DOES have a pivoting head, and does have the vibration, but the fact is that the 390cc still gives me a better --  i.e., closer, more complete, less time -- shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised, but that&#x27;s the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my advice is, save some money and buy the quieter 390cc.</li>
    <li> cuts facial hair much better than any other razor I have tried!</li>
    <li> second Series 7, other reviews are spot on.  the cartridges can get expensive if you don&#x27;t use it everyday.  Because they are alcohol based they evaporate in about a month even with out use and you can only use about 70% of the cleaning solution before the shaver registers the cartridge as empty.  if you leave it for more than a week its work opening it and putting the top on the cleaning cartridge to stop the evaporation.</li>
    <li> This is a major improvement over having to shave with a razor every day. I can do a good no shaving with this in about 2 minutes instead of about ten for the razor.&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a razor that you should use daily, it doesn&#x27;t do well with facial hair once it gets long (that is a feature of foil shavers ,not just this one. Go rotary if you don&#x27;t shave daily).&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning is nice, and the little canisters of cleaner last for about two months or maybe 6 weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;In all, it is a worthwhile upgrade for someone who has to shave every day.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband as an anniversary gift.  He has been undergoing chemo for cancer and radiation.  Therefore he is weak and was told to not cut himself or nick himself while shaving, because of the bleeding it could cause.  He loves this shaver, and I do also.  He uses it, puts it back into the holder and whenever I think of it, I check to see if it needs cleaning.  If it does (because it will show up on the end of the shaver), I just push a button, and it does the rest of the work.  Great thing to have...</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second Braun electric razor. He loved his older model &amp; I was hoping this would be as good. He loves this one and told me he couldn&#x27;t believe it was even better than his old one. A very happy wife &amp; hubby!</li>
    <li> If you use electric shavers Braun makes the best. This shaver gets really close and the cleaner makes it feel new every time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very so cool!MY friend see it so happy.It&#x27;s a surprise and  cheaper than in china.</li>
    <li> This is my second base/shaver that I have purchased. The first one lasted several years but the base eventually started malfunctioning so we went back to just a cheapy electric razor for a while. After 3 or 4 of them not doing a good job I forked out the money and went back to the one that gave my husband the closest shave. Now I just need to figure out how to incorporate a set of glasses into the set so he can see well enough not to miss spots, lol.</li>
    <li> too good to be true! I didn&#x27;t know that brau would shave better than a disposible. It&#x27;s really a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Not as good as other Braun shavers I have had in the past. It does not shave as close as I would like or require.</li>
    <li> I have always been an electric rotary head style shave user and leery of anything else...that is....up until now. My friend has had one for 3 years and told me it was a great close shaving shaver. I bought one 3 weeks ago and love it ! I do not get ANY pulling or snagging on my skin even if it&#x27;s a few days old. I also do not get any ingrown follicles as a result of a bad shave(cut). It also has a hygiene meter which tells you when to put it back on the charging station for cleaning and charging...yes !...it auto cleans !&lt;br /&gt; I strongly recommend this unit for anyone that requires a close shave without any snagging !</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! So easy to use, high quality, smooth and close shave! I usually have sensitive skin but this thing doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! Definitely 5 stars all the way</li>
    <li> 5 other previously purchased shavers are still lying around my room; discarded. I have finally found my very PERFECT SHAVER!</li>
    <li> This razor is the best electric that I have ever used. I would recommended it to everyone.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was thinking about buying one for a year and finally I decided to get one since I can always return it if I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;Never again razors! I was sceptic, if the shaver will shave me enough, since I have to be fresh shaved every day for work. I have a strong face hair and it cuts it all and leaves my face shaved completely - baby face :)&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for this product. Worth money!</li>
    <li> The lock button doesn&#x27;t work and the return policy is the worst!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shaver.  I have tried several others and for some reason they tear up my face.  This one shaves as close as a razor and has not caused any skin issues.  I love the cleaning station as well.</li>
    <li> FASTER AND BETTER THAN A RAZOR</li>
    <li> Changed my life. I use DE and other fancy shaving techniques, but this takes care of my busy weekday shaves with perfect comfort and speed and a very smooth shave. Bought a second on as backup. After trying Panasonic wet/dry shavers, Norelco, etc. I consider Braun 7 series is the end-all of shavers. Just stick with a dry shave, even with the wet/dry Braun models, it&#x27;s just as good a shave and takes much less time and mess.</li>
    <li> After about 6 weeks of use.  Pros -  It is a quiet shaver.  The motor feels powerful and the battery retains its charge for several shaves.  Once fully charged it is not necessary to keep the charger/cleaning unit plugged in unless charging and/or cleaning is required.  Many electronic status indications.The cleaning/lubricating feature appears to work well.  It is comfortable to hold while shaving.  Cons -  It does not shave my heavy beard as close as I had hoped.  My old Remington shaver was much louder, but resulted in a closer, smoother shave.  The forward/aft flexible head didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  The narrow trimmer is somewhat awkward to use.  Expense.&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line - I would rate it 4-5 if it left me with a smoother, longer lasting shave.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased. I only replaced the first because it was several years old and heavily used. It actually still runs well.</li>
    <li> close shave but requires too much cleaning fluid/after shave and foil change.</li>
    <li> The best thing since sliced bread.  I found that it shaves as close as a blade (sounds like a commercial).  I thought it was a little loud at first, since I was switching from a blade.  However, the locking head for shaving under the nose stopped locking, so I sent it back for repair (still under warranty).</li>
    <li> Like some others I read, the older models are much better.  Not a close shave no matter  how use  it. When (not if)you try to get a close shave, it will become very hot.  I went back to my older shaver and put this one in the drawer.</li>
    <li> After receiving this shaver as a gift using it for a few days, I find it to be the best razor I have ever used.  This is my 3rd Braun over 30 years and it is the very best.  Also, the new cleaning system is a great improvement over the last one that I had.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a winner!  My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> got it for my dad. will see how it works.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s exactly \\&quot;as good\\&quot; as a razor...but it is pretty darn close.  I have a thick beard (heave 5 o&#x27;clock shadow) and this razor does a good job if I take my time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this was just bad luck, but this new Braun shaver didn&#x27;t work as expected out of the box, and then totally croaked about ten days later. Have returned it to Braun awaiting a refund check. You&#x27;d expect better quality control, especially from Braun, and especially on a top-of-the-line product. Oh well, maybe I&#x27;ll try the top line Philips instead and see what happens...</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for some time now, but just getting around to reviewing.  I have tried a lot of electric razors over the years, but always went back to razor blades for closer shaves.  I never felt like I was really shaving.  When the 7 series came out, I read some good reviews so decided to give it a try.  With Amazon&#x27;s return policy, there was no risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives amazingly close shaves!  Perhaps not absolutely as close as a blade, but close enough that I use it every day.  I used all other electric razors for weekends only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very delicate face skin. My new shaver Braun 7-790 working fine with my face.&lt;br /&gt;For me is the best shaver working in my face.</li>
    <li> not a close shave at all - very disappointed</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, but it has one specific flaw. I read the reviews prior to purchase and they were mixed, so i went ahead with my purchase. One of the bigger debates was the shavers head (foil). Some said it was the smoothest, quickest shave ever and some said that the holes in the foil are too big and that head doesn&#x27;t really pull in the hair as is advertised. Well, the foil holes are too big and the current foil design does not allow for a very close shave, at least not on my face. i have an older 7000 series shaver and it shaves better than this very expensive one. Anyway, what do you do with a $200+ shaver even if it doesn&#x27;t do the best job? You use it. I do hope that Braun reads these and changes their design, or at least sell the thing with 2 different foils so that depending on beard type and face a person could customize their shave. Nobody wants to make a $200 mistake and have to live with it.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun 5 Series and it was great for many years until the battery finally died. I decided to get the 7 Series, but have not been as satisfied as I was with the 5 series. The trimmer on the 5 series was better and the battery on the 5 series would hold a charge for almost a month, where the 7 series needs recharging weekly. Otherwise, the 7 series is ok.</li>
    <li> Absolutely delivers as an electric razor. Went from Mach 3 Turbo to this and the transition took two days max. I have had no problems and nothing but compliments on the closeness of the shave. Lock the head to get parts of your neck near your chin - it helps immensely. The trimming part is a bit of a weak point - like most electric razors. I still have some blades for fine tuning/\\&quot;you never know\\&quot; situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost and more importantly the time effectiveness makes this a good buy. No more preheating my face to get it so it cuts me less, foaming, dragging the razor across my face, cleaning, realizing I missed some spots and doing it all over again. No more bleeding, no more raw skin, red marks, or the lot. Just an easy quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even opened the cleaning system. The manual says you don&#x27;t have to use it, but can manually clean it - either with the brush or rinse it under water. Haven&#x27;t applied machine oil like the manual says, seeing how it works without. Any tips on this would appreciated.</li>
    <li> Very convient!The best shaver for me!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have owned.  It is better than my 2 previous Braun models.  This shaver is quieter while shaving, and while cleaning.  I can shave much more quickly now even on the medium setting and the quality of shave is better.  The LED light from the shaver/cleaning unit is pretty bright.  That&#x27;s fine for me because it doubles as a bathroom night light.  Some may not like that feature, though.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller</li>
    <li> i bought it 5 years ago for the 1/2 price works like new , great shaver</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product. I have always used a razor to shave, so i was kind of scared of purchasing this electric shaver and have it not give me a smooth shave. I must admit I am now convinced on this. After only a few days my face got used to the electric shaver. Even my wife has noted that my skin is smoother. I recommend this for everybody. If you have a doubt, trust me get it and you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> i had and old Braun for the past ten years.&lt;br /&gt;this new serie really exceeds my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;it is like a Rolls Royce.&lt;br /&gt;i shave every other day, and you know how difficult it is when you need to shave in between when you have to go to a business meeting or party...but the cut length really makes it easy for me, no scraches, no redness, no iching.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the new Braun series 7 to anyone who use a shaving machine.&lt;br /&gt;it solve the old machine problem too, whith under the chin now no more leftovers.&lt;br /&gt;i would say 9 out of 10, only because it does not shave your face by itself and you have to move your hands...lol</li>
    <li> If you want a razor that costs a lot of money, makes a lot of noise and does a mediocre job of removing facial hair then this is the razor for you.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.  Bottom line, you buy a razor to efficiently and thoroughly remove facial hair.  This razor requires repeated coverage of the same region to cut the hair. (A lot of repeated coverage).  But even worse, this razor does not cut very close so after a shave it feels like you still need a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based solely on its performance as a razor I would give it two starts but because it is SO expensive, I was force to give it only one star!</li>
    <li> I am a long time Braun user (20+ years) and was excited to see a new model when my previous razor suffered a tragic death in the swimming pool. Unfortunately, this model is a</li>
    <li> Has taken 8 Months to get use to the shaver..I am use to Shaving with a Blade and Rotary or Foil shavers are definately different.&lt;br /&gt; The best thing is it cleans the blade after every use..and the refils are not too expensive..Compared to purchasing Blades every Month or two this is economical as a three Pack of Cleaning fluid cost $10.00.  Thats enough for about 46 Months as it does evaporate even if idle.&lt;br /&gt;  The shave is good..The Shaver Block is self adjusting and keeps the shaver surface on skin in various positions(actually helps especially in a FOIL shaver).&lt;br /&gt;  The adjustment speed hasn&#x27;t been used by me, as I crank it up High all the time.  The position of the adjustment button is in a place that it is constantly being inadvertently lowered or raised as my hand hits it while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Panasonic and Norelco the Braun is Superior in all categories.. the only thing I wish this could do is operate in the shower..but the self cleaning head more than makes up for this.  People dont realize or even know a clean razor and face will help prevent ingrown hairs and infected follicles..the cleaning fluid keeps the Hygiene always very clean..in fact on the tip a meter tells you Battery levels and HYGIENE levels to assist in determining if it needs to be charged or cleaned..It also tells you when its time to buy a new Shaver head Block as its all in once piece.&lt;br /&gt; Comes with charging base/cleaner..and has a nifty carrying case for just the razor when you travel,&lt;br /&gt; Keeps a good charge and you can make a three day trip without even plugging in, which you can always do  in addition to the charging base.&lt;br /&gt;  I really shopped the Shaver market for several years as technology enhanced shavers on market.  This is on pricey side, but in my opinion it was worth the cost for what I got.  I have had a rotary razor, and several FOILS in past ..so I know there is a Difference in the shave...and none are like a actual Blade..but this razor was the closest to a blade..period&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagined..what Razor would a Dignitary or Donald Trump use, and this is definitely the razor.  It is fancy, but not over-complex..every setting /function is used.the closest to a blade..period&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagined..what Razor would a Dignitary or Donald Trump use, and this is definitely the razor.  It is fancy, but not over-complex..every setting /function is used.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model Braun shaver.  I can&#x27;t believe how smoothly and quickly this shaver works and the cleaning system is the best.  The shave is close but without irritation, even on the sensitive neck areas.  This is probably the best shaver I have ever owned, and I have owned many of various brands over the years.</li>
    <li> Lights don&#x27;t light up to let me know cleaning program progress.  Shave is pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is very good shaver and I like it because it works very excellent. I offer it for everyone need a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Got this for husband. He LOVES it. I also go the refills after awhile and still stick to buying him the water refills when he is down and he loves this thing!</li>
    <li> In the past, whenever I wanted a close shave, I&#x27;d use a blade. (The Edwin Jagger Safety Razor) Other days, I&#x27;d use my triple head rotary electric razor. Often, the rotary would leave razor burn on my neck. I was on vacation recently, and used my son&#x27;s Braun 7-760. I was impressed. When I got home, I ordered the 7-790cc. I can honestly say that the difference between the Braun and a real blade is almost non-existent!</li>
    <li> Painful when shaving. Pulls whiskers. More noisy than previous models. Does not give a close shave. Seems to be a clear downgrade from previous models. I would not purchase again. Don&#x27;t count on Amazon for guarantee!</li>
    <li> For an expensive razor, it has a few short comings. Will give a close shave but take 3 to 4 time longer than my old Braun Series 3.. Tough on sensitive skin because you have to go over the are too many times. Very noisy and I think the Pulsonic  thing is nothing more than a gimmick. Hopefully, this shaver will improve with time.</li>
    <li> Very noisy.  Very bulky.  Ugly. Complicated.  Takes up large amount of sink space.  Way over priced.  Shaves no better than any much cheaper shaver that I have every owned.  Highly disappointed.  You do NOT get what you paid for.  Do not understand what all the hype is about Braun.  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap electric razor I used almost never. This is a vast improvement over going cheap. If you want a great razor that will really perform this should be one of your top considerations.</li>
    <li> Braun has the best shave of any electric razor I have bought.  It is well worth the price for a good and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> A superb razor.  Gives a great shave without making my face raw.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver I use 790 cc for the first time, I was using, it has a very rich, brush up flat and agile, is a good razor.</li>
    <li> It was a gift. Husband really likes the shaver. Gives a clean smooth shave.  The setup is nice and tidy.  Could have gotten it for a few dollars less at Costco had I checked there first,  But very satisfied with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to have Philips and Panasonic but this shaver gives me a very close shave (the closet shave that I ever experienced using an electronic shaver). The clean/renew cartridge is very cool and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Better than my old one of the same make, but older model.  This one is sleek, feels good in the hand, and does a great job on my medium coarse beard.  The pop-up trimer is a different shape, and more efficient, than the older model.</li>
    <li> My razor had issues within the first 60 days. Braun informed me that I needed to mail the razor hundreds of miles away at my expense to get any benefit from the warranty. I then said I would rather exercise my rights to the 60 day money back guarantee. I was then told that would also require me to pay to return the razor and it would take 8-10 weeks! Wow, DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED BY BRAUN&#x27;S MISREPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THEIR WARRANTY AND MONEY BACK GUARANTEE.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  After a year, even though I replaced the head with an OEM part, the cleaning system started to do funky stuff.  The head turned all brown, covered in weird spots.  The plastic under the head bubbled up (!).  This shaver is a piece of junk.  Braun said the warranty is only 2 years, after that they&#x27;ll fix it, but you have to pay.  So all that \\&quot;built to last 7 years\\&quot; advertising is just that - advertising:)</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to update my review of this product because of a few technical issues that have come up. First, after only 2 months of use, the button on the razor that you use to lock the pivoting head (in order to shave in small, tight areas; especially under the nose) just fell off. Really...it just fell off. Apparently the button just broke off; and what&#x27;s worse is that I almost never used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is the charging station. After just 2 months, the charging station refuses to charge the razor to full capacity. A design problem with the station and the contacts on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed online that a number of other customers are having a similar issue with the charging/cleaning station dying after a brief period of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This is still the best electric shave that money can buy, no question. The quality of shave itself is unmatched for an electric. It is just a shame that certain technical aspects have made me take a star away from my review. I hope Braun will consider these issues with their next generation of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is INSANELY good. I have been a Norelco rotary shaver for as long as I can remember. I had tried foil shavers (mostly the old Remington products) off and on over the years, but had a real issue with neck irritation. As much as I was OK with Norelco, I still felt that there HAD to be something on the market that would give Norelco a challenge. I found it. This Braun is the best electric shaver in the world. There is no comparison. The first time I used it, I knew that this razor was different. I have never been a blade shaver very much over the years, but this product actually DOES shave as close as a blade. As far as the neck irritation goes, with this product...NONE. There is some time for the skin to adjust to a new shaving method, but it doesn&#x27;t take very long. I can&#x27;t speak for the \\&quot;cleaning station\\&quot; that comes with this. I use it after every shave, but I can&#x27;t say whether it cleans the razor or not. Still, \\&quot;cleaning station\\&quot; or not, this is the best electric razor on the planet...period.after every shave, but I can&#x27;t say whether it cleans the razor or not. Still, \\&quot;cleaning station\\&quot; or not, this is the best electric razor on the planet...period.</li>
    <li> I love the Braun electric shaver with one exception- It does not work great at my neck line. It doesn&#x27;t irritate. It leaves some unwanted hair. I usually have to shave my neck once a week. This is the reason I take off one star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple Braun shavers before over the years, and this one like those is excellent. It&#x27;s all good - shave closeness, variable comfort setting, charger and self cleaning stand, ergonomics - the weight, shape, materials - how it feels in you hand. Now for a word of caution for folks thinking of switching over for the first time. This has been my experience, and certainly may be different with others, if not most (I may be weird)! Anyway, as I said it&#x27;s my experience that one never gets as close a shave with ANY electric as one would get traditionally with a quality razor and sharp blade. Even after a few months of using the electric when your face is supposed to have become used to it, there&#x27;s a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve had other electrics, notably Norelco rotaries, and the Braun by far gives the closest shave, but still traditional shaving is much closer, The convenience and time saving with the electric are big pluses too. YMMV</li>
    <li> This one is best shaver I have used. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great shaver with a very close shave, the only draw backs are that it&#x27;s a bit louder than I thought it&#x27;d be, I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for years and this one is louder than most.  The cleaning station is also surprisingly loud but seems to do a great job so its worth it.  Those two things are all that kept it from getting 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. I also have a high-end Norelco rotary and this one is better. The cleaning system is better than I expected. I recommend your remove the solution cartridge and snap the cover back on between cleanings so the solution will not evaporate. I clean mine once a week in the machine, but I rinse the cutter in water (and let dry, of course) 2-3 times a week to help my solution last longer. Put a drop of light machine oil (like WD40) on your finger and smear it on the foil once a week if you rinse it in water as often as I do.</li>
    <li> I really love this electric shave I have tried several electric shavers over the years buy they didn&#x27;t leave my face smooth gave me a five o clock shadow this braun really works great and leaves your face really smooth</li>
    <li> Item as stated and shipped promptly!</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome! It has three power modes, I set mine to &amp;#34;Furious&amp;#34; and use it dry. The resulting shave is as smooth as the best Gillette blades but with no irritation at all. My old $80 Philips Norelco Aquatec was slower, didn&#x27;t do as good of a job and always left my face stinging. The Braun 790cc has literally improved the quality of my life... I look better, feel better and my wife gives my smoother face more attention too. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s any drawback it&#x27;s that cleaning it out manually isn&#x27;t as easy as it could be so it tends to build up some stubble dust during use which can get messy when it sprinkles out. I tap it out in the sink as best I can while I&#x27;m shaving and the automatic cleaning station does an excellent job when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ordered mine with the standard packaging, Amazon seemed to indicate it was made in Korea but rest assured the shaver is still made in Germany. The build quality is quite good, it feels solid in the hand and mine&#x27;s even survived a fall of a couple feet without injury.</li>
    <li> this is horrible!  it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. you have to cover the same area 10 times before it cuts the hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good value considering the cost of razors.  But razors are the standard and this Braun comes close.  Also the cleaning base is a huge must have. If not you will get stubble and in grown hair</li>
    <li> Good service but my husband isn&#x27;t to happy with the shave</li>
    <li> I used to breakout after using my norelco electric razor, even with new blades.  I used to have to lather on the aveno after shave lotion.  With this razor, I am not even red/irritated.  HOWEVER, I have noticed it does take about twice as long to shave as it did with the norelco, but Ill sacrifice time for a non-burning neck!</li>
    <li> I went from an older Braun series 3 to the series 7 and would impressed by the new style and power options.  I could be a comfort level with my old shaver, but this one really get going on the highest setting.  I&#x27;ve actually reduced mine to the lowest sensitivity setting for most of my shave because the most powerful setting seem to tug a little on my facial hair.  Great packaging, great battery and length of use for this series.  I would recommend the upgrade.</li>
    <li> Been a Brauner for long time (decades?)..this is good but the size of the trimmer blade seems smaller and not as husky as earlier series 7.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before but always went back to blades. The electrics didn&#x27;t shave as good and were a hassle to clean. The Braun solved both problems. It&#x27;s shave is close and the automatic cleaning has to be seen to believe.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been through several systems trying to find something that works for me. Everything either shaved my face well but was too harsh on my neck - or it was gentle enough on my neck but didn&#x27;t shave and I would have to double the irritation by having to double back with a conventional razor blade shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Shaver does everything and does not burn and irritate  my skin and shaves baby smooth everywhere and at all angles and curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very Pleased I finally found a Shaver that does everything I need it to do and even more pleased that it does it extremely well and with absolutely no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I decided to spend the extra couple of dollars for this very heavy duty and durable Shaver!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the shaver</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver, and it is great.  No nicks.  Speedy.  Gives a really close shave.</li>
    <li> Have had this buzzer for two years.  I&#x27;ll start by stating that I have a thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the Good:&lt;br /&gt;When I use this razor on a daily basis its a 5 star razor no question, quick, easy, close shaves.  Cleans nicely under water (just the head, not fully water proof) and with the base unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t call it the bad-  but limitations:&lt;br /&gt;If I go for a few days or week without shaving, while still capable of shaving nicely, it takes quite a while to shave completely clean.  Probably 2-3x the amount of time if shaving with a traditional razor blade.  I also feel as if the shave doesn&#x27;t get as close when long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin facial hair this buzzer is a must have.  Although expensive at first you will not have need to purchase another set of blades or cream and save in the long run.  Also the time saved is great.  With a thin beard, or daily buzzing this razor is extremely quick and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remedy my thick beard issue I have a set of blades and cream in my bathroom.  When I buzz on a day to day or even day to third day basis I give this buzzer 5 stars.  On weeks when I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t bother shaving I&#x27;ll use the razors.  Which for me isn&#x27;t often.  I&#x27;ve had the same 4 blades in my bathroom for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations, no buzzer is going to get as close as a blade so if you&#x27;re looking for the CLOSEST possible shave stick with razors, but if you want quick, clean and very close shave I recommend this buzzer.</li>
    <li> Bought for my techy son who loves it still after 6 months.</li>
    <li> It is present for my dad. It works very well in China and my daddy likes it very much.</li>
    <li> This shaver was purchased as a gift for my son to replace one (different brand) that was lost in a bag that was stolen. He reports being extremely pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, very strong performance and an ultra close shave. Has many functions and features which make it top of the line. I&#x27;ve been using electric razors to shave my face for over 51 years, and have tried nearly all the different brands.  This Braun 790 is head and shoulders above the competition. It&#x27;s a little more money initially, but is well worth the price and is an extremely good value.</li>
    <li> A good product, but my older 5 series gave a better shave with less effort.</li>
    <li> Works OK.  Not as close a shave as I like.  Requires frequent cleaning. Not worth the price.  If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d make another selection.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this razor - best he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS I EXSPECTED FROM A BRAUN  200.00 PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver since my first one is now my travel shaver.The amazing job that this shaver does is never disappointing and the self cleaning is the reason I love Brauns products.</li>
    <li> a pure good electric shaver with solid quality.&lt;br /&gt;The Dock that can clean and charge is so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Like it</li>
    <li> It gives me a good close shave.  I use it every day.  Its the best razor I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This does everything that I expected of it. The razor has three settings (L - M - H) which helps for heavy vs light growth areas. The motor is strong enough for me, though I don&#x27;t have a super-heavy beard, and it does take 6 quick passes over the same area (though that is normal). I think the new cleaning unit is an improvement over the older ones I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is missing? The older Braun had the so-called system 1-2-3, where you could use the long-hair clipper in conjunction with the blades. That is now gone. The long hair clipper comes out at 90 degrees to the unit. Works fine, but can&#x27;t use it with the regular shaving blades. I also do lament the fact that over the years Braun has gone from making its razors out of real metal (yes, I still have one that is now 24 years old and still works - a direct plug-in model). These new ones are slivery-plastic. I&#x27;m almost positive it isn&#x27;t going to last 24 years. This one is even more plasticy than the one I got 6 years ago. A worrying trend, but still a find product.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful. I like it very much, has not started to use. Very beautiful. I like it very much, has not started to use.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good&lt;br /&gt;I realy like it.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend a year ago for Christmas. He uses this on daily basis and he says that the shaver pinches his skin from time to time, which gives him blemishes. However, the shaver still gives him very smooth shaving every morning so he&#x27;s happy with it. He claims it&#x27;s way better than shaving with shaving cream and a razor every morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my son. I have had many Braun and other electric shavers over the years and this one in clearly the best. Self cleaning function works great and is very quiet.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my husband as a gift, he raves over it! Especially likes the cleaning function, compared to his old one, he already had a Braun, but wanted a new one.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple different shaving systems, even lower priced Braun shavers, and nothing comes close to this one. It actually works on the neck, and I have a sensitive neck. The only issue I have with the shaver is the trimmer. It does not trim very well. Other than that, the shaver has been amazing.</li>
    <li> At first when I used it did not give close shave that I wanted, especially under my chin. Gave it few weeks for my beard to adjust like directions stated, and so it did. Now its fourth week and my shave is as close even better than with my other Gillette razor. Especially closer shave under chin than razor blade. I was going to return it but my patience paid off and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t cause it turned out to be best investment ever.</li>
    <li> This is the best Braun shaver I have ever had.  It shaves very close without pressing or pulling on your skin and the side trimmer works great too!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this shaver to replace another Braun.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but in this case you truly get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited: The above comment is how I used to feel about Braun but the quality and availability of replacement cutters/foils for this razor has taken a dive.  They used to last for a year. The latest one I bought lasted four months and now you can&#x27;t even buy one (which is a good thing &#x27;cuz they were a piece of crap). Let&#x27;s hope Braun is fixing this problem. I used to love this brand and product but am very disappointed by what they are doing now.</li>
    <li> I was worth the investment compared to other electric razors. I can get a clean shave without nasty razor bumps and bad skin rashes.</li>
    <li> He likes it! I don&#x27;t know he like the gift itself or just because he loves me! However,I bought it with a lovely price,it is enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the shaver a few days shy of a month.  I will start by saying it is easily the best consistent shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;ve owned Norelco triple head shavers my whole life and I don&#x27;t plan to ever use one again after trying this Braun shaver.  When I received the shaver the first thing I noticed was the inner packaging looked like it had gotten wet and then dried over time.  When I opened some of the plastic in the box I was a little disturbed to find what looked like muddy droplets of water in the package that held the cleaning solution.  The shaver battery was discharged and after charging said the shaver needed the heaviest cleaning available (all the bars on the readout where on).  I still am not sure how a supposed brand new shaver needed cleaning?  The readout for the cleaning and battery status is extremely hard to read and you have to put it under certain positions under light to be able to see the readout.  I am not sure if this gauge is suppose to light up or not.  I can&#x27;t find any documentation that says if it should or shouldn&#x27;t light up.  However after charging I had a wonderful shave.  It does take awhile for your skin/beard to get used to the shave,  but well worth putting up with mild discomfort.  What gets my goat just a little is that all the documentation says that this fluid that cleans your shaver also lubricates.  This seems to be a marketing ploy in my opinion.  There are two fluids in the cleaning solution which is simply alcohol and scent.  Where is the lubrication in that?  So I would highly suggest anyone using this shaver to see what lubricant is available that might do the job and manually apply it.  I do love the self cleaning option, it does leave the shaver in pristine condition.  This shaver unlike my old Norelco shaver basically leaves your beard clippings as fine powder.  The cleaning system pumps the liquid through the system and pulls all the trimmings out of the razor.  I usually clean it after each shave as I shave my beard and head.  The Braun is a bit pricey but well worth it in my opinion.  I would have given it five stars if they actually had lubrication &amp;#34;such as oil&amp;#34; in the cleaning solution.beard and head.  The Braun is a bit pricey but well worth it in my opinion.  I would have given it five stars if they actually had lubrication &amp;#34;such as oil&amp;#34; in the cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> My old model began to have issues during the cleaning cycle where it would just run continuously.  I&#x27;d had it for years and it worked flawlessly.  I had no issues replacing it after all that time with a similar model.  The new one continues to perform as I&#x27;ve come to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You hear it all the time about how close a shave you get.  I&#x27;ve used many different razors over the years and several electric shavers.  I&#x27;ve never had ANYTHING trim as close as these last two Braun units.  I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I had a braun razor for about 12 years. That was a good razor. This new one is even better. No razor burn no matter how hard you push. No mess in cleaning. Easy to use and great shave.</li>
    <li> My hands shake because of BETs (tremors).  I got sick and tired of cutting myself when I shaved so I started researching electric shavers and settled on the Braun 790.  I tried one electric razor years ago and was not satisfied with the results.  My Braun gives me a great shave, and it&#x27;s simple to maintain.  Just put it in the docking station and it charges, sanitizes, cleans, and lubricates the razor with the touch of a button.  It took about three weeks for my beard and skin to adapt to the razor and now I am getting as good a shave as I did with my old razor without the cuts.  I can kick myself for not switching sooner.</li>
    <li> I have been lifelong shaving cream and razor person. I just switched to the electric world because of my frequent travel at my new job. For those making the switch, beware, it will take a couple of weeks to get used to the shaver. So wait sometime before writing a review. Braun electric shaver is as good the razor without all the hassles that goes with wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reason for 4 stars are as follows.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is not as easy to get to the hair below the chin. It needs some work.&lt;br /&gt;2. I still need to clean up manually near the hairline next to my ears. I do not have the feel for the Braun to do it (yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going back to the razor. The switch has been good.</li>
    <li> Best shave by far. I had a Braun shaver years ago but changed to Norelco because the Braun did a poor job on neck hair. I tired of Norelco after a few years and decided to return to Braun with it&#x27;s new technology.  I bought the best and am convinced it is the best. Neck hairs - no problem. I get a wonderful shave every time and the cleaning system completes the perfect experience.</li>
    <li> great product in all senses,  except for the cleaning cartridges that run out fast... but anyway you can sort it out easily</li>
    <li> Very good quality, always in use, and take it with you when you travel. I&#x27;d like to use it for 20 years.</li>
    <li> After spending years shaving with disposable safety razors, I thought it was time to treat myself to a nice electric razor.  After reading ratings and reviews, I settled on the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsar System.  I have not tried any other electric razor so I can&#x27;t compare.  However it has done everything I hoped it would do.  I have no discomfort from using it daily for the past two weeks.  While I can get a little closer shave with the disposable safety razors, the Braun does just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the cleaning system.  I actually use a compressed air can (like computer repair people use) to blow off the hair particles before I put the unit in the cleaner.  I  can&#x27;t be sure yet but I feel that this will improve the cleanliness and make things last a little longer.  I feel very optimistic that this will serve my needs very well.</li>
    <li> j&#x27;ai command&amp;eacute; cet appareil et me le suis fait livr&amp;eacute; en 48 heures &amp;agrave; mon hotel &amp;agrave; nyc,&lt;br /&gt;impeccable&lt;br /&gt;je suis extrêment satisfait, tres bonne qualit&amp;eacute; du produit, bel objet, marche impec</li>
    <li> The shave is good, the unit as a whole works fine so far , I will see what happens a year from now but so far nothing negative to say , nice unit.</li>
    <li> My old Panasonic finally gave out on me, so I had to quickly search for a new shaver.  I read a lot of reviews and finally settled on the Braun Series 7.  I have always preferred electric shavers to disposable razors because disposable razors seem to destroy my skin.  Since my shaver died and I had to wait for the new one to arrive, I had to deal with disposable razors for over a week.  My skin was sore!  As soon as the Braun arrived, I started using it.  I loved it from the beginning!  It seemed to shave closer and didn&#x27;t give me the irritation that I sometimes got with the Panasonic.  I also love the self-cleaning feature.  It really makes each shave feel better.  I highly recommend this to any man that wants a good quality shaver, especially if his skin is a bit sensitive like mine.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System is the best shaver i&#x27;ve used，smoothly and clearly，Automatically clean, charge, lubricate and dry are very nice！&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shortcoming：noise&#x27;s too laud</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever, have been a fan of this brand for a long time. The foil is improved and more robust. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I gave up on the cleaning system and every couple months soak my razor head in rubbing alcohol for a few minutes then blow it with an air can - perfect operation and a lot less counter clutter. The cord plugs into the razor the same as it does into the charging base so it&#x27;s easy to skip the base if you want. It only needs charging once a month or so. I wish it came with a snap-on travel head cover instead of a nylon zip case, for better travel protection.</li>
    <li> This is the first foil type I&#x27;ve used and it works far better than the triple head type.  Takes a few passes to get a smooth shave, and even then it&#x27;s not that smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me though, I don&#x27;t particularly care about a smooth shave.  The self cleaning base is great--noisy though so don&#x27;t use it when people are sleeping!</li>
    <li> Okay product. The blades don&#x27;t last very long and are about as expensive as the entire shaver to replace.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for nearly 3 months now and, I must say, it was well worth the price. I&#x27;ve tried many different razors/shavers over the past few years but never a pulsonic shaver. I&#x27;m a black american so my facial hair can be pretty curly and tends to want to stay under the skin if not cut very close and pulled up towards the surface as this shaver does. In the past I&#x27;ve had the tendency to get facial bumps (which I absolutely hate) from other razors/shavers but after only about a couple of weeks of use of the Braun series 7 in order to get my skin used to it, there are no more razor bumps!! My only complaint about the shaver is that it does take me a few passes in order to get all of the hairs, and the shaver is a bit louder than I had anticipated from reading mentions of the sound in previous reviews before I purchased it. So, if you&#x27;re trying to keep the noise down from your significant other if you have to get up like I do very early in the AM, then just know that this may not reduce the noise as much as you&#x27;d like (but maybe you&#x27;re lucky and you&#x27;re significant other sleeps pretty soundly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this was a great investment for me and I love the fact that it has an awesome self-cleaning system.</li>
    <li> the best electric razor ever!!!</li>
    <li> My husband was surprised for his birthday.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok. It was billed as the best of all shavers, certainly the most expensive. I&#x27;ve found it to be adequate as a shaver. I like the cleaning base.</li>
    <li> I wanted to really like this shaver. I&#x27;ve used electric shavers most of my adult life (I&#x27;m almost 49). All Norelco. The one I had before the Braun was bought on Amazon in 2007 and the on/off button died (not repairable - I opened it up and checked inside). The things I liked: close shave, cleaning system. The things I didn&#x27;t like: the rotating head never locked like it said it did, being difficult to shave close to your sideburns or goatee, the idea of paying for new cleaning fluid every few months.</li>
    <li> Chucked my razors for good.</li>
    <li> Expensive but, it does provide an absolute crappy shave.&lt;br /&gt;Each and every time. Wave a tiny flag for consistence.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to admit this lapse in purchasing judgement, however as Forrest&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Mama said,…stupid is as stupid does.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the multi blade razoo.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll take the Braun to the range.&lt;br /&gt;Time has passed. I tried to use this rubbish razor on multiple occasions. Each time with poor, sorry to outright bad results.&lt;br /&gt;I, however, am pleased to announce that it has succumbed to a 180grain .40S&amp;W hollow point round. And it showed no grace when it went on to it&#x27;s deserved reward. What a miserable product.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received this shaver system in exchange for my honest review.  I&#x27;ve used this for about a week and have been impressed thus far.  My biggest issue with electric shaver systems is that they can never really encompass the same quality shave as a razor.  But this one sure does come close.  This shaver has a great battery life and does a great job of a first-pass shave.  The cleaning system is pretty nice as well and with regular use should hopefully extend the life of the foil.  Not too loud, which is good because I don&#x27;t want to disturb my wife or my daughter.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaver. It gives me a clsoe shave in general , but the only problem I have is due to the contour of my face. There are some hard to get areas that I can&#x27;t get as close</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great. I was hesitant buying an electric razor but it seriously was one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Great razor. I hope it lasts as long as the previous model!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a smooth cut but it still sometimes pulls my hair</li>
    <li> The shaver itself:  Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System.  Until I purchased this shaver and when I needed to look smart, I always felt it necessary to use a conventional razor blade for a quick &amp;#34;once over&amp;#34; to get it really close (easy after getting rid of the stubble with an electric shaver but a bit of duplicated effort).  This Braun shaver is perfect - a really close comfortable shave.  My only complaint and it&#x27;s trivial is that the cleaning unit is a bit &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34; and bulky - however unless you&#x27;re going on a really long trip you don&#x27;t need to take it (I&#x27;ve just been overseas for over 6 weeks and the shaver worked perfectly with the only cleaning being a weekly wash under a running tap (warm).  Definitely a very good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s service - well I&#x27;d give them 6/5 if it was possible.  My first shaver arrived in Australia with a few parts missing from the cleaning unit. Amazon, without any questions sent me a COMPLETE new pack.  Unfortunately I am not ambidextrous enough to shave with both hands simultaneously</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few shavers cheap, semi-expensive but this one by far is the best shaver i&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t even have to look at the mirror to double check for missing spots anymore. It&#x27;s that good. Self cleaning charge base is a big plus. It lets me enjoy fresh shave every time. User selective sensitivity is a huge plus. I get zero irritation in sensitive spots anymore without having to worry about closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Series 3 prior to this one and this one is leaps and bound better than the old unit. Specially in neck hair shaving and irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Close shaves&lt;br /&gt;Custom settings to find the fine balance between irritation and close shave&lt;br /&gt;Self Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Charging station&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Nothing major</li>
    <li> Love Braun products and have used them for years.  This is a great razor and I like it.  However, the cleaning system broke after about 6 uses.  Very upsetting.  Now, thanks to your typical &amp;#34;we sort of care&amp;#34; customer service, I have the option to wait 8-10 weeks for a Citi gift card refund or try to get it repaired.  Either way I have to pay to ship it to them.  Sorry Braun, but if your nearly $200 razor breaks within a couple weeks, you need to step up and take care of your customer.  You do that by sending a pre-paid label like many repeatable companies do now.</li>
    <li> i had given up on electric razors and by chance decided to try it one more time and im glad it was yours that i purchased</li>
    <li> I compared this to the Phillips 6000 series. The Braun was far superior. It cuts like a mower. I get done shaving very quickly. Some people try to save on the cleansing kit refills but I found that it makes the shave much more enjoyable with less burn. It has an oil that makes your face smooth. Buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This Shaver works very well. I have used another brand of electric shaver for years. The Braun 790cc is far superior to my previous shaver. The shave is very close and comfortable. The cleaning station works well to keep it clean &amp; fresh. I do recommend the Braun 790cc to anyone who uses a electric shaver.</li>
    <li> this item is good for me  i love it so much  the price is suit for me  i lke it</li>
    <li> Most of the time is very easy to use, but sometimes scratched me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m troubled with ingrown hairs and very sensitive skin. Shaving for me is always a risk. When I didn&#x27;t have to shave too often I used a razor but soon I went electric.  The electrics I&#x27;ve had were a old Braun that tugged on my hairs, then the Remmington UltraSmooth then Panasonic ES8109S and now the Braun 790cc.  I tried the Norelco style but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic worked pretty well but I still had problems so I went for the top-of-the-line Braun 790cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is very good. I like the extra power, I like lemony cleaning fluid and am glad it has alcohol in it. However, I still get ingrown hairs some times. Recently I got three in one week so I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  It&#x27;s probably the best shaver out there but there has yet to be a great design for people that get ingrowns and have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the Braun there are areas where I must use an Andis trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with issues like me I can recommend the Andis Outliner II  for trouble areas but use it carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even with the Braun I can&#x27;t got for a close shave and I don&#x27;t totally trust it. However, it&#x27;s very well-built and probably the best shaver on offer right now.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a young teen shaving for the first time I have always used a hand razor, and to this day I still do from time to time. Fast forward about 10yrs and this was my first electric razor. I read some reviews on it and with the return policy on it I just couldn&#x27;t turn the chance to try it. I&#x27;ve had it for 20months and just now purchased a new head for it, it&#x27;s recommended to change every 18 months. This thing has been the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and only recently has it started to miss a few hairs which was due to the blades becoming dull after 20 months of shaving. I absolutely love this thing for the battery live, the great shave, the indicator lights on it when it needs cleaning and recharging, the ability to plug in the razor and shave via electrical outlet if the battery is dead, and the cleaning station it sits/charges in. Anyone who is even considering this razor I say CLICK BUY NOW, NOW!!! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This replaced my Panasonic wet/dry razor, which stopped working for me after about a year of use.  Given the longevity of the Panasonic, I decided to try this one. This works OK.  I think the Panasonic in wet mode gave a MUCH BETTER shave.  That said, this system is nice.  Not sure whether I would go with this or the Panasonic if I had to do over.</li>
    <li> Best close shave I&#x27;ve had in a long I would recommend this to everyone its the best one I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Its is the best elec razor I have ever owned. I upgradef from an older braun  and thought it was great but this is even better</li>
    <li> The shaver shaves as well as the Braun it replaced.  My only complaint is the cleaning/charging station.  I just don&#x27;t use it cause I don&#x27;t have the space and water with a little soap works just fine.</li>
    <li> The shaver system by Braun is very stylish (I like that part) and extremely functional (he likes that part). Beauty and function -- what more could a buyer want?</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I have never written a review or endorsement of any product on the web or elsewhere. In addition, this review is not based on my personal experience, but that of my 86 year old father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father had been a blade shaver for many years, but several years ago developed macular degeneration and had a very difficult time with the traditional razor and shaving cream. At that point he adopted an electric razor, and was pretty adamant that the Norelco shavers were the best. However, it seemed like the Norelco shavers only gave a good close shave for a very short time, and they were hard for him to clean and keep in good working order. Also, his beard is fairly stiff, and most days he would have a five o&#x27;clock shadow by noon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, exactly one year ago I gave my father this Braun razor as a Christmas gift, and I thought I would wait to see how it faired over several months before passing judgement. The fact is he loves it! I thought it might take him some time to get used to it, but within a week or two he was praising the shave he was getting with it. He says it only takes him about two or three minutes to shave in the morning, whereas his old Norelco was a five minute ordeal at least. The shave seems very close, and his five o&#x27;clock shadow now shows up at the right time! He loves the pop-up trimmer, and figured out how to use the head locking switch so that he can shave comfortably under his nose as well. Finally, the self-cleaning function is just what the doctor ordered here. He cleans it every other day, and a refill lasts about six weeks at that cleaning rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for Christmas this year I&#x27;m giving him the replacement head and some cleaning refills. While I think the refills are a little bit over-priced, it seems like a minor thing given the overall ownership experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it&#x27;s a second hand endorsement, but coming from my Dad it&#x27;s pretty high praise.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Braun user (20+ years) and was excited to see a new model when my previous razor suffered a tragic death in the swimming pool.  Unfortunately, this model is a step back from any previous Braun which I have used.  Considering the high price and overall positive reviews, I had expected a shave at least as close as prior Brauns.  Unfortunately this model does not provide a close shave.  Even after 10 to 15 minutes of shave-time I still have pesky hairs that this model cannot seem to reach.  While it is quiet and I like the cleaning system, the shave quality is poor when compared to prior Braun models.  You certaily could get as good or better shave with less expensive razors.  I have been using this razor continuously for 3 months and have seen no improvement in shave quality during that time.</li>
    <li> I bought the 790cc in March 2010.  From the beginning (I have a rather heavy beard that grows in different directions), getting anything resembling a close shave in less than 15 minutes was impossible.  Still, I decided to stick with the mediocre shaves, the earth-shattering noise both of the shave and the cleaning process, because I was fed up with blood all over my shirt collars resulting from the inevitable daily cuts that accompanied my super-duper Gillette blades.  By September, the foils (supposed to last 18 months) had so badly degraded that after 10 minutes, I still had a full beard.  So I purchased a new foil and cutter cassette.  Slightly better results for about a week.  Then, the five o&#x27;clock shadow became worse...and worse, and finally, the morning shave entailed an excruciating ripping of the hair from my beard.  By late November, I was finally determined that this was not going to work, and I went back to the drawing board.  For whatever reason, the Panasonic was not on my radar screen in March.  This time, I expanded the search and the ES-LA93-K wet/dry came up.  I read a half-dozen reviews, several from former Braun 7-series owners, and went ahead and bought the Panasonic.  It arrived December 3rd.  I have had two shaves, one dry with Williams Lectric Shave, and one in the shower with pre-shave oil and shave gel.  Both shaves exceeded in closeness, comfort and neatness anything I have ever experienced, ever, anytime--in a record setting 4 minutes dry and 5 minutes wet.  It is more comfortable to hold, quieter, utterly pain free, and is everything I expected and much, much more.  The cleaning system is easy to use, and much quieter.  I had used Braun shavers in the past, with similar results. The 7-series received rave reviews, and I decided to give it a shot. I am done with German engineering for good, after getting rid of a disaster of a BMW for an Infiniti and now the Braun 7-series in favor of the Panasonic.  While the Braun may work for you if your beard is lighter and has a predictable and consistent growth pattern, I would recommend the Panasonic simply because it works better under the most difficult conditions, and would likely give you lucky light bearded folks a two-minute shave, dry or wet.  I had grown to dread shaving--the past two days have been terrific.  It is six hours now since I shaved, and no hint of shadow. With the Braun, it would be there in less than three hours.  By night, if I was going out, I needed to shave again.  Those of you who are still trying for a perfect or even acceptable shave with the Braun:  do yourselves a favor and try the Panasonic.our beard is lighter and has a predictable and consistent growth pattern, I would recommend the Panasonic simply because it works better under the most difficult conditions, and would likely give you lucky light bearded folks a two-minute shave, dry or wet.

    <li> I was already a Norelco user and was not happy with electric shaver compared to the Gillete Razors. The Razor gives awesome shave and with no much time. I needed a good shaver which would give me closest shave without much hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the following 4:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Braun 550 cc-4&lt;br /&gt;2. Braun 760 cc-1&lt;br /&gt;3. Brain 760 cc-4&lt;br /&gt;4. BRaun 790 cc-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a diffrence between cc-1 and cc-4 which was very difficult to judge or search online. Though from shaving point of view not much of a difference but Optifoil is better than Smartfoil. CC-1 is older model with Smartfoils and no Optifoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the products were awesome, 760 cc-4 and 790 cc-4 are exactly same except the LCD indicator and the Hygiene LCD indicator which I think was necessary for the difference I got. The washing system in 790 has quick wash option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cc-1 are still more expensive. I dont know the reason. Perhaps the bigger pack size is the reason and it come with a plastic case instead of pouch. Pouch is much more better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The washing system in 790 is awesome . Infact you dont require a major wash if you wash it under quickwash daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall Braun 790 cc is the best shaver in terms of treat to skin and closest shave. In one week you will be a fan of this product. I have seen Panasonics Arc 4 reviews and was sold for it. But when I tried 5 Series I realised Braun has class. I will agree that panasonic will also be good, but I doubt panasonic&#x27;s clening system. Is it just there to give competetion to Braun or really a great, simple system, I doubt. Again for $180 getting a german machine is an edge. I would suggest guys, just go out and get a 5/7 series from nearest store and  Try it for 1 or 2 weeks and see the difference yourself....</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about Braun shavers - had my first one for 8 years (was still working, but the batteries weren&#x27;t holding much of a charge), then upgraded to a 6550 which I have been using for the past 13 years (and still works just fine - I&#x27;ll probably put it in my office for those days I forget to shave before heading out to work!) - thought it&#x27;d be nice to have a change to a new shaver, and this is even better than the last one!  I love the automatic cleaning feature - I was a little nervous that the solution would be perfumed (as I am sensitive to that sort of thing) but you don&#x27;t even smell it after the razor is clean!  Shaving performance is great (don&#x27;t know if the vibrations help, but it&#x27;s like getting a face massage - pretty funny) - overall, an excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> This was the \\&quot;first\\&quot; of many attempts to find an electric shaver that could equal the razor head-to-head in my morning shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem has always been the neck whiskers that grow in circular patterns.  I owned the previos model which did about a 90% job when compared to a standard multi-blade razor - - - but to my surprise this did a 100% job on these hard to get properly cut/shaved neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extendable trimmer is also amazing and keeps the hairs on my ears and ear lobes trimed smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also a pleasant surprise to experience the different 3-speeds and how they affected the overall shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the high speed with the most vibration that produced the smoothest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous mode had the cleaning system/base - and this one also does a wonderful job of cleaning and steralizing the shave head and enternal blades.  The liquid lubrication also makes it unnecessary to put any pre-shave on my face - and that is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - it is all that they said in the advertisement and the BEST shaver out of the over dozen models and brands I&#x27;ve used over the years.  I am 69 years old and the morning shave with this razor is a real joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cudo&#x27;s to Braun - it is a winner!</li>
    <li> short and to the point I ordered the Braun 7 series and the Norelco sensotouch 3d model1250x. I was curently using a Braun 5 series which still does a good job. The Braun 7 series gives a slower shave but much better and closer near perfection of the blade would give it 5 star. Norelco 3d was faster but not as close of a shave and after my first 3- 4 shaves i noticed some irritation especially shaving wet never will try that again. I would give Norelco 3d a 4.5 stars. Braun 7 series it&#x27;s the better shaver for me but both are top shavers. Also huge disadvantage for Norelco is the charging stand kinda unpractical when traveling. Also the Braun feels more stronger and longer lasting product plus the cleaning station is awesome.</li>
    <li> NOTE: YOU CAN NOT RETURN THIS SHAVER TO AMAZON.  Health and Beauty and \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; because of the alcohol cartridge.  Braun does have a 60-day return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver does a good job with my beard.  However:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  The shave is no better than my Remington Titantium at 1/5 of the price.  I shaved half of my face with each for awhile to compare.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The Remington trimmer feature is significantly easier to use on neck and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;3)  The cleaning unit is as loud as coffee grinder.  Really.  Can&#x27;t believe that the German engineers couldn&#x27;t do better.  Forget it if you are married!&lt;br /&gt;4)  The blue light on the shaver is as bright as a night light.  Lit up the whole bathroom -had to close the door to the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, sending it back to Braun for a refund.  With the money saved I can buy one heck of a lot of new Remington blades and foils. Squirt bottle of denatured alcohol will do the same thing as the fancy cleaner quicker and much quieter.  Light and noise are beyond acceptable.</li>
    <li> Been very satisfied with the closeness of the shave and especially the cleaning/lubricating system. However, I&#x27;m still having issues getting around the neck. Other than that, it&#x27;s an amazing shave.</li>
    <li> I have very, very sensitive skin. Nothing works for me. I walk around with red spots for half a day after shaving. Even my boss lets me shave every other day because of my condition. Well, not anymore! This shaver is as smooth as butter, mainly due to the pulsation frequency it is using, which is way higher than anything I used before. It literally glides over my skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> The Braun 7 gives a close, fast, and comfortable shave. Having switched to the 7 after using the 5 for a couple of years, I expected an improvement. But I was not prepared for the totally different shaving experience of the 7. It requires many fewer strokes across my face, shaves incredibly close, and is so sharp that I experience no burn or other discomfort. I have tender skin and even an eclectic can burn my neck. But not this one. It shaves so close that I can shave at night, saving time in the morning. By the next morning (36 hours later), I start to feel stubble. The shaver is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used electrics nearly all of my life and this one is in a class of its own. It gets all the hairs, including those lying flat and in difficult spots. Though a little noiser than the 5, the 7 is pretty quiet. I&#x27;m recommending it to my buddies who shave with razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use many of the bells and whistles. I just set it on the recommended fast and close setting. The cleaning unit is straightforward, and it tells you when you need to replace the fluid cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. Don&#x27;t worry about the price. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Braun Syncro shaver for almost 10 years. It still worked perfectly fine but a newer product usually means improvement, and this is such the case. If this one lasts as long as my other one, which still works, it&#x27;s well worth the investment. Cleaning times are short, closer shave than my older unit and much faster.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in a shaver this pricey. My five year old Norelco with blades needing replacement out performs this piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> The shaver came a lot sooner than expected, which is good.  It was pricey.  Obviously I have been out of the loop awhile.  I bought it for my son, but I&#x27;m assuming he liked it.</li>
    <li> i thuoght the cutting would be smoother a little choppy other wise it is a pretty damn good shaver .</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun razor over the past several years, and it is the best.  I was amazed the first time that I used it---it worked so smoothly and effortlessly at giving me a clean, close shave, and it is quieter than the previous models.  The cleaner does take a bit of getting used to.  In my bathroom space I have trouble making a permanent spot for it.  And when you first put the razor in for cleaning, it makes strange noises for a few minutes (my cats perk up their ears!).  But the finished cleaning process does make it worthwhile.  I am glad that I spent the money for this.  For some people who say it is a bad shave, there is a reminder that sometimes you have to use it for a few days to truly adapt to it.</li>
    <li> This shaver appears to be built with quality in mind.  I have had Norelco shavers for years and enjoyed their quiet smooth shaves.  This is the first Braun I have had and I am impressed with the balance and feel of it.  I also think this Braun shaves closer and faster than the Norelco.  Since I shave most everyday, a long heavy beard is not often an issue with me.  I noticed the closeness of this shaver the very first time I used it.  Time will tell if the foil screen is as durable as the Norelco heads.</li>
    <li> I CHOOSE THE RATING BECAUSE IT THING KICKS ASS&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NITHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT IT&lt;br /&gt;I THINK EVERY MAN NEEDS ONE</li>
    <li> You need to spend over $100 to get a Braun made in Germany otherwise it is made in China and they suck. On thing I don&#x27;t like is the disposable cleaning cartridges are expensive (42 drops of lemon essential oil and alchohol). because they are plastic and need to be changed every few months and then disposed of which is bad for the environment. However, the cleaning station works great and so does the razor.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, close shave, works exceptionally well.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for an electric shaver.get yours today. Thanks Braun</li>
    <li> I replaced an old Braun when it died and this one is light years ahead in terms of technology and performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 34y/o male who has been shaving for ~15 years.  I&#x27;ve never owned a Braun electric razor before but I expected more from the flagship model.  I will say it does look snazzy and I like the battery/hygiene meters built into it.  But I bought this for use, not bathroom decoration.  I REALLY have to dig the razor into my face to get a (mostly) close shave.  The self washing feature grinds like it is doing something but this is the only electric razor I&#x27;ve had that leaves me with clogged pores, making me look like an acne-riddled teenager again.</li>
    <li> I switched from electric shavers a few years ago because of bad performance.  I tried a few Braun and others but they just didn&#x27;t work well.  I hate to shave so I decided to give the new line of shavers a try.  I am very happy with this shaver.  It cuts very close and does it without having to spend an hour going over and over my face.</li>
    <li> Close shave, very fast.  Cleaning charging stand is bulky,  but great to have.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend he loved it :) comes nicely packed ! Def recommend great gift for the holidays !!</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate razor for those of us with a &#x27;wire brush&#x27; beard to attack every day. I&#x27;ve worn out a pair of 300-series Brauns over the years and this is all I expected it to be. The trimmer is out of the way and doesn&#x27;t get laid on the counter surface. And my lady says it&#x27;s gentle enough for her use.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t even mess around with other brands.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about the cost, but what a great shave and can take the razor on week long trips and the charge easily holds.</li>
    <li> shaved good but head would not lock for trimming as stated it should.  I talked to Braun and they said it should lock and told me to return it for a refund which will take 8 to 10 weeks.</li>
    <li> The Braun 790cc is very good product. I very like it. I will share it to my friends. It was over my expectation.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a gift. I have had a Braun shaver over the years and this one in clearly the best. Self cleaning function works well and is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Works great and is one of the best brands to use in the business!! They will last for years. Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Replaced a 10 year old Braun.  Extremely close shave.  Almost, but not quite, as close as razor with expensive brush on shave cream.</li>
    <li> Gave it about a 2 week trial period. I can grow a pretty thick beard, and typically shave about 4 times per week. I switched from a Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D. I loved that shaver. Best electric I ever had, until I couldn&#x27;t get replacement heads for it anymore. The new replacements they have aren&#x27;t the same. Anyway, it was my first attempt using a Braun shaver, and a non-rotary electric. Made sure I read up on how to get the best shave possible from this new shaver. Followed the tips, but never got a close shave. Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Insufficient around the jaw line. One of the tips suggests to stretch your skin in different directions to better apply the shaver in that area. The tip helps some, but still not a very close shave. I never had to contort my face in so many different way to shave when I used the 3D...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Difficult  to get all of the hairs of the upper lip, just under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to tell while shaving exactly where the cut will stop. For example, shaving near the edge of your side burns - there&#x27;s a little guess work to know how far up you are. Sure, you can bust out the precision pop up, but that&#x27;s not a close shave at all. Maybe with more time, you&#x27;d be able to get a better sense of where the stopping point is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Went over the same spot multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Worse on longer hairs. Shaving the next day wasn&#x27;t so bad, but waiting 2 or 3 days, and then shaving again, caused the shaver to have more difficulty cutting the hairs. On a positive note, I&#x27;ll say that I did not noticed any bad snags or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Last warning is that if you&#x27;re ordering from Amazon, and need to return this shaver, you may not be able to. It&#x27;s considered hazardous for some reason, and they will not accept it back.</li>
    <li> This razor works well on my medium tough beard.  The only issue I have found is that it shaves effective on my neck on either side of my throat.  It takes a little extra work there and I cannot shave as closely there as on the rest of my face.  Overall this is a very good shaver!</li>
    <li> Got it for my boyfriend and no more pricky stubble . I think He loves it too makes his job easier</li>
    <li> This is more a review of electric shavers in general. I am sure this is as good as they come, but I greatly prefer a razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;BUT this is a very good razor so far as e razors go.</li>
    <li> Excellent one. i am a first time user and it saves lot of time and does it perfectly.  the blade even comes for more than a year.</li>
    <li> nice shaver,however i&#x27;m not interested with the hi-tech decice,the Clean&amp;Renew station which costs extra money.For that station,i probably pay more $50.Acturally,i only want the shaver.The station is not necessary unless you would like to experience the high technoledge&amp;#34;automatic cleaning&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new shaver.  I switched over from being a Gillette guy for years, mainly because of the torture my neck went through using a razor.  My face often felt irritated and I would always get ingrown hairs in my neck.  Throw in some nicks and cuts every once in a while and you get the complete picture.  I used to shave in the shower after washing my face with many different pre-shave lotions and scrubs.  I also tried a ton of aftershave lotions.  Nothing worked 100% at alleviating the ingrown hairs and irritation.  I read a magazine article that talked about how razors scrape off a couple layers of skin which makes your skin form scar tissue which can leave you more suceptible to ingrown hairs.  It was something like that.  So I did a bunch of research and found the Braun series shavers were highly rated.  I went with the 7 because it had the hygiene cleaning feature.  I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and I love it.  The shave is all around better than with a razor.  It&#x27;s as close as the razor without the irritation and ingrown hairs on the neck.  I used to only shave in one direction (down) with one swipe which sometimes left some hairs.  With the electric razor I go in any direction I want and go over the area a couple times if needed.  They say not to do this but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin so I see no harm in taking a couple passes. I just changed the cleaning reservoir and it was definitly cleaning off shave residue so I&#x27;m glad I got that feature.  I&#x27;ve taken the shaver with my on a few trips the longest was 5 days.  The battery had 4 or 5 bars out of 6 left on the charge so plenty of juice and the hygiene bars hit 1 on the last day which means it wants to be cleaned.  I&#x27;ve also done the oh no I&#x27;m running late I&#x27;m going to shave in the car.  I never was able to do that with my razor.  Like I first said, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shaver.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> overall I gove this a 4/5. pretty good shaver, comfortable on neck and does a good job on the face overall.  I think the price could be lower though.</li>
    <li> Ok, for anyone skeptical about this razor, I can&#x27;t think of a better story than mine.  Three years ago, I bought a Braun razor - I believe it was a series 8000 or something like that.  It used the Clean &amp; Renew system like this one.  That was the best razor.  Then this past July when traveling, I lost my razor.  I suffer from an acute case of seborrheic dermatitis which makes me break out for nearly ANY or NO reason including if the air goes from hot to cold too fast.  My case got really harsh in my mid-30&#x27;s and I could no longer use a blade razor.  I had tried Norelco and all the others to no avail and then I came across that foil razor.  It was amazing.  So, to have lost it, I was in deep trouble to say the least.  I researched and researched and even looked around for the same model on other sites because there just couldn&#x27;t be a better razor than that one.  I found a couple but they were used and I can&#x27;t stomach the idea of using a razor that someone else has used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to Braun&#x27;s site and really dug into this razor.  It&#x27;s their top-of-the-line Braun and my head said get it but I&#x27;ve been fooled before.  I was using a blade razor once a week until finally I had reached a point that my face was swollen 5 days each week and I looked like I had been in a fight.  It had gotten embarrassing.  I stopped shaving altogether for a little while.  My beard is slow-growing but VERY coarse.  Finally, I broke down and ordered this razor near the end of September - last Friday as a matter of fact.  Today, when I got home from work, there was the razor.  I was hopeful but trying to keep my expectations low.  I took it out of the packaging and plugged it in and set it up for charging - setup took about 2 minutes - plug, plug, slide in cartridge, insert razor.  I waited 3 hours for it to charge really not wanting to shave with it because I knew it wouldn&#x27;t measure up to my other razor and my face would swell and I have a big day at work tomorrow with a lot of face time.  But all the more reason to shave, right???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just now at 10:00, I took the razor out of the charger.  First, it felt different - BETTER.  It really is easier to grip than the last one and the 360 head of the last one didn&#x27;t pivot quite as much as this one.  This one has a push-button power button rather than the slide like the last one.  I was really dreading this.  Then, I pressed the button and put it to my face.  Don&#x27;t apply pressure to this razor!  Just let it glide over your skin.  If you have a coarse beard like I did or if your beard is a little long, make two or three passes but don&#x27;t press it to your face with any pressure. If your beard is long, do the typical trim to get it prepared for a shave.  Then, just glide it.  MAN, I LOVED the feel of this razor.  In about 10 seconds, I felt at home again with my razor of three years but this one WAS better.  IT JUST WORKS.  Within 5 minutes, I was clean-shaven and my face was far from broken out - my skin was smooth and actually relieved now that the hair was gone.  ABSOLUTELY NO IRRITATION.  With the long beard, I expected there to be some pulling as my other razor had done that in its last few months.  Not the first hair pulled.  Oh, and those few little hairs that lie flat on the throat that you never seem to be able to get, I glided the razor over them just to see the results.  Smooth and hairless after two swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better yet, I finished my shave and sat down to read the instructions.  I know if any lady is reading this, she&#x27;s saying \\&quot;Typical man\\&quot; at this point.  With my old razor, the instructions called for replacing the shaving block every 6 months - those things were about $50.  As I read this one, the instructions call for the block to be replaced every 18 months.  So I&#x27;ll have three times the use between block purchases now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not familiar with the Clean and Renew system, just imagine going a week eating every day and dropping the dishes in a sink and coming home to find them all clean and put away and ready for your next meal.  That&#x27;s what Clean and Renew does for you.  Just drop your razor in, give it a second to tell you what level of cleaning your razor requires and press the button.  When you come back tomorrow, the razor will be ready for you to simply pull from the \\&quot;holster\\&quot; and start gliding.  I&#x27;m so completely impressed with this razor that I WISH I could be a spokesman for Braun on it.  I am too ashamed to show my face when I was broken out from the dermatitis but it wasn&#x27;t attractive at all.  This razor allows me to live a more normal life - something a lot of guys don&#x27;t have to think about when they are choosing a razor.  I can&#x27;t tell you how my stress level has decreased in just a few hours after opening and using the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, if you think you have a tough beard, just try the razor.  Ladies, if you have a picky husband who wants those that distribute the lotion, take it from someone who has tried that razor - the lotion dispenser gets clogged and dirty and the razor takes a lot of time to maintain.  THIS is a real guy&#x27;s razor.  No maintenance except a little money for the Clean and Renew cartridges - my last razor used one every 4 - 6 weeks and I expect this one will do the same.  The razor is always fresh and ready as long as you just press the button.  THIS razor will make you WANT to shave - maybe even TWICE a day.  Can I give it a higher recommendation?  Can I say anything else to make you buy this razor?  Well, my last Braun that I loved so much cost all of $300+ if memory serves.  This one costs $206.99 at amazon.com.  There is NO reason not to use this razor for your beard or not to spend a little extra money on your man to show him you care and make his grooming time a little less stressful.  No cuts, no pulling, no hair and no cleaning.  It just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  BUY THIS RAZOR!d coming home to find them all clean and put away and ready for your next meal.  That&#x27;s what Clean and Renew does for you.  Just drop your razor in, give it a second to tell you what level of cleaning your razor requires and press the button.

    <li> Very good product, high quality and works fine. I am using this for a time now and I am happy.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for my husband, This morning he said he is very happy with it and it is the closest shave he has gotten with an electric razor. Loves the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> For the price this razor is not worth it in my mind.  I bought this product because I heard it was good for sensitive skin.  I used it for just about 50 days and it said after a month you should start seeing a closer shave and your face should have become adjusted to an electric razor.  Well it started off fine but the last 2 weeks was torcher on my face.  I returned it to braun on the money back guarantee.  They did stand by that.  Thanks for the opportunity Braun.</li>
    <li> Very good, the price also is very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing.  I hesitated to spend this much on a shaver but then my Panasonic was lost on a trip.  This one is easily worth the extra money.  My only complaint is the built in long hair trimmer does not work to the same level (my Panasonic was better) as I would expect given the stellar performance of the rest of the shaver.  Even with that caveat this is easily the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great Product, quick shave as good or better than a blade. Great cleaning system. I would recommend this Shaver System to anyone.</li>
    <li> head never locked in place and now the lock button is missing. It apparently feel off some lost for ever. If this what braun puts out I will never buy one again.</li>
    <li> OK.... So this is like my first review ever normally I just read them. But, I just got done shaving with this Hog 9 minutes ago and all I can say is WOW!!! This thing mows through hair like a pig! No Joke, and it does this so smooth and effortless like a Cadillac gliding across my face with no irritation what so ever and shave oh so close, face like a baby bottom. In all fairness I stopped using electric shavers a few years back after the irritation from several Phillips Norelco rotary models and one Remington foil shaver got to be too much. Models ranging from the $180 Phillips Artic 1050x(which was a useless piece of junk that left neck and chin whiskers) down to the $45 Phillips 7310xl so I have used a wide range in quality shavers. I cannot believe the closeness and quality of shave I got from the Braun 790cc the first time using it coming from a Gillette Fusion blade razor. What happened to the break in period of like 1-3 weeks? All I can say is this is what an electric shaver should be.... I will expect and except nothing less from shaver from now on. WAY TO GO BRAUN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sure this is a bit more than some would like to spend but, in this case you truly do get what you pay for. It feels like one sturdy rugid piece of hardware compared to the cheap feeling shavers of the past. I gave this piece a good working. To get a feel for the razor I pushed down hard when shaving as well as let the blade do the work itself and it didn&#x27;t heat up or irritate my skin one bit, very efficient. I seriously love this rig so much I feel like River dancing and I don&#x27;t even know how...lol! I opted for the 790cc-4 over the 760cc-4 just in case I needed the quick clean feature one day and at a $10 difference I figured what the hell. Although besides color, the 5 min. quick clean and a different battery meter they are identical. If your thinking about getting this or are in the market for a new electric razor DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS RIG! I did a lot of research about the product and currently, Amazon has the best price on this. I will do and update in about 3-4 weeks after the so called break in period and hopefully have more on this. I actually can&#x27;t wait to shave again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -G. Martuccithe product and currently, Amazon has the best price on this. I will do and update in about 3-4 weeks after the so called break in period and hopefully have more on this. I actually can&#x27;t wait to shave again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -G. Martucci</li>
    <li> I use this for convenience, its quicker than using a blade but don&#x27;t think that any electric can out perform razors, it won&#x27;t get you nearly as smooth. It misses hairs consistently in a few areas on my neck, it takes 10-15 passes to get them all, yet it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation. The pop out trimmer works great, though it is hard to see what you are trying to trim. The cleaning system is  more of a bragging point, I would save some money and buy a shaver without.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He seems pleased with the shaver.</li>
    <li> My dad has a very coarse beard,and we bought him this for Christmas and he loves it. Said it&#x27;s by far the best electric razor he has ever owned. He was going to buy a cheaper one but mom held him off till after Christmas. boy he&#x27;s glad he didn&#x27;t go buy one now. My mother said that it is so easy to clean which is great for my dad. Easy is a good thing. So for the guy that uses a electric razor you probably should buy this expensive razor because it works and works very well.</li>
    <li> HUSBAND SAYS DOES GREAT JOB</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than using a blade.  I like the self cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> After having this razor for only two weeks, I am already willing to declare it the best razor that I have ever used. It is spectacular in it&#x27;s ease of use and cleanliness.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Braun shaver which I have owned during the past 20 years. The shaver usually lasts at least 5 years and provides a close, clean shave every time. The trimmer comes in handy to reach difficult places around the ears. I am a true fan of Braun, which provides the consumer with quality products, excellent customer service and a solid warranty.</li>
    <li> Paid almost $300 for it in Canada. Within 1 year the shaver would cut out in the middle of the shave. Turn it back on, cut out, over and over. Braun provided a replacement even though I didn&#x27;t have a sales receipt. Within one year the replacement shaver would cut out in the middle of the shave (sound familiar?). More annoyance, obviously a defect in some component, probably the switch. This time they wanted me to ship it across the border to Wisconsin and upon receipt a second replacement would be sent out. That was in September 2011, it&#x27;s now January 2012 and Braun claims it was never received. Like an idiot I went cheap and didn&#x27;t get a guaranteed delivery method. My shipper is investigating but I&#x27;m probably stiffed. Do packages actually get lost these days or did the receiving facility mishandle it?&lt;br /&gt;Who knows. I now purchased a Phillips at half the price and it seems to cut just as good.&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s customer service was good but I can&#x27;t purchase Braun products again.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my husband for Christmas.  He&#x27;s been using it since then and told me the other day how much he really likes it.  He likes the cleaning part; seems it knows when it needs to be cleaned and it does it itself.  It doesn&#x27;t shave like a razor of course but it&#x27;s the next best thing.  I&#x27;m not sure how this one compares to others that don&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Braun which I&#x27;ve had for 7 years.  The shave is close and the cleaning/charging system works great.  My only dislike is that it pulls hair several times during a shave.  Painful!  A redesign of the head is in order I believe.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this purchase.  I finally, after 18+ months, have had to order a replacement head at the prompting of the shaver (it was declining in performance for a few months) and I&#x27;m sure that will make it as good as new.  The price on this varies, so make sure you&#x27;re not paying too much.  If the price is high, wait a while.  There are various tools available for browsers to view Amazon pricing history to know if you&#x27;re getting a good deal.</li>
    <li> I had a prior series for years and it was time to upgrade. I was surprised at how much better this new version is and I believe it is worth the extra cost to get such quality.</li>
    <li> The best of the best, change my life</li>
    <li> This razor is worth every penny.  I kept getting ingrown hairs from other razors and sometimes they would get infected.  I&#x27;ve had this razor over a year and haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair at all!</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my dad as a gift, and dad loved it so much.</li>
    <li> This is the first Braun I&#x27;ve owned and have had it for about 9 months.  I mostly owned Norelco&#x27;s before this.  This provided a closer shave in less time than any Norelco I&#x27;ve owned.  My skin gets very dry in the winter months and I tend to get skin irritation on the neck with electric shavers.  So far I have not had that issue with this shaver, which is awesome.  I also like the self cleaning mechanism.  I was initially concerned about the price, but it has been well worth it.</li>
    <li> it is good，and 130.99 is  cheaper</li>
    <li> This is the second type of electric razor that I&#x27;ve tried.  The first was a Norelco, which I had high hopes for, but it didn&#x27;t even come close to the shave I got with a razor.  When it was time to start shaving my head on a regular basis, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot.  The Braun Series 7 works much better than expected.  I get a very close shave with none of the irritation I used to get with a razor.  If you&#x27;re thinking about switching to electric (or from another electric shaver), I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> The shaver is great.  It cleans my beard quickly without pulling even after a weekend going commando.</li>
    <li> After using Norelco rotary shavers for the past 40+ years, and just a couple years ago buying a Norelco seno 3D, Norelco suddenly stopped making the replacement heads for the shaver, and although there are some left, the price is 200+, more than the price of the shaver alone. Also, I&#x27;d always had frequent ingrown hairs, and assumed it was something I had to live with using an electric. Then I reviewed shavers extensively and found the Braun is not supposed cause ingrown hairs, Having never used a foil, I ordered the 790cc, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Way superior to the rotary, and the best shave ever, can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t read reviews sooner. Goodbye Norelco, I will never go back.</li>
    <li> This is a pricey shaver, but it also seems to be a very nice one. The cleaning station also seems to be much nicer than the first generation, which I had to take into a Braun service station for fixing every few years. It&#x27;s my opinion that this Braun shaves much closer than the first generation Series 7. Although my previous series 7 unit worked well, this one is better. You don&#x27;t notice how much things degrade over time, so even if you think your 10 year old shaver is fine, the new one works MUCH better. I recommend it. I don&#x27;t really care a lot about the LCD display on the shaver itself, but the added displays on the cleaning station are very nice - they&#x27;ll tell you how much longer your cleaning solution should last, and how dirty it thinks the shaver is. There&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;fast clean&amp;#34; button if you don&#x27;t want to wait for it to go through it&#x27;s whole drying cycle.</li>
    <li> really good i like it</li>
    <li> Good Price. Fast Shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> THis is the best razor i have ever owned . Worth the investment to anyone who has to use automatic shavers. This is a dream come true. Self cleaning and super clean and fast shave!! Under 5 minutes. Just bought a few cleaning cartridges. This Braun shaver absolutely dominates any other razor on the market.</li>
    <li> Came FAST and shaves great....</li>
    <li> good product,good price!</li>
    <li> ok...I&#x27;ve had this a little over a month and I will more than likely never purchase another razor again..took some time to figure out the most efficient way to shave...the hair on my neck is a little tricky..when I first purchased this I was moving the shaver too fast...now I move it slow...especially on my neck..&lt;br /&gt;I actually like to shave now...I don&#x27;t have a thick beard...my upper lip and chin are the heaviest spots..&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really care about the cleaning dock but I have to admit...it does a great job...I am a cheapskate though...I reseal the cartridge refills after every cleaning...theres alcohol in it and it would probably evaporate too fast if I left it open..&lt;br /&gt;If you hate shaving...buy this product</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Best Father&#x27;s Day gift!</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electrical razor. I&#x27;d write a review about it but we hall have different skin and hair types. The cleaning system is a bit excessive but is a nice add on. Love them</li>
    <li> I purchased another two for my brothers, great machine with high performance.</li>
    <li> 作为礼物送给了姐夫，挺好的~希望能够有更多的折扣~</li>
    <li> I like that it cleans itself.  Works well.  Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver.  I like it.  Speeds the morning up.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping; good value; positive experience</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband, who frequently gets painful, ingrown hairs.  He had tried every method of shaving, and nothing was working.  Braun is the best in shaving, but this model takes it to the next level.  He says this makes shaving easier than any other electric razor, and he rarely gets an ingrown hair anymore.  The self-cleaning function is also awesome!</li>
    <li> It was my first electric shaver, excellent product, have it for more than a year, no problem at all. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good.Happy shopping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite useful. And the price is lower than other.</li>
    <li> Not as close of a shave as I expected, but it&#x27;s nice that you can use it wet. We&#x27;ll see if it ends up rusting....</li>
    <li> fantastic&lt;br /&gt;it is so clean n cuts so smooth...the charge lasts for a couple weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so quiet...n sleek&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;buck</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many brands of electric and manual blade razors. This replacement for my older Braun is the closest shave yet! Outstanding! The quick clean feature is also nice. Only gripe is no foil cover protector but is not a big issue since it includes a nice case. I bought the 790 over the 760 as it has a few more bells and whistles. Both have the same cutter assembly.</li>
    <li> it worked very good for my head, i used to shave my head because i have little hair. someone needs to shave the head i recommended.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s used it only a few time prefers, old way of shaving. Does shave close enough.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing, didn&#x27;t know technology like this existed. I would&#x27;ve paid $400 for it.</li>
    <li> Far too expensive and they couldn&#x27;t provide a blade guard for when it&#x27;s out of the cleaner!?</li>
    <li> It is a little bit noisy but still good.</li>
    <li> It gives a good shave with low irritation. It may take a number of passes over your trouble spots to get that done, but to avoid the red patches it is worth it.</li>
    <li> The razor and cleaning kit is very convenient. Seems to be a pretty close shave with little to no razor burn. I like it so far but it has only been 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> It is very powerful, I loved it!</li>
    <li> WORKS FINE IF IN NEED OF A QUICK SHAVE BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLD RAZOR BLADE SHAVE.</li>
    <li> Amazing shaver and my husband likes it very much! German product is great and Amazon&#x27;s customer service is also good, it&#x27;s a very pleasant online shopping experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for around a year and very happy with it. I am using it to outline my beard (I am not shaving all my face), and at first I struggled a little bit with it, but with practice and when I learned to use the &amp;#34;Lock&amp;#34; feature it became very easy for me. Battery is amazing, I am taking it with me for trips over 2 weeks without the charging/cleaning station and it lasts for the whole trip.</li>
    <li> It is the best razor yet however, I still have problems shaving the neck.  I love the cleaning system</li>
    <li> Works nice. Quiet and nice travel case</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to replace my old shaver (about 7 years old).&lt;br /&gt;It works nicely and I love it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at getting a close shave. I appreciate the adjustment levels as well.</li>
    <li> I have been in the Braun family for 5 years and this by far is the best.  Great investment.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my naked in the tops of my cheeks. However I still need to use a razor to do the edges of my beard. I am still happy with the purchase, I no longer have razor burn or ingrown hairs all over my neck. I have a very thick beard and very thick whiskers, there is no razor that does not irritate me. This has given me much relief.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He looks like he has an after 5 shave right after using this, he&#x27;s disappointed. Apparently this can&#x27;t be returned? It&#x27;s a big loss.... :( What am I supposed to do with it?</li>
    <li> terrific to be able to buy this product online. Saved my husband searching all over Manhattan for a retailer. Thanks</li>
    <li> To all my brothers out there with the dark itchy razor bumps, this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an authentic user; no gimmicks.  Just brought it a couple of weeks ago.  And it is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used the standard razors, I started to form dark marks on my face and neck.  Many of the African American males in my circle experienced a similar issue.  This is because our skin is too sensitive for regular razors.  It cuts the hairs too deep, so the hair grows back ingrown into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REAL TALK: Invest in yourself. Nobody wants to go around with spotted, itchy skin (or see that).</li>
    <li> The razor is excellent. But the price I paid you was not. Costco now have this model for approx. $40 less than I paid you.</li>
    <li> I replaced my husband&#x27;s old Braun and he just loves it! Says it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever shaved with.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a much better shaver than my old 3-series. However, this one is only marginally better. Also, the trimmer isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned have tried foil and rotory shavers of all types. This is by far the smoothist and quickest to use. The cleaning station is a big plus. Always ready for the next shave!</li>
    <li> Close shave. Good cleaning system built in. Happy with this product. I had the previous Braun and it lasted 5yrs no issue then I dropped it and the screen cracked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of Braun shavers over the years but the Series 7-790 is the ABSOLUTE BEST SHAVER I&#x27;ve ever had or used. I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this shaver. It&#x27;s costly compared to others but, like I said earlier, it is without a doubt the ABSOLUTE BEST SHAVER you will ever own.</li>
    <li> Cuts slides very good on the skin and cuts very close!!</li>
    <li> Braun comparison Philips, I would like Braun. Because of his technique has been very perfect. This also brought a flush. Pretty good. Special love husband.</li>
    <li> great shaver-my other Braun died and I got this to replace-almost as close as a razor blade shave-great product-on Amazon saved almost 90.00 dollars</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun over the last thirty years. They last forever and give a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> The cartrige leaked out anywhere in box when i receivd it.</li>
    <li> Have always owned a Braun electric shavers. Last one lasted for almost 10 years. Ordered the Braun Series 7 790cc shaver and it  is without a doubt the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. As close as my blade.Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 is by far the best electric shaver that you can purchase on the market today. I have owned other Braun razors over the years, but the Series 7 is the best one I have owned yet. I get a very close shave by adjusting the level of intensity on this razor which I like because I have very sensitive skin and I am prone to Pseudofolliculitis Barbae or Razor Bumps. I also get ingrown hairs on my neck because of the electric shavers of the past. So far, with this razor flare ups have been minor but it is much better than the panasonic model I used to use. I am glad to see that is Razor is Made in Germany because you can definatly notice the difference in quality versus the Made In China electric razors. Overall I am glad I bought the Braun Series 7 Razor and hope it will last me for a long time.</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco for the past 30 years. I decided to look for newer technology for a better shave. After a lot of research,I found it in this razor. The cost and maintenance&lt;br /&gt;or comparable to all other in its class.</li>
    <li> As represented.  Clean shave. Expensive, but worth the high price.  Deleivered quickly. Could not find this Braun 790c shaver for less dollars.</li>
    <li> I was pleased that my son was able to get a really lose shave with this razor. He had been using a well known competitor shaver for years but just was not getting the close shave that he needed.  It is worth the price!</li>
    <li> every morningCi use it and every night Ci use it tooIevery morningCi use it and every night Ci use it tooIevery morningCi use it and every night Ci use it tooIevery morningCi use it and every night Ci use it tooI</li>
    <li> great, much less sound than my old 790</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this, its amazing. It comes with the clean&amp;renew station which charges and cleans automatically, cleaner cartridge, travel hard case which is cool.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i could say negative is that on the bottom screen with the power and hygiene meters are, it doesn&#x27;t light up. Even with that minor thing its an amazing shaving system.</li>
    <li> This razor has exceeded my expectations. The quality of the shaves has been outstanding, and the cleaning of the razor is very easy and effective.</li>
    <li> Better then described; and works great. Excellent deal for an open item and it was the black razor not the silver which was a awesome! Everything was there and works great and I like the adjustment feature from sensitive to intensive. I had the Old Series 7 Pule-sonic  and this is much better smoother and quieter. The cleaning is just as loud as the original and works great.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with electric razors for 20 years, mostly Braun.  My Braun 8595 (which was great) died, so I \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to this Braun 790cc.  Simply put, it can&#x27;t closely shave the hair above my lip.  Even after I shave, I look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  The shaver head is too big to shave the area of the upper lip. The Pulsonic technology is a joke. The shaver head is twice the size of previous models that didn&#x27;t have, and clearly didn&#x27;t need Pulsonic technology.  It is a gimmick. Also the blades are spring loaded, so the you can&#x27;t push the razor into your skin to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;And if that weren&#x27;t enough, this razor keeps missing patches of hair on my face. I have to \\&quot;re-shave\\&quot; with a blade to get the shave I had with my previous Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this over-engineered piece of junk to Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of a razor as good as the Braun 8000s?</li>
    <li> My closest shave in many years.  Comfortable, no skin irritation, fantastic build quality, charge/cleaning station is as good as advertized.  Also, the cleaning cartridges are just $12 for three months, and the foil/blades $33 every 18 months.  Spend the money, this IS worth it.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> My first electric razor in 20 years, and boy have things changed.&lt;br /&gt;Did my research before buying, and I feel like i made the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;A close shave, no burn, and quick too. The cleaning dock did a great job, and the feel of the razor suggests that it will last a long time. Quality construction, nothing cheap about it.&lt;br /&gt;Deducted one star only because of the high price. However, I do feel that I got what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it, you won&#x27;t even need the 60 day satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I came from using disposable razors and gel. I am required to be shaven for my job. I used a rotary electric years ago and have been turned off since. I impulse bought the Braun after only a few reviews and minimal research. The Braun 7 series is way easier and quicker than a razor. It is nice to not have to use gel and wash my face. I tend to put things off and this makes it less of a pain to shave with. I would say the quality of the shave on my face is just as good as a razor; the neck isn&#x27;t as good. I would buy this product again. I would just suggest buying the 4 pack of cleaning solution right away for like 20 dollars as well.</li>
    <li> I shave both my face an head, it does a wonderful  job!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband thoroughly enjoys it. He tells me that it is the best gift ever every time he uses it. I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> my 10 year old Braun 8985 shaver finally needed to be replaced. It worked well and I was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 790cc is even better. It shaves better than the old one. I have always had difficulty getting a close shave on my neck. The old one often left too many whiskers. But the new one gets them with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the shaver (without the cleaner or power cord) on a 2 week trip recently. I used it every day and it worked flawlessly. By the end of the trip the hygiene meter was all the way down, but the battery meter still showed 1/2 a charge left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;- the battery and hygiene meters. My old shaver did not have this.&lt;br /&gt;- it really shaves close and well. A great improvement from the old one.&lt;br /&gt;- it uses the same cleaning cartridges as the old shaver, so I can still use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The shipping was within literally 2 days! This is a birthday gift to my husband, he will not receive it till next month but I will update my review to see how much he likes it! Which I&#x27;m already sure he&#x27;ll love, he&#x27;s an easy pleaser. He&#x27;s looking for a better shave &amp; he&#x27;s always used low end things, so this is a good buy. My father has used this brand for 10 years + and all is needed is to change the foil and something else every couple of years and it&#x27;s good to go. Hopefully my husband will love it too! :)</li>
    <li> My husband love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> nice unit, verry god, thank you,</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of the Phillips Norelco 8800 until I went into world of shaving in Bellevue while a friend got a cut through shave, they asked me if I wanted one but I declined stating that I have such sensitive skin around my face it would not be pretty in the morning, i enquired as to what the best expectirc razor was and was told the Braun 790cc was the best of the best, as my Norelco was due to be replced (3 years) i bit the bullet and bought one, I have to say it is amzing, it glides over the skin and does not irritate my face half as much as the Phillips one does, it looks and feels a better quality and I do not get the usual rash around my neck anymore, this is a must for anyone like me who has sensitive skin and cannot wet shave.</li>
    <li> Very quiet as compared to my old shaver. But does not give me as close a shave</li>
    <li> an excellent razor.  My second braun series 7 razor and the conveniance of the auto cleaning is worth it. the shave is very nice.</li>
    <li> Works well with black curly hair</li>
    <li> My husband loves his razor. Best he has ever had!</li>
    <li> The best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. It gives the closest shave. The charge lasts longer than you&#x27;ll need for 3-5 shaves (even if you like to take your time like me). The cleaning feature is pretty cool. There are tons of at home recipes online to make your own cleaning solution if you want to save a few bucks too. Definitely worth the buy when it&#x27;s on sale too. I didn&#x27;t regret my purchase for one moment and this razor will stick with me till the day it dies.</li>
    <li> Shaves like my $40 Norelco rotary shaver.  Misses some hairs, has a hard time on the neck, especially the throat area.</li>
    <li> Had it for about 2 months and have traveled for a week straight without packing the charger or base.  It held the charge and worked well.  I had to clean it with the little brush provided.  Now back to the base and what does it really do?  I&#x27;ve stuck with Braun because the foil head works well on my beard.  Are the auto cleaning and the Pulsonic features really worth the extra cost?  In my opinion - NO.  I am really a very DIY kind of guy and the little extras don&#x27;t add up for me.  I&#x27;ve tried the various settings and don&#x27;t notice any difference in the closeness of shave.  Go with the more basic model and clean it yourself!</li>
    <li> Better than my last Braun shaver</li>
    <li> I have purchased at least six different shavers in my lifetime, and have always gone back to a blade. No more, this is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased. A clean smooth shave every time, even along the neckline, with no burn sensation when done. Letting the shaver do its thing with light pressure only, proves to me, I made a wise choice. The cleaning system works well, highly recommended !!!</li>
    <li> the best Shaver I have ever had! Compering to the Series 5 it&#x27;s just a god of the shavers....</li>
    <li> Awesome razor!! Well worth the money. I use it every other day on my face/head and it works fantastic. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good! I used rotary shavers for over 15yrs, I never though electric shavers could do any better than that.&lt;br /&gt;Then came this Braun shaver. It is superb!&lt;br /&gt;BTW, there is a guide on the internet to help choose the best shaver to each kind of beard / skin. Search the internet for &amp;#34;Electric Shaver Guide&amp;#34; on a site called &amp;#34;Electric Shaver Report&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very well made shaver and it works great. I was skeptical at spending more than I would normally for a shaver but I am glad that I did. Good buy!</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver and it replaces one I&#x27;ve used for the last 10 years.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of the shave and it seems much closer than my older Braun.  I use the razor six days a week and it gives a consistently close shave.  On those rare occasions where I don&#x27;t shave for several days it still works great.  While not the cheapest electric shaver on the market it is well worth the cost.  I&#x27;ve only had mine for a little over a month so I don&#x27;t know how long the cleaning cartridges will last.  I use the full cleaning function about three times a week and it says the cleaner is still \\&quot;full.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best shave yet and I have owned 3 of the previous series items by Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 5 Series shavers for well over five years, but didn&#x27;t go to the 7 Pulsonic Series two years ago because of price. I could kick myself now since this 7 series is a much better shaver...faster, smoother, closer, along with more bells and whistles on the shaver and cleaning system. The two blade heads have greater movement up &amp; down and the head unit follows the contour of my face better. At the moment price is approx $175, and this model qualifies for the August $20 instant rebate at checkout; net, $155.  Years back, I paid slightly more for the Braun Activator. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I returned the razor. I was not able to get a good shave with it. It was not as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> Liked this so much I bought a Braun 7000 toothbrush also.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver and I found that is quick &amp; easy to use . Also, I found that has good system cleaning that will protect our faces from any skin damage .</li>
    <li> Very convenient, is also very comfortable with. Send a colleague, he is very pleased, this is a good gift. I would like to recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I first bought a Braun for my husband for Christmas in 1999 and after 12 years it finally shaved its last whisker.  Being in a rush, my husband bought a Remington to fill the gap and has complained about it from day 1.  Well, Santa brought him a new Braun for Christmas this year and he LOVES this one.  Not being the one to use it, I can&#x27;t compare any of the specifics, etc., I just know he comments after every use, &amp;#34;I love this razor&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but if it lasts about as long if not as long as the last Braun, it&#x27;s $$ well spent.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my husband who had never used an electric razor.  Within a couple of days he said he would never go back to the lather and blade razor.  The electric razor saves time for him and gives a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaves.  Lights on shaver indicate when cleaning and recharging is needed.  Cleaning indicators commence too quickly after a cleaning.  Self cleaning does not clear the indicator...annoying.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST razor like ever!  The cleaning system keeps it sharp and clean all the time we actually purchased a second one for our other house we were that impressed.  I purchased through amazon and it was at my house in two days.  An excellent experience all around and the hubby&#x27;s face is nicer to kiss on now :)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun series 7-790 after reading many reviews of Braun and other razors. This is replacing my remington which gave a close shave but I could not stand the noise it makes any longer.  The Braun is so much more quieter and does give a closer shave.  Its a little pricey but still was worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after I had been at a Military school for about a month.  My face was getting destroyed from shaving every day, so I decided to invest in this Braun.  Now about a month after using this product, I am happy to report that this razor causes no irritation on my face and it shaves close enough to pass inspection.  The razor feels very solid and well made, and the cleaning station is a nice touch, but the blue light on it can sometimes be annoying since it is right by my head when I try to sleep (I live in a room the size of a broom closet.. lol), but other than that, I don&#x27;t regret buying this razor at all.  If you have the money, this is definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Great shaver but don&#x27;t expect to use this as a Trimmer.... You will be disappointed to see how useless the trimmer is.... Over great piece of engineering especially the hygiene function is good to have.</li>
    <li> Yep!  I find this hard to believe myself, as a life long wet blade shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally my reason for switiching to electric was due to my work, I have to look presentable, that means clean shaven all the time.  But sometimes I am time pressed so I have to shave in a hurry.  Hot water towel, shaving soap ritual takes too long, and sometimes just not feasible, because hot water simply is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in summer time, when it&#x27;s already hot and muggy outside, I really don&#x27;t feel like getting hot water treatment to my face and head. (Yes, I am a head shaver as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when shaving in a hurry, I ended up getting nicks and razor burns as well.  Not very presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But due to inertia, I proscnated for years before finally plunging on electric.  Wow!  What a difference.  I never could believe electric razor, and dry one at that could give shave as good as (not almost as good, but as good) wet blade shave without the nicks and the burns a lot faster and with no muss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One trick of getting a dry electric shave as good as wet blade shave is shave against grain, and learn the &#x27;topology&#x27; of your face and head and adjust the angle of &#x27;attack&#x27; accordingly.  Btw. it&#x27;s the same method as wet blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is no &#x27;learning&#x27; cuts and burns as in wet blade shave, just feel your face and head with your fingers if there is some stubble after the &#x27;attack&#x27;, you&#x27;ll feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now one reason why I think some &#x27;feel&#x27; that wet blade shave is a touch better than quality dry electric shave is that in wet blade shave, one doesn&#x27;t just cut the hair only, one also scrapes the grime, dirt trapped between the pores, by opening the pores of the skin through hot water towel treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big deal,  if one wants that &#x27;wet blade shave&#x27; feel, just scrape one&#x27;s face and head with face scrub soaked in hot water! after dry electric shave.  You get the same that &#x27;wet blade shave&#x27; feel without the cuts and burns, and a lot less muss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally for some who complain about Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution costing too much, I&#x27;d say, go soak your head, it&#x27;s only a few dollars a month, plus you would be saving money in time wasted on cleaning and drying, shaving cream, pre-shave oil, and what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides one doesn&#x27;t buy Mercedez S600 and complain about poor gas mileage and premium gas one has to buy!s, and a lot less muss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally for some who complain about Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution costing too much, I&#x27;d say, go soak your head, it&#x27;s only a few dollars a month, plus you would be saving money in time wasted on cleaning and drying, shaving cream, pre-shave oil, and what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides one doesn&#x27;t buy Mercedez S600 and complain about poor gas mileage and premium gas one has to buy!</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with all types of shavers ever since I remember shaving. I have tried hot towels, disposing of razors after 2 uses, chemical shavers, and Norelco shavers. This shaver is by far the only machine that does not irritate my face while allowing a closer shave than with any other method. I highly recommend it to guys with ingrown hair issues and sensitive skin.[[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]]</li>
    <li> This shaver lives up to it&#x27;s great billing.  Lightweight, feels good in your hand and does a great shaving job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Rinseable design is great for when you don&#x27;t want to do a full cleaning.  Super close shave, lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The trimmer that pops out is a bit annoying to use.  Not as accurate as the old version.</li>
    <li> For about half a century, I have used Philips Norelco rotary shavers almost exclusively. Every few years, the current unit would break or wear out and I&#x27;d simply buy the latest model. I went through this process last year and found that the newest Philips shaver shaved less well that the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started reading reviews of competitive devices on Amazon and elsewhere and decided to try a Braun. I&#x27;m glad I did! I&#x27;ve used it daily for a couple of weeks and found that it shaves much closer! For anyone thinking of switching, I highly recommend trying the Braun.</li>
    <li> The battery is worn out and has to be replaced in one year, which is not worth its price at all.</li>
    <li> I based my purchase using the braun web page and their recommendation on my shaving needs. This shaver has done everything it said it would do. Would highly recommend to anyone that was a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver, after shaving with regular Gillette manual razors for ~7 years. This machine has cut down my shave time considerably and the shave is *nearly* as close. I have problems with completely eliminating the hairs near my Adam&#x27;s apple, sometimes I can get them closely shaven, other times they remain no matter how much i stretch the skin around that area. I don&#x27;t like the trimmer built-in to the shaver, it frankly sucks, awkward placement and sucky cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the system/dock I really like the cleaning system. I have had this shaver for ~7 weeks and I am still on the original cleaning fluid cartridge, the dock shows it is at half-life, so I fully expect to squeeze 3 months cleaning life from each cartridge. I don&#x27;t go to extremes like other reviewers to squeeze 6 months out of the cartridges; I simply only clean the shaver when the display on it is showing the machine is dirty (1 bar left). My only complaint is the noise the dock makes when cleaning the shaver, but I guess it&#x27;s necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase, definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the number one ranked shaver and very expensive.  Braun should concentrate on the quality of the shave before adding all the other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should state the item can not be returned, I could buy at a local store and return it.</li>
    <li> I owned the old series 7 but lost the power cord...&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item and it v&#x3D;came with the clean &amp; renew system that also charges my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied, and it came as described and on time.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7-790cc is a good product. I love it so much. Guys, you can have a try! You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an improvement in the efficiency of the electric razor I use.After a few years of different Brauns I switched to Phillips rotary types for the last 7 or 8 years and decided they did not do a good enough job plus the shape makes it very hard to keep a straight line on the sideburns. So I purchased the latest Braun. It cuts better and quicker but is very heavy and no trimmer attachment. Overall, I do not thimk it offers a worthwhile improvement. I would not recommend it over the rotary one.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun for over 30 years and this new model is better than any other electric shaver that Braun has produced. I have nothing to report about shortcomings.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever Amazon review. I felt compelled to write it because I am so thrilled with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past six years, I have been using an electric razor daily to shave my face and head. I&#x27;ve had a succession of three Panasonic razors, the last one being the ES-LA93. I had opted for the Panasonic since they had the most powerful motors, and honestly they did give me a good shave, but the blades are very expensive, and for my usage needed to be replaced every 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been dithering about trying the Braun for several years. I read countless reviews comparing the ES-LA93 to the 790cc. Most gave the Braun a slight edge, which led me to take the plunge. I am most please that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Braun provides a noticeably closer and somewhat more comfortable shave. The foils are much more responsive. I assume the closer shave is the result of the \\&quot;Opti-foil\\&quot;, which seems to be thinner. The motor is not as powerful as the panasonic, however it does not \\&quot;bog down\\&quot; at all, and the razor runs much cooler against my skin resulting in a more comfortable irritation free shave. Also, the cleaning station does a much better job than the Panasonic. Finally, when the blades do need to be replaced, the cost is appx. $18-20 less than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the 790cc is a home run. I actually look forward to shaving again!</li>
    <li> I buy it at a low price ！Clean shaven and easy used through the weeks.You deserve  it  .Such a pleasant shopping trip</li>
    <li> So let me get this out of the way.  Is it as close as a blade?  No, but keep reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best electric shaver I have used.  My routine went from 10 minutes to 3.  The shave is not as close as a blade but it is acceptable for every day appearances.  Might be a little iffy in the military but for regular business it does just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs the best with day old hair and anything longer than 2 days will need a cleanup run with a razor (just with water).</li>
    <li> I noticed a lot of the reviews on here are from people who have had a multiple very expensive electric razors, so i&#x27;d like to give the point of view of someone coming from a gillete mach 3 and a norelco rotary electric razor. I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 shaves so far and i have to say it really seems amazing. That&#x27;s considering that it mentions that you won&#x27;t get the best shaves until your face has adjusted if you&#x27;re coming from a rotary or regular razor. The norelco i had was about $100. It did an okay job but the shave lasted only for maybe half a day and i was never really able to get a close shave, so i would alternate between the regular razor and the norelco to keep a clean shaven look. This series 7 really makes it look like shaved with a regular razor. The only difference is that the razor will last me until the next day and the Braun i&#x27;ll start seeing hair late at night. It&#x27;s much, much faster than the norelco. With the norelco it would take me forever to get a decent shave. Long enough to make me consider just shaving with the regular razor every time i used it. The braun is nice looking, fast, gives me close shave, and is pretty loud. The hair trimmer really is at an odd angle, but works great, not like the one on my norelco. I&#x27;ll have to come back to comment on the cleaning system, but as far as the Series 7, it does an amazing job. I also got an awesome deal. This top of the line model cost me about as much as the low end ones cost. Win!</li>
    <li> A number of years ago, I purchases a $70 foil style Remington electric shaver.  I didn&#x27;t stay with it long as it caused my face a lot of irritation and I never got a close shave.  I even used some of the \\&quot;before shave\\&quot; liquid stuff and it helped but not enough.  I went back to the \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; blades and shaving cream and would go 4-5 days between as I am retired.  I don&#x27;t like to wait that long as my beard gets itchy especially in the heat.  I bought this shaver and used the first time and knew this was going to work for me.  I&#x27;ve used it 6-7 times and each time it gets better.  My shaving time is getting shorter and the closeness is improving too.  I plan to shave every other day with this before I shower.  Braun suggests not washing your face before use as I assume the skin oils help lubricate.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is OK but I put it in the base after each use so it is fully charged.  You would have to take the cord along with you on a week long trip.  The base and cleaning system works well but as I read in a review, it is bit noisy while cleaning which lasts about 20 minutes or so.  It is about as loud as using the shaver on your face.  I&#x27;m not so concerned about the price of the cleaning cartridge nor the fact that the foil and blades should be replaced every 18 months.  The Gillette Fusion blades I was using before are pretty pricey and now I don&#x27;t look all grubby after 2-3 days.  I have no doubt I will be using this shaver every two days from here on out.</li>
    <li> I have gone back and forth, foraying with Braun wanting them to be as good as they used to be. My previous shaver was a Panasonic.  Decided to give the Bruan 790 a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Looks good&lt;br /&gt;+ Feels good in my hand - nice weight, shape, etc&lt;br /&gt;+ Hasn&#x27;t pulled any hairs&lt;br /&gt;+ Quiet(er) than my Panasonic by ALOT except when cleaning&lt;br /&gt;+ Speed - my shave with a 2 day stubble (and I have a thick, heavy beard) is done much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;+ Thoroughness of shave is better - the Braun does a better job of those pesky neck hairs that are curved or lay flat&lt;br /&gt;+ Cooler - stays cooler at the end of the shave&lt;br /&gt;+ Travel case - nice case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Beard Shadow - I get a more noticeable beard shadow by mid-day (my Panasonic did not leave me with a shadow for a few extra hours)&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning solution - I personally like the Panasonic design of dry cartridges and adding water&lt;br /&gt;- Noisy when cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer - most trimmers are not great but this trimmer seems sub-par&lt;br /&gt;- Cord - it&#x27;s coiled cord that gets stretched REALLY easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Braun to anyone BUT I would also highly recommend the Panasonic OVER the Bruan especially when you can save $30-50 on the price.  I&#x27;ll keep the Bruan for now but will swich back to a Pansonic when the Braun dies (should be about 2 years based on my last Braun).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 790 for the past year with outstanding results. The shaves are close, quick and easy without the irritation that I would get using double edge razors or cartridges. I wash my face in the shower with an oil removing soap, dry my face, then rub on a very light coating of Face Saver talc before I start shaving. Four or five minutes later my skin is smooth even when rubbed against the grain. I only use the cleaning station about twice a month for a deep clean, since the foil and blades can be washed with soap and water. Five stars from me for the Braun 790.</li>
    <li> This item is priced as above ¥6000（equvalent $938) in a store in China.WTF.Purchasing here is a great deal for customer from China.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun for many years and loved it.  Finally it died and I bought this model.  After a couple of weeks I can say that it is an awesome shaver.  I have a heavy beard and this Braun does a really nice job.</li>
    <li> The best electric razor I have ever owned. I love the automatic cleaning system.It will last seven days on a vacation without charging, and still give you a perfect shave everytime.</li>
    <li> 1. The shaver does not have a cover for the delicate foil shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;2. The travel case does not have space for the recharger.&lt;br /&gt;3. The travel case is not designed to hold the small cleaning brush. The brush will be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above 3 defects in design do not figure for a Company like Braun other than they want you to spend more money to replace a damaged shaver head, a lot charger, and a brush that fell out of the travel case.</li>
    <li> This was a gift that I bought for my son. This is going to be his third Braun shaver. He is so fond of them all.</li>
    <li> I came from about two decades of Norelco use. Those shavers were fine enough, I guess, but when I knew I had to buy a new one, and based on how long I have them, I figured getting \\&quot;the best\\&quot; might be money well-spent. I did the research and this was the one that looked like it was the top, so I went for it, and I am glad I did!! It offers the closest shave of any electric that I have ever tried *by far*. And this new thing about the charging/cleaning station is really outstanding: every time you put the  shaver to your face you know it is as clean as it can be and all charged up. No work on your part at all. I LIKE IT. Highly recommended! Hope it lasts... so far, I am betting it will.</li>
    <li> I would really love to be able to throw my Gillette ProGlide razor in the trash, or at least put it away, if I had a reliable and mostly foolproof method of shaving with an automatic. Nothing against the ProGlide since its the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used but I just really prefer the simplicity of this sort of system. Its been years since I used a foil or rotary razor and I was hoping that the Braun Series 7 would enable my dream to become a reality... close but not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave for a foil razor. Lets not fool ourselves and pretend I&#x27;m comparing this to my ProGlide, hairs will be left a bit longer, need to be reshaved a bit sooner, and appear a bit darker (if you have black hair like I do). Still I consider this shave fairly smooth once you&#x27;ve gone over the same area a few times from different directions.&lt;br /&gt;Quality materials and much cheaper than some of the Panasonic wet/dry. Its very hard for me to say which gives the better shave since I haven&#x27;t tried those, but I simply wasn&#x27;t willing to pay twice as much for some of the other quality razors on the market. If you have realistic expectations this shaver will likely meet them for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to take on a trip. I took this on vacation and I found it very easy to use, it stayed charged and was function even without the daily use of the washing stand.&lt;br /&gt;Nice cometic touches on the razor itself. It looks nice, feels nice, good grip.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner lasts a long time. Didn&#x27;t seem to drain much with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird hairs it will not get under any circumstances. This may seem odd to you (it certainly did to me) but there were some hairs I simply could not get this razor to cut at times. It wasn&#x27;t a consistent problem but I couldn&#x27;t figure out why it was happening. I&#x27;d try coming at them from every angle, multiple times, even circling the razor. No idea what the problem was since my manual got it.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly speckled base (on the black). This may not bother most people but it did me slightly so I thought I&#x27;d mention it. The cleaning base has little metallic flecks through the black that look a bit like dust. Not a deal breaker but if you get a little OCD about this kind of thing, fair warning.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly odd smell from cleaning product. I&#x27;m a bit sensitive to odors, and this certainly isn&#x27;t terrible, but there is a light scent when you bring it up to your nose even if its been cleaned the day before.). This may not bother most people but it did me slightly so I thought I&#x27;d mention it. The cleaning base has little metallic flecks through the black that look a bit like dust.

    <li> Excellent shaver. Definitely the closest shave I have ever had from an electric razor. I&#x27;m not totally convinced that the cleaning system is really necessary but it is quite cool and I do use it at least once a week. I took the shaver on a 4 day business trip (without the cleaner or recharging cable) and it performed like a champ, with no sign of a diminished battery. The shaver is 5 star without a doubt. As for value for the money, I would probably drop to 4 stars due to the high cost. I&#x27;m not saying it was not worth the cost but it is certainly a bit of an indulgence.</li>
    <li> I have always used electric shavers (Remington &#x3D;&gt; Norelco &#x3D;&gt; Braun).  The Braun series 7 - 790cc was a gigantic step in close, smooth shaves.  No comparison to my prior Braun.  I highly recommend it.  Mike</li>
    <li> My husband and 17-year-old son share this shaver and say it is a good, durable product that gives a close reliable shave, is easy on the skin and easy to maintain and keep clean. What else can you ask for? My husband uses it everyday and our son uses it several times a week, so it gets a great deal of wear and is dependable and easy to use. We would definitely recommend this product and will be buying another for our son next year when he goes off to college!</li>
    <li> So you like electric shavers and still don&#x27;t have a Braun Series 7? What are you waiting for? This is the closest and cleanest shave ever, fast and sure. Easy to clean. I&#x27;m fully satisfied!</li>
    <li> very smooth shave, easy to use, very comfortable, great shaver, would buy it again, battery life is very long, travels well</li>
    <li> Overpriced.  This series works ok but does not last more than a year.  Suggest another brand which would be less expensive.</li>
    <li> Love my Braun Series 7 razor.  Was replacing an older Braun and this one works really well.  The fit in the holder is somewhat suspect, but overall works great.  Holds a charge for long trips around a week or so depending on overall use.  Display on this is good, but all a bunch of hype in my opinion.  Sounds good when buying, but not really needed or used.  Overall I like it.</li>
    <li> Great machine, thesis my third Braun an al seem to be well built and do what they are made to do, and that is to give you a close chafe comfortably, and I agree they do.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my fiance. I don&#x27;t think he will every buy a different brand again. He loves the shave and the self cleaning! He finally shaves more than once a week!</li>
    <li> excellent- perfection would be that a close shave could be had a bit faster. I am sure you will find&lt;br /&gt; a way soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for decades, since the 1980s, always wet/dry models. I&#x27;ve liked Panasonics best in the past, and my least favorite was a Norelco. My Norelco recently died after less than a year of use, and I bought this Braun. It&#x27;s immediately become my favorite. It&#x27;s the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using. It charges quickly and stays charged for a long time (two weeks and running on a charge), and it shaves CLOSE-- closer than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used -- with just a couple of passes, with no razor burn. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and recommend it to anyone who thinks using an electric in the shower results in poor shaves. It&#x27;s also very solid and well-built.</li>
    <li> 1)On every monday(I don&#x27;t shave on saturdays and sundays) it pulls my beard once or several times. I think this is caused by middle blade. Although i replaced the shaving head with a new one, this problem&#x27;s persistence made me think that it&#x27;s about bad design of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;2)Cleaning kit cleans and lubricates well but shaver lubricates my skin as well :) at my first use after cleaning. Besides bad feeling, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s harmless to contact some agents in alcohol based cleaning solution with my face.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 years of practice, my thought is to try panasonic.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!!  Gives a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Shaves close to the skin. Cleaning system works well.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life! Best razor and system I&#x27;ve ever seen!!</li>
    <li> Work best when you use shave gel. Closest shave i&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor but I find myself using my razor blades when I&#x27;m in a rush. Takes longer to use the braun you have to run it back and forth several times to get all the hair. Warning!!! Hair with grow back thicker and wiry. If I don&#x27;t shave for a day or two my wife literally feel like she is getting poked By needles when she kisses me</li>
    <li> I have tried a LOT of electric shavers over the years and have had this now for almost a year. I use both this and blades, kind of back and forth depending on how much time I have. When I am really in a hurry I grab this Braun. It never, never irritates my skin and I have sensitive skin with winter eczema sometimes. It gives a very close shave the the cleaning system is awesome, worth every penny for this shaver. I sometimes shave on the road, in the car, if I&#x27;m in a hurry. It shows you the level of power left at the bottom and how dirty-the level of cleaning needed etc. No electric shaver will shave quite as close as a blade and I believe no one saying it does. However, this is close and very good. It&#x27;s handy, gives a close shave, worth it!</li>
    <li> It is very comfortable when I use,but a little noisy。</li>
    <li> Expensive, but really gives you a close shave. The clean stations keeps it oiled and in prime shape.  Highly recommend this system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the prior two models. This series 7 is the most powerful and gives a phenomenal shave. I will say it&#x27;s more difficult to clean - can&#x27;t really do it manually.</li>
    <li> It was a little expensive, but it meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> Very solid product my dad has had the same model for 15 years still works I got my own and love it.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had from an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this shaver works! This is only the second time I have shelled out more than $100 for a shaver and the last time was a disappointment despite all of the research I did beforehand. I&#x27;ve been using modest single-foil shavers since (mostly Braun and Panasonic) but they have worked less well as my hair ages with white hairs that are too soft to catch in the screen and others getting more stiff. If I went a day without shaving, it took twice as long to shave the next and a week of no shaves would mean over an hour trimming it down with a hair trimmer first then trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this Braun has sailed through everything. It worked so well that I went a week without shaving just to see how it would handle it and it didn&#x27;t take any longer than a daily shave would, thanks (I&#x27;m guessing) to the blades in the middle that snip everything off at a manageable level. The head locks easily at an angle to use a single foil for the areas that are tough to reach (upper lip, for me).&lt;br /&gt;I only use the cleaning system about once a week and that appears fine from what I have read online, which means the costs for cleaning solution should be much less per year. I don&#x27;t care for the fake &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; scent, but it goes away quickly after you take the shaver out after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with the more expensive models - I can&#x27;t see how they could do any better than this.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Braun Series 7-790 for 3 weeks and never got a close shave.  Going back to my Gillette Pro-glide.  Nothing will ever give you as close a shave as a traditional razor.  Don&#x27;t buy this, you will end up returning it.  I returned 2 different electric shavers.  The both did not shave close, you have scruff within a few hours. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I had a 10 year old panasonic razor that was causing me all sorts of irritation despite replacing blades.  This 790-CC is amazing, after one shave there&#x27;s no razor burn or discomfort at all and my face is smoother than its been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning, while pricey if you go through refill often, is great and makes the shaver easy to use.  I put the cap back on the tank to preserve its life, so hopefully my order or 4 extra will last me a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its nice to be able to get back to a regular shaving schedule since this makes it so effortless after having suffered for years, even growing full beards rather than mess with my old shaver. No cons here, i love this shaver.</li>
    <li> Works great over a year later!  Worth the money!  Consider making your own cleaning solution to save some extra money.</li>
    <li> Love my series 7 braun, the last one lasted a few years then started getting really loud, was gonna send it in to Braun to see if it just needs lubricating but decided on a new one when they went on sale over Christmas for $150.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Series 7-790cc in May 2012. Really liked the shaver and the auto cleaning system. Used the shaver daily without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is with the pop-up trimmer on the handle. It is very difficult to open and close. My unit completely broke and now won&#x27;t close.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe that this shaver was designed in such a way. The trimmer is positioned in a position that is very difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;When open, it is very difficult to see what you are trimming in a mirror as the shaver hides anything that is being trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;But the shaver itself is excellent. Very good shave. Comfortable and easy to use. I travled with just the shave often and was easily able to clean it under running water in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I will be able to send the unit to Braun for repair/replacement.</li>
    <li> My fiance is loving his new shaver!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to the ratings.  Missed many spots.  on the other hand Braun has a great guarantee, so he sent it back.</li>
    <li> I like it shaves well  C&lt;br /&gt;cleans it&#x27;s self. Really a big improvement</li>
    <li> I was nervous due to a couple of negative reviews, but gave it a try:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Excellent price&lt;br /&gt;2) Fantastic shave&lt;br /&gt;3) Great manufacturer customer support (contacted to be certain of what I had received and a how-to)&lt;br /&gt;4) The liquid cleaning cartridge lasted two months(?) I replaced the original about two-three weeks ago&lt;br /&gt;5) The replacement price of cleaning cartridges is a FRACTION of what they used to be&lt;br /&gt;6) Ergonomic design and shaving comfort make me look forward to daily shaving, as opposed to before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is SO-O-O good I&#x27;m hoping to never need to buy another razer.</li>
    <li> After fully loading, I shaved for 3 weeks. Very fast, close shaving. I am very satisfied.i AM RECOMMENDING THIS SHAVER TO MY FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> Great shave. I&#x27;ve used an older Braun model for years.  The Series 7-790cc works great, and it&#x27;s a good upgrade. The middle setting gives me a close shave with comfort.</li>
    <li> Such a low price to buy, so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Before always like this product very much, but the price is too high, thank you for giving me such a low price.I like it very much,The future will continue to pay close attention to Amazon.</li>
    <li> This razor has been excellent. The self cleaning is great. Cleans and charges quickly and works as expected -- good close shave. Only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that it it tough to work on beard detailing.. around corners of face, but can do so once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift and was very excited to try it. Charged it up and tried it for a few days, seems to pull the hair out instead of cutting it and the shave isn&#x27;t close at all. I got about the same shave as with a $15 razor I got at wall-mart. Maybe I got a bad razor, I&#x27;m not sure, but mine was sent back and is not worth anywhere near the price it sells for. Don&#x27;t waste your money and if you need to use their 60 day money back guarantee you can expect to wait 8 weeks for braun to get around to sending you a refund.</li>
    <li> This shaver does everything is advertises and provided a great shave.  I upgraded from the 6 series and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  If you are looking for an electric razor, this is it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product and delivers an outstanding shaving experience. Since the product has already been reviewed in great length I wanted to focus my review on one particular aspect that seems to stir up some controversy: wet vs dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some that use this razor as a wet razor meaning they use it to shave with shaving foam, gel, or other like products. Others, rightfully so, point out that this model is not rated as a wet shaver and uphold that 1) the razor would not perform well \\&quot;wet\\&quot; since it&#x27;s not designed to shave with foam and 2) that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving might damage the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact is, there is only one model in the Series 7 lineup that is officially rated as a wet shaver, the 7-799cc. Unfortunately, that model is not available in the US and Canada. At least not at the time this review was written and since the 7-799cc has been out for a while now I doubt it will come to the US at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, all the Series 7 models use the exact same shaver head (Braun only makes one for the 7 series) and the same pulsonic shaving mechanism. The ONLY difference between the 7-799cc and other Series 7 models is the amount of water insulation of the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the 7-799cc is completely water insulated and can be completely immersed in water. The unit can therefor safely be used in the shower. That is NOT the case for the other Series 7 models which should NOT be used in the shower since water can get into the power plug hole and damage the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, all models are completely water insulated around the shaver head. Braun advises to rinse the shaver head under running water with the shaver turned on (although unplugged for safety reasons) for manual cleaning. The user manual also states that it is ok to rinse the shaver with a mild soap solution. Obviously, alcohol based solutions (which have very low surface tension) aren&#x27;t a problem either since that is what the cleaning station uses. Exposing the shaver head to shaving foam/gel etc would therefor not be any more of a problem than cleaning the shaver manually by rinsing it under running water, soap, or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That means all Series 7 models are fine to be used as a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaver as long as one does not expose the unit to more water than one would when manually cleaning it per manufacturer instructions. In other words do NOT use it in the shower and keep water off the body of the razor. As far as shaving performance goes, the 7-790cc would perform identical to the 7-799cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you should use it as a wet shaver comes down to personal preference. I personally find that I get a slightly closer shave when shaving wet and the razor glides much more smoothly over the skin. On the other hand the dry performance is still outstanding and since it&#x27;s faster and more convenient I only use the wet shave when I need an extra smooth shave for special occasions.on uses.

    <li> I bought this while it was on deal. I now feel it is worth buying even if it is not on deal. Very cool shaver, clean shave everytime i use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Simple, cool and perfect and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Little louder on noise end.&lt;br /&gt;It show unhygiene after every 4 shaves.  For ppl who shaves daily the cartridge will last only 1 month. then it will be expensive on cost end.</li>
    <li> i like it very much ,Very suitable for Asian people&lt;br /&gt;the price is very good.It cost me 130-40 dollars. God bless America.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. The Noise is lighter than Philips&#x27;s. The cleanning station is also very smart. Next time, The products by Braun will be my first choise.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my huwsband.  It replaced the Series 3 that he was never happy with.  He says this is the perfect shaver.</li>
    <li> Just shaved with this and I love it.  I suffer from extreme skin irritation shaving with a regular razor and shaving with my braun I don&#x27;t get any skin irritation.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It was a Xmas gift from my girlfriend and all I can say is wow!! It shaves as close as a blade with no irritation whatsoever.  It is very smooth on the skin and I love the after cleaning smell. This is my first Braun product, I&#x27;m sure I will become a loyal customer. All I can say is buy it!!!</li>
    <li> good i like it so much HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product, I love it!Thank you!The future will continue to shop in this!I am very satisfied with this product, I love it!Thank you!The future will continue to shop in this!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Easy to use and good results.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old 7000 series that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer.  Great razor!  Fast and powerful... picks up pesky flat whiskers easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in 2011 and am writing my review about a year later.  This product works very well.  I shave about three times a week and am unable to shave with regular razors due to a nickel allergy.  Though this product did take a few weeks for my face to &amp;#34;get used&amp;#34; to it, it shaves close with very little irritation and cuts through multi-day stubble with ease.  I use the cleaning feature about every three shaves (when the display indicates a cleaning is needed) and it does seem to keep it pretty clean.  One year later, it&#x27;s still cutting as good as it did on the first day (minus the break-in period).  The battery life seems really, really good. I only plug the unit in to clean, and it keeps a full charge (at least based on the battery life indicator) the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hint to save on the cleaning packs is to remove the cleaning pack (and re-plug the cleaning pack) when not in use and only keep it in the unit when cleaning.  Because of this, I have been able to only use 2 cleaning packs in the past year (partially because I only shave every few days as well, and probably because I try to empty the razor after each shave).</li>
    <li> Ive had for years now and still does great</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my teenage son as his first electric shaver. I personally love the developments that Braun have made in these shavers over the years. Having owned one of the original Pulsonic models with the cleaning base that has given me endless close shaves, it had to be the product for my son&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
    <li> So far i did not use electric razor. A few days ago i bought Braun Series 7 and i am very happy now. fantastic shave for electric razors if only you use it everyday. You will enjoy with it.</li>
    <li> learning how to use it</li>
    <li> As advertised good product&lt;br /&gt;Self cleaning excellent works&lt;br /&gt;Better than other brands tried in past&lt;br /&gt;Better than Remington and few other brands tried&lt;br /&gt;Self cleaning liquid can be obtained&lt;br /&gt;Lowes Dept Store in gallon size and&lt;br /&gt;poured into plastic container came with  shaver&lt;br /&gt;Use lavendar oil for scent if wish</li>
    <li> Do not get a close shave. Will return it!</li>
    <li> Only one month in operation -- gives a good electric shave and the self-cleaning takes care of itself.  No issues.</li>
    <li> Well, I had high hopes for this shaver. I gave it to my husband for Christmas, hoping it would be good for travel. However, he is not getting as close a shave as he does with a razor. He reports that it works fine but he has to go over and over his neck. Perhaps an electric shaver can never get as close as a razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read that you get what you pay for in electric razors, but I&#x27;ve never had any luck. I finally splurged on this one due to the great reviews here and on thewirecutter.com  Unfortunately, it just works ok under my jawline. You HAVE to remember to use it every day under there as it has trouble with  longer hairs.  It works beautifully on my face and cheeks, but on my neck it barely passable.  I don&#x27;t have an especially thick beard at all, but I do have sensitive skin on my neck and am prone to ingrown hairs there.</li>
    <li> great shaver! Love Braun products...</li>
    <li> TRIPLE HEAD NORELCO IS BETTER.</li>
    <li> Does not shave close enough</li>
    <li> Have always had Braun shavers and they never disappoint me with how they work or last.</li>
    <li> Bought new, this shaver typically pulled out 3 or 4 whiskers during a typical shave.  It was painful.  After struggling with it for 6 months, I thought I would give it one last chance by replacing the head.  The new head never pulled a whisker and works perfectly.  If it pulls hairs for you, try replacing the head.  Out of the box quality was very poor.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this!</li>
    <li> I had Braun Shaver Series 5. I was so happy with it. By an error on my side I thought it broke but later I discovered it was my outlet, and I returned to Costco, bought this series 7 from Amazon &amp; thinking it would be the best ever. I found that it would pick hair quicker but not in the hard to reach areas, as the older one used to do. It is also more noisy than the series 5, and can be pulling hairs severely if one of the shaver&#x27;s sides is close to areas with long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;However it can be better fit to some whose skin is not sensitive by any degree. It also cleans well, fast and by several optional ways. You will have to pay much of replacement parts (like the head) though! Good luck any way!</li>
    <li> SHAVES BETTER/CLOSER THAN NORELCO THAT I HAE USED FOR YEARS.  IT IS A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN I WOULD LIKE, HOWEVER.</li>
    <li> my husband has never had a razor he loves so much</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shavers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Love the shave and the self-cleaning feature!</li>
    <li> Makes a very clean shave even when it has to go through several  days growth. Bob</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great. Feels great. Best shaver out there.</li>
    <li> This machine is faboloous. Well  designed. Provides a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and shaves well.  So far it&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. The cleaning solution works good also.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a very close shave. I can actually get a closer shave on my neck with this Braun razor, than I can with a regular razor with out all of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning function is wonderful. The charger/cleaning base is rather large, but it works sitting on my dresser. The first batch of cleaning solution lasted between 5 and 6 weeks of everyday use. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with electric razors for many, many years.  This is the first shaver that has lived up to its description.  No other shaver comes close to how well this shaver performs.  The only thing that is weak about this razor is the trimmer. It is just too flimsy to do the work of a real trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! Says it never pulls at his facial hair even when it&#x27;s grown out after a couple days. Makes his face feels like it was shaved with a sharp razor minus the after burn and cuts! He says he barely gets any ingrown hairs now too compared to his old shaver.</li>
    <li> My experience makes me wonder about all these good reviews&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I had a norelco for convenience and it was better than the foils of its&#x27; day. It was quick but not a great shave so as I got older, switched to blades. Seeing the ads and these reviews I thought to try the \\&quot;new\\&quot; shaving experience and went with the top of the line model.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I had to press hard and go over areas so many times that every little raised imperfection in the skin was irritated.&lt;br /&gt;The trouble spots on the neck just did not get a close shave and I found myself going over them with a blade any way. I consistently got a rash and burn.&lt;br /&gt;Braun said satisfaction guaranteed so I called the customer service and was advised to continue using it and it would get better.&lt;br /&gt;WATCH THE RETURN POLICY DATES. By waiting, I found out that there was a very short window with returning this to Amazon. I never had that problem with any product here but it cannot be returned because I gave the machine a third week, which did not make any difference at all. It is a bad patchy shave with skin irritation and embarrassing redness after use. This thing lists for more than $250.00 and has multiple replacement parts and expensive maintenance. So, I have done my duty: YOU ARE NOW WARNED.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever purchased.  I was hesitant to purchase this shaver due to the higher price compared to other electric shavers but now I am glad that I spent the extra money.  My previous shaver never really gave me a close shave.  I almost always had to finish up with a manual razor to clean  my neck and beneath my upper lip.  This razor has a cleaning system that really works well.  Overall I have no hesitation in giving this product 5 stars. I have had this razor for about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun electric razors since my last purchase of one maybe 4 years ago. The Braun razor is a very comfortable shave. Having very sensitive skin, I dont feel razor burn, get razor bumps from using it, and its a very close shave. When my series 8000 finally got too old, I decided to buy this new 7 series. I love the way Braun designed this razor to fit better in your hand while shaving, you can adjust the level of closeness of shave that you want, and the shave is very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> So excited for my series 7 to arrive to my home after getting a great deal on amazon but I was gifted with a chipped foil head right out of the box... Really doubting Braun&#x27;s quality control now but will try another before making final conclusions. Now to go through the trouble of waiting for another one to arrive from Braun since amazon can&#x27;t receive these types of returns...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Do not contact Braun if you received a \\&quot;dead on arrival product\\&quot; like mine which got chipped. I thought amazon would not accept returns as it says online but I called to make sure anyway since Braun was closed for the day. I was surprised by the response which was that they would simply send me a new one. When the item is nonreturnable they simply send you a brand new one and you keep the old one to throw away. Really surprised by the no hassel response from amazon. Really great customer service, the guy was really apologetic and handled this in 5 minutes. This definitely encourages me to keep shopping from amazon confidently knowing they stand behind their customers. As for Braun I still can&#x27;t increase rating as this was really disappointing that their most high end end device slipped through their quality control with a chipped foil head.</li>
    <li> I had the old original 6 series from I think 2003?  or 2002, when the self cleaning mechanism first came on the market.  It lasted until about a month ago when the on switch caught in the on position and froze.  It died, but after 8-9 years, I was not upset at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to pay a bit more for this model and let me say that in 8-9 years, the technology has totally improved.  This is a sweet product and if I can get say 5 years out of it, I will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty nice shave, and many more options than I used to have, also can rinse under water if needed.  Couldn&#x27;t do that with the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it, its worth the $200 that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought the Series 7 because I felt it offered more than the Series 5.  I will get the series 5 next time.  Not worth the price difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last 3 years &amp; now I bought another one for my brother &amp; he likes it as well.</li>
    <li> This shaver rocks!!!  I have had it for just over a month now and I actually look forward to shaving every morning.  It provides the closest shave I have ever had without irritating the skin.</li>
    <li> I only have two complaints. One I wish they made one for women. Two the trimmer isn&#x27;t really useful, but that is because it is made for a man&#x27;s face, not a women&#x27;s legs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a father&#x27;s day present and OH MAN! did I get a reaction from my husband!  HE LOVES it!  He has officially converted over to the electric razor because of this product.  No more purchasing blades.  No more RAZORBURN!  It is so easy to use.  You don&#x27;t have to clean it, just push a button and it does it for you.  It charges in less than 15 minutes.  I never believed that you could get a nice shave with an electric razor, but NOW I do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because it just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations from reading all the reviews. I&#x27;m a half black half spanish male and I have coarse hair. The main reason I bought the product was because I was tired of getting in-grown hairs all the time from the typical razor. The product gives a great close shave, but still doesn&#x27;t get rid of the razor bumps for me. I don&#x27;t get as much with the series 7, but I still do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only up side to the product for me, is that I use the trimmer feature it has to shave my face now, which does a pretty good job, but doesnt get a close shave. If I use the head piece I will most likely get in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> This is such a delight. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I should buy this model. But after reading pages of reviews that were praising this very model as being the best in the world i said why not. And was I not disappointed at all first shave I had. It shaves so fast and good. awesome quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this without a doubt. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> This razor arrived DOA (despite trying to charge it for several days, to give it a chance at redemption).  I called the customer support line, to ensure there wasn&#x27;t some trick I was missing.  The service representative (who was clearly on a different continent) spent about 3 minutes on the phone with me, basically instantly proclaiming this was not correct behavior for the razor and to return it or have it serviced (right, because I want to fix a defective razor right from the start).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically wouldn&#x27;t leave a negative review for a faulty product.  After all, there&#x27;s always a bad apple in the bunch, and this does not reflect how the razor works when it DOES work.  But hopefully others can learn my lesson and NOT buy the razor here.  As it turns out, you can&#x27;t return products that contain \\&quot;flammable materials\\&quot; to Amazon, which I assume refers to the cleaning solution (though I did empty it, it doesn&#x27;t matter, there&#x27;s no area to contact Amazon regarding this problem).  So the ONLY alternative I have, opposed to simply returning the razor and swapping it for a new - and hopefully working - one, is to return the razor to Braun.  Which means I have to PAY for the return shipping and wait 10 weeks for my money back on an item that NEVER WORKED.  This is beyond frustrating.  And really makes me far more hesitant about a lot of purchases on Amazon.  Either way, I certainly won&#x27;t be buying another razor here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another note to justify my 1 star review - the returns process for the razor is deliberately antiquated.  You need to have all the original packaging.  The manual does NOT include the shipping address for returns.  It seems solely out of hope you won&#x27;t be bothered to hunt it down, you must call and have the address dictated to you.  And let me mention again the scripted service representative whose response to a DOA product was essentially \\&quot;ah well, you can return it or do whatever you want with it.\\&quot;  All for a product that NEVER worked.  I can only advise others against buying a product from a company with such deliberately terrible customer support.can only advise others against buying a product from a company with such deliberately terrible customer support.</li>
    <li> Having been a Rotary Shaver Guy for the past 20 years, this was quite a change for me.  The shaver has a solid feel in your hands.  The blade orientation with the sliding head permits shaving those tough to get at areas.  They suggest that it takes a few days to \\&quot;re-train\\&quot; your beard and they are right.  Initially my shaves were not as good as my Rotary Shaver, but after a few days, I found it to be very close.  There is no irritation when shaving or afterwards.  The cleaning system is nice (so far).  I like having a clean smelling shaver.  I don&#x27;t clean it every day, though they recommend that you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides to the shaver are:  It has a very loud buzz while shaving, but this is to be expected since that vibration is used to cause the hairs to be easier to cut.  The second thing is the cleaning mode is also very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a solution for quick on the go shaves if I don&#x27;t have time for a real shave. After my first couple shaves this has become my only shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Razor like shave with very minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self cleaning station is great, after each clean it&#x27;s virtually brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side burn shaver on the back is quite precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is fantastic, I have gone weeks in foreign countries with no charger and it worked the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;To get that perfect shave I like it takes some time to remove all of the stubble, but you can easily shave while you are doing something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy specific cleaning pods that are difficult to find in stores. However they can be ordered cheaply in mass off amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on the whole I would buy this product over and over again. Simply fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever owned! I had a previous Braun model that was a good shaver, but there were times that I had to follow my shave with a standard razor to get some stubble on my neck. So far, I haven&#x27;t had to reach for the razor after any of my shaves with the new Braun!  The clean and renew system works quite well and is improved on this model by putting the shaver and stand into sleep mode after a full charge and clean, so that you aren&#x27;t constantly powering on the system. If you have stubborn growth on your neck and most shavers don&#x27;t do well there, give this Braun a shot.</li>
    <li> In my humble opinion, this product has no competition. Shaving with Braun 7-790 is enjoyable and effortless. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other pretenders. This is German engineering at its finest. Stick with the best. You won&#x27;t regret it (for at least the next three years).</li>
    <li> I loved it I just wish the bleeding mask came together and I wish they were together and both of them worked</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into my 3rd week of using the shaver.  Here&#x27;s some things which probably influence this review:  (1) I have been an electric shaver user for over 20 years, so I&#x27;m not comparing to straight-edge shaving (2) I&#x27;m not a rotary/Norelco user (tried it several times through the years, but never liked it)  (3) I have used other brands for extended periods, such as Wahl and Remington, but have mostly used Braun products, some purchased new, some hand-me-downs or inherited from Dad.  Nevertheless, I had great reservations about shelling out this much money for a shaver.  My previous model was a 2-year old Braun series 3 product, and I was not a happy camper because it seemed to get dull quite fast and I was buying a new head 2 or 3 times a year.  So here&#x27;s my verdict on this Series 7-790cc model:  It&#x27;s worth it!  If it ever gets lost or stolen, I&#x27;ll buy it again in a heart-beat.  I can echo all the other favorable reviews:  It&#x27;s quick.... it takes me very little time to shave in the morning.  I use overlapping straight strokes, with a little back &amp; forth on those hard-to-get areas like under the chin.  The clean-up process is easy.  With my prior razors, I have always popped off the head after each shave and brushed out the debris, and then usually sprayed a lubricant on the screen so that it was ready to go the next morning.  None of that is necessary with this razor, and the cleaner does a great job of flushing it out.  My only complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the cleaning machine is loud!  And I did not see any warning about it in the literature or the prior reviews.  The cleaning cycle causes the razor to activate, so it&#x27;s not really any louder than regular shaving, but it cycles on/off several times, and it can transmit the vibration through the surface it sits on.  So if I leave it in the bathroom for a cleaning cycle, it wakes up the spouse.  If I put it in another room, it still generates enough noise to disturb the quiet morning.  Maybe my 5am routine is just too early for the household, but it would be great if the cleaning unit had a timer to start it at a pre-set time, such as 10am when all the house occupants are out the door.  I have to keep the cleaner/charger on the workbench in my garage, and even though it&#x27;s awfully inconvient to retrieve the razor each morning, I still wouldn&#x27;t buy any other razor.  I&#x27;d hook up my own timer, but you have to press the button on the front to start the cleaning process.Maybe my 5am routine is just too early for the household, but it would be great if the cleaning unit had a timer to start it at a pre-set time, such as 10am when all the house occupants are out the door.

    <li> The Braun Series 7 is the best ever.  I love mine and will reccomend it to anyone. Worth the price.  Especially if you save dollars buying from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Braun 5790 for roughly 3 - 4 years already and I liked it.  I decided to upgrade from the 5790 when it came time to replace the shaving block and foil.  I looked into other brands but decided to stick with Braun considering my experience with the 5790.  While pricey (very pricey), the 7790 is definitely a much better shaver than the 5790.  One drawback is the trimmer.  The trimmer is much smaller than in my previous shaver.  Moreover, the angle makes it difficult to see where you are trimming forcing you to do a weird head turn while looking at yourself through the side of your eyes (I&#x27;m sure my wife will get a kick out of this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good shaver.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my Norelco razor due to the discontinuing of the shaving cream refills.  I thought that system was nice as it seemed to give me a clean, smooth shave.  The cream wasn&#x27;t messy and left my face smooth.  One important aspect to this shaver as it shaves FAST.  It feels like I&#x27;m done in less than 2 minutes. It&#x27;s also powerful.  No need to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; with a razor if Haven&#x27;t shaved for a weekend.  It cuts through all of that with no problem.  Going back to a dry shaver means my face is dry after, but I&#x27;ve been using Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel or Nivea after shave which both work well.  The razor is loud, but that&#x27;s really no big deal with the bathroom door closed in the morning.  The one drawback is the cleaning base.  It&#x27;s nice to have clean, sanitized razor every day, but it takes up alot of counter space.  It&#x27;s a minor gripe, but if you don&#x27;t have a small sink than you might have to store it somewhere else.  It&#x27;s been 6 weeks and I&#x27;m still on the first fill unit.  I estimate it will last 8-10 weeks.  Overally I&#x27;m really pleased with the razor and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I did my research and read the reviews for a multitude of electric shavers.  I went with the Braun which got the best reviews and was the top choice in Consumer Reports.  I got a great price through Amazon (approximately $80-$90 less than in the stores) with free shipping.  I got the shaver two days after I placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;The last time I used an electric shaver was in college over 30 years ago so I was worried that with my first few shaves I would have irritated skin as I did when I first used an electric shaver way back when.  My concerns were unfounded as my skin never got irritated and the shave was just as good as a razor.  In addition this Braun model has a cleaning feature.  When put in the charger the shaver is automatically cleaned and lubricated.  This feature should help the blades and shaver last longer.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a great shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Bruan top of the line 7 series shaver for the past 8 years. I was pretty impressed when I received it as a Christmas gift. I have replaced the block &amp; foil on my older Braun 2 times since I have had it. After the first replacement (which was about 5yrs in) I noticed that the shave quality was not quite what it was from the years earlier. So recently (in the last month) I had been pondering the decision to either replace the block &amp; foil again (a third time) on my old but still running perfectly Braun, or to cough up the cash for a Brand Spankin new one. For anyone who does not know this Brauns are made in Germany. Not only are they made in Germany, but their model naming convention is based on the BMW. Yes the BMW car, hence the Braun 3, 5, and 7 series models. I have been a long time enthusiast of BMW cars. What impresses me most about the BMW is the build quality. Similarly, the Braun seems to reflect the same quality. So to get to the point, I opted to buy the new Braun 790cc. After about 4 hours of charging, I had to take this thing for a spin. For starters I was not impressed at the initial results. I had been using my old Braun for so long that I had forgotten what a good shave looked and felt like. Never the less my first shave with Braun 790cc was not a whole lot better than my existing 8 year old Braun. Then, I put the thing back into the charger, and ran the cleaning cycle. The next morning I used it again. This time I was blown away. The thing gave me the closest most comfortable shave I have ever experienced, outside of a regular razor. Regular razors are not an option for me due to having a very wirey  (black man&#x27;s) beard that will curl right back into an adjacent pore when cut with a razor. The result being a series of very nasty &amp; painful shaving bumps. My new Braun performed outstandingly well. It shaved my face (including the sensitive neck area) extremely close and with 0 irritations (something my old Braun did not do). Ultimately I have no regrets for buying the Braun 790cc, especially since I got it for $206.00 with shipping included. I could go on and on about this item, but I will simply end it hear by saying \\&quot;A Solid Buy\\&quot;.ltimately I have no regrets for buying the Braun 790cc, especially since I got it for $206.00 with shipping included. I could go on and on about this item, but I will simply end it hear by saying \\&quot;A Solid Buy\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I ordered Panasonic LA 63 two weeks back. Tried it for couple of weeks and found it not working very well for me esp with neck and chin. Got even couple of minor cuts with the first shave. I went ahead and ordered Braun 790cc and the first shave out of the box was fantastic. Got a fairly decent shave for neck and chin too, thou it took over 5 minutes going back and forth in all directions. Overall this is a good shaver compared to LA 63 for the following reasons :&lt;br /&gt;neck / chin shave : LA 63 left a lot of hair untouched even after multiple tries. 790cc did a much better job, almost as good as razor, after multiple tries. Dont expect it to remove everything with one swipe.&lt;br /&gt;cleaning : LA 63 is washable but without a stand or storage, it is a pain. LA 93 should help here but dont get fooled by ordering LA 63 and hope to store it some place else after cleaning. LA 93 is still cheaper than 790cc at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, 790cc gave much better shave with less irritation compared to LA 63. You definitely need a stand / storage / cleaning station to keep this thing after shaving. If you are going to order Panasonic, LA 93 will give the stand / cleaning system like 790cc for an additional $30.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with electric razors most my life.  I&#x27;ve had a number of them ranging from the most expensive norelco&#x27;s to cheap ones only to not find a close shave.  I had recently read an article \\&quot;2011 Grooming Awards\\&quot; in Maxim 05/11 issue 161, which covered the reviews of the products.  The Braun Series 7 shaver was listed at No.  1 for electric razors. This prodded me to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I looked through several local retailers here in Houston, only to find the price was quite high.  Next stop was online, and behold the Amazon beast has the best prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the product, was delivered before Xmas, (wife claimed it was a gift, bah humbug.)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opened the box, shaver was BRAND NEW, NEVER OPENED.  this having been one of my first times to purchase something like this over the internet, i wasn&#x27;t certain as to what i would be receiving.  I was very happy to see this was just as i had bought it from the store.  Once i drug everything out of the box, snagged the manual, quick read plug this, snap that, and viola we&#x27;re charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge took a little over 4hrs (plugged in and came back after 4hrs so not completely sure).  Figured i&#x27;d try it out w/o trimming first, and WOW... Lets just say that, this razor can take a good amount of stubble down to bare skin very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purchase of the Braun Series 7 razor has by far been my most valued amazon purchase thus far.  A must have for all those men looking for the closest shave w/o having to use a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I did alot of research before choosing a electric shaver. Like most of the comments here I have tried a few electric shavers in the past and have always ended up going back to the cream and blade. However after trying my new 790cc I am just about ready to throw it all out. I was shocked with the closeness of the shave to be honest. I love the whole system from the shaver to the Clean and Renew System. What a great buy. Plus Amazon shipped it super fast!</li>
    <li> I like it very much.This shaver is the best,and the price is also good.the package is good but too big.</li>
    <li> good to use,  I bought it on line, and is very cheap, also very helpful to me. I like it.</li>
    <li> I love it, It&#x27;s very cheaper than our country. If you&#x60;are in a market for a good shaver,this is it.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a birthday present (August 2013) for my boyfriend.  At 51 years old he had never used an electric shaver and was very hesitant.  It has been THE BEST experience ever for him.  Fast, easy and smoother than he has ever been able to achieve with razorblades.  The cleaning attachment is a very big plus.  I would recommend this to any man with strong facial hairgrowth.</li>
    <li> works as presented.  i had over a week of hair growth and it buzzed it away with out tearing off my face.  i also use on my head and works good.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my 10+ year old Braun electric shaver which was fairly well worn out but still working OK.  This model takes off a 2 day growth with no pulls on the beard.  Oddly there was no shaver head cover supplied.</li>
    <li> My only experience with an electric shaver before this one was a cheap Remington shaver I bought over 10 years ago.  I didn&#x27;t use it very much because it caused more irritation to my skin than even a regular blade.  For the last several years I&#x27;ve pretty much only used a beard trimmer to shave with occasional use of a Gillette Mach 3 for special occasions.  Even with a higher quality blade like the Mach 3, my skin still gets irritated and shaving more than two days in a row with it really causes problems.  The beard trimmer was easy on the skin, but I always looked like I haven&#x27;t shaved for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago I finally decided to try an electric shaver again.  I knew if I was going to use it regularly it needed to work well and I was willing to spend the extra money to get a good one.  After much reading I settled on the Braun 790cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the instructions say give it a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to it, I have made a point of shaving every day.  From the beginning, I have had absolutely no irritation after the shave.  It&#x27;s so nice to get a shave that&#x27;s practically just as close as a razor but without the razor burn.  I definitely wish I had tried it sooner.  I think the adage of, you get what you pay for, is true for electric razors and I think that was likely the problem with my old Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for some specific points about this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Overall Feel - Feels great in the hand.  Looks and feels very solid and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning system - I always hated cleaning my old razor, which means it was never done regularly.  The Braun cleaning system works really well and guarantees it will get cleaned regularly since I only have to push a button.  It&#x27;s also nice that it gets sanitized with an alcohol based solution during the process.  I&#x27;ve settled on an every other day cleaning schedule.  The full cleaning cycle takes about 30min which includes a heated drying cycle. Take note that if you tilt or tip the base with the cleaning cartridge installed it will spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Closeness - For me, there is no visual difference between using shaver and a razor.  You might could tell a difference by feel, but it still feels pretty smooth to me.  The area below the jaw right at the neck requires a few additional passes in different directions to get all the hairs, but this seems to be a common problem area with all electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difference between 790 vs. 760:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated between these two models and ended up choosing the 790.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would use the extra features, but it wasn&#x27;t much more at the time than the 760.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while, I can say that I don&#x27;t think spending the extra money for the 790 is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 790 adds a quick clean feature, which is supposed to clean the shaver in about 30 seconds if you&#x27;re in a hurry.  I tried it once but don&#x27;t see myself ever using it.  First, it leaves the shaver wet which causes problems shaving unless you take some time to dry it off.  Second, the shaver certainly doesn&#x27;t have to be cleaned before every shave.  I&#x27;ve been cleaning it every other shave, but I don&#x27;t think it would have any problem going longer than that.  If I was in a hurry, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the cleaning.  When I do clean it, I start the cleaning cycle right after I shave so the length of time it takes doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other additional feature you get with the 790 is a &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34; meter.  This supposedly tells you how dirty the shaver is.  This seems very much like a gimmick designed to make sure you use the cleaning system frequently, ensuring you buy more cleaning cartridges.  The hygiene meter goes down by about 1/3 for each shave and seems to have no bearing on how dirty the shaver actually is.  The only way to make the hygiene meter go back up is to use the cleaning system.  Manually cleaning the shaver does not bring it back up no matterhow good a job you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the 790 and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another Braun series 7 shaver.  However, if you&#x27;re debating between the 790 and 760, my advice is to go with the 760 unless the price difference is very small.how good a job you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the 790 and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another Braun series 7 shaver.  However, if you&#x27;re debating between the 790 and 760, my advice is to go with the 760 unless the price difference is very small.</li>
    <li> The item was delivered as indicated. Packaging was good as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;My curiosity got the better of me, and I used it one time after initially charging it.&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was not good re. the side trimmer as I thought its design wouldn&#x27;t have stood up to constant use. I was wrong. The trimmer worked well; very well!&lt;br /&gt;I then used the foil shaver with shaving cream, which left my face feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation after effects.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to continued long term use of this product.</li>
    <li> This Product is the best of it&#x27;s class, not cheap, as it consumes the cleaning fluid and one should replace a cutting block \ net combo every 18 months, but it gives a close shave, comfortable grip, sound nice, cleans and charges itself and all around gives you superb value for your money and excellent shave</li>
    <li> I just got this earlier this month and it does all that it claims to do.  I have a very thick beard and have only used a razors and cream all my life.  I had tried an electronic razor years ago in the past and found that it did a very poor job of giving me a close shave, It also pulled at my stubble and hurt.  Do ever get me started on the irritation that it would do to my face.  I thought I would take a chance with this. The Braun Series 7-790 is a joy and does a great job.  I can now say good by to buying blades and shaving cream. It also leaves my face very smooth.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my 5 year old braun 7000 series. Much quieter, charges quicker, and smoother. Not as straight forward on setting the clean settings, but it works well and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> الماكينة تحلق بشكل ممتاز فلا تحس بحكة أو حساسيةبعد الحلاقة مطلقاً لكنها ليست جيدة في الأماكن الدقيقة (السكسوكة) لكبر رأسها</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Love the close shave. Getting use to the cleaning system. I keep it on the strongest settings and have had no problems. I clean it about twice a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally have this. I had a 8000 series since early 2005 (now a series 5). It was on its last leg so I have been using gillette  and Shick and even tried another electric for the past year. I have tried the pulsating ones, the fusion, Norelco, etc... Those razors all suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went and bought an electric Norelco shaver that looked awesome as I didn&#x27;t want to fork over the money for the Braun. Huge mistake! I was all sorts of cut up and bleeding on the first shave! I spend about $120 on that electric POS! I&#x27;m back to the Braun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First have was as close as ever. First shave there were no cuts. First shave with this was the last shave with anything other than a Braun... EVER! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean. Switched over from a rotary style shaver. This unit shaves faster and more efficient without tugging.&lt;br /&gt;Nice clean shave with out any breakouts or ingrown hair. Highly recommend this shaver. Great design and holder.</li>
    <li> There is more to this quality piece of German engineering than is described.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and no complaints. Amazon price&lt;br /&gt;was too good to pass up at more than $100 price difference&lt;br /&gt;compared to big box stores...</li>
    <li> the shaver is great close cut, long battery life, easy to clean, portable. I have been looking for is Shaver Like thisand have finally found it</li>
    <li> I have been used for a month.Powerful, flexible use very convenient.Shaving effect is good.The quality is good in Germany.very cheap.</li>
    <li> good function, shave clearly, looking-good appearance and easy to carry. A rewarding system for your friends and family at home.</li>
    <li> 宝贝已经收到了  很喜欢  非常满意  只是不明白为什么标题写着790-cc收到的写着790cc-4呢  不知道有什么区别啊  充电了  马力十足啊  只是朋友很纳闷儿为什么老买剃须刀  因为之前买过了  因为感觉很便宜  所以才买的  在国内查询了  果然国内五千多人民币  非常喜欢  非常喜欢  非常喜欢  非常喜欢  非常喜欢  非常喜欢  非常喜欢</li>
    <li> The cleaning system stopped working after using it three times. I will not recommend this product because it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I recently replaced my Remington electric shaver with this Braun.  I wish I could give this 6 stars.  Everything from setup, to cleaning is easy.  The instructions are well laid out and easy to follow.  The shave is extremely close and comfortable.  I do not have a thick beard, but this shaver does not leave any stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you may read in other reviews, the blades themselves take some getting used to for removal.  The only reason I did this was during a week long trip that I did not take the base unit (charger/cleaning unit).  I needed to do some light cleaning during the trip so I removed the blades.  After cleaning them I was able to re-install the blades with little issue - again, the more I do this, the easier it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this trip, I also wanted to test the shaver and its claim of 5+ hours of shaving off of a full charge.  After being gone 8 days, I still had over 50% battery left.</li>
    <li> I like it very much.It looks beatiful.So I will take it as a gift.If you choose it like me,I think it&#x27;s right.</li>
    <li> I have had two before and they did an excellent job!&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also an excellent travelling tool.&lt;br /&gt;John Diment</li>
    <li> If this is the best of the electric shavers, (and it may be),then I just don&#x27;t like electrics. More time consuming than a  blade. A lot of pressure required to cut and it can be uncomfortable. Manual cleaning is never good enough for the system. Needs electronic cleaing every second shave, and I have a very light beard. Cleaning solution trays are gone quickly and not cheap.</li>
    <li> I have had many different electric shavers. Braun has always been the best. This is my 3rd Braun. Each one gets better.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be intuitive to my needs. This is the best shaver I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver last April after Consumer Reports(and other sources)gave it glowing reviews.  It was praised for its close, consistently comfortable shave and ergonomics, as well as the self-cleaning feature.  I never had any luck with rotary shavers as they always left my skin feeling dry, taut, and gave me a rash-like burn that I found very uncomfortable.  So I switched to foil...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself worked amazingly well in the beginning.  With the first use, I was amazed at the smoothness of the shave and how comfortable it felt against my skin.  The trimmer worked OK for my needs and, as always, the self-cleaning feature worked perfect as well.  Fast forward 9 months later.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s simply my skin type, the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of my beard or what, but the shaver seemed to lose its \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; as time went by.  Shaves that were close and comfortable before now seem less smooth and accurate.  The unit also goes through cleaning solution much more faster than my old Series 5(which simply wore out after 6 years).  The solution always seems to be in short supply in my area so I end up buying two packs of three refills when I can find them available locally.  The instructions say the cutting foil/head is supposed to be good for 18 months(that&#x27;s about a year and a half), but I beg to differ.  It just seems all around DULL to me now.  I am contemplating on purchasing a new head just to see if that indeed makes any difference in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the \\&quot;electric vs. blade\\&quot; argument goes, we all know this has been fiercely debated for decades.  Either you&#x27;re on one side of the fence or the other.  Electrics are more convenient, but I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, you just CANNOT beat the close and accurate shave that the old traditional wet blade razors offer you.  I personally liked the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo, but got tired of purchasing the expensive cartridges before I decided to make the switch to electric shavers.  Bottom line folks, it all comes down to personal preference and opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give the shaver three stars because I feel that, despite the price, something just doesn&#x27;t seem \\&quot;right\\&quot; with this one.  As stated previously, my old Series 5 seemed better in many regards, and cost nearly $100 less than this model.  Either Braun has changed something along the way, or my beard just doesn&#x27;t like this particular model.  Whatever the reason, I&#x27;m stuck with it, will tolerate it for now, but will give serious consideration to purchasing another Braun in the future.  Good luck to all the other user&#x27;s out there.comes down to personal preference and opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give the shaver three stars because I feel that, despite the price, something just doesn&#x27;t seem \\&quot;right\\&quot; with this one.

    <li> Best in quality!! It was all that he was expecting and more. His last braun lasted years and we have hopes this will do the same.</li>
    <li> I had never used a razor braun series 7. Now that I have tried I can say with certainty that this razor shaving is something different than before. The razor leaves the feeling of perfect shave, and in fact it&#x27;s really so. I think I&#x27;ll keep this razor for many years</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot from the amazon. I like what I keep and returned what I dont want. I like this, So I gave it five star ratings</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver and closest one I have ever used. It is smooth on the skin (very practical for sensitive skins like mine).&lt;br /&gt;Suitable battery life. You should economize your money buying other product and save it for this one which will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;A high quality German product. I command it highly</li>
    <li> First, let me state that I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 2yrs and this is my conclusion on it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;This is really dependent on the person using. For reference when I use a safety razor I have to shave twice; once going with the hair and once going against it. This is the only way I can get a completely smooth shave without using a straight razor. Now knowing this, the foil razor style does not work for me. There are hairs that no matter how many times I go over it or which direction I go the razor just won&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Costs:&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution will cost you roughly $15 for three cartridges. So you have three months of cleaning solution; please be aware of this. The blades are suppose to last for 18months but after nine months you will start to notice you have to go over the same are more often. At one year it&#x27;s even worse and if you skip a day shaving the next shave will be horrid as it will completely miss areas and will most likely take you longer than if you just used a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cycle is incredibly loud and pretty much has to be run after every use (so everyday). Also realize that there will be a lot of hair left in the stand and it needs to be washed out every few months or it could plug up the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;After using this razor and a Norelco rotary (several years ago) I&#x27;ve come to realize that foil razors just don&#x27;t work for me. I know it&#x27;s weird but if you know someone who has a foil razor I highly recommend you ask to try it a couple times first. While the foil razor has issues getting all the hair I never had that trouble with the rotary one. So each individual will get different results with this razor.</li>
    <li> It took him a day or two to get used to, but he loves using it now! I definitely recommend to buy as a gift.</li>
    <li> The shaver is quite great, I like the design, however it will be better if I can turn off the vibra mode....</li>
    <li> This shaver, while not as good as a blade, is the best I have ever had from an electric razor.  I use the cleaning device once a week and just manually clean it on other uses to save time and money.  I have owned it almost a year and it still shaves as close as ever.  A fabulous shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent shaver for a while to try something new and came across this model. As I&#x27;m not going to go over all the features, I will say you do get your money&#x27;s worth in terms of quality and easy of use. I will say that having the base for charging and cleaning does take some up real estate on the counter. Also the cleaning cycle is very effective, but not the quietest process depending on where the base is located. The only thing I hope isn&#x27;t an issue is the cleaning cycle versus the charging cycle. I use the shaver four or five times, clean it manually after every use of course, and do the sonic cleaning when the indicator gets in the red. However the battery really doesn&#x27;t get used up that much and always gets charged while the cleaning cycle is doing its thing. Why is this an issue? Well in the history of batteries its a known fact that with any recharge battery its good to discharge the battery all the way before recharging it in order to extend the life of the battery overall. Something that cannot be done with the way its designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to note is that this model is not for the person who travels. Since the cleaning and charging must take place in the base that needs to be around in order to do its job. Not something to be through in a suitcase especially with the cleaning tank at the bottom. Otherwise an excellent shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> I have always had electric razors for less then $80 bucks. I couldn&#x27;t believe someone would pay more than $100 for one. I saw this one on sale and figured I would give it a try and return it if I didn&#x27;t like it. I really like though and will not be sending it back. I have to shave everyday for work except for the weekends. I don&#x27;t grow a think beard, but after not shaving over the weekend my old razor used to make my neck red and itchy. This Braun has never done that. I can go over my face several time to make sure I get everything and it has never made me itch or caused a red rash. It is not as loud as my old razor either. I would have to close my bathroom door so I didn&#x27;t wake my wife and kids up. I alsi love how I can just stick it back in the docking system and clean it. I don&#x27;t plan on buying replacement cleaner cartridges. I plan on cleaning out the old cartridge and filling it back up with rubbing alcohol and a little electric pre shaver. I have not had to do that yet because the one it came with is still good, but I have read a few threads online and others have done it so I am going to give it a try. Right now I also take the cleaner cartridge out after every cleaning and replace the caps so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate when not being used. I think that helps. There are also little things that I like about it. I like how the end of the plug it is bent at a 90 degree angle and plugs into the side of the dock so I can push the dock up against the wall without the cord getting in the way. That helps a lot when you don&#x27;t have a lot of shelf space in your bathroom. Overall I wish I would have bought this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> easy to use, very good! battery is good too, only need to charge it every half a month. keep me clean.</li>
    <li> This it a great razor, I ordered it for my picky husband for Xmas and he really does love it.  The only thing is he says it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a regular razor but its quick and close enough..</li>
    <li> I came back to the braun 7 series after trying the comparable Panasonic model.  The Panasonic model was louder and the vortex cleaning system was gross having to empty the water Etc. plus it only lasted 1 year, not acceptable for a $300 razor.  The braun 790cc is quiet and the cleaning system is the best.  Plus my previous 790&#x27;s lasted for over 3 years.  Buy it you won&#x27;t get a better electronic shave!!!</li>
    <li> Everything you&#x27;d hope a shaver to be! Great upgrade from my 6-7 year old 3 Series (even with new head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;, and he has been extremely pleased with it.  He gets excited about shaving now, which has never happened.  He has been very happy with the closeness of the shave and the way his skin feels after.  The self-cleaner has been great too!  He used to shave with the Gillette fusion power razor, which he liked ok, but since using this electric razor, he has not had near the amount of skin irritation after use!  His skin is Much happier after shaving with the Braun.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a mini Odyssey of electric shavers, after switching from a DE because I was tired of the time &amp; technique requirements. I started with the SensoTouch 3D, which was fairly close but caused some irritation and took a long time to shave with. I replaced that with the Panasonic Arc-4 (8243A), which seemed better during the week that I tried both. So, final observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness: The Panasonic was capable of getting the closest on my cheeks. However, the overall shave was uneven, and it had major trouble on my neck. The Braun had the maximum average closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evenness: By far, the Braun produced the most even shave. There were no missed hairs, and the variation in closeness between face and neck was the smallest of the three (but still noticeable to the touch). That made the shave look much closer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time &amp; Comfort: The Braun took the least amount of time, and produced the least amount of irritation. It actually feels really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I wound up doubling my original budget, but I think the 790cc is the shaver for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sixty, so it isn&#x27;t like a I have a strong young man&#x27;s beard anymore.  In fact I have a light beard.  This shaver pulls terribly even on a one day growth.  Forget two days!  Heck if I skip three days most people don&#x27;t notice, so again I don&#x27;t have a fierce beard.  I bought this to replace a different Braun that pulls, thinking I should upgrade, but it didn&#x27;t work that way.  Back to Remington with me.</li>
    <li> great price and great shave</li>
    <li> The Maserati of shaving devices.</li>
    <li> For me, this provides a closer shave than using a razor.  Using a razor, I was generally limited to one pass.  Anything more and I would get uncomfortable irritation.  With the electric razor, I can go against the grain repeatedly without any irritation.  So for me, several passes with the electric razor gets a closer shave than the single pass I was limited to with a traditional razor.  The automatic cleaning/charging station is a huge bonus.  As is the ability of the razor to collect most whiskers, cutting down on clean up time.  Incredible product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about with shaver.  The trimmer is effective and takes care of sideburn.  I even used the trimmer to cut down longer facial hair.  The charge holds well for a long time, and the cleaning station keeps things hygenic.  If this shaver goes down, I will buy another.</li>
    <li> It gives a pretty close shave but definitely not worth the price. The cleaning system is more of a hassle than anything really, you have to be careful not to spill the cleaning solution and it&#x27;s quite noisy when used, you could do about as well of a job cleaning the shaver yourself with water and a cloth; the shaver itself is also pretty loud. This Braun electric shaver is OK to sum up but overpriced, something cheaper will give you just as close of a shave without spending nearly $200, so unless you really want the self-cleaning system and the battery monitoring system etc. there are better options out there.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver.  I charged the unit and gave it a try and was immediately impressed with the quality and closeness of the shave.  The shaver is very solid and well built.  Before I shaved I placed the shaver in the cleaning unit and it replied with a light indicating the unit was clean.  After my first shave, I replaced it in the charging/cleaning station and it indicated the 1st level of cleaning would be appropriate.  I pushed the button and could hear the shaver vibrating on and off as it thoroughly cleaned the razor.  The next morning it was like new and ready to go.  It is a little noisy as it cleans the unit but it is well worth the noise.  Most days I&#x27;m heading out the door to work and don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s taking about 30 minutes to go through the cleaning and drying cycle.  The noise is only in the beginning of the clean process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridges last approximately a month and the shaver head needs to be changed in 18 months.  There is an indicator on the base telling you when to change the cleaning solution and one on the shaver to let you know when to change the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric plug is a little large and sticks out from the wall socket more than I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver and would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of making the switch!</li>
    <li> Bought to replace an 800 series Braun that is no longer available. The Series 7 does not live up to the ease of use and care of the older series. I have also found that the trimmer is not as convenient.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver and the iterative improvements make the upgrade worth the cost. Each Braun I&#x27;ve had has been impeccably engineered and have performed well over the years I&#x27;ve had them. I have no reason to believe the Series 7 will be any different. I generally get a good, close shave and the new shaver feels good in my hand and is quieter than previous versions. The automatic cleaning system is a must. The system lengthened the life of my previous shaver by a couple of years.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers in the past but the Braun shaver is much better.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great, but the base unit you charge and clean it in, just doesn&#x27;t work anymore. It worked fine for the first few months, but the vibrations from the cleaning process wore a grove in one of the metal contacts. Now, the shaver doesn&#x27;t sit right in the base and once the vibrations from the cleaning starts it loses contact and turns off.  Not too happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Bought a 790cc when it was first released back in early 2009.  That one started falling apart recently.  The \\&quot;noble\\&quot; metal paint started deteriorating where the cleaner fluid touched it, one of the locking button on side of shaver head fell off and recently the relatively new (8 month old) cutter block started throwing out plastic pieces.  Even though I bought into the Braun infrastructure, I looked for an alternative and sadly the one I tried Panasonic came up short; it just did not handle as well as or shave as smoothly as the Braun.  So while I am not happy with Braun that their flagship razor failed after 3 years (of course it&#x27;s no longer under warranty, though they say it will last 6 years on their web site), I felt I had no choice but to buy another 790cc after seeing the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is familiar and I like it.  It shaves well and it feels well balanced in my hand.  The newer model seems a little more compact and seems put together better than my old model and has more features.  Time will tell and I will update this post if this shaver does not live up to its price like the last one.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver that I ever bought. I pick on my friends that only have the 3 series. The 7 series cleans itself and it seems brand new every time I use it. It massages your face and does not leave burns like other ones do. I highly highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for a while and even the Wahl Peanut for shaves to avoid a shredded beef face. The search stops here. The best, by far, 2nd place is not even visible from this shaver. Super smooth and you can press it against your face, chin, jaw lines, neck, and you get no irritation with a superb shave! It&#x27;s pretty amazing, I just wish I found this a while ago. Also feels its made of more quality then other shavers I&#x27;ve held, overall I would recommend it over any other shaver. It&#x27;s not cheap, but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> After using a Norelco for years, I finally decided to try the Braun foil shaver based on reviews from several different websites. In short, there is no perfect electric razor, but this is as close as it comes! This is the closest shave I have experienced with an electric razor. The shave feels closer than my Norelco 1250 plus the clippings don&#x27;t fall out easily as with the Norelco RQ12 head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not think I would like or use the self-cleaning station since it requires purchasing refill solution. However, it perfectly cleans the shaving head much better than could ever be accomplished manually. I simply take the solution out of the base after cleaning and re-cap the container using the plastic caps it came with which avoids the denatured alcohol evaporating naturally while not in use. After 4 weeks about 20-25% of the solution has been used after cleaning every 5 days or so. Bottom line: if you don&#x27;t want to purchase the refills then you can simply wash out the shaving head and store the cleaning station elsewhere which was my original intent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main motivations for trying something new was the poor reviews on the new Norelco RQ12 replacement heads. I had my 1250 for a couple of years and it was time to replace the heads. But the new one was $60 and had poor reviews. The Braun&#x27;s replacement foils are cheaper (about $30) and the reviews on this shaver have been fantastic. Also, one of the user reviews mentioned that the little red spots on his neck from irritation have gone away since switching to the Braun. I have experienced the same thing - no red irritation spots on my neck after 3-4 weeks of daily use. I have zero complaints since making the switch. It&#x27;s obvious no electric shaver will give you the closeness of a good manual razor with just one pass but this is the best electric option out there! All electric razors take several passes and stretching the skin in some areas to get the perfect shave. I am extremely satisfied with the quality of shave and quality of this product one month in. Highly recommend!e quality of shave and quality of this product one month in. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> More convenient than using before. And I like the clean way.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my father who is partially disabled and he loves the clean shave he gets with it.</li>
    <li> Made with care for countless razor sharp accidents.It&#x27;s product worth buying in order to expand market and make decent shaver accessible. Production description and price match product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon on Black Friday sale.  Great deal.  I still have the old model Braun 7680 and it still runs great after 7 years.  So far I think this is definitely an upgrade comparing to 7680.  Much smoother shave and it cuts my shave time to half.  Love the battery indicator.  The only thing I found missing is the cap.  The old 7680 has a cap on the top to protect the head and this new model does not come with one.</li>
    <li> I still love my Series 1 (on my second one) for a quick shave and ability to take the abuse of being dropped. I liked the Series 3 but it just died recently and I thought I&#x27;d scope out the newer styles. This Series 7 is the hook! It was a choice between the Braun and Panasonic after a boat load of research. I really liked the fact that the Panasonic head came apart from the shaving block like the Braun Series 3, but it came down to overall shaver ratings online and knowing the reliability of the Braun products I&#x27;ve used over the past 35 years. Okay, that and I got to party with some German senior enlisted when I was on my twilight tour in the Navy and those guys were pretty cool (Hitler wasn&#x27;t their fault).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to say the Braun 790cc gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver. Say what you want about the rotary shavers, but the foil shavers don&#x27;t pull the hairs out of your face to give you a close shave.</li>
    <li> I disliked a previous electric shaver.  It didn&#x27;t shave well and left may face irritated.  The Braun Series 7 provides a shave that is almost as close as a standard razor and it is less irritating to my skin than the prior electric razor or my standard razor.  It is convenient.  Also, I am able to shave daily (as opposed to every other day).  With my standard razor I couldn&#x27;t shave daily due to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This system is expensive.  But, if it lasts, it will be worth it (especially since razor blade refills are so expensive now!).</li>
    <li> Love it. My 10 year old Braun finally gave up and died so I was forced to replace it with a newer model. I researched for a while and even though it was a tad more expensive than I wanted to pay this was. a great choice. Even though I kept replacing the cutter and foil on my old one this works much better. It is a tad more complicated than my last one (more buttons, bells and whistles than the star ship enterprise) its easy if you read the instruction booklet which being a guy isn&#x27;t a natural thing. Anyway it really is great and if it lasts as long as the other one till be superb.</li>
    <li> hubby loves it - his old one died after 9 years</li>
    <li> I have always been a shaving cream and razor person. Decided to try this Braun system. The shave is as close as the wet method, quicker, neater, and free of the occasional bloody spot. The cleaning stand works well. The cleaning fluid lasts a long time, several weeks, and cartridge replacement is easy.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver very much. Before this one, I used a Philips RQ1095/21, which I got in 2009. Braun shaver is much more powerful than Philips&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the shave, especially in the neck area. Better than what I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s been reliable for 1.5 years now and definitely does the job!</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace my 8000 series that the battery finally failed in. I actually think the 8000 was a better razor but for what is available today this was my favorite. Runs quietly and gets the job done. Takes some cleaning cartridge as the old. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> The price is a little expensive, can be a little cheaper. Things are very good, need to buy the next time.</li>
    <li> brought this for my 35 yo Downs son. He has a thick beard and we have used many makes &amp; models of electric razors over the years. At 1st I thought this was another advertising prank but............THIS IS THE GREATEST RAZOR ON THE MARKET</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers exclusively for 2 decades because frankly, they were the best.  However with the last 3 shavers I purchased all 3 of them have broken approximately 1 year later.  Each one broke in the same way.  The 2 tiny plastic pieces that held the trimmer together broke off and the trimmer quit working.  I paid a lot of money for each shaver.  They may give the closest shave, but the build quality has deteriorated in the past few years and I&#x27;m tired of throwing money their way.  I will never buy another Braun.  This is tragic because my face is used to Braun shavers and it will take a long time to adjust to another brand.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Nothing but GREAT PRODUCT. It&#x27;s been 2.5 years I&#x27;m using it with no problems at all. I didn&#x27;t even replaced cartridge lol. This is the machine you need to buy for your needs. Trust me. No nobody paid me anything for this review. I just want my brothers and sisters get a best product. God bless all of us</li>
    <li> Love this electric razor</li>
    <li> Wow Best shaver I have every used, Easy to use and does a good job.</li>
    <li> 6 months ago I started to look for an electric razor because the blade was causing me pain in the face. first buy the braun 3 series, is an excellent razor, leaves no hair and you can use it with shaving cream. As I am a bit obsessed with things, I decided to undertake the search for the perfect razor, I bought the braun series 7 790cc and philips 1280x. I honestly expected a lot of the Series 7, however there is no difference with the series 3.&lt;br /&gt;Philips 8000 series (1280x / 47) actually represents a step forward in comfort for sensitive skin and a closer shave. When used with shaving cream, it looks as if I had shaved with fusion Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;if you do not have much money  buy Braun Series 3, if you want the best, go with a Philips 8000/9000 series.</li>
    <li> Good Electric Shaver for the price</li>
    <li> Works great! Very nice product! Use it daily. Have had it for a couple years and never have had an issue. Def worth the money! Just need to replace the cartridge yearly for clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor, glad I bought it. Nice to always have it charged and clean. Shaves close and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time and without any damage. Item was correctly  described in the description. It&#x27;s a little pricey though.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me the closest shave of any electric razor I have tried but it incredibly slow to shave with.  It was difficult to get hairs that had grown out for more than a couple of days.  Sometimes impossible.  I had  a 15 year old Norelco that I was trying to replace which didn&#x27;t shave quite as close as the Braun but it was 3 times as quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a very disappointing experience but amazingly, Amazon would not let me return it but gave me a full refund.  Amazing!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER I&#x27;VE EVER HAD.  I RESEARCHED ONLINE FOR MONTHS BEFORE BUYING AND ALL I READ WAS THAT IT WAS THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER AND I STRONGLY AGREE.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver! So far have nothing but positive results from this model, does not do as great around the neck area but very pleased with it</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have with it is that the trimmer is worse than my old one. I have to get my old Braun out to use it for the trimmer, besides that it&#x27;s great so far!</li>
    <li> I think that it covers all areas of my face and I have control how it cuts.  Packaging was good and since I can not use a bladed razor since I have a medical condition that stops me for cuts.  Love it since electronic control of anything, I can do ( great for me.).</li>
    <li> this thing keeps nicking me around my adam&#x27;s apple, badly. but it works on other portions of my face well.</li>
    <li> I like it! It works quite well as I expect. The price is good. The voltage is world-wide enabled which is suitable for travel.</li>
    <li> The Cleaning System is not very useful.But the shaver is good and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I may buy another one for my father</li>
    <li> Love it!  Costly, but well worth it.  I like the cleaning system.  You have a clean shaver every morning. Buy you , you will like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 6 Braun shavers - series 3 and 5 - which were all pretty good, but this series 7 is definitely a cut above the rest. It cuts long whiskers without pulling them and shaves much faster than my previous models. For me, it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Before I got Braun 790CC, I used Norelco 1150x for about 2 years,&lt;br /&gt;790CC is the best shaver i have ever used. very fast, very clean</li>
    <li> My husband had a Braun shaver for several years and when it went kaput he wanted to purchase another Braun. We paid a lot of money for this shaver and it seems to be made very poorly. It does not shave his nearly as well it just sounds cheap and tinny when running. I do not like it as I trim his neck line and the new design of the trimmer makes it hard to trim the hair line without shaving his hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We mail ordered as we thought the company was making quality products. I do not believe we will be purchasing Braun products again.</li>
    <li> first electric shaver I that I have used in 30 years. It it shaves really close and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun razors for a long time.  This model is the best yet. It gives a good shave and it seems more quiet in the cleaning mode than the model I had previously.</li>
    <li> Lots of features. However, it did not shave any better than my previous $40 Remington electric shaver. So I truly don&#x27;t see the Braun&#x27;s value. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this electic razor thinking that is was a good envestment.  BOY was I wrong...  I first noticed that I did not get a good shave.  If you are someone that occassionaly shaves and has little facial hair, it might be good for you.  I on the other hand have thick facial hair the Braun shaver was not up to task..  After about 20 days shaving my liquide cartridge ran out.  It states on the box you dont need one but if you dont use it you will get a strong odor from the shaver.  THIS SHAVER IS OVERPRICED AND DOES NOT DO THE JOB....</li>
    <li> I had tried a rotary head shaver about 15 yrs ago with the recommendation of my father but the shave never really felt great.  I have been shaving with a Mach 3 for many years and with my sensitive skin, it meant that I would skip a couple of days shaving from time to time because my skin just couldn&#x27;t handle it.  I did some research about electric shavers, rotary vs foil, and most websites/reviewers were claiming that foil shavers gave a better shave than rotary.  I then researched which foil shaver was best.  It came down to 2-3 different ones.  I decided on the Braun shaver simply because I had quality issues with other Philips products lately and did not want to go through this hassle again.  And at a similar price point.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I REALLY like my experience so far with the Series 7-790 shaver.  I have been using it daily now for over 2 weeks and since I have a bald head, I also use it to shave my entire head!  The feeling of itchiness the Mach 3 blade left after on my head is now over.&lt;br /&gt;As far as using the cleaning station, I have been using the quick 25 sec cleaning on a daily basis and the long program cleaning twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy the fresh lemony smell of my shaver from the cleaning station.</li>
    <li> This shaver is one of the best. Use this one since several month&lt;br /&gt;every morning. Replaced an older Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Something that the guy in your life will enjoy for years. Originally purchased the Braun 5 Series 7 or 8 years ago, it is still in great shape but passed it down and purchased this one. With proper care it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my dad and he loved it! He siad it looked so nice he didn&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for less than a month, however it has been a significant improvement over my previous Braun System 3 shaver. System 7 provides a closer and smoother shave along with a station that cleans, sterilizes, recharges and holds ready the shaver for the next use. For me, the trimmer works better than any that was available on electric shavers I previously owned. As I mentioned I have been using it for just a short time and have found nothing that I could put in a &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; category.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 790cc for about three months now with excellent results. The short version goes like this: the shaver comes with a high price tag, but one that&#x27;s worth it if you want a no-fuss shaver that has its own built-in cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the longer version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard grows in with a medium level of thickness and speed, but my facial hair - especially on my neck - grows in a multitude of odd-shaped whorls and other circular patterns. With a traditional razor, it&#x27;s impossible to shave without cutting myself. Despite that, for years I dealt with a bloody face after shaving and would stanch the bleeding with a styptic pencil. I finally got sick of that and made the switch to an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Back in high school, I shaved with a three-head Panasonic shaver that was less-than ideal and always left stray stubble unshaven, which I&#x27;d have to remove with a traditional razor. With a gap of about 15 years between that electric shaver experience and my current one, I realize the technology has changed quite a bit. Despite that, I can say hands down this is an amazing shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for sure: it may be the best electric shaver out there but it will never shave as closely as a blade razor. That&#x27;s just the reality. Your shave will still be close and you&#x27;ll still be happy, but you&#x27;ll never get that \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m able to shave in about three minutes -  a mere fraction of the time I spent shaving when I had to lather up and use a blade razor. That time savings alone makes it worth it, but the icing on the cake is the Clean &amp; Renew system, which is wonderful. Just place the shaver in the charging station, press a button to clean it, then walk away. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with the clean &amp; renew system is that I appear to have a mild allergy to the cleaning solution. Even after being cleaned and dried, my shaver always has a slight residue of the lubricant on its metal surfaces, and on two different occasions my lips have become swollen and slightly bumpy. I&#x27;ve fixed this problem by gently wiping off the shaver head with a tissue before each shave, and this seems to have solved the problem. Just be aware - there may be other people who have allergic reactions to the lubricant too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I weren&#x27;t slightly allergic to the cleaning solution/lubricant, I&#x27;d give this shaver 5 stars. But since I am, I have to take away one star and give it a 4. But don&#x27;t let that steer you to some other shaver - this thing is the real deal and I highly endorse it.two different occasions my lips have become swollen and slightly bumpy.

    <li> My Dad absolutely loves this shaver.</li>
    <li> I wished that I had known the capabilities of this type of shaver many years ago.  Even though my face is multi-color from razor burn, my face has not itched since my first used of this shaver system.  It is worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun products for over 20 years and have found their shavers of high quality throughout this period. This particular shaver raises the bar to new levels and I would recommend it to anyone. For starters, my favorite feature is the \\&quot;closeness of shave desired\\&quot; adjustment (i.e., it really works). Next, the foil over the blades is not of cheap construction... it will last. I also am impressed with battery life and the built-in battery life indicator. I travel a lot and it&#x27;s nice to \\&quot;not have to guess\\&quot; if there&#x27;s enough life left in the battery anymore. The travel cover fits tight and provides good protection too. Overall, this shaver is a solid choice to purchase.</li>
    <li> I SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT, BRAUN ARRIVED A MY LIFE AND I WON&#x27;T LEVE. I USE THE BRAUN SERIES 7 ALL DAYS.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I expected I went back to my Gillette until I found the Panasonic ES-LT41, what a difference!</li>
    <li> Gets really close shave and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m someone who has perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (Mediterranean, strong facial hair). Even with blades I usually have a hard time getting a close shave in my mustache, with this, feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Difficult areas like around the jaw bone and neck continue to be a hard to shave area, but it does just as good as most razors without getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanliness bar seems to lower quite fast, but it seems that you&#x27;ll get a better bang for your buck if you fully have it self-clean when it&#x27;s close to being done.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver for around 15 years. I thought I&#x27;d give it another go. They have definitely come a long way. It is a little tough to get a consistent shave and takes a little extra time. However, compared to the manual razor, this is much less irritating on my skin. The cleaning system is a little average and doesn&#x27;t seem to work particularly well. I usually rinse the head under water before using the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I&#x27;m a fan of the Braun shavers and this one is as good as they come. For me, nothing works as well. Lots of horsepower, long battery charge, close shave. Fits in your hand the way you would expect it to.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!!  It blows away all other shavers. I previously had a series 5 and this one is way better. I shve my head also with it and it performs great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this particular model, but I will never purchase a braun product again. I always used Braun shavers until my wife purchased the new Braun 360 complete for me one X-mas. 2 years later it broke and of coarse the warranty expired. I contacted Braun and they gave me a list of service centers. So I sent it in to be repaired at my own expense. The part was discontinued (after 3 yrs. on the market). I contaced Braun again and to my surprise they could not care less. They would not replace my shaver with an equal value shaver. They sent me a travel shaver worth $49. The 360 complete cost my wife just under $400 at the time. Make your own choice, but I&#x27;ve made mine. It&#x27;s like buying a car and three yrs later you can&#x27;t find parts for it anymore. Is it a disposable? I guess Braun beleives it is. A very expensive disposable!! If you&#x27;re going to offer repairs, then the parts should be available at all times. BOTTOM LINE!!!</li>
    <li> One can get a good shave but really have to take time and work at it. Does not shave smooth on the first pass.</li>
    <li> Talk about an amazing shaver! I have had ZERO issues with mine and have had it for 7 months. I had a Braun before this and didn&#x27;t even buy the cleaning fluid, I just brushed out the hair after each use and it was perfectly fine for years. However with this I do buy the cleaning fluid, but use it only every few months. I shave about twice a week, and I used to get razer burn before I got my first Braun (my first braun lasted 8 years and still worked great, I was just ready for something new). But this one has 3 different settings so when I&#x27;m on my neck I use the lightest setting so it doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort. The key to this is being slow and gentle and LIGHTLY pressing on your skin. I don&#x27;t mind going over an area a few times if it means no irritation later, and this thing gives my skin baby soft like a razor can! I will always buy Braun.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just as ecpected and very useful, maybe i&#x27;ll get another one for my friend.I like it very much.OH YEAH</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of this, but it worked so much better, with this one, i have to shave twice the time that i used to</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric shaver in decades. I was somewhat skeptical about buying one. I am now a believer. This product is easy to use and outshines my razor by a longshot. It takes the &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; out of shaving. It shaves fast and close with little skin irritation. I have not found out any pitfalls after using it for about one month. I wish that I would have tried it sooner!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Good shave with adjustments Noisy cl we an cycle.</li>
    <li> 3, 5 &amp; 7 series like BMW. Yet interestingly, replacement heads for each level share about the same cost (?) I just received this as a holiday gift and it is definitely the most full featured and nicest electric shaver that I have owned to date. I began \\&quot;power\\&quot; shaving with a two head rotary Norelco before switching to Braun 25 years ago. Nothing since has provided as close and comfortable results compared to the single large foil Braun&#x27;s of the late 80&#x27;s/early 90&#x27;s until I used the 790cc. However, my previous two shavers were (triple head) rotary Norelco&#x27;s again as the balance of quality for price remained reasonable while the top Braun units became so expensive. (and the affordable models lost performance and reliability) My beard is fairly light in the neck area yet rotary shavers have always caused me irritation and redness there. This new Braun provides a close and burn free shave in my very first week of use. (a real challenge when switching things up). I am not certain yet that the cleaning system offers any actual cutter longevity over simply added luxury and convenience. For what the solution refills cost, I could just replace my cutter head parts annually and rinse them weekly. Had I purchased a new Braun for myself, it would have likely been more basic and without a charging/cleaning stand. (translates to \\&quot;less expensive\\&quot;) But truly Honey, I really love it ! Thank&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever!,! Great for a heavy  beard.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on which Shaver System to get for my husband and after all the back and forth I picked this one and my husband loved it. Started to shave with it right away. I can&#x27;t wait to try it too but don&#x27;t let him know. Was easy to set up and it does the rest. Very innovative technology for shavers.</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun series 5 model which I used for about 6 years and was very happy.  I decided to purchase the 790cc, to give it a try, instead of replacing the heads again on the older model.  I found it provides me an even better shave, getting closer with less repetition.  And while some people of criticized the new pop up trimmer, I really like it.  I find the smaller size and new location to be more maneuverable and it easy to trim in tighter places.</li>
    <li> This Braun Series 7 shaver is, by far, the best electric shaver on the market.  Read the reviews....all exceptional...and I&#x27;m so glad I stepped up to the very best.  Amazing shaver!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned. Very expensive but gives an efficient and comfortable shave. Battery seems to last forever. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have always hated shaving. I had used &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; razors + shaving cream for 25 years. During that time, I tried a few electric shavers. They were mid-priced electric shavers and I hated them. They seemed to remove more skin than hair, so they quickly found themselves buried in my drawer or thrown away. A little over a year ago I decided to spend &amp;#34;real money&amp;#34; on an electric shaver and give it a final try. After a lot of research I decided on this one- at least in part due to the generous try/return policy.  Am I ever glad I did!  I&lt;br /&gt;love this shaver, to the extent that shaving has almost become enjoyable. It works great- very close shave. I thought there might be a &amp;#34;get used to it period&amp;#34; where it would be uncomfortable for a while, but it worked great and comfortably right out of the box. The cleaning system works great, too. I run the cycle after every shave, and I shave on average every other day.  A cleaning cartridge tends to last me a couple months. Sometimes I won&#x27;t shave for a few days and will have a pretty heavy beard. In those cases, this shaver works a little harder but does the job no problem. I&#x27;ve had no trouble using the trimmer either. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product and a night and day difference compared to the less expensive models.  I can&#x27;t say how other brands&#x27; top models compare to this one, but I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better. It&#x27;s also just the right size and weight- easy to hold/handle.  It&#x27;s literally been a life-changer for me!!</li>
    <li> My husband is disabled by MS and has found this a great way to shave since he&#x27;s been unable to use a regular razor.  We are very pleased with the shave it gives and the way that it cleans and charges itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and he loves it! It has been 4 months now and it still works great :)</li>
    <li> 2nd Braun shaver I have owned, first one died after a few years or so. Thought it was going to make it through my last deployment time it hit the sink from a 3 ft drop. This one replaced it upon my return home and has been great ever since.</li>
    <li> I have owned many Braun shavers over the last 30 years and this is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed it is much quieter than the previous ones. The charging and cleaning unit is interchangeable with my old one.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with Braun is the overpriced foil/cutter replacement. If you shop around online the price is still over thirty dollars. If you live in Canada retail stores charge over forty five dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the travel case is OK. It its like the last 7 series I have, a semi hard case to protect the shaver. It would be nice if it was a bit larger, or had a sleeve to accommodate the cleaning brush for travel. I know you can fit one in the case, but it sits loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this shaver in my opinion is the best one Braun has offered. I will continue to be a loyal Braun customer.</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Each new model has performed a bit better than the previous one.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I notice much of a difference between the three speeds available with this unit.  But I will say that the resulting shave is close and there is no razor burn using any speed.  The shaver is a bit pricy, but I think the comfort is worth paying for.</li>
    <li> Braun shavers are the best. This is the second Series 7 Braun shaver that I have had over the years and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift for a friend and he things it is the best gift the has gotten in the last few years. It safes him a lot of time and can use it on his way to work.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband - the following it his feedback on this shaver - I had an 8 year old version of this Braun shaver - It worked well but for a really close shave, I used a blade. I cannot begin to tell you how impressed I was with this new Braun Series 7!  It is extremely easy to use and has this really cool feature where you can use a blue light to dial up or down the intensity of the shave. The lesser settings still gives a great shave. Also the fact that you can get a very close shave without having to go over the same spot is a big plus. In short, the electric razor is fantastic and if you are thinking it&#x27;s time to replace yours (whatever the brand) I would say do it.  Obviously it is much more expensive than most other razors - but A) You get what you pay for and B) Since you will be using it almost every day, the cost per day is SO worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers now for more than 13 years, and I have always been satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Pulsonic Shaver from Braun.  I needed a spare travel razor and tried a cheaper Braun; however was not happy at all with the cheaper smaller razor and returned it.  Love the way this razor shaves and happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who had used the same razor for over 6 years. He says this razor is the best shave he has ever experienced. It isn&#x27;t cheap, but if it lasts him another 5-6 years then it is totally worth it. It also has a great hygiene feature to tell you when to click the clean button, and it will just clean itself!</li>
    <li> My husband Loves It. I bought Him The series 5 Several Years ago And It Was On It&#x27;s last Leg. He Says This One Is Definitely Better.</li>
    <li> This works really well. My only complaint is that after it&#x27;s used it makes cleaning mechanical noises for quite a while.</li>
    <li> It is very good,  very comfortable to use.It is also very easy to use,to clean.I love it very much.Every man needs one.</li>
    <li> Have a Panasonic ES8077 that I have used for about 3 years and have been quite happy with.  However, after purchasing this Braun I have made the Panasonic my backup shaver that I take on trips and the Braun is my number one shaver for everyday use at home.  Shave is great with the Braun and another big plus is the charging/cleaning station that is much quieter than the Panasonic and gets better reviews for reliability.  The charging/cleaning station fopr the Panasonic sounded like an F14 taking off and began to give trouble after a couple of years.  it completely died just short of 3 years old.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick and efficient. Although I have used Braun shavers for a long time, this one is a real improvement both in terms of result and battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome beautiful clean shaves everytime... This is coming from the wife.  The cleaning feature is pretty cool but kinda loud, we just start it as we&#x27;re headed out the door for work.  The only complaint besides noise is the beard trimmer is silly.  They put it in a place where you have to contort yourself in front of the mirror to see what you&#x27;re doing.  It does a fine job it&#x27;s just in a weird place to be able to see around it to see what you are trimming.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever had. Very close shave and in less than 2 minutes I&#x27;m finished. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> It took me 30 years to find and electric shaver that really does &amp;#34;shave as close as a blade&amp;#34;.  This is the one, though.  I don&#x27;t even understand how it can shave so close.  Plus, with the auto-wash feature, I don&#x27;t even mind letting my son use it too!  I just tell him to hit the auto-wash button after he uses it.  Amazing product.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a rotary shaver that I had been using for about a year and a half.  The Braun shaves much closer and the automatic cleaning/charging station makes it very easy to use.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Replaced my old braun shaver with this.  I have no complaints with the new unit.  Its a great shaver, at a good price, and i would pick it up again in a second!</li>
    <li> I am so happy.A great do not regret the decision to buy it。I used to buy 1150 with more than 790 great this</li>
    <li> excellent razor! Shave is almost as close as a saftey razor. Only complaint is that when cutting a two day old beard, the razor pulls out some hairs.OUCH!</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  Only use it when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband for Christmas and he adores it! Easy to use, close shave, and SUPER EASY to clean!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay. since its price is much higher than other brand, so i  expect it will much better than others, but it  just not as good as i expect!</li>
    <li> best electric razor i ever used. Shaves better then any standard or electric razor. Smoothest shave ever. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Coming from previous Pulsonic 9595 which was showing wear and tear of age.  I like the adjustable closeness settings, light-normal-powerful, which does make a difference for my beard.  If I don&#x27;t shave for a day or two, I use the light (comfort) setting to take off a quick layer, and then go to normal for a finishing run, and am quite satisfied.  One harmlessly annoying feature is the &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34; indicator which declines rapidly (after two or 3 shaves) so that it is blinking a warning at you.  Once you put it in the base for a cleaning it resets.  However, I like to go a full week or maybe even a full charge (this battery goes for 10 or more days before needing a recharge) before using the cleaning station, so I basically ignore the hygiene indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One marketing point on this item: feel the Amazon should make it more obvious up front that if you choose to return this shaver for whatever reason, it has to go back to Braun because of the &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; clean &amp; renew refill (alcohol based) - NOT back to Amazon.  This did not affect me, as I like this product, but other reviews have complained about this.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It has tonz and tonz of power and easily slices through the scruff. Very very very worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  Older models were much better.  Whatever they did to this shaver made it uncomfortable, slower, and simply unpleasant.  And this was expensive.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  It comes with a disinfectant solution so it&#x27;s always clean.  Plus, he looks clean shaven even at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun 7000 syncro for years and loved it.  Only decided to go with the new series 7 since the battery in the old faithful razor was starting to lose some of its pep.  Have been using this series 7 for about a month and it is definitely the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It leaves nothing behind and I finish shaving probably about 30 percent faster. For anyone that says their beard is too tough, or they don&#x27;t like electrics, I say give this a chance.  It takes about 2 weeks for your face to get used to the electric shave, but you&#x27;ll never get as close of a shave with a blade as you do with this razor.  The auto-clean feature is great, but may not be necessary to do every day (like I do.)  I haven&#x27;t tried just rinsing it in water.  Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good product. Was a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Shaves as close as those 5-bladed razors without the bloodshed. The cleaning cycle is a little noisy but if you start it as you leave the room, it won&#x27;t bother you.</li>
    <li> Shaves good, cleans good, charges, you name it does everything but cook and clean.  Must buy if you are looking for quality</li>
    <li> It was pricey for me but my old shaver was not holding a charge.  I researched this one and it does everything I wanted it to do.  And it is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  No 5 O&#x27;clock shadow anymore.  Works smoothly, holds a long charge for travel.  Quieter than my old one...</li>
    <li> It is what you would expect in this price range.  This is my 3rd top model Braun and I have been very pleased</li>
    <li> The best shave ever made. Shaving is close and not hurt the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The vibration provides a nice massage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased. I had already used circular shavers, but the process of Braum is very much higher.&lt;br /&gt;I Recommend</li>
    <li> The best price I have ever seen on the internet. To get the same item it was 50% less than pricing in Canada.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shaver</li>
    <li> Manual says give it two weeks for you hair to get use to it,  but its more like a month. Overall its a great product.</li>
    <li> I think it is the best shaver of the world.It does very clean job and I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I can finally get a decent shave and never have to worry about cutting myself.  I would give it five stars if they had a mobile cleaning station that I could more easily pack in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shaver; works just likes it says it will.This one replaced a slightly older model and it was worth the price to upgrade. Very happy!</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I have owned since the 1970s. After shaving with shaving cream and various safety razors over the years, I finally decided to try an electric razor again. After researching different makes and models, I decided to go top-of-the-line and purchase the Braun Series 7-790cc. I am happy that I made the choice to spend a few more dollars up front and go with Braun. This model provides an exceptionally close shave as promised, and cleans itself to perfection by simply placing it in the cleaning station after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinking of upgrading or converting to an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  TIP - keep the cleaning solution out of the unit.  Insert it once a week to clean and charge.  The solution is only rated to last about a month (due to use and evaporation).  I will likely get six months or more out of my original.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS SHAVER AFTER USING ANOTHER BRAUN FOR 5 YEARS. I TRIED IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT.  I PUT IT AWAY UNTIL LAST MONTH ON A CRUISE.  IT WOULD TAKE ME OVER THIRTY MINUTES TO SHAVE AND TWO HOURS LATTER I HAD STUBBLE.  IT WAS THE WORST SHAVER I EVER BOUGHT AND I HAVE HAD A FEW! IT&#x27;S AVAILABLE IF ANYONE WANTS TO BUY IT.  ONLY 5 HOURS OLD!</li>
    <li> Said it was one the best shavers he came across. Good gift and gives a close shave. Good job Braun.</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver that I&#x27;ve purchased in the last 10 or so years.  This is the most expensive of the three but is by far the most comfortable and closes shaving of the three, and all three were/are much better shavers than anything used previously.  This one is well worth the added cost if it holds up as well as the first two.</li>
    <li> My second Series 7 . Even better than the first.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like German engineering. This is a wonderful product. It does everything a shaver is supposed to do and does it very well. It is, however, kind of expensive. But at least it works! Unlike my Remington, which, after only a year, has a battery which barely holds a charge. Sometimes, you have to pay to get the &amp;#34;good stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It was a gift &amp; he seems very happy with it.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> very good i like it so much~~~its too big ~~~Perfect very good i like it so much~~~its too big ~~~Perfect</li>
    <li> really comfortable and shave clean, one little problem is where is the receipt or invoice? how to get global guarantee service here?</li>
    <li> The best shaver I&#x27;ve owned !&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for the best shaver out there!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by consumer reviews</li>
    <li> Bought this since it was on sale and my old razor was already due for a new foil and cleaning fluid. It works great for an electric razor, but it&#x27;s not really any better than the older Braun models that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It has the closest and most comfortable shave of any razor I have owned. I appreciate the batter indicator when I travel.</li>
    <li> As a daughter, I never think about to buy a shaver for my dad. Because I am a girl, i never use it. I can not get any connection between shaver and present. However, my boyfriend, he bought the Braun series3 which cost him 150 bucks. He really satisfied with his new shaver and suggested me to one for my dad as a birthday present!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the target first, unfortunately, it need me to paid 200+!! OMG, I can&#x27;t believe that I just paid 170 and got the 7 series from Amazon. That&#x27;s the reason why I love Amazon so much. You will always can get your surprise!!</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars...because it&#x27;s all there!  But, one detail...that you can only use this on a dry face.  I wish I&#x27;d known before purchase.  But you live and you learn.</li>
    <li> OK. Does not live up to advertisement.</li>
    <li> Good product for long continual use.....will last for years</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  Frequently he had trouble getting a close shave and usually wound up with razor bumps and a very red face.  Not once has this happened since he began using the Braun.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my husband as a birthday gift, first it is very loud and second what kind of a respectful shaver with this huge brand name on it doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer piece? Seriously my husband doesn&#x27;t shave his beard entirely but only trims it his current shaver comes with a trimmer head that he can attach to it and trim his beard i thought this one being very fancy would have the same little pieces of accessory but no just an expensive annoying shaver sitting on our sink now I would of returned it but it says this is not a returnable item... A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The shave is excellent.</li>
    <li> Love Braun series shavers.  Have used them for many years, always gives a reliable shave.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but had to on this shaver and my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the shaver works, it is a nice close shave, the cleaning solution lasts about 2 months if you are using it about once a week. I fill it up with Rubbing alcohol as it gets low and give me another few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After exactly 1 year my shaver completely died. Acted like it was running (blue light lit, activity for battery blinking, etc. but nothing happened with shaving head). I let it die, recharged, nothing worked, even bought a new foil head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with Braun / PG support has been a long drawn out mess and I just had to warn people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you rely on this thing, purchase 2 or look for another brand. If it dies you are out of a shaver for at least 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun call in support is little to no help, they outsource the repair to 1 company based in Northern California. I sent my shaver in 2 weeks ago and they STILL have not looked at it.&lt;br /&gt;So let me get this straight - I paid over 200 bucks for a high end shaver and I have to pay shipping to get it fixed? and wait 3-4 weeks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the last Braun I ever buy, moving to Panasonic after this, or some other decent brand once I do some research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure others have had the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> Works great. Upgraded from 5 series. Definitely shaves better and closer.</li>
    <li> I was over whelmed at first by what seemed complicated to use, but it was actually very easy and works very well.  thanks to other reviewers for their excellent info.</li>
    <li> Works well, but it still takes a couple of passes in different direction to get rid of all the stubble. Cleaning station is convenient.</li>
    <li> I got tired of shaving with Norelco shavers and having to use a safety razor to get missed hairs and my neck areas. This Braun shaver shaves more closely and there are few &amp;#34;touchups&amp;#34;. It has a more powerful feel than other electric razors I have tried. I have not used it sufficiently to assess the cleaning procedure, which the Norelcos did not have. So far it appears to be worth the higher cost.</li>
    <li> not as close as I expected</li>
    <li> great shave but get tired of having to go buy the cleaning canister</li>
    <li> Great Product, but it you have to fight to get a shave even close to that of a razor and shaving cream.  Quick and effective with no muss for foggy mornings.</li>
    <li> good price fast shipping love it</li>
    <li> I have to start with the fact that this razor is not worth well over $200.00 dollars. It shaves no better than any other razor at hatf this price. Another fact is that it is (VERY EXPENSIVE) to maintain. Every single piece of accessory that this razor requires is way out of line with any razor on the market. I have hair that grows sideways and when I finish shaving with this, I have to go over my face with a regular razor. Braun should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much in this tough economy. I am stuck now because I saved up for this for 3 months. I will never trust a razor again that costs this kind of money. Don&#x27;t think becuase your over-spending you are going to get quality. Oh, and the biggest scam is the cleaning cartridges.</li>
    <li> I love my new Braun series 790cc Pulsonic Shaver system, silver Braun. I recommend that you purchase one of the best shaving razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It is does not shave as close as my previous Braun.&lt;br /&gt;It is a hassle to refill or replace the cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for over a week, so far.</li>
    <li> My face gets a closer shave with this machine than when I use a razor or go to a barber who uses a straight razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and gives very close shave.</li>
    <li> My brand new Braun cleaning station never worked for me. It would run for one second then turn off and start flashing red error lights. I called Braun to have it replaced since I was sent a faulty product and they told me I had to pay out of my pocket to ship it across the country and have it repaired. That&#x27;s great customer service. Sell someone a faulty product then tell them to pay more money to make up for their mistake. Can&#x27;t believe I paid over $200 for a broken product.&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: the actual shaver did work fine and no complaints there.</li>
    <li> I had older Braun shavers and they were very good, but this one gives a closer faster shave.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great razor, allows for nice shave....face is still getting used to this razor but definitely looking cleaner now that I am using this razor and my Andes clipper.</li>
    <li> Did not shave well, but it was ok. Need some improvment. My boy friend like it, because it is electronic.</li>
    <li> The best foil electric shaver on the market.  Very close shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver with a self cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> Good price and Amazing shaver performance! This shaver can&#x27;t be compared to  the cheaper 3 and 5 series from Braun. 790 cc performs Smooth and effective shaving!</li>
    <li> I had owned a previous model of this same product and love it. I used it for probably 5-6 years before it needed to be replaced. (And that, only because I&#x27;d dropped it twice)&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price of the cleaning fluid refill cartridges.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of the Braun shaver for many years.  The new one didn&#x27;t disappoint!  It is superior to my old shaver.  It does a great job.</li>
    <li> Man razor. My first real razor. would highly recommend, baby smooth cut.</li>
    <li> Had not use a electric shaver for years. Got tired of using a blade. Ordered the braun series 7-790 to try out. Man was I was blown away with the shave I got from it!!! To me it was as good as shaving with a blade. and the cleaning station was top notch.</li>
    <li> This is a review more of the Braun return process (which is bad) than of the shaver itself (which could be great for you, but didn&#x27;t work well for me). The return process is part of the shaver experience, and it seemed worthy of documentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHAVER&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this shaver in September, having shaved manually for a number of years and wanting to speed up my grooming. I have a fairly thick beard, and various online guides and reviews suggested that this was one of the better shavers on the market. The cleaning solution smelled great, the automatic cleaning process seemed to work well, and the entire setup looked cool in my bathroom. The shaver itself did a great job on my face but couldn&#x27;t shave fairly large sections of my neck, despite many passes from many angles, varying degrees of pressure, and weeks of acclimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RETURN PROCESS&lt;br /&gt;Different shavers work well for different people, so most consumer shavers come with money-back guarantees. The Braun is no different: you have 60 days to try it out, and if you&#x27;d like to return it, you can. Unfortunately, I found the return process frustrating and ultimately misleading. My experience was as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1. Search online for &amp;#34;braun 60 day money back guarantee.&amp;#34; The top hit is the return form pdf. Off to a good start!&lt;br /&gt;2. Read the return form, looking for a return address. Seems like an obvious place to put it, but no dice.&lt;br /&gt;3. Call the number listed on the form, then navigate four layers deep into their automated phone system. Eventually find the recorded message that reveals the return address after making you listen to much of the return form.&lt;br /&gt;4. Call the number back again and re-navigate the phone system and re-listen to the whole message, since the address is only read to you once (fairly quickly) and then the system hangs up on you.&lt;br /&gt;5. Call the number a third time and re-navigate/re-listen to check the address I have written down.&lt;br /&gt;6. Punch the address into Google Maps to increase confidence in its correctness, since I&#x27;m about to mail a fairly expensive gizmo to this address and I haven&#x27;t actually seen it printed anywhere. Pump fist when the address exists.&lt;br /&gt;7. Repack my shaver and accessories, walk it down to the Post Office, and pay to mail it and track it.&lt;br /&gt;8. Check Post Office tracking status a few days later to learn that it arrived safely somewhere, hopefully where it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;9. Wait for ~5 weeks without hearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;10. Call the Braun customer service number and speak with someone about the status of my return. They found my return in the system, which pleased me, and told me that it was being processed. No timeline estimate was available.&lt;br /&gt;11. Receive in the mail a prepaid Citi card for the amount I paid Amazon, after about 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps 1-10 could have been (much) better, but Step 11 broke the camel&#x27;s back. I purchased a Norelco shaver earlier this year, and when I took advantage of its money-back guarantee, I received a check in the mail. I didn&#x27;t have to call a number to activate the check, the money that the check conferred didn&#x27;t expire or have maintenance fees, there was no PIN to memorize, it was simple to combine the funds from the check with other funds to pay for something expensive - in other words, it was just my money back, which is exactly what was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the prepaid card I received from the Braun money-back guarantee has all of those features, and seems like a poor substitute for getting my money back. Thus, the process continued:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Call Braun customer service, express my confusion about getting a crippled card when I wanted my money back. Ask if this switcheroo is buried in fine print anywhere, or if they just do this. Be informed that it&#x27;s not printed anywhere, but that&#x27;s their policy, and there&#x27;s nothing that they can do about it.&lt;br /&gt;13. Think on this for a few minutes, then call Braun customer serviceagain and speak with someone else about it. Receive the same story again, and hear that I don&#x27;t actually need to activate the card that says &amp;#34;You must activate your card prior to use.&amp;#34; The jury is still out on this one.&lt;br /&gt;14. Write this review on Amazon, with the hope that people will be better aware of how the return process works and that Braun and Proctor &amp; Gamble will make this experience more user-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck with your shaving and/or returning!again and speak with someone else about it.

    <li> Much better than my old series 5. Even better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7 is my favorite. I own 3 of them</li>
    <li> Very close shave, but the frequency at which it vibrates (much higher than other razors) was headache inducing...</li>
    <li> Excellent shave after conditioning my skin to this shaver. Shaves closely with no irritation. The sideburn trimmer is curved instead of being straight. That makes trimming sideburns and beards more difficult than with a strait-edged trimmer. The base is very pessimistic in indicating how often the shaver needs cleaning. It has lights to show in 4 stages how dirty the head is from completely clean to needs a thorough cleaning now. It usually indicates that a complete cleaning is necessary after only two uses. That is simply not accurate.</li>
    <li> My second series 7.  A great razor!</li>
    <li> I moved up from a Braun series 3 to the Braun 790. It is a quantum leap forward and I&#x27;m now shaving every day and enjoying it. Amazon thank you very much for the price reduction.</li>
    <li> I had the Braun model 7570 and it wasn&#x27;t worth having.  So this has been a big step up.  I would not have bought another Braun if the reviews had not been so positive.  This is the closest shave I have gotten, ever.</li>
    <li> This is a REALLY nice shaver! Works great. Son in law uses it to shave his head and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it.  Thanks for the speedly delivery, too!</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco for years,my 8240xl shaves decent but Norelco has always been hard on my neck. 790CC-4 first shave and I am sooo happy with closeness and comfort. No discomfort on neck. Shaved as close as a blade and only took 90 seconds to do it. Fifty two years old and finally found shaving paradise!!! I was scared I would spend $164 and not have improvement over Norelco,if you are hesitant go for it.  Close and easy under nose, jawline and neck!&lt;br /&gt;  Shaver has a substantial quality feel to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JAN.26,2012&lt;br /&gt;After using for a few days I can&#x27;t believe how comfortable and close this razor shaves. WOW! Literally shaves closer than a blade with no skin discomfort,irritation or nicks!</li>
    <li> come quick works well looks good.it works comfortably, it worth that much price. try it next thanksgiving. the cleaning system a bit noisy. fully automatic.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old 360 series shaver that developed a problem with the switch (still useable but the trimmer setting became a bit difficult to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more pleased with the Series 7---I thought of not &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; but getting the equivalent of my old shaver.  Glad I upgraded. The shaver head has independent &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; on the two shaving surfaces to adjust to the shape of my face, and the shave is definitely smoother and closer.  This is one of the best pieces of engineering one can find in the area of personal care products---ergonomic design is just right, the shaving head is simply outstanding and the &amp;#34;clean and renew&amp;#34; holder is not only well designed but also shuts off after the shaver is cleaned and charged (no more slow drainage on the electrical circuit---it was never a lot, but many many &#x27;small&amp;#34; drains add up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case for the shaver is a plastic reinforced (very rigid reinforcement) cloth container shaped to fit the shaver. It has a zipper.  An improvement (I think) over the all plastic holder for my previous Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL IN ALL---an outstanding product.  If you are looking for an outstanding shaver, this is the one!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: For those who are concerned about where Braun products are being made (following the Gillette acquisition, here is the info from the box: Shaver made in Germany (5 stars for that!); Clean and Renew unit made in Hungary; Cleaning Cartridge made in Ireland; Electrical cord and travel case made in China.  From the info, this shaver head seems to be made in Germany. (No markings on the shaver head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS 2: Do not confuse this with the Series 7000 shavers.  That is a series &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; in the features, etc. hierarchy for Braun (and an earlier model).</li>
    <li> Braun has been incrementally improving their shavers for quite some time now.  This is the 3rd one I have owned from them since 2005 and it is definitely the best one.  It is essentially the same as the original Pulsonic but the design is slightly changed, they have added a speed adjustment setting and changed the color to a black/silver/gunmetal type color.&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this shaver is that if you have sensitive skin you can turn down the speed so as not to damage your face or skin as badly.  That is not to say that this shaver will do that by any means.  It will not, actually.  I use mine on the highest setting all the time to quickly take care of my facial hair and it does the trick without causing razor burn, bumps, or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is very good at charging and sanitizing but just remember to clean out the inside because hair can accumulate between cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this shaver system to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the time to use a wet razor or anyone who prefers electric shavers.</li>
    <li> This razor does its job without a problem. When used correctly, it gives a close shave, as close as one can expect from any electric razor. Contrary to what some people say, I do like the cleaning system that comes with the razor. It seems to do a better job than trying to clean it by hand. The shaving foils are very sensitive, and it pays to use the cleaning system to maintain the quality and duration of those foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: Keep the shaving head parallel to your shaving surface - makes a big difference in the closeness of the shave. I don&#x27;t suggest using a pre-shave lotion, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in shaving, and even has a tendency to gum up the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the shaver a lot, and find that I need to use it again in the evening, if we&#x27;re going out to a public place. But that&#x27;s not a problem, as it just takes a few minutes to shave.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who is very sick.  He loves it.  He shaves every day and then it cleans itself.  It gives the cleanest shave ever. I would recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> My husband had this Braun shaver a few years ago and thought it was the best.  When it was time for a new shaver he switched brands and was very disappointed.  It wasn&#x27;t long before he went back to Braun.  It&#x27;s the best and will never switch brands again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to my dad for his birthday, and he is as happy as clam!! He said that his skin is always soft after shaving!!</li>
    <li> This razor replaced my previous Braun (Older 3 Series). I had that one for over 15 years before it broke (after my wife dropped it!)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent replacement! Clean and quick shave....</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned. It replaced a grundig which up untill ne WAS the best I have ever owned</li>
    <li> I have always shaved with a regular razor but have bought various rotary razors over the years, but never was particularly impressed with the closeness and the bulky heads. This was a totally different experience. It shaves really closely and seems to be well made and solid construction.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; because he has very sensitive skin. He&#x27;s been using it about 2 weeks and has had no irritation at all! The only thing is that he has a hard time with his jawbone/ upper neck, but that may be because he hasn&#x27;t gotten used to the settings. I&#x27;ve read really great reviews on this product all over the internet, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. Amazon also shipped it very quickly. Very happy!</li>
    <li> First just a little about myself and my preferences.  I have to have an electric shaver due to really sensitive skin and a lot of issues using razors.  Another thing I consider is that I have very thick and fast growing facial hair, aka I look like a mountain man after not shaving over a weekend.  I also have to use foil shavers and have gone through several brands of various price points before I decided it is worth it to buy the high end shavers with cleaning bases.  The cleaning bases aren&#x27;t necessarily a must have but I like them personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to compare the Series 7-790cc and the Panny (Panasonic) LA-93.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of shave:&lt;br /&gt;  I would call this a tie between the two.  Panny seems have a bit more umph to the motor and a much larger shaving head than the Braun.  They both accomplish a very close shave and do it very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ability to tackle thick facial hair:&lt;br /&gt;  This one goes to the Panny.  It has a bigger shaving head and a little more muscle to the motor.  The win here is due to the fact that it took just a few minutes less to get a really good shave compared to the Braun.  The Braun is able to do very well but takes just a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Form Factor:&lt;br /&gt;  This is a very personal consideration and just my opinion but it goes to Braun.  Fits in the hand nicely and the smaller shaving head, pop-up trimmer, and lock for the head seem to have been planned out very well.  The Panny always seemed a bit awkward to hold and use.  Eventually you get used to it but the Braun was natural right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning base:&lt;br /&gt;  Panny wins hands down.  The base while it isn&#x27;t much to look at performs it&#x27;s job extraordinarily well.  Braun&#x27;s isn&#x27;t bad but not up to the Panny by a long shot.  Also not a huge fan of the citrus scent from Braun&#x27;s solution but it&#x27;s also not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me those are the main points.  I can answer any questions just leave a comment if you are debating between these two or just want to know more about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the final verdict?  Well after using each for a year (Panny) and six months (Braun) I have to say I like the Braun better out of the two.  This is a very tough decision but I seem to get a little less irritation and just as close of a shave.  The form factor for this also pushes it over the top for me.hese two or just want to know more about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the final verdict?  Well after using each for a year (Panny) and six months (Braun) I have to say I like the Braun better out of the two.  This is a very tough decision but I seem to get a little less irritation and just as close of a shave.  The form factor for this also pushes it over the top for me.</li>
    <li> As with all my other Braun shavers, it provides clean shave with minimal irritation.  This model picks up long hair much better than the old four digit models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint I have is, after inserting the shaver, the base needs to recognize it before I can push the cleaning button.  It only takes a split second, but the previous model would allow me to push the cleaning button before the shaver was recognized.  Considering that I&#x27;m in auto-pilot in the morning, waiting that split second is a hard habit to break.</li>
    <li> This is Braun flagship model.I came from shanghai.The price is attractive.So I bought it.After half many transport of month,I received my parcel.I am so exciting.Although I paid tariff.I am still very happy.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Philips/Norelco rotary shaver, and would use a regular manual razor when I wanted/needed a nice close shave, but the rotary was good enough most of the time. Then, after surgery and radiation treatment to my neck area (my battle with cancer); my doctors advised me to only use electric shavers from that point on, because any cuts to the treatment area would have difficulty healing and increase chances of infection.  So for the past two years I have relied on my rotary shaver; and although it has always given a decent shave, it would irritate my skin, and the large head was difficult to navigate around my sideburns and nose, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided it was time to upgrade. I read reviews and researched the top shavers from Braun, Panasonic, and Philips/Norelco and ultimately decided on the Braun. Based on my research, all three shavers produced similar results, so in the end it came down to price, features, and comfort.  At the time, Philips/Norelco had the best price and was offering a $50 instant rebate which made it very tempting; but because I had been using their product form some time, I really just wanted to try something else.  The Panasonic was also a good alternative, but was priced a little higher and it had a larger shaving head then the Braun, so I was worried about having the same difficulties around the nose and side-burn areas as I had with the Philips/Norelco. So my money went to Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the shaver for a few weeks now and am very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than I ever got with my Philips/Norelco, with less irritation.  The build quality is top notch and the cleaning station works great. Always leaving my shaver smelling clean and fresh. For me this shaver was a great choice, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality shaver.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old Braun 8985 slider that turns the unit on stopped working. In the past, I&#x27;ve replaced foils and cutters probably once every 2 years for that brand new shave feel. It was a good reason to replace the activator with the 790cc finally. When the new Braun shaver arrived I immediately tried it and to my surprise, the shave was closer on the regular setting than with my  8985 model. The 790cc also is more comfortable to hold in hand since it&#x27;s not as flat and heavy, but more organomic. It feels very sturdy, no rattling parts. The cleaning station feels a bit lighter but well constructed.&lt;br /&gt;I consider this shaver as a substantial upgrade to my 6 year old activator. Very happy with the purchase. Shaving is fun again :)</li>
    <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s ever had with an electric razor. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Information on the Braun web site, this shaver is Made In Germany -- YET the shaver is made in CHINA !!!~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really should get my money back</li>
    <li> Many years ago I used a Norelco rotary shaver, then switched to numerous handles with replaceable blades. About 5 years ago I switche to a Gillette M3 Power. I was pleased and surprised by the closeness and ease of shave, but I got tired of the expense of replacing the blades. Back to electric. I searched for reviews of the best available electric. I am satisfied I made the right decision. The Braun Series 7- 790 gives me a shave that beats the smoothness of the M3 Power, and leaves my skin more comfortable. I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers for the past 35 years.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Braun models, including a Norelco that allowed me to shave either wet or dry.  The 790cc beats them all for closeness and comfort.  I have had issues in the past due to my sensitive skin, but the 790cc is very comfortable.  It shaves closer than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  The cleaning/charging stand works great.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy the 790cc earlier.</li>
    <li> The shaver is excellent. It was a gift and replaces an older Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> This replaced a nearly identical Braun 7 series which I had had for many years. With Braun cleaning fluid and an occasional new blade/head set the original gave good service and this new one should keep my beard in check for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is not cheap and neither is the Braun but both are well worth it.</li>
    <li> Been using it for two years now. Works great. Sometimes the head gets caught mid-shave and pops off. Otherwise, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; shaver I have ever owned! It&#x27;s quiet, produces a super close shave, and it cleans itself! What more could you want!</li>
    <li> Love it so far. Close shave and nice quality</li>
    <li> My husband really appreciated getting this for his birthday. Works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this one after my old Braun finally wore out.  This system gives me a comfortable shave that is as close as a blade without burning or nicking.  The cleaning system assures that I always have a clean and fresh smelling razor every morning.  I have tried blades and rotary head shavers, but nothing works as well as this.</li>
    <li> Pretty great shaver, gives me a good shave for an electric, is easy to use, looks nice, I love that the charging station does self cleaning. It doesn&#x27;t handle slightly longer hair well, so don&#x27;t go in expecting for it to painlessly chop a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend running the cleanse and sharpening process every other shave.</li>
    <li> I know everybodys beard is a little different but nowhere near the shave I thought it would be.  No matter long I try to get a close shave, it always requires cleaning up with a regular razor.  It is a nice unit and feels good but no where near the results I thought I would get for the $170 I paid for the thing</li>
    <li> hands down the best electric ever! I can t say enough good things about this product. very very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Father&#x27;s Day gift to off set having to shave everyday. 2nd best to a close shave.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor! Works and Shaves great every time.</li>
    <li> Have not owned an electric shaver for about 15 years. Bought this shaver because of the way it is cleaned. No brush for cleaning whiskers. Just add water to the cleaning boat, turn the razor on, let it suds real good and PRESTO rinse in clear water let dry, and ready for use again</li>
    <li> Present for my son...his specific choice!</li>
    <li> Very convenient but not as good a shave as with a razor.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love it! Best Shaver I ever Owned!</li>
    <li> i love it so much! it works very well!</li>
    <li> Very satifiy with it , but it is not clean as good as Philip</li>
    <li> I get a great shave out of this, and without any irritation whatsoever. However the cleaning dock system needs some improvements. After a few months of use, the contacts begin to corrode, and the dock doesn&#x27;t recognize that the shaver is hooked up. After a bit of fidgeting and adjustments, it will work again, but it&#x27;s a bit of a pain for what&#x27;s supposed to be a top quality shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning fluid doesn&#x27;t last long enough for my standards. It seems like it evaporates quickly due to it containing a lot of isopropyl alcohol.</li>
    <li> This is the first time in my life I am using an electric shaver. I bought it because I had some surgery on my neck making it difficult to use a regular razor blade. I read a lot of reviews before choosing this specific one. It arrived pretty fast from Amazon, although not as fast as other items but it came with a very significant discount. It shaves pretty well but not as close as a razor, even at the best setting, I need to shave twice a day now instead f once. The cleaning system is very convenient and I use it once a day every day, compensating this way for the time loss with twice shaving and longer time to shave. I have seen no difference between the neck and the face, it is equally effective in my opinion. For the long run, if it will work the way it is described, it will be a bit cheaper then using a blade...but this remains to be proven</li>
    <li> Actually Due to Electric Shaver can&#x27;t clear my beard very well, I always shave manually,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but Braun Series 7 Shaver is best thing I ever seen, it can clear everywhere very well, Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can save my a lot of time in the morning! Very helpful to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further more, Braun Series 7 has a good outlook and good value-Price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally Speaking, It is worth to buying!</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Does a good job giving you a smooth shave, and is low maintenance.  Unfortunately, after each use, it requires cleaning in the included cleaning system.  Unfortunately, it runs through the cleaning solution very quickly and the replacement fluid module is expensive.  The main cost is in the actual plastic fluid container.  They should offer a large size fluid only bottle to refill your cleaning module, then they can sell it at a more reasonable price.  The shaver itself is quite expensive, so they should give you some sort of break on replacement supplies.</li>
    <li> Alittle background - I&#x27;m 56 years old, so I&#x27;ve been shaving for awhile.  Like many men my age, I&#x27;ve tried almost every way under the sun to shave, including a lengthy process that involves hot washcloths, a mantle of Noxema underneath shaving gel, changing blades every 5 days religiously, etc.  Additionally, I&#x27;ve tried virtually EVERY electric razor option that&#x27;s ever been made; my electric razor \\&quot;graveyard\\&quot; is embarrassing!  Bottom line - Nothing shaves closer and more efficiently than a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo, lots of hot water, and a gel product - but who can be bothered with this 20+ minute/day RITUAL?  Plus, it&#x27;s messy, uses a bunch of hot water, needs to be done immediately after a shower (or IN the shower), etc.  Enter the Braun Series 7 - 790cc.  I&#x27;ve been using it for ~1 month now, so this is no \\&quot;honeymoon review\\&quot;.  But from the VERY first shave, I was in love!  The entire kit oozes \\&quot;Teutonic Craftsmanship\\&quot; - if you want the Porsche/Mercedes Benz of electric shaver, this is it!  It&#x27;s reasonably quiet for an electric - I immediately plugged it in (since it came w/o a sufficient charge to run cordless), spooled it up to \\&quot;Intensive Shave\\&quot; (the most aggressive of the three closeness settings) and attacked my stubble.  I fully expected some \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;, since I was switching from blade to electric - NOPE!  I also expected a noticeably less close shave - wrong again!  The Braun shaves ~95% as close as a blade, with NO razor burn; I don&#x27;t care if you go over the same place 100 times (and *I* do; I&#x27;m anal like that).  Careful around your lips - you CAN get some razor burn on your lips if you&#x27;re not.  And remember to \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; your skin while you&#x27;re shaving; plus, I flip the shaver around so the head hits every section of your beard from every possible angle.  Start under your nose first - using an electric shaver will make that area sweat, so get that section done while you&#x27;re \\&quot;dry\\&quot; there.  And don&#x27;t forget the back of your neck - get out that hand-held mirror!  No razor burn THERE either - THIS was when I KNEW that Braun had hit a grandslam home run!  I have always only been able to use the \\&quot;sideburn trimmer\\&quot; of an electric shaver to keep the back of my neck shaved - with any and every OTHER electric shaver, if I used the regular shaving head to shave this area, I would break out.  Not so with the Braun!  After you&#x27;re done, just put the shaver into the cradle and push the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button - next time you&#x27;re ready to shave, it&#x27;s all charged up and fully clean!  No more removing the shaving head and trying to brush out the skin/stubble; no more blowing it out with compressed air cans.  No muss, no fuss - takes me 13 minutes to shave my face AND the back of my neck - and I go over each area multiple times.  Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price on this unit either.  Go ahead and buy the extra cleaning cartridges and an extra cutting head while you&#x27;re at it.  And DO buy a \\&quot;7 Series\\&quot;, WITH the cleaning option - Made in GERMANY, NOT Cheen-wa.  You&#x27;ll never look back, and the \\&quot;price of admission\\&quot; will soon be forgotten!  Thanks Braun, for making THE shaving system for the new millenium - this is the \\&quot;gold standard\\&quot; for which all other electric shavers will be judged.  If I were Norelco or Remington, I&#x27;d just toss in the towel and go home...razor burn THERE either - THIS was when I KNEW that Braun had hit a grandslam home run!

    <li> I bought my Braun 9595 on 7/2/08 after extensive research on trying to find the best electric razor.  At age 26, I was through with razor blades and even a cheapy rotary electric wet/dry razor, so I wanted to get the best money could buy.  There are a lot of gimmicks Braun uses here, and I&#x27;ll start with the foils.  They say that the micro foils give you the closest shave and even pick up hair on your neck that other shavers leave behind.  I just shaved with the Braun for one of the last times this morning (see below for what I&#x27;m replacing it with), and let me tell you, there&#x27;s a lot of stray hairs on my neck!  I replaced the foil head one month ago!  I should note that I stopped replacing the foil every 18 months after the first 18 months, and started replacing them yearly in hopes I could get a closer shave, sooner, but that didn&#x27;t happen with this last replacement.  Repetitively shaving over and over on my neck will make it irritated very quickly, so I&#x27;ve learned to either live with it when in a hurry or go back over it with - get this - a $17 Walmart trimmer with multiple attachments, one of which is a foil head.  No joke.  The $17 trimmer gets closer and picks up what the $200 Braun left behind!  Heck, I even bought a $5 micro shaver just as a fast, small shaver to bring on trips and THAT shaves closer than the Braun, albeit with the irritation expected from something so small and with a single focus in mind, getting close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about all the things that have failed now.  One thing I liked about the Braun was the built-in trimmer, but that broke after 3 years and would flop around until the cutter died and I had to super-glue it to the razor just to stay in place!  And what&#x27;s with the official Braun cleaning fluids - it has literally burned off the silver \\&quot;paint\\&quot; on the razor itself, just under the swiveling head, as where there was once a warning of some kind, it has been completely wiped off and is now a flat black under the paint.  I have had to grab a hand towel and nearly \\&quot;sand down\\&quot; the paint when it was chipping off, not something you expect from a fine piece of German engineering....  An LED burned out on the cleaner, and considering I clean my razor every time I use it, go figure it was the one under the Economy status light.  Why the lights flash next to the setting and not the one in the center telling you the cleaning has been activated is a little beyond me - someone will need to comment on whether or not they&#x27;ve changed that with future revisions, but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With using a good soothing aftershave, the Braun is still very bearable to use, but I shave before showering as they recommend and while in the shower, I feel a lot of irritation that I shouldn&#x27;t feel from something that has all this special mechanisms for vibrating to prevent irritation (another gimmick).  It is ridiculous how loud this razor is to operate - if my girlfriend is sleeping, not even a closed bathroom door will prevent her from waking up in the adjacent bedroom.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, but now that I know there are other razors that are quieter, shave better, and last longer (the latter is to be determined), I&#x27;ve placed my order for a Panasonic ES-LV81-K that was once a $600 shaving system, much more than the max Braun ever charged for the 9595.  This was recommended by a certain authority on what&#x27;s \\&quot;the best\\&quot; and arrives in a catalog by mail, and considering they&#x27;ve never let me down in the past in telling me what&#x27;s best, I&#x27;m going to give this one a shot in hopes that I will look more presentable day after day!

    <li> my previous shaver pulled out the whiskers, this one cut them off. Much better. They seem to want to sell you cleaning solution. I think you can clean it with a tap and some brushing of the base</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the three previous generations of the Braun top end model, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands. I&#x27;ve used this shaver for the last several weeks, and can say that it shaves closer than previous models, especially under the chin, where the older models were less than satisfactory. As a result, you can now shave faster without having to go over the same areas a number of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the overall performance is excellent, I&#x27;ve rated this item four stars for two reasons: The new trimmer design takes some getting used to. Unlike the old design, which pushes up parallel to the body, the new trimmer pops out at right angels to the body.  It&#x27;s much narrower than the old design, so this whole new configuration feel different to hold, and takes a few uses before feeling comfortable. Secondly, the concept of the new travel case is weird. It is a hard molded case designed to protect the shaver, but doesn&#x27;t accept the charging cord. You have to throw the cord into your luggage, along with the shaver case. Why not stay with the old soft case design where the cord and shaver fit into the same case?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product that could use a few small improvements.</li>
    <li> So far, everything works well. It&#x27;s nice having the base to just sit it in, and I push a button and it&#x27;s clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaves closer than other electric razors I have used easy cleaning system and holds a charge for a longer period of time</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending money on shaver refills and not getting a comfotable shave. I had a Braun electric shaver a few years ago and gave it to my son who is still using it and loves it. The new Braun Series 7 is the best shaver I have ever had. The only draw back is how loud it is during the cleaning cycles. I will definitely not be giving this one away anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an aging Braun Series 5.  The performance difference is like night and day.  The Series 7 gives a shave that is the closest to a blade that I have ever experienced.  They have also improved the cleaning system.  It now has a guage for remaining solution that actually works and is easy to interpret.  I would recommend it for anyone who uses an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> After being a long time Braun customer, this shaver forced me to switch to Panasonic!&lt;br /&gt;Having just taken the time to agree with another user&#x27;s comments, I&#x27;ll just paste in what I wrote there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You couldn&#x27;t be more on the mark!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor after my 8000 (forgot the exact model number) fell to the floor and stopped working. This razor doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all on the first pass, and after multiple passes still leaves my face course. Also, as you mention, there is absolutely no audible feedback as to the spots that need further attention. This is the shaver I paid $195 for?!&lt;br /&gt;I then purchased the Panasonic ES8243A for $105. Although it irritates my skin a little, right after shaving, it shaves infinitely better than the Braun! And gives enough feedback to know where you have missed. The only other points I don&#x27;t like about the Panasonic are that it&#x27;s more plasticy than the Braun, and didn&#x27;t come with any kind of cleaning system. This might be a blessing in disguise, since I just tried to return the Braun, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow it because it contains \\&quot;hazardous materials\\&quot;! What a joke. They sent it to me, but I can&#x27;t send it back to them?!!!&lt;br /&gt;***** BEWARE *****&lt;br /&gt;Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you return this razor! When I attempt to do so, all I get is a message stating that it contains \\&quot;hazardous materials\\&quot; - and a \\&quot;continue shopping\\&quot; button on the bottom of the page - no further information.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you have to go through all the trouble of returning it to Braun directly -- you can read other comments here about how that goes!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Braun for about a week now. It definitely shaves much closer than my previous Braun (which was excellent). It&#x27;s a bit noisy, but VERY effective. The price is high, but when you only purchase a shaver every 10 years so, it&#x27;s not a bad value.</li>
    <li> This is the best foil shaver currently available. I have owned foil shavers for over 50 years and Braun shavers for about 30 years. I have a Syncro, 8995 360 Complete, and most of the previous top models.  The display on the 8995 is the most advanced by far and gives lots of useful information, but the 8995 is not as good overall as the 790cc, and uses the older NiCd batteries.  The 790cc uses lithium ion batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is much faster than the older models, and offers various settings to customize for the particular face area or type of beard. It can do an average shave very quickly, or an extremely close shave if you take more time, locking the head for some areas. The trimmer flips out about 1 1/2 inch perpendicular to the shaver body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have two Braun Pulsonic Shavers, an original 790cc and a newer 790cc-4. The earlier shaver suffered a failure of the trimmer mechanism and was finally replaced by Braun under warranty. The clean and charge overflowed if the drain stopped up. The newer 790cc-4 trimmer has worked perfectly, and the clean and charge has been redesigned so the drain does not stop up. Both shavers will experience paint peeling on the back (from the cleaning solution) after about a year of use. Braun should offer instant replacement of any failed shavers under warranty. Service Centers are often unreliable with slow turnaround.  It is totally unacceptable that major cities like Houston do not have a Service Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an extremely fine shaver, smooth, fast, comfortable, powerful, and the best foil shaver I have used. It is highly recommended. I have several friends who previously used rotary shavers that bought a 790cc-4. They also find the Braun a superior product and are extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> the best razor! more than expected for that price love it and that is all that I have to say about this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a philips Norelco for a while that worked okay, but this shaver is outstanding.  Much less irritation.  Less time wasted in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like the cleaning station, although it is quite loud.  I live alone, so the noise is not an issue for me, but something to consider for you married folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it on a deployment and the battery lasts at least as long as advertised and the battery meter is really nice to have.  Although, I don&#x27;t have the cleaning station with me, so I&#x27;m reminded daily that my shaver is not sanitized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have received 5 stars, but I called Amazon Customer Service minutes before ordering this and they assured me I would receive a $50 statement credit, but now they are trying to reneg.  Very dissapointing from a company I have used so frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: after speaking with their Customer Service again, and requesting to speak with the manager, I was given the $50 statement credit that I was promised.</li>
    <li> Much improved over my last Braun razor. Easy to handle and cleans much quicker. It also holds a charge longer and shaves closer.</li>
    <li> This si the best shaver i have used in my entire life. So far i have always been shaving with the best gillette and schick blades.&lt;br /&gt;Also moved to a straight razor for a few months for the heck of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But god, do i love this shaver. I feel like shaving all the time now. I am enamored by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives such a great shave, so close, so smooth, zero skin irritation.Feels like shaving against the grain without any razor burn or bumps or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridge is ok. It still has some hair left here and there. Nothing a rinse cannot cure.&lt;br /&gt;I got it for thanksgiving from Walmart for 145$ + tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to use this one. I have not used the panasonic arc 5 but that is at least 200 $ more. Go with this and you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s last shaver died, and he was using his mustache trimmer to shave.  I hadn&#x27;t known that, so when he told me, I hopped on Amazon and got him this shaver.  He loves it!  It does a great job shaving his face, very smooth results.  I, and my husband, highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was pleased I picked the Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver . Close shave and looks sharp</li>
    <li> Finally got rid of my 10 year old Norelco. Great razor</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, he said this is the best shaver he has ever had. It was very smooth and didn&#x27;t make it face break out at all and took half the time to get a perfectly clean shave! High price but an incredible product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun Series 7 razor for about half a year now. It still cuts just as well as the first time. I used to get a lot of acne breakouts with my straight razor, these gives me none at all. On the gentle setting (the one I use all the time) it takes no time at all to shave, it looks BETTER than a straight razor, and leaves literally no razor burn or red marks on my skin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot recommend highly enough. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> Shaver works great, husband happy and has a baby face now. I am a happy woman. Would recommend this shaver.!</li>
    <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> Having used an older Norelco shaver for the past few years I guess I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing with a high quality shaver.  My face has slowly adjusted to this razor and the shave has only gotten better.  Not only that but the razor burn and ingrown hairs that caused acne on my neck and face seemed to have almost instantly cleared up.  The cleaning feature is great, I have been taking out the fluid cartridge per a recommendation I read to help preserve the life of the cartridges.  It&#x27;s a little annoying but it should help them last longer.  The cleaning cycle is definitely loud so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend running it first thing in the morning if your spouse is sleeping.  Don&#x27;t think twice about dropping the money on this razor, it&#x27;s worth it ten times over for the quality of your skin if nothing else.  You can also look at the 760cc which is basically the same razor without the &amp;#34;quick clean&amp;#34; ability and a different color...but if you are spending the money you may as well pony up and get the highest end Braun.</li>
    <li> I chose this as it was rated number one out of the top ten.  My husband has a tough beard and nothing else worked.  This works wonders on him and he loves it.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Series 7-790cc electric razor.  I purchased this one for my winter home in Arizona.  I like everything about this razor - the shave, the way it fits my hand, the cleaning system, the low noise level, good features.  Buy it - you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! I never thought an electric razor could work as well as this one does. It&#x27;s comfortable to use, and gives a smooth shave every time. Like every electric razor it doesn&#x27;t handle the neck and chin area particularly well, but it does better than most. Self-cleaning is super easy: just put it on the charger and press the clean button.</li>
    <li> My hus band says it is a good razor. He is glad I got it for him. Last Braun lasted 6 years.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, nice cut, the cleaning system is much better than the former one (I like the fast speed cleaning).</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy this because of the cleaning/charging apparatus and having another wall wart sucking power 24/7. But I have resigned myself to either unplugging the power supply when not in use or eating the little electricity that it uses. But worse than that waste of resources are the cleaning cartridges which are made of plastic and evidently not recyclable. If Braun were a responsible corporation, they would offer some kind of exchange on the plastic cartridges, or make them in a way that they would compost quickly. They could also put a switch on the wall wart so that power could be shut off to it when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if those things bother you, you can put them away and clean the shaver manually, the same way you cleaned your old Braun. The cord that plugs into the charger/cleaner stand will plug directly into the shaver to charge it directly. Of course, you still have to deal with the wall wart because the transformer for charging is not built into the shaver.</li>
    <li> Great shaver but the cleaning machine is way to loud.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband for a Christmas gift. He has wanted an electric razor for a long time. Purchased this one based on the other reviews. It has far exceeded his expectations. He loves it</li>
    <li> Shaver is very nice and gets real close on my but i have bad skin and some pitts on my face and does not do a good job of getting in crevices. If your face is perfect this would be a good tool but if you have some breakouts our pitts you might want to try another shaver.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shaver! The battery stays charged for an amazingly long time. It spends a lot of time in my pickup so I can &amp;#34;shavedrive&amp;#34; if needed to save time.</li>
    <li> Excelent buy. The shave is great.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the cost of the cleanig &amp; renew. You must have stock of the cleaning supplies and the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s a great choice.</li>
    <li> I read quite a few reviews before I settled on this shaver. I have always used a rotary electric shaver, but my last one had a battery that only worked for 2 years and did not allow you to plug it in directly so there was no way I was going to spend money on another rotary shaver. I am very happy with the Braun 790. It shaves great and cleans easily. The battery is rated for 10 years and even when it dies I can still pug it in directly and shave. A great electric razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace my 370cc series which lasted over 7 years.  Decided to upgrade to the 790cc series and love it. It is more ergonomic in my hand, has multiple settings, and tracks the cleanliness through the hygiene indicator so it doesn&#x27;t automatically clean it unless I press a button to do so,  and is quieter while cleaning.  Excellent !</li>
    <li> Bought this series 7 shaver to replace a series 3 that I had for many years.  The series 3 performed flawlessly all these years.  I will miss it.  The battery would not hold a good charge anymore. I am very impressed with the series 7. Faster and quieter that the old series 3. Shaving takes much less time and the results are far superior.  I hope the new one will last for as many years as my old trusty series 3.</li>
    <li> Noticeably closer, yet more comfortable shave than my old Remington.  The cleaning feature keeps the blade clear after each shave which is probably why you get a consistently good shave.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed . My previous Series 7 gave me a closer shave. Is it possible that I received a used shaver?</li>
    <li> Top of the line shaver and the price reflects it. Having the bucks it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several others and this one id for sure the best one. Have done lots of research before buying so you can trust the short review.</li>
    <li> I just love watching this slick thingy sitting on my desk.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel the scenary all day long.&lt;br /&gt;It perfectly generate a &#x27;grown-up&#x27; boy mood in entire room just by sitting on the desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way to &#x27;decorate&#x27; your room slick, and it perfectly goes along with my fancy-looking Samsung monitor..&lt;br /&gt;For functions,&lt;br /&gt;**not recommend for wide-area shaving. I got this product only for my mustache and it works just as clean as razors and wet shaving methods i&#x27;ve been tried for a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS)&lt;br /&gt;I love the manly sound and strong vibration, even if it is a bit noisy and strong for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Clean shave, quick to charge, cordless to boot!!  Always clean and fresh! What more could one want from an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a Series 3-390CC to replace my OLD Braun that finally died after 8 years.  I was very disappointed when I discovered that my older shaver actually did a better job.  I managed to get the Series 7-790CC on sale and it actually shaves closer than a razor!  Ignoring the bells and whistles and simply evaluating this on it&#x27;s ability to provide a close shave and nothing I&#x27;ve found compares to it.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried Norelco, Remington and Panasonic...and they were all \\&quot;OK\\&quot;...but I was still reaching for the blade for special events.  I believe I&#x27;ll be able to throw them out at this point!  Updated - 05/03/2013 - 6 months later, the razor is vibrating badly and the locking mechanism for the tilt head has failed.  While it&#x27;s under warranty, the only local service center close to Chicago, IL is in Massachusetts!  I can send it there at my expense where they&#x27;ll have it for an unknown length of time and repair it for \\&quot;free\\&quot; or not and send it back to me.  I&#x27;ll probably send it in for repair and sell it on ebay when I get it back.  The shave was great while it lasted, but the quality is lacking and the after purchase support is poor!</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re in the market for a good shaver, this is it. nice to be able to adjust how clean you want the shaver to cut and the charger/cleaner is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m pulling one star for not being able to use the shaver in the shower.</li>
    <li> One of the best online purchases in years! Easy to operate with superb craftsmanship and smooth lines! Shaver fits well in either hand and offers selective shaves for skin type and sensitivity!</li>
    <li> bought it for myself.compared to the one I bought for my dad, I am a selfish son haha. it can shave easily and quick. That&#x27;s the most important part</li>
    <li> This shave was the best thing to ever happen to me, I had a electronic shaver before and it use to cause me to break out all the time because it was so hard to clean and maintain. With the Braun, it cleans itself and hasn&#x27;t broken me out as much. I still get a few pimps here and there but not like before, I&#x27;d get these huge pimples. I also never get any cuts so that&#x27;s a positive and it&#x27;s easy to shave and quick.</li>
    <li> The razor does a nice job overall, but I still have hairs all over the face and neck region that do not get lifted and cut.  Because they lay flat against the skin they are missed. The instructions tell you NOT to shave after showering or after cleaning the face. Not sure how to prep the beard or stubble prior to shaving to improve the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system seems to work very well, but the the digital display is silly. After each use the display tells you HYGIENE is low. Time to clean. The liquid replacement solution is not cheap and I am trying to figure out if I will come out ahead overall with future purchases of both the shaving screen, shaving replacement blades, and cleaning solution VS the traditional and very expensive Mach or Gillette razors. I would love to be a test case for the razor manufacturers.</li>
    <li> I forget what it was even like to use a razor. The 7 series Braun is pretty affordable now, and I have been using it for awhile. I have given 2 as gifts and they were very well received. The cut is great and it couldn&#x27;t be easier to use --- the charge lasts long enough to travel with, and it gets a nice deep clean when you return. The blades are expensive but really rarely need to be replaced. Overall, I am hoping for this to last about 5 years - it shows no signs of quitting with daily use. Needless to say it is Made in Germany and very high quality.</li>
    <li> Why would I replace it?  Well to be honest this shaver is lighter.  So now I can take it on trips.  And it shaves closer than my old 8500.  I really like this shaver.  Not once has it yanked a hair out of my face.  I will never buy anything but Braun.  The old 8500 even with new heads and freshly charged use to pull a hair out of my face ever now and then.  Not a single hair has been pulled with the new 7 series.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of this shaver, it is truly a masterpiece of electric shaver, also the lifetime of cleaning solution is a bit short, only couples of weeks</li>
    <li> big improvement from previous model. love it.it has more option to clean and more option for shaving.it gives closer shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver was recommended to me for my husband, so  I purchased it as a Christmas present.  My husband is very happy with it and says it gives him a close shave.  It&#x27;s also easy to take care of.</li>
    <li> First, let me establish a baseline that was helpful for me when looking at shaver reviews; my facial hair isn&#x27;t overly course, my skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts, and I generally (used to) skip a day between shaves without looking like I had more than a 5:00 Shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I love this shaver! I am now shaving pretty much every day because it is just so easy to do now. I hate using a traditional blade on my face and always have, but have just dealt with it because I never really tried an electric razor. After years of my neck staying rashed and bumpy, I figured I would try a different approach. I tried using my Wahl Trimmer&#x27;s foil cutter head and was honestly amazed at the shave it gave me. Well, that&#x27;s when I decided I would look at a good shaver. I read and watched several reviews and decided just to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative I read on this shaver was the shave time. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it is much different than using a razor. It may take a little longer, but nothing worth mentioning as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cleaner is a nice feature, and I am pleased it has it. I like the &amp;#34;no maintenance&amp;#34; approach this gives you. One less thing I have to do after shaving (clean the head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave is very good. I do have to say that perhaps you CAN get a little closer with a traditional razor, but I think that is generally expected. For me, there is very little difference since I don&#x27;t have a thick beard anyhow. My wife gives this the nod of approval on smoothness of shave, so that is the only standard I have to meet. Also my skin isn&#x27;t having any problem adjusting to this shaver, and the bumps on my neck have reduced some already (just about 3 weeks in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and size of this is great. I love the range of motion the head has and the lock feature is easy to use and handy. The Panasonic models this gets compared to look rather large and chunky, so this is a great size IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the LCD monitor, battery life far exceeds the hygiene, so I have never seen the battery drop more than 1 little block in a weeks usage (at which point I run it through the cleaning cycle and the battery gets recharged). If you had to take this thing with you on a trip, I don&#x27;t see the battery going dead unless it is over a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it over again, I would certainly buy this again, and I have already recommended it to some of my friends.great size IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the LCD monitor, battery life far exceeds the hygiene, so I have never seen the battery drop more than 1 little block in a weeks usage (at which point I run it through the cleaning cycle and the battery gets recharged).

    <li> Before this product, I used Braun Series-3, compared to series 3, this product is much much better.&lt;br /&gt;and, i also loved this price! order this product!</li>
    <li> I never used an electric razor and was hesitant on purchasing this for months thinking if it didn&#x27;t work to my advantage it would be a waste of money. After the first shave with this thing, I am sold. No painful razor burn feel like I typically get when I manually shave. If your face is sensitive, try this out. It has three different pulsonic settings to adjust for comfort.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Series seven does exactly what it claims and that is paramount. If you are in the market and looking for an outstanding product, buy now!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so i looked at all the reviews and decided that it was time for me to upgrade from the Braun 7526. I have only owned the new 790cc for a short time and have only used it less than 5 times, but there are some things that i noticed immediately from the 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Smoothness - The 790cc does not sound like its cutting anything and easily runs through my hair, no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;2: Faster - The 790cc cuts faster than my 7526, so my less time spent in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;3: No Bleeding - I have not cut myself once, and i deliberately tried to by pushing hard around my face in areas the 7526 drew blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on what i wrote above, i guess you can tell what the pros are over my Braun 7526, but there is one thing that still does not match the old 7526, a close shave. Not saying the 790cc does not provide a close shave, just the 7526 shaves closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas of my face that are dense with hair, the 7526 leaves less shadow, so this is the only things that disappoints me and why i did not give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell about battery life, durability and maintenance, but if it lasts as long as my other Braun, it should pass with flying colors.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7  7- 790cc Shaver System, in Silver is one of the closest shaving razor  that I have ever used it</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I have never actually owned other electrical shaver before but did not regret switching from manual to this shaver. Convenient and doesn&#x27;t cut my skin. It&#x27;s much cheaper getting it from Amazon than from my local retailers. It&#x27;s cheaper by more than 50%.</li>
    <li> This is definitely worth the money. I just used it this morning and am thrilled with the closeness of the shave and how I could hardly feel it. It is loud but not obnoxiously so, and for all I know it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s powerful. It didn&#x27;t pluck a single hair, just nice smooth cuts. I also like the styling.</li>
    <li> Husband says it is F***ing bad ass, He wishes he have had this razor during his deployments to the middle east. Clean shave that feels fresh, good after shave/cleaner, it smells lemonish, definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble shaving. My beard is thick and it always hurts. I found the art of shaving to be the best system... However, this does not hurt to use, I shave first with this then go back with a blade to clean it up... I won&#x27;t be buying another electric razor. They just don&#x27;t work well for thick beards</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this product! I bought it from Amazon because here in Australia it had a retail price of $599 and I quite frankly wasn&#x27;t going to pay that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the shaver has the cleaning function. It performs well and it gives you a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It works as offered, very robust, battery life is long enought. Motor is strong to shave deeply. I recommend this machine for those who have strong and dense hairs. Cleaning system is cool. Unfortuantely there are not batteries spares officially. What am I going to do when batteries turn off?.</li>
    <li> I very like it  and it  is very convenient，790 shave cleanand I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this shaver if you&#x27;re partial to electrics.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my choice. It was between this one and a Panasonic model.  Good clean shave and very well designed.</li>
    <li> I feel Braun makes the best shavers on the market and have been using them for at least 20 years.  For an electirc shaver, it gives a good shave with no complaints from me.  Others have tried to get around not using the cleaning refills or adding alcohol to them -- that just doesn&#x27;t work.  Their cleaner keeps this shaver clean &amp; lubricated.  I have been buying the refill cartridges from Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save at a decent price.  If you buy this shaver, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I went on a trip recently and American Airlines completely lost my bag, so I lost my 790cc shaver.  I bought this new one to replace it, and I&#x27;m loving it.  It was already a 5-star shaver, but now this one is quieter than the last one, so now all the more solid of a 5.  I preferred the white color of my old cleaning base, but this black with sparkles one is okay too.  But I like the color of the new shaver though.</li>
    <li> Had five series for two years and needed an upgrade. Love the cleaning system and ease of shave.  A little noisy when cleaning, but lasts a while.</li>
    <li> This was a huge switch from my rotary Norelco...but we&#x27;ll worth the purchase...from the point of ordering it to receiving it and using it...I could not be more satisfied! My face never felt better and the self cleaning in between shaves is a plus! I can&#x27;t really say anything negative about the Braun Series 7!</li>
    <li> was great for an automatic shaver but automatic shavers are not my thing. gave to my brother and he says it is the best he has ever used</li>
    <li> Top quality that should last for years and probably be more economical than buying a cheaper Braun model every couple of years. Comfortable and close shaves.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I wish my old razor had quit sooner.  I never had a idea they had improved shaving so much.</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews i decided to purchase this shaver and it did not disappoint. This is my first electric shaver and it is very comfortable, it takes a little getting used to, especially shaving the neck area, the cleaning system is awesome</li>
    <li> Excellent product; exceeds my expectations. Would recommend it to others who have never needed an electric shaver before. Chose it because of its high CR rating.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver better than the round type.  He says it works best if he uses it every day.  I sometimes catch him using it after work to keep smooth at night.  He will let it go over the weekend sometimes and use the straight razor Monday mornings.</li>
    <li> i own a older vision of the 7 series and the blade gone not sharp enough after 3 years using. this one this great, but the cleaning station could be better quality and shorter cleaning time</li>
    <li> Had to have this item shipped to an address in the US before it could be shipped to me in Hong Kong. The same model sells here for US$400, and Amazon has it for less than half that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that this is one fantastic electric shaver. I&#x27;m really glad to have figured out the shipping because this is one helluva dry shaver. I used to use a Panasonic which was a very good wet shaver as opposed to a dry shave. This Braun is much easier as it doesn&#x27;t require much prep as a  wet shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7th April 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this shaver for about a year and a half. The shave is not as close as it used to be and was just about to replace the shaving block when this happened: The position lock broke. Then also the clean n shave thing started to malfunction so that it starts the cleaning process and almost immediately stops functioning. Of course the recharger won&#x27;t work whilst plugged into the cleaning device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother with repairing it since it may cost too much once I factor in the price for a replacement shaving block, hence am off to review the Panasonic 5-head products for a probable purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was quite satisfied with the item, but really didn&#x27;t expect it to start malfunctioning so soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used an electric shaver for the convenience.  Started out with the old Norelco 3-headed lift &amp; cut.  It did the job but was never great.  About 10 years (yes 10!), I got a Braun 8585 that I have used up until 2 weeks ago.  It still works fine and even holds its charge still, but I needed a new cutter foil head and a refill of the clean &amp; renew fluid...those 2 together are about $50 so I figured it was time to spring for a new shaver.  Having read the mostly positive and some negative reviews of guys coming from the old 8000 series I was hesitant if I should even opt for the 7-series.  I figured the 5-series wasn&#x27;t much of an upgrade, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did.  I don&#x27;t have the thickest beard, so YMMV...but the 790cc is a definite improvement over my old 8585 workhorse.  The Pulsonic shaving action definitely vibrates faster than my 8585 and it does shave faster and closer.  The pop-out hair trimmer is not as good though, but that is a secondary feature so I&#x27;ll let that slide since it does still work.  The LCD battery &amp; hygiene scales are gimmicky but will be convenient when travelling.  I also like that the shaver body is sealed now so it can be rinsed/cleaned under water, something my old 8585 couldn&#x27;t do.  Again, it&#x27;s not a big deal feature when home and you have your clean &amp; renew dock charger, but will be good when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the clean &amp; renew fluid, I find it a worthwhile expense.  It keeps the shaver head clean and lubricated.  Since the fluid is still fairly costly, I don&#x27;t use it everyday.  I typically wait for it to get to the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning cycle (there are 3 cleaning cycles: eco, normal, intensive) which is usually every 3 days or so for me.  I&#x27;ve found using the eco cycle every day really burns through the fluid, but waiting to do it less frequently will result in the fluid just evaporating before you get to use it all since it is alcohol based.  So by doing it every 3rd day, one cartridge usually lasts me about 2.5 months.about 2.5 months.</li>
    <li> Nice for the men with hard beard</li>
    <li> First electric in years. They have come along way. Clean the shaver after every shave and you&#x27;ll be impressed. I finally god rid of my blades a and shaving cream</li>
    <li> Use it for special needs son. Close shave that doesn&#x27;t tug hair. Self cleaning a positive.</li>
    <li> Best razor that I have ever owned. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a heavy beard and sensitive skin. Having the three settings that are so easy to change as you are shaving makes for much closer shaving experience.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Will report back if I find something to note about.</li>
    <li> I am a new owner of this unit and using first time. Very good one and I LOVE it.. Can I use in wet shaving ?</li>
    <li> My husband chose this and since he got it and started to use it I have heard nothing but raves. He gets a closer shave and after talking him into replacing his old one, I&#x27;m sure glad I did. You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver.. does it job well.. and great price from Amazon</li>
    <li> What a great shaver to use. It&#x27;s very convenient to use. It gives a great shave everyday, smooth without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see... Where to start?  Well, first off the shaver is an excellent fine tuned machine, solidly built and easy to hold.  I absolutely love it!  It is great for my sensitive areas, such as my neck and underneath my chin.  I also love how you can select and change to motor speeds at will.  Cleaning is also a snap!  Just as easy as placing it in the base or by manually cleaning it under running water and using soap!  What I love most about it is that It gets, for the most part, skin close, which is something I could never do with a blade.  And for my money, its a sure thing!  The only complaint I have with this shaver is that does an okay job on my neck.  Now don&#x27;t get me wrong!  It does a decent, presentable job!  The only thing is that on my neck the facial hair grows accross and to the right, which is somewhat difficult for me to shave regardless of stretching the skin in different directions (as it says to shave agains the grain when in use).  That being said, this is where the trimmer shines and I am able to clip off the hairs that the foils have missed when shaving the majority of my neck stubble off.  But other than that the shaver does a commendable job, even with a weekends worth of growth on my face!</li>
    <li> I have used a straight razor for many years but decided to try an electric as my hand is not as steady as it used to be with a sharp blade.  The Braun is not quite as close of a shave as the straight razor but it is pretty close and it fast and quiet and does not irritate my skin as I had feared.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver primarily to shave my head. My head is not the easiest to shave as I have a full head of very thick hair. After reading several reviews I decided to give it a try. Simply put I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) It shaves my head very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;2) Does not leave any skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;3) Cleaning system is a nice feature&lt;br /&gt;4) Works great for both DRY and WET shaving. I&#x27;ve used it in the shower without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Doesn&#x27;t shave my neck area below the chin as well as top line rotary shavers. It could just be my skin type as a friend of my tried it as said &amp;#34;Wow...best shaver he&#x27;s used.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;2) Hygiene bar - If you normally wash your shaver in running water like I do, you might get confused as to why the Hygiene bar doesn&#x27;t refill. Truth is that for it to be at full Hygiene you need to use the cleaning base as it uses denatured alcohol to clean.&lt;br /&gt;3) Clean and Renew cartage cost can add up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;1) It catches hairs very well if you are just face shaving. If you are shaving your head it will not catch hair as well as your shaver is often facing downwards. If you dry shave your head, take you shirt off so it doesn&#x27;t fall on your clothes. Personally I prefer to use it in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to deal with any loose hair particles.&lt;br /&gt;2) You don&#x27;t need to clean it with the base all the time. I tend to clean it twice a week and normally just rinse it after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;3) SAVE THE CLEAN AND RENEW CAP - If you don&#x27;t use the base to clean everyday take it out and cover it with the cap as it will slow down evaporation. If you leave it in the base it will evaporate faster.&lt;br /&gt;4) If you don&#x27;t want to spend on the clean and renew, you can actually make it yourself. Just search &#x27;DIY Clean and Renew&#x27; in google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product. One of the best shavers I&#x27;ve used and certainly the best foil shaver to date. I would recommend this product to anyone and especially those using it to shave their head.to shave their head.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another Braun, purchased about 7 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner base has been slightly re-styled but uses the same cleaning fluid cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels nicer in the hand -- much slimmer and the shaving head is angled a bit. Trimmer pops more out than up and works well.&lt;br /&gt;The shave quality seems improved (but that may be a function of the fact that the old unit had worn foils/blades -- they say you&#x27;re supposed to replace them every 18 months and I never did in 7 years.) Build quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I like this new Braun better than the old one. It&#x27;s expensive but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> The high price tag aside, the Series 7 delivers a close shave and has excellent cleaning accessories. The replacement cleaning cartridges are expensive, though.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is moderate to fine and I don&#x27;t shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;This razor cuts though a 3 day beard with ease and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a better razor.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed. I was expecting more. I liked my old Brauns better.</li>
    <li> Good product,it shaves clearer than phlips.Only when it is working it has strong vibration.</li>
    <li> Converted from my Gillette razor to this bad boy.  Never used an electric shaver before because of all the bad things I&#x27;ve heard about them.  Completely proven wrong; I am officially impressed. So far not a single con other than the price; this thing is over-engineered in a good way, the shave was completely fine and irritation free even on a couple day stubble, completely opposite of what I expected.  Can&#x27;t wait to shave again.  Can&#x27;t speak on behalf of electric razors in entirety, but this thing is great.</li>
    <li> It is much cheaper to buy this type shaver in us than in my country. Very good!</li>
    <li> Works very much as expected, quiet and a great quick shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is okay. I have to say I was disappointed with the individual results I had with it. I read the Amazon reviews and read up on Consumer Reports about this shaver before buying it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, It is a great quality shaver with a powerful yet gentle motor which caught most but not all of my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is my individual problem and the reason for me to rate it 3/5 stars. Like some of the other Amazon reviewers I experienced dilemmas with catching and cutting flat laying hairs on my neck. Which have always been a problem areas as they grow in every direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have tried 2 Philips dry rotary razors, 1 Philips wet/dry foil razor,  1 Wahl dry foil and 4 Remington MS2-390 foil razors. All purchases within a 10 year period...I would say I am very experienced in the world of electric razors. The Remington MS2-290 was the best for me but unfortunately they have been discontinued. So I am on a quest to find an electric razor that will provide a close shave and get all of my facial hair. It doesn&#x27;t matter the cost and that is why I considered this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well here is what I loved...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cleaning station spoils you if you ever had to clean any other electric shaver. It makes life so much easier when you don&#x27;t have to clean up fragments of facial hair off the sink.&lt;br /&gt;2. The charge and the hygiene indicator was a great visual of how long you needed to charge and clean the razor.&lt;br /&gt;3. The cleaning cycle was pretty quick, leaving the razor ready to go within about 30 mins. (No one wants to hear or see that thing cleaning for hours after you have used it)&lt;br /&gt;4. The razor is quiet compared to the other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;5. Again very powerful motor that was gentle on sensitive skins. No pulling or niches of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;6. You can even adjust the power based on how your skin reacts to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;6. If you wanted you could charge the razor and shave at the same time or in other words you can use it corded.&lt;br /&gt;7 Also if you wanted to avoid the cleaning station, you can still clean your razor manually which might save you money on cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After 4 weeks of use it kept missing patches of neck hair despite following instructions and using preshave products to straighten the hairs. This is to me is major because when you purchase a razor such as this one, at a hefty price that it is going for, you really want an all-in-one amazing electric razor. In addition to using this razor I had to use a fine beard trimmer to get all of the longer hairs it missed. That defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product if you have the right facial hair for it to cut. However, if you have stubborn facial hair that goes in all directions I would suggest the Remington F5-5800 first, The F5-5800 goes for a much smaller price and it performed just slightly better as this one.or in other words you can use it corded.&lt;br /&gt;7 Also if you wanted to avoid the cleaning station, you can still clean your razor manually which might save you money on cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> This is my third Braun shaver. I liked them all, but this is the best. It is outstanding even when I am having to plow through a few days of growth. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got this for my Boyfriend - he has used it one time only and so far he LOVES it!!!</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVER I EVER USED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that grows facial hair very fast and thick. The common thinking seems to be &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t get a clean shave with an electric razor&amp;#34;. That ends here, I&#x27;ve used this razor for almost 2 years, it&#x27;s also been through a deployment to the middle east. excellent battery life and the cleaning station is perfect. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I needed to express my feelings on this device.</li>
    <li> I have purchased cheap electric razors in the past, and figured they did not work well because they were cheap.  After several years of shaving my face and head with a razor, I decided to bite the bullet and buy a good electric razor.  After much research, I bought the Braun Series 7 - 790cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it would not shave as close as a razor, but this is a joke.  After shaving, it looks like I have a days worth of growth on my face and head.  I normally takes me about 3 minutes to shave my head and face with a razor and shaving cream, and I&#x27;m baby smooth.  I spend at least 5 minutes with this electric razor and look like I haven&#x27;t shaved at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also shave my legs, and although it doesn&#x27;t get close, it does okay.  When I use a razor on my legs, I tend to get razor burn, and don&#x27;t shave every day anyway.  So the electric razor works fine for that.  No razor burn, and no one looks that close at my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely can&#x27;t use a normal disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth shave</li>
    <li> Good quality shaver. Worked pretty well but not as well as I expected with all the great reveiws. I&#x27;m an African American male and I bought this shaver to shave my head. It shaved most areas of my head very good but there were to many spots on my head that this shaver could&#x27;nt cut for it to be a keeper.</li>
    <li> the best no questions asked10 start on my book</li>
    <li> Very delicate for sensitive skin, great even for a thick beard.</li>
    <li> I went by the reviews when purchasing this product to try and find a razor I would enjoy.  I didn&#x27;t have much success with the razor conforming to the contours of my neck like everyone else did.  I also cannot stand when razors &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the hair from your face instead of trimming them.  I expected the &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; on the more aggressive settings for this razor, but it happened quite frequently on the sensitive setting, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station and cleaning solution are quite nice. I personally found the razor to sit awkwardly in the docking station and it would take multiple attempts to align the metal beads on the back of the razor to the charging units; the docking station could have been better manufactured to allow for an easier fit that didn&#x27;t have to be finagled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun offers amazing products but it simply didn&#x27;t cut it for me.  Amazon, fortunately, were beyond cordial with the return of the device, at least.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin, always gets a five o clock shadow. It does a nice job of cleaning up his face and he has much less irritation than with a blade.</li>
    <li> PROS: Great shave on face, not poky&lt;br /&gt;  Great cleaning&lt;br /&gt;  Great battery&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Inaccurate shave on neck&lt;br /&gt;  Irritations</li>
    <li> For many years, my husband has had nothing but problems using a regular razor. He decided to spend the money and buy an electric razor. The reviews for this razor were pretty consistent so he gave it a try. His facial issues are clearing up and he is shaving in about half the time.</li>
    <li> Works great. The cleaning cartridge need to be changed a little bit too often</li>
    <li> This razor provides a fast, comfortable shave. After a normal shave with this electric, I still do a very quick touch up with a blade razor (water only - no shaving cream) on a couple of areas that are always difficult no matter what type of razor I use. The final result is a much longer lasting, smooth shave than I ever got with a blade razor alone.</li>
    <li> I opened this new shaver morning (790-CC4), charged it, and started using it. I like the variable setting (3-steps) for mild to intense. I like the feel of it and although the display is less sophisticated than my old one, this one might be more practical in usage. It has a Li-Ion battery and so is a bit lighter, and seems well-constructed.</li>
    <li> It is the best shave to do what I want. Also it has the best price. I do not want the cheap items.</li>
    <li> every man should invest in this device clean lemony shave with no skin irritation!!!!!!!!!!!! get it while supplies last asap!!!!!</li>
    <li> After much research (and almost buying a Panasonic) I went with this Braun. I&#x27;ve always used a Braun, and my last one last 9 years before the battery started to die. This shaver has been great! When I first started using it, I had to check and make sure there was a plastic cover on it - it was that smooth (there actually is not a plastic protector for the foil provided which is the only negative). The shave is close and smooth and takes me about half the time as my previous Braun (500 series). I don&#x27;t have a particularly heavy beard so I can get done in about 2 minutes. One time through, even on my neck (where it works really well), and I&#x27;m done. The pop-out trimmer is also very good - it&#x27;s about an inch long and works very great. I started using this shaver on April 1 and haven&#x27;t needed to re-charge yet. 28 days on one charge is incredible. Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> I went from Braun rotary to this .... this S7 is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but I would reccommend a Braun rotary if you have the choice.  Also, this thing has the cleaning feature (which is noisey, espeically if run in the AM).  I think the cleaning solution bothers my skin, not sure.  I kind of regret buying it, can&#x27;t return it now.  I think I will try to sell and buy another rotary, loved my old Braun (sigh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of those razors that looks like a good idea ... but in the end, its stand takes a lot of room on a crowed bathroom sink, its noiey when cleaning, and the shave is ok.  Also, the trimmer is in the middle of the unit, I find myself doing acrobatic moves to trim my eyebrows or sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word: Avoid</li>
    <li> Prior to the purchase I used a 20 dollar remmington for about 2 months to see if my skin could handle the foil . After a month use of the Braun the razor is truly amazing worth every dollar .</li>
    <li> Took a few weeks to get used to the new foil, but a good shaver. Prior shaver was a braun 75XX which has lasted several years. I&#x27;ve had the new shaver a few months now and I would buy it again. Only thing I have a small amount of trouble with is the trimmer as it is on the front and not the top of the shaver. Makes it a little harder to see what you are doing, but it works.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Fits well in my hand and is comfortable to use. The trimmer can be a little ackward on certain spots but is mostly fine. I continue to like not having to clean my razor. This is my second self cleaning Braun and I am happy I bought this one.</li>
    <li> Im sorry,but I didnt like the shaver,it not what its crack up to be.Not for the price.I dont think it worth price I paid for it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Houesman</li>
    <li> Not a bad shave but I&#x27;ve had better for a lot less money. I would not buy another Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver does not shave particularly close.  It seems its prime purpose was to create a continuing source of revenue for the manufacturer.  cleaning pack lasts about 3 weeks, and blade replacements are recommended often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just junked this and changed to a Merkur double-edged razor; much cheaper, faster, and better shave.</li>
    <li> gives a close shaving in some areas but its not performing very well on the neck area ; also it is really very noisy</li>
    <li> At first, this was the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used used.  After owning it for 2 years, the blades have worn and it&#x27;s no better than a far cheaper Norelco.  I used Norelco shavers for around 10 years before I bought a Braun.  And on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best shave, obviously from a razor, I would give the Braun (with new blades) about a 7 and I would give my 40 dollar Norelco about a 6.  For just a slight improvement in shave, the Braun costs a WHOPPING $120 more!  And every couple of years you have to replace the head on the Braun, which costs $40.  The blades on my Norelcos lasted 3 or 4 times longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have money to burn, go ahead and buy the Braun.  If not go with Norelco.  I&#x27;m done with Braun.</li>
    <li> This razor is worth the money if you can swing it. I&#x27;ve used dozens of piss poor razors in my day, and this razor WOW-ed me. This is the second of these that i&#x27;ve owned. The first was gifted away when I decided to grow out a beard for a year.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. It shaves smoothly without making any irritation or pain like other shavers. I used to have Braun cruzer3 before and it used to make irritation and cut me sometimes. This one might sound expensive, but it really worths it. Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This has been Braun shavers over the last 20 years and they keep getting better and better. I have always had difficulty cutting awkward angles stubby hairs and sensitive skin after shaving. This shaver as advertise does it all. I honestly can say this saver has provided me the closest shave to use a traditional razor.</li>
    <li> Just plain junk.  I expected so much more out of a German made product.  I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow 2 hours after shaving.  It doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good as my Panasonic model, and they cost the same.  Be CAREFUL.  These products for some crazy reason are not returnable to Amazon, so after you lay out $300 for a shaver, find it&#x27;s horrible quality, you CANNOT return it under any circumstances.  Amazon phone support and a manager refused to help me.  Stay clear folks!  This is not a good product.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. I splurged because I got a job that requires me to be clean shaven. I really like it on my face. It doesn&#x27;t get hot and cuts close. However like most guys it doesn&#x27;t do a good job on my neck. The shape of the head doesn&#x27;t and the direction my hair grows doesn&#x27;t help right under my jaw line. I frequently have to go over those areas leading to mild irritation (it doesn&#x27;t really bother me).I think I&#x27;m one of those guys that need this for my face and rotary shaver for my neck. Maybe I&#x27;ll eventually get a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system does a good job and the cleaning solution lasts a good while. I haven&#x27;t had to change the fluid yet and I bought this around 5 months ago I believe. Also don&#x27;t believe people when they say it is just rubbing alcohol because it clearly isn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t feel like rubbing alcohol at all. It feels like a lubricant. My guess is it is a mix of lubricant and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a very long time. I&#x27;d guess it lasts as advertised although I&#x27;ve even drained more than 1 or 2 bars of battery life.</li>
    <li> Works better then expected. Haven&#x27;t had an electric razor for many years. Wasn&#x27;t sure this time but thought I would try this one. Meets all expectations and then some. Would recommend it to anybody and have.</li>
    <li> Next to a barber using a straight razor this Braun is the tops. I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for decades and comparing it to the Braun Series 7, my old one is a clunker. I like the way it cleans itself. Just plop it in and away it goes. Love it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  Easy to use after we figured our the auto-clean.  Gets a very nice and close shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun after many years of using a rotary shaver. I have a tough beard which grows in several directions and electrics have historically only done an average job. This is the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor. The cleaning and charging station works well and takes care of daily maintenance with no effort.</li>
    <li> Gives a close shave. I like it a lot better than a Norelco, but not as good as the old reliable Mach 3 straight razor with shave cream for a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I had to ask my husband what he thought of the Braun shaver I ordered from Amazon and here&#x27;s what he had to say: It&#x27;s what Braun advertised and he likes  that the shaver cleans itself, and the travel case is nice to have for weekend trips.  The shaver is expensive but you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon. It&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s had and it&#x27;s worth the price. He would recommend this shaver because of the quality and dependability of the product doing its job.  In my opinion it&#x27;s saving us about $14-$18 a month by not buying any disposable shavers every month.  I noticed that his skin is very smooth and by nightfall, his \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; is not as rough either.  I like the way his skin feels with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the most advanced electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. I red many reviews and articles before the purchase of Braun Series 7 and man am I clad I did. The feel is as clean as with the razor shave, but takes less time and is not messy:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with my new shaver - would buy it again without any hesitation. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Im in the military and this shaver will meet and exceed your expectations. Only con was that it takes a a couple more minutes then expected. But over all Good.</li>
    <li> I never had a system like this beforre.  I have used Braun Electric razors for over 25 years.  They are long lasting and provide an excellent shaving experience.  I am very pleased with how easy this system works.  It provides a quick, close shave aand an even eassier way to clean your Electric Razor daily.  I know I made a wise decsion when I purchasewd this product and recommened it to others who like quality and durability in their Electric razor System.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors since 1977 and once tried a Braun series 5 but felt guilty sold it and bought an Arcitec and have hated it for the last 5 years.  I used my old Norelce 5885 most of the time.  This time I bought a Braun Series 7 and it is incredible!!!  I am not looking back.  Some complain the refills for the cleaner are expensive but I only use it weekly and have had zero problems.  This razor shave extremely close and without any irritation.  The ability to lock the head makes shaving the neck very easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the electric razor world!  About 10 years ago I bought a rotary Norelco razor and it was terrible, so went back to the regular Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate enough to get a nice Amazon gift card from my father, and I have always wanted a nice Electric razor, so off it was to research on which brand/model to buy.  I went with this Braun 790CC-4 as many of the reviewers gave it glowing marks.  A few of the downfalls was the $$$ and the cleaning fluid expense.  I figured if it was as good as the reviews, it was worth the $$$$. As well I found Generic and do it your self cleaning fluid, so another way to save $$$.  Many stated it was loud, but I don&#x27;t find it that loud at all, it is quieter than my old Norelco which I still have (not sure why.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it for a bit but extremely impressed how close of a shave I get. Honestly for me, its as close as my Mach 3 razor!  And I&#x27;m one of those people that uses a razor blade for a long time, as I don&#x27;t grow a lot of facial hair, and I&#x27;m cheap!  So this Braun is a huge improvement and I am totally happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I was looking to register it on the [...]  and it asks for a TESA code---According to a Braun rep on their Facebook page---that TESA code is no longer being used and their website should be changing and reflect that.  As I looked all over on the razor and included literature, and could not find that TESA code***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Been using it just over 1 week and still loving it!! No issues at all.  You can make your own cleaning solution (using Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol 70% and Lemon essential oil) and you just keep using (rinsing) the plastic cartridges. More info at [...]</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son and he really like how close a shave it has, he claims it is better than the previous Braun shaver he had</li>
    <li> This was an upgrade for me after having an earlier Braun self-cleaning model.  This one seems to grab more hair and pull far too often while shaving and the foil head is much more difficult to remove and replace.  I do get a better shave from it, compared to the previous model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco SenoTouch 3D rotary shaver for years and have been satisfied with it, but  saw and read many reviews on the braun 7 series, noticed a price drop and decided to take a chance.  This one is not meant for shower shaves (Dry Only) like the Norelco and is the only negative for this model.  The higher model 799cc is for showers but that cost over $100 more, and did not seem worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a side by side comparison with both shavers.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I timed a shave using my  Norelco SensoTouch 3D shaver with a brand new shaving head, and new Braun 790cc over a two day period (1 complete shave each), and find the Braun takes less time ( 2 1/2 minutes for me), and I will give the Braun slightly closer shave over the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system, though it will cost about $5.00 each, is in my opinion worth it.  It does a very good clean job with a nice touch of a lemon smell with a tad of lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement head for the Braun is less expensive than the Norelco, it lasts about 18 months as stated on their web site over the Norelco&#x27;s 12 month replacement time frame and cost a few dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop out Trimmer is better than my Norelco shaver in that its a bit longer, and away from the shaver.  Norelco trimmer is shorter, closer to the shaver body, and a bit more difficult to use, but I don’t use them that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I highly recommend this series 7 shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the clean, close shave this shaver gives him.  Does not irritate face.  Only problem I have with this system is it just starts having a problem either with shaver or cleaner not working correctly just as it goes out of warranty - 2 years - but using every day, can&#x27;t beat this shaver.  Cleaning method is very sanitary and he loves this shaver system.  Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Since purchasing same Shaver system for probably 4th. time on 1/13/14 this one has been to Braun&#x27;s repair shop 3 times for the same problem with the clean and renew station.  First time not six months old had problem not cleaning.  One year to date of purchase, same problem.  June, 2015 Third time to  repair shop - been without it for one month - same problem with cleaning station....finally giving me a new station....but back ordered.  Will not buy Braun again.  Braun should have sent me a new station the first time my husband had a problem.  The folks at Appliance Sales in San Fran. where you have to send razor station know me by name now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as my mach 3 razors , which is disappointing considering the price of the electric razor . First razor , so maybe I expected to much . Just wish it would give closer shaves.</li>
    <li> It has worked well so far! Would be nice if it gave a little bit closer shave, but it does the trick and I like the cleaning system, as it makes it feel much cleaner</li>
    <li> This is an extremely good quality product. I read a lot of reviews of electric shavers before I bought one and this model was always up in the top 3. It&#x27;s pricey but worth every penny. I shave both my head and neck and I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave, even compared to a straight razor. If you spring for this you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Every 8 or so years, I seem to drop and break my shaver and always go back to braun. Has three settings for three different intensities. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for over 20 years and have generally been satisfied.  Prior to the purchase of this item, I had always used a rotary shaver so this is my first experience with a foil shaver.  I should not have waited so long.  Based on all of the reviews that I have read, I expected a closer shave and I get a closer shave.  I did not expect a more comfortable shave but this is the most comfortable shave that I have ever gotten.  Great shave and comfort, who could ask for more.  The extra money for the cleaning case, etc. was in my opinion well spent.  I really like this razor.  Great value.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been probably 10+ years since i&#x27;ve tried using an electric razor and have always gone with gillette disposables, most recently Fusion Proglide Power.  I never tried an electric that cut close and didn&#x27;t cause razor burn or irritation. I recently read some reviews on which electrics were recommended for black men and this one consistently came up so i gave it a try.  I found an online coupon and came away with a great price (MUCH lower than retail).  As some may know, we are predisposed to ingrown hairs due to the natural curvature of hair growth. Shaving is usually a problem for most of us. with the Fusion, the day of the shave was great, smooth, not too many bumps (used in combo with manually removing ingrown hairs beforehand and products like Bump Patrol), but the following days were pure hell.  Once my hair starts growing back,(and my beard is fairly thick and grows in all different directions) i get the soreness in some spots, whiteheads and the beginning of ingrown hairs. because of this, i&#x27;d switch back to using hair clippers for shaving : not close, but comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case i gave this Braun a try.  entered with skepticism, but i&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with the result. As some have mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a blade, but it still cuts plenty close. My skin was smooth to the touch after the first shave.  initially, it missed some hairs, but after setting it to the most powerful setting, it took care of those stray hairs. there were literally maybe 5-10 stray hairs (in that hard to get to throat area) that i went over with a manual (single blade).  So far, no irritation during or after the shave. the next couple of days will determine whether or not this will work for the long term for me as the regrowth phase is the most problematic. I&#x27;ve never been an every day shaver, usually once a week with the Fusion.  the cleaning feature is nice and works well.  The cleaning cartridges are somewhat expensive, but given what you pay for a pack of Fusion Proglide Power razors, it&#x27;s a better deal. With the price i paid, i think i got a winner...and if it doesn&#x27;t work out on the face, i can always use it on my head!ack of Fusion Proglide Power razors, it&#x27;s a better deal.

    <li> I have always dreaded the shaving process.  The blade nicks and it is simply an uncomfortable process - shaving cream everywhere, back hurting from standing and leaning, hate it.  I admit, however, that the shave is close, feels good, and when all is said and done, there isn&#x27;t a better shave.  The pluses did not out way the gains, however, and I have &amp;#34;made do&amp;#34; with cheap, or moderately cheap electric razors most of my adult life.  Minutes go by, somehow you think you will get there if you shave long enough, &amp;#34;the baby skin&amp;#34; feel on this day, but it never happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I purchased the Series 7 790 three weeks ago.  I still do not believe that I get the &amp;#34;baby skin&amp;#34; feel, even better than the blade.  &amp;#34;Not this morning&amp;#34;, I say to myself.  This has got to end sometime.  Well it doesn&#x27;t.  This is, without a doubt, the best razor I could have ever imagined.  I only wish I had known!</li>
    <li> This is such a pain in the proverbial ass compared to a rotary razor.  There is some sort of cleaning liquid pod that you must insert into the bottom of the holder and apparently must replace periodically when the liquid dries out.  I did not find the razor to cut particularly closer than my old rotary razor made by Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used only Braun shavers for the past 25 years. This one isn&#x27;t any closer of a shave and the charge doesn&#x27;t last. I should have stayed with the 5 series.</li>
    <li> Best close shave I&#x27;ve had in my whole life. Would recommend this razor to anyone that suffers from delicate skin.</li>
    <li> Bought it in early February. Plugged it in, charged it up and used it but the charger quit working not long after the first charge. To decide whether I should keep it or return it for a refund, I continued to use it until the battery ran down. Almost two months later, the battery did run down. Impressive battery. The shaving quality was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to go for warranty repairs on a brand new shaver so...With the price having increased $50 from my purchase price here on Amazon, I decided to return it for refund and try a Panasonic wet/dry model instead (Panasonic ES-LV61-A).</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun 8300 series that I held on to for way too long.  I cannot believe how quiet and quickly this shaves my face.</li>
    <li> This is a simply great product. Am happy to be born in a era where u get such a clean shave without using a blade.</li>
    <li> I just want to say :performance very good.my husband very love.smooth and clean. Aslo very quick……i will support braun continued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three Braun electric razors and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. Great for sensitive skin. If you like foil razors, you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> The product is a very solid electric razor.  I purchased the razor to replace an older Series 7 Braun, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in closeness......which I thought started to decline on my old razor.  It doesn&#x27;t compare to shaving with a blade in terms of closeness.  I&#x27;m writing this review primarily to make people aware of the return policy.  Most electric shaver reviews talk about 30 and/or 60 day 100% satisfaction money back guarantees.  I purchased the Panasonic ES-LA93-K from Amazon and didn&#x27;t notice any  real difference from my older Braun so I returned it and received a refund within a few days.  Braun however has a much different return policy.  First, it must be returned directly to Braun.  Second, Braun will issue a pre-paid Citibank debit card.  Hopefully you will be satisfied enough to keep it, but  good luck if you need to return.  This is the response directly from Braun:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow 8-10 weeks for delivery of a Citibank pre-paid debit card</li>
    <li> It is a great product, won&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I wish Braun engineer had a way to capture the hair and pull it inside during shaving....</li>
    <li> Very good .He can will be treated as beard is very clean.The price also very cheap. I like it.Suggest you consider buying it.</li>
    <li> *  Will try to keep this review as short as possible while still trying to get my point(s) across  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background on me:  I take my shaving and the experience of that very seriously.  I have a thick to heavy beard - no question.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently used two (top of the line) Phillips Norelco 3D rotary shavers with cleaning system over the past year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Why two identical Norelco&#x27;s within 1.5 yrs?  Functionally they worked fine; was not happy with the 60 minutes charge capacity Norelco claims this shaver can sustain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I personally like the Braun over the Norelco:&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have had my Braun for 8 wks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The weight and feel of it in your hand is a secure and comfortable feeling - more impressive than the Norelco.  This unit is obviously well made.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Though a little louder than the Norelco 3D. The Braun seems/is more powerful and I like that!&lt;br /&gt;3.  Shaving closeness...  I have to honestly say that I could not tell a distinct difference with one over the other.&lt;br /&gt;4.  While shaving - I now prefer the straight up and down movement of the Braun foil over the constant small rotations required  with a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The Braun power cord can attach directly to the shaver and can be used, I&#x27;m assuming... to keep the shaver going in case the battery prematurely die&#x27;s-out.  You do not have this option with the Norelco 3D.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Battery charge indicator is practical and easy to view.  Retention of sustained battery power when using is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;7.  The cleaning unit is very cool and does a superb job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding overheating of the foil head against your skin as other reviewer&#x27;s have commented.  I have never experienced this.  I can tell you this however...  When I was using the Norelco rotary,  for the longest time I always had two small bumps on the lower left side of my neck.  I refer to this as minor skin irritation bumps.  After two days of using the Braun they completely disappeared and have never come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Though waterproofed to a certain extent.  This shaver is not designed to be used in the shower.  The shaver&#x27;s foil head can be cleaned by rinsing it under hot running water without having to detach it from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CLOSING I would just like to point out one thing to keep in mind to someone who may be new to shaving with an electric, OR switching from one electric to another; especially if you have a heavier beard like mine.  In my opinion and experience you must be patient and give your new electric shaver a &#x27;minimum&#x27; of 21 actual shaving days.  This will allow your facial skin and whiskers the time needed to adjust for a nice close shave.  Again be patient and you will notice a difference.ppeared and have never come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Though waterproofed to a certain extent.

    <li> Ok so along with this shaver doing everything it says it&#x27;s supposed to, it also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin when I use it as some electric shavers can. Only downside, I don&#x27;t think the &amp;#34;hygiene status&amp;#34; is legitmate. I think it is probably time based and doesn&#x27;t actually know when it gets dirty and needs to be cleaned.</li>
    <li> Major dissapointment with this purchase. I figured because it cost so much that Braun would live up to its reputation and deliver a good product. But now I know why the price is reduced over a 100 dollars over regular cost and now today I notice its even another 30 dollars cheaper. There is nothing worse than shaving, and then jumping in the shower and then feeling  your face and then realizing you have to use a razor to get the job right. My 4 year old Panasonic does a better job and its worn out. This thing vibrates rather well but that heavy vibration does not translate into sharp hardworking blades producing a clean shave. In fact, I now finish the job with my Panasonic. As indicated in dozens of other comments, the huge charging station is not practical for travel or easy placement in the bathroom. The shaving head is so complex it collects and then deposits all the shavings all over the floor. Its constantly leaks the trimmings. All in all, a major fail on the part of Braun and it looks like men are going to have to wait a long while longer for a decent shaving product. What product goes from 300 to 200 to 170 in the course of a month.It is clear there are a thousand fake reviews on this product.  This product has failed. If you dont believe me, disregard the dozens of fake reviews and sort all the reviews from worst to best. Look at the worst reveiews. Those are the genuine rewies. Sighhhh....</li>
    <li> This is a high quality shaver. The issue that others have with the cost of the cleaning fluid and battery is real, if you put the shaver into the stand after each shave. Batteries have finite recharges, and placing the shaver each day into the charger will cause the battery to fail much too quickly. Secondly, the cleaning fluid is alcohol, so it will simply evaporate. And so while it&#x27;s really good ad cleaning, it&#x27;s also an ingenious marketing device to get recurring revenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, here&#x27;s what to do: clean and charge the shaver, take the fluid back out, replace cover, use until battery empty, then put the fluid back and place shaver back in charger. In between, after each shave take off the screen and shake out the hairs. I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for 4 months and had to recharge 3 times, with the fluid still working great (if you don&#x27;t take it out you would have to have replaced it twice already). After 4 months it&#x27;s too early to make a final judgment, but so far so good. 4 stars only because a piece of the screen came off and I had to repair it.</li>
    <li> I read some fantastic reviews for this shaver.  And now that I own it and have used it, I wish they made these twenty years ago so I could have avoided all of those single edge razor burn shaves that were, at times, very irritating to my face.  This is actually a pleasure to use.  I no longer agonize about having to shave in the morning, it&#x27;s so simple.  The cleaning system is great.  My only negative comment is the electric cord plug should have a 90 degree end so the cord does not protrude from the wall.  I am highly recommending this shaver.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; shaver.  It does shave quite well, but the shavings fall out so I have to lean over the sink to use this.  And I dont mean just a little bit, a substantial amount comes out.  I have ensured that the top is on properly, and its as secure as it can be.  If I am doing something wrong someone please let me know, otherwise I would never recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I find every time I have to shave, I have to keep going over, and over the same spots on my face to clear ALL the hairs. And I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, or mustache. Very frustrating, and sometimes leads to skin soreness. Not thrilled with it, and considering how expensive it is, I would NOT recommend it</li>
    <li> best electric razor I ever owned, however a bit expensive.  If it lasts 5 years it is a good product</li>
    <li> After a decade, my I could tell my Braun 8975 was starting to wear out. It needed a new foil and cutter, so I was thinking about getting a new one. I saw a $40 coupon on Braun&#x27;s website so I went for it. Shaves smoother, and I love the cleaning station. Been using it 3 weeks or so and don&#x27;t see any downsides.</li>
    <li> First one I ordered didn&#x27;t arrive but contacted seller and they sent a replacement. The recipient loved the gift. Great gift for boyfriend, husband, father or brother.</li>
    <li> I only wish I had discovered the Braun Series 7 earlier.  I had been using Gillette manual razors ever since I started shaving--Mach III, Fusion Proglide, etc.  They worked fantastically-well: simplicity combined with a close shave.  However, once I started to need to shave every day (guess those unkempt college days are over), I found myself loathing the 5+ minute routine every morning of lathering my face with shaving cream, washing the manual razor cartridge under the water every few strokes, and cleaning my face again thoroughly after shaving to avoid any residue shaving cream.  And that led me to the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now complete the daily shave-routine in under 3 minutes.  That may not seem like much of a difference, but believe me, when you&#x27;re trying to get out the door to catch public transportation into downtown in the morning, those few minutes help--any fan of the snooze button can certainly attest to that.  And sure, the shave isn&#x27;t as close as the manual razor, but it&#x27;s 80-90% as close and definitely gets the job done.  There&#x27;s also no thinking about accidentally cutting yourself like you might with a manual razor.  For the ultimate time-saver, this razor even cleans itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this gadget, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so nice and powerful. it makes me feeling fresh everyday. i going to trust this amazon and will keep buying things now.</li>
    <li> Excellent, good quality, powerful, quick shave.</li>
    <li> This electric razor shaves closer than a regular razor does for me.. The reviews you read are telling the truth!</li>
    <li> I like the variable setting (3-steps) for mild to intense. I like the feel of it and although the display is less sophisticated than my old one, this one might be more practical in usage. It has a Li-Ion battery and so is a bit lighter, and seems well-constructed.</li>
    <li> Solves the whole shaving problem. Extremely convenient. No nicks or cuts, even around moles, and no mess to cleanup. My skin feels much healthier. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun shaver before and used the heck out of it. I liked it a lot. This one, though, is so much better. I honestly feel like I used a razor when I&#x27;m done shaving, it shaves that close. My old shaver never got that close. And it doesn&#x27;t catch on any hairs when it gets too long at all. Very efficient. Very nice. The weight is great and it is contoured to my hand the way my bulky previous Braun shaver was not. The base has some nice features with the multiple cleaning options. I also like how the indicator lights will turn off after a little while so your bathroom is not illuminated all night long. Nice little touch. Overall, this thing is totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good experience with them, fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco for over 30 years.  My 8 year old Norelco needed to be retired.  Based on Amazon reviews I thought I&#x27;d try this Braun shaver.  The shave was great right from the start, comfortable, closer than the Norelco and much faster.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the switch that locks the shaver head broke after a week. However, that does not prevent that shaver from giving an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had his for less than a month, and so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased. It&#x27;s easy to get set-up and charged. The pivoting action is natural and I get a very close shave in a reasonable amount of time. The cleaning station is a bit bulky, but the razor has stayed neat and tidy and the cleaning solution has a pleasant lemon-citrus smell. Overall, not inexpensive, but a value nonetheless.</li>
    <li> OH yeah, I bought this for my friend, and he said it&#x27;s very good and useful, I give this 5star.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver. Using it for a few months now and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does provide a clean shave. However the cleaning feature (that tells you when to clean your shaver) is only a timer and does not really make sense. If you power on the shaver (without using) it for a few minutes, it demands that you clean clean it. This in turn, uses up your cleaning fluid and electricity.</li>
    <li> A test version of this long running excellent product. They now include a new and improved carrying case that protects and cannot pop open on impact.</li>
    <li> My husband had a Series 7 for years, and it was his favorite razor. However, the battery stopped holding its charge, and then he decided to fiddle with the charging station one time and broke one of the contacts. I surprised him with this new Series 7...and I thought he was going to cry! It&#x27;s even better than the previous and he still loves it.</li>
    <li> It is a nice shaver to use daily or every other day. This shaver will increase the period between visits to barbershop. The only disadvantage I could find is that it isn&#x27;t superior in fine shaving. You would feel your skin isn&#x27;t very smooth.</li>
    <li> I always get irritation when using an electric shaver. I assumed it was just part of shaving, and went about my life getting rashes and having to use lotion after shaving to remoisturize, etc. Enter Series 7 790cc!! This thing blew me away, it shaves closely without having to go over the same spot a million times (surely helps with the irritation as well), and lo and behold...NO IRRITATION!! What a miracle device! It made the impossible, possible!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
    <li> I suffer from ingrowns and razor bumps so I did some research, and came up with this device. Honestly, this is the best move I&#x27;ve made, in an effort to tame ingrowns and razor bumps. Simple glides with light pressure and you will get an unbelievably close shave for an electric, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes- or my skin for that matter. It looked like I spend an hour trying to get every hair off my face with a blade, when in reality it took me 10 minutes total with this one electric. Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a Series 5 previously, which was ok, but I&#x27;d have to follow up the electric shave with some light double blade razor shaving for tough areas.  I don&#x27;t have to do that here, Series 7 cleans that area well enough to not have to follow up with a blade. It might appear to be the same as a series 5&#x27;s head (which I had serviced to be the sharpest ever), but this device is clearly not the same, and far superior to what I used previously.  The close competitor to this is a Panasonic that costs 2 times the cost of this Series 7, and does the same thing. This is your device if you&#x27;re ethnic.</li>
    <li> This is the best razors I have ever owned. I suffer from constant razor burn and ingrown hairs and this razor has almost completely stopped both. The sensitive setting on the razor works wonders and stops both razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The shave is close and clean. Also, the cleaner/charger works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that the cleaner/charger shuts itself off after cleaning and recharging are complete. This is a solid shaving system!</li>
    <li> This is my second Series 7 shaver. It gives a great  shave, better than the Norelco or Remington shavers I own. I&#x27;d have given it a 5 except for the cleaner. It works OK but it is hard to get the plug out of the slot it plugs into on the cleaning unit. I do not have room to leave it plugged in all the time and I hate the fight I have with that plug when I do clean it.</li>
    <li> I originally owned a braun and had it for nearly 5 years before I decided to get something newer. I opted for a Panasonic thinking it would be just as good and I suffered for over 2 years. It tugged and pulled and did not cut very closer at all in addition to a horribly designed cleaning system. I now have switched back to the 790cc and it&#x27;s good to be back. The shave is very close and if you take out the cleaning solution and re-cap it between cleanings, it will last months longer than if you just leave it in the base station the whole time. This particular model doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long between cleanings but the cleaner it is the more effective the shave so I can&#x27;t complain if I have to run the cleaner once a week or every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get the Panasonic if you think it is as good for less money. You do get what you pay for and Braun wins this battle every time!</li>
    <li> I will say up front that I had been using a different style of razor - the Philips Norelco Arcitec, which has 3 rotating heads, rather than the foil style that this one so elegantly reflects.  First off, this is the closest to a blade I&#x27;ve ever experienced. It&#x27;s fast and quiet. The biggest discovery for me was how well it shaves my neck. My Norelco for some reason was just awful on my neck, and I had to use a blade every other day to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning thing is quite cool and really works. I knock the loose hair out like one would ordinarily and press a button... Done and done! It also has a lemony fresh scent rather than smelling like an old razor.  I had considered getting it from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond but even with their 20% coupon. Amazon&#x27;s price was unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if your neck is a challenge to shave, this is definitely the razor for you.  I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for 25 or more years and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 does not give a shave as close as I had anticipated.  I like the feel of the razor and the Pulsonic but am&lt;br /&gt;disappointed it does not shave closer then the Series 3 I have had for several years.</li>
    <li> Excellent man&#x27;s razor.  Works great whether my beard is 1-day or 4-days old.  Very sharp blades.  The cleaner does a good job of refreshing the shaver.  The device does go thru the alcohol quite quickly, and you have to replace the foil sometimes, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me as a birthday gift and I love it. Took some time to get use to since I always just used a razor but the more you use it the easier it gets (I still use a razor right after just to get some small stuff I missed). The only thing you have to change is the liquid cleaner (that you can make your self) and the razor clip every 6 months.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing, you get no razor burn. It takes off even long growth with ease and you get a very close , comfortable shave. Also the next day you still look good, very little stumble until later in the day. That&#x27;s how close it shaves. Definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> The best foil shaver out on market</li>
    <li> FAIR, NOISIER THAN OLDER MODELS. PLUG IS HARDER TO  CONNECT AND DISCONNECT. HYGIENE METER TELLS YOU TO CLEAN EVERY THIRD USE.</li>
    <li> If electric razor irritation is a problem for you then look no further than this razor.  It&#x27;s as close a shave as you can get with an electric razor, and zero irritation.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!! My Husband loved it!!!</li>
    <li> I would like to return this.</li>
    <li> This has made shaving much easier for me.  It is easy to keep clean with the system that come with it.  If you have to take it on the road you have to leave the base at home but you can still keep it plenty clean enough to use effectively.  I think that its performance would degrade at some point without the base but I don&#x27;t know when - certainly more than a week.  I find it to shave comfortably and fast.  I would describe my beard as medium heavy.</li>
    <li> Just started using it  and love it so far.</li>
    <li> Without question the best electric shaver made, and using it in the shower is great. But to get the best shave in the shower, you need this gel: http://www.amazon.com/Tend-Skin-Air-Shave-Gel/dp/B000X4JUYA/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my review of this gel, which just makes this shaver perfect in the shower:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Tend-Skin-Air-Shave-Gel/product-reviews/B000X4JUYA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_synop?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;0&amp;sortBy&#x3D;bySubmissionDateDescending#R2NWPANBCRKAQ8</li>
    <li> This will be a Christmas present for my husband...  and I am sure he will appreciate it very much!</li>
    <li> Easily the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Solid, comfortable feel. Much easier to work around chin and jaw then other shavers, both rotary and non. Has occasional trouble with flat-lying hairs, but that&#x27;s my only criticism. Battery life is great. Cleaning system seemed like a cheesy attempt to get you to pay for extra stuff, but I have to say it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The Braun razor I had for 10 + years died. I tried the other razor and did not get a close shave. o yourself a favor buy Braun first and save your money. Make sure you get the Features the Clean &amp; Renew Shaving System.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Only complaint so far is that hair keeps falling out of the sides of it while you shave</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor my husband has used in years. He had a bad experience when he was younger. He was hesitant to use this and when he finally did.... He was amazed. He said it&#x27;s smooth, glides right over his face and that he loves it. He even uses it on his head!</li>
    <li> Super duper close shave. Charged battery lasts foreverrrrrrrrrrr.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for the Braun series 3. My husband is very pleased with the series 7. It&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVE EVER HAND DOWN.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave; really an easy task first thing in the morning to use.  Very comfortable; no pull or scrape.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical @first because I tried a electrical shaver before and never left my face smooth. I also tried Shick Hydro 5 and that only left my face smooth one use. After using this shaver I&#x27;m sold had for a month and it still keeps me smooth. After the fourth shave my hair got use too the machine, best purchase I ever made. Every MAN should have a electrical shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 790cc a year or so ago.  I have been relatively pleased with the shaver (I&#x27;ve owned several Braun Shavers over the years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...given the over $200.00 I paid when new, I am very frustrated with the cleaning &amp; charging base -It feels like a cheap, delicate plastic product.  I purchased several additional refills and then it stopped working after 6+ months.  Forget the \\&quot;Sensor\\&quot; it always says \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; clean needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been very difficult to find the proper cleaning/charging base (customer service at Braun never replied to my online email request) &amp; I am equally frustrated with replacement prices for similar items that I view on Amazon.  I cannot find the replacement base for this model on Amazon either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice - decent electric shaver, but the clean &amp; charge base is for home only &amp; if you buy -assume the base will fail within a year, so don&#x27;t load up on the replacement cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I purchase an electric shaver, I will search for another brand, because I am offended this process is so difficult.</li>
    <li> The razor vibrates terribly and does not give anywhere near to a close shave.  Panasonic is far superior.  The Braun takes far to many passes to cut the beard around the neck area.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an electric razor for sometime the Braun was rated the best of any that I researched so I got one and it is everything and more that I expected excellent electric razor</li>
    <li> This Shaver is truly amazing. I had been using a Braun shaver for over 8 years and this is my second Braun shaver. It works very well and especially with the base cleaning system makes you every shave feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> Not for me .. Doesn&#x27;t get tclose shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost two years now and it&#x27;s worked out really well. It offers a close shave and it&#x27;s faster than a safety razor. My only criticism is that the cleaning cycle is so damn loud. So damn loud. Like, you can&#x27;t clean it at night unless you enjoy pissing off your neighbor. Best to clean it as you&#x27;re heading out the door or listening to some loud music with some headphones.</li>
    <li> Gift for my man. He gets hair bumps easily and loves this razor.</li>
    <li> At first i was reluctant to pay this much for a shaver but it has been a fantastic decision. It&#x27;s amazing how much value you get by purchasing the best of something you use every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this shaver if you&#x27;re partial to electrics.</li>
    <li> Used this razor everyday over a 9 month deployment and it has yet to lose it&#x27;s edge.</li>
    <li> Product meets all right&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
    <li> Very happy with my Braun Series 7-790cc&lt;br /&gt;Much closer shave than my previous Philips Norelco with the so called GyroFleX 3D system. It would be a 5 stars for me if wet shaving was possible.</li>
    <li> My husband is 82 and is in a wheelchair. It was very hard for him to shave he tried shavers  before they never worked. They also didn&#x27;t cost 160 dollars. He loves this it clean shaves him easy to use. Sorry it took so long for him to try one again.</li>
    <li> Very close shave and adjustable for my sensitive neck. lighter than my other Braun</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Remington I had bought in a clearance isle. I used it for 2 years and liked I could run the head under the water and use it&#x27;s cleaning system to dry it. I went through 4 blades in two years. They no longer sell the replacement blades and foils without going online to their website. I didn&#x27;t like paying $10 shipping so I looked in to a new electric razor I could rinse under water. I found the Braun 7-790cc-4. The razor looks good and feels good in your hand. The cleaning system blows my old razor&#x27;s out of the water. Very clean very quickly. The shave though surprised me. It was not as close as I thought it would be. Some days I shave twice. I never felt the need to do that with my old razor. I have been learning new ways to shave with it that has helped a bit. I started using my free hand to pull and stretch my skin to get a closer shave. It was not much better. I like to shave after I shower thinking it was making the hairs easier to cut. The instructions say shave before your shower. I tried that today and my face still feels pretty smooth and I have worked all day. I am going to try it again and see if a closer shave is as simple as doing it before a shower. With that being said I would probably buy it again if I had a choice due to the quality of the unit as a whole. It looks good, feels good, cleans up easy, and the shave is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I am hesitantly giving this 5 stars so far. I alternate between a wet shave and dry shave. Started a long time ago using a rotary shave then 20 years ago. I switched to a Braun shaver and found it was highly superior to the rotary shavers but that is my preference. My old Braun started to die so my kids gave me this model for Christmas. After a week of use, here are my observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good, the shaver charges quickly, gives a good close shave. You do have to manipulate your skin like stretching and puffing out your cheeks. I also judge how good of a shave by how well it does around the neck and Adam&#x27;s apple. So far, it has been working well and passed my test shaves. The new cleaner/charger works well and can judge when it needs to be cleaned. Something different from my last Braun shaving sytem. Takes the same cleaning cartridge as previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad, this has a very high pitched sound, both when using the shaver and when on the cleaning cycle. It is very loud too. It also vibrates as one of the features which gets a little getting used to. One other issue is the location of the trimmer. It is not in the best of locations and is quite close to the shaver itself. Very inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the cleaning cartridge. The cartridges are the same. Braun always recommends you shave prior to washing or cleaning your face. I have tried both prior to and after washing and I cannot tell the difference and feel it is a way to sell more cartridges. I still use Lectric  Shave, more to allow the shaver to move a little more easily. The only other thing is it is pricey even with purchasing on Amazon. Amazon&#x27;s price was still the best than anything local. Arrived quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, overall, it seems to work very well. I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> good but doesnt shave well on the edges of the face</li>
    <li> Very good feeling, it is a little loud</li>
    <li> This is my third series 7. They are great.</li>
    <li> I recently read an interview with a barber who said that because of the random patterns of facial hair, a good shave takes approximately15 minutes. The Braun 790 cuts that&#x27;s down to about 7 or 8.  It is a pleasure to use and, of course, no razor burn</li>
    <li> It is fine but it doesn&#x27;t clean longer hair.</li>
    <li> Well I am an avid Braun loyal customer. They make well designed shavers. That is why I bought this one online without physically touching it. They missed the mark big time on this one. The trimmer is &amp;#34;in the middle&amp;#34; of the shaver. That means when you put the trimmer on your face, it is hiding behind the body of the shaver!! You cant see what you are trimming. Did anyone at Braun actually use this shaver? Very disappointed......</li>
    <li> Best Braun I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thanks for your sound advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Arthur Cabrak</li>
    <li> This was a nice shaver but I decided it wasn&#x27;t for me.  I took advantage of Braun&#x27;s 60 Day Money Back Guarantee and sent back my shaver.  Almost 11 weeks later I not only don&#x27;t have my money but now they say they have no record of receiving it back (even though I have proof in the form of a return receipt).  Once Braun has your money, good luck getting any help from them.  My advice, pick another company.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for over 2 years with excellent results.  It seems to give as close a shave as my razor, but it takes nearly the same amount of time to reach an equivalent degree of closeness.  This makes sense as I imagine getting individual wiskers to find the opening in the foil, and being in the correct position might taje several passes as I move the head around.  The cleaning system works well, although it is recommended to periodically remove the head and brush it and the shaver topworks under running water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving all my life and I&#x27;ve perfected it. But I&#x27;m also tired of it. Thanks to all the careful reviewers here on Amazon, this Braun 7-790 offered a chance to break out of my lifelong routine and boy am I glad I did! My first shave with this was a pleasant surprise all around. I had tried a Braun 25 years ago and remember it tearing out the hairs one-by-one and promptly went back to the blade. But this razor is quiet by comparison to other electric shavers, does a great job on a couple of trouble growth patterns on my face, and except for getting a better mirror to see if I had missed any spots, each pass was almost effortless. I don&#x27;t save any time over wet shaving in my case, but the convenience and total cost of ownership will eventually be noticeably better. I would recommend this razor to anyone and I&#x27;ll definitely never be without a Braun again.</li>
    <li> If I could give it ten stars, I would. It even shaves closer than a blade. I am a dedicated razor blade guy. Razor blades give a great shave with some irritation. I now get a blade-close shave with no irritation at all. I would recommend this shaver to everyone!</li>
    <li> A real plus for me was not having to deal with cleaning, lubricating or charging the unit.  You just put it back in the holder and it all happens.  It also gives an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Gave an incredibly smooth shave, even with a full week&#x27;s stubble! Machine is not as loud as I feared it was going to be, and the cleaning station is awesome.</li>
    <li> Super close shave. Best shaver of them all. Highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also bought one for son in law who doesn&#x27;t use a shaver but does now.</li>
    <li> This shaver is perfect, it gives a very close and comfortable dry shave and very little irritation if none. I Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is a good shaver. It&#x27;s better than the last couple of Brauns I have had. That&#x27;s progress. A near blade experience if you spend a few minutes at it. Five stars would be awarded if it were as good as a blade and quick too. It&#x27;s my goto for weekdays. Easier than all the stuff you need for a blade shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. But I still have to use razor for my sideburns.</li>
    <li> new version not as ergonomic as 7500 series from a usability standpoint. IMO</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver made. My last one lasted 7 years and I got excellent shaves everyday.&lt;br /&gt;  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I paid $160. plus for this. It came without owners manual, warrantee card and other enclosures. I can not access Braun because I have no serial number, yep, I looked. I e mailed Amazon. Item can not be returned without original sales receipt and approval from Braun. No sales receipt it came Amazon.  I will post any resolution to this issue. If you consider buying this item be aware the shaver is made in Hungary, the power box in Ireland and the power cord in Japan. Hmmm, wonder how that all works together. I will not &amp;#34;try to figure it out&amp;#34; without manual and risk damage.</li>
    <li> Overall i love this shaver. I have very sensitive skin and this shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin all (i shave daily). The only thing is that you will never get as close of a shave as a razor gives you. Also, very low maintenance.</li>
    <li> Smoothest Braun shaver yet!  Easy set up.  Easy use.  Easy clean!  I&#x27;ve used Braun&#x27;s for 30 years - I&#x27;mslow to replace an old one but when I do I&#x27;m very pleased with the latest improvements.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for a similar Braun for my husband and he loves this shaver. It cuts close without giving him a rash.The ability to just sit it in the base and it recharges is great, not to mention being able to push a button and it cleans itself. As electric shavers go (and he has had many over the years) this one stands out. I buy the cleaner solution refills online in bulk- it makes it affordable. The shaver blades the same. It lasts many years, this one is a year and a half and the prior one he had for 6 years.</li>
    <li> The best shave for a long time. My old Braun was seven years years old, and needed replaced. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor at an excellent price. It shaves almost as well as shaving with a twin or triple blade in the shower, my old style. Much better than my triple-header rotary shaver which was surprisingly terrible. .</li>
    <li> Gift for Son with sensitive neck prone to break-outs.  OUTSTANDING product!  Very close shave and NO neck break-outs.  High quality and worth the coin</li>
    <li> Very nice but still not 0 cut</li>
    <li> Not impressed at first. Was even going to return it. Continued to use and after about three weeks I am getting every hair and the closest shave of my life. Very well built. Excellent battery life. I rinse every time and clean and renew about every two or three shaves. Pricey but &amp;#34;AWESOME SHAVER&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. The sensitive setting is awesome for my neck. Great deal and great product.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Replacing a Series 5 that was 5 years old (still working OK except that the cleaning base would not work anymore). Best price anywhere for a great shaver. Feels solid in your hand, multiple settings for comfort, clear view of remaining battery life as well as need to clean.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product with a superb cleaning station. No complaints</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves the shaver!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor a while ago and switched to a foil rotary shaver because I have VERY sensitive skin.  I get bumps really easy.  I loved this foil razor but needed to try something different just to see if it was the right razor for me.  While the rotary razor did good and the online reviews gave it 5 stars...i was not impressed......but this foil razor is awesome!!! I run a business and dont have to shave everyday.  This razor really cuts the long whiskers with ease.  The rotary razor took multiple passes and at times I would have to use a straight razor to get them because the rotary would pass over them.  I will NEVER leave or try another razor again...this DEFINITELY the razor to get.  Only thing I suggest is not to shave after you JUST cleaned it...the cleaning solution burns like hell!!</li>
    <li> This is really a great razor. I&#x27;ve tried several but this guy cuts pretty close once you get the hang of it. Blades last 18 months per the manual. In order to make the cleaning solution last I clean it every fourth shave in the solution, but release the blades and tap the cutter on the sink to knock the loose stuff loose each use. The solution it shipped with lasted me months.</li>
    <li> I was surprised.....Its an OK shaver, but not for its price.  Had it now 7 months, the shave takes longer to get down to a simi smooth shave, but I just bought a Norelco, above average model, and it gave me a closer shave at half the cost, and that was an eye opener.  I will never go back to an expensive shaver again for my skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s superise me, the motor is powerful,and very exquisite,charging very fast.five stars estimate</li>
    <li> Quiet, and shaves great</li>
    <li> I have used blades all my life because I always heard that electric shavers did not give a closer shave. I decided to go with the choice with the best reviews even if it was a high price. It totally was worth the price, the shave is very close and I stopped wasting too much water when shaving under the shower. The cleaning system make it even easier since it helps you maintain the device ready for the next shave with the push of a button (that is it!). The replacement system for the blades last for about 18 months and the one for the cleaning system for about five weeks if you shave every day. Best decision to start the year!</li>
    <li> Received as a Christmas present from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Best shaver I ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to any one who wanted the best shaver ever.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best shaver he has ever used. It shaves right thru his beard and leaves a nice smooth face.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. Made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved it without the Alcohol cartridge; Amazon handled my issue very well and refunded the money easly. Very excellent company. Recommend it for every smooth clean with no pain. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  It is very high tech. Great shaver and cleaning system.</li>
    <li> He&#x27;s always used a razor/shave cream. I did some looking around and decided on this shaver. He had mentioned years ago he didn&#x27;t like electric. However I thought he&#x27;d like this one. And he does. He can&#x27;t believe how close it shaves. Asked if he&#x27;d recommend it, and he said absolutely.</li>
    <li> Really nice machine. Much better than my old Norelco</li>
    <li> Purchased it for someone that lost his. Was sent to his home fine. He said that it was a used product. I was unaware of that.</li>
    <li> my husband very like it ,good price ,good quality</li>
    <li> Thirty years ago I received and electric razor as a gift, used it a handful of times before throwing it out and declaring I would never use one again.  My shave regiment was in the shower, hot towel on the face, followed by shaving cream and a Gillette Mach 3 razor.  Over the past couple of years I started nicking myself in a couple spots.  A few weeks ago I nicked myself on the chin before an event and I could not stop the bleeding.  I did not have styptic pencil handy and it took forever to stop the bleeding.  That night I decided to look into electric razors and found that there were a few electric razors that had a large following of loyal users.  After doing my due diligence I settled on the Braun Series 7 and boy am I glad I did!  I was surprised at how well this shaver worked!!!  There are a couple of spots on my neck that are tough to get, but after a few tries mission accomplished!!!  I think my wife likes this razor as much as I do because gone are the days where I have rough stubble from a few days growth.  N</li>
    <li> great, love it. best offer</li>
    <li> I moved up from Braun Series 5 550cc, and there is a night and day difference! The 550 is pretty good, but the 790 is just plain awesome! I&#x27;m able to shave closer, and more quickly than my previous shaver. I found the 550 had a harder time with difficult areas to cut on my face, like areas on my neck, where the 790 required 1 or 2 quick passes.</li>
    <li> Not as close as a straight razor or mechanical razor blade unless one is willing to spend @25 minutes which is too long for me.  My purpose is not to eliminate every strand of hair from my face, .  I noticed that  electric razors are more effective if the skin is moist, it eliminate friction and permit the razor to glide and cut the hair.  Here is how I engage in this:&lt;br /&gt;I use a Clarsonic Mia 1 face brush and a cleaner and scrub my face clean and wash (generally when taking a shower).  once  my face is  as dry as the Sahara Desert, I use Williams Lectric pre shave.  I DO NOT wait until 15 seconds, I apply an amount to the sector of the face I wish to shave and immediately after applying, I shave employing the lowest or the medium setting, the Braun shaver literally glides over my face like a car driving on solid ice and it  removes virtually all of the hair from that area.  Then I repeat until my entire face is virtually hair free and wash the Electric Pre wash when finished.  I get double my pleasure because as the pre shave starts to evaporate, it &amp;#34;shocks&amp;#34; the facial hair away from the skin, permitting me to further remove more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Braun is completely dry (alcohol will evaporate in several minutes), I employ compressed air  such as one used to blow a chilled air from computer monitors (cleaning duster / Blow of duster - to remove dust from computer related devices) which removes 100% of the hair from the Cleaner, the cleaning solution will not accomplish this entirely.  I engage in this every time I shave.  Then one a week, I clean the Braun in the  provided cleaning solution that came with the Braun shaver.  I save on the cleaning solution this way and instead of using water to remove the hairs from the shaver, compressed air is more efficient.</li>
    <li> I used to have the 350cc series and when it broke I decided to upgrade and I&#x27;m glad I did. That power seems to stay consistent through the battery. Very easy to clean and take care of.</li>
    <li> Brother in law loves this Christmas present. He usually suffers with ingrown hairs and has had little luck with other razors... this one does the job without problems.</li>
    <li> Charging system too big for travel.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this Braun shaver and it continues to work well after a few years.  Nice close shave :&amp;#62;)</li>
    <li> I am enormously pleased with this product!  The Braun Series 7-790cc is a perfect example that Braun continues to make advanced quality razors.  This razor is truly \\&quot;Top-of-the-Line\\&quot; in features, and it most definitely produces a desirably smooth, close shave.  I like the totally redesigned shape.  The handle is well constructed with an \\&quot;Easy-to-Hold\\&quot; fit made especially for your hand&#x27;s grip.  The Liquid Crystal Display is easy to read.  A real plus to this razor is that the razor blade and shaving foil are constructed into one high performance unit.  The combined razor/foil head is easily removed, and this new design makes cleaning a snap.  Plus, this razor&#x27;s head makes shaving a two or three day old beard practically effortless.  I have a Braun razor that I have been using for more than 20 years.  It is so old that I can no longer purchase a replacement rechargeable battery for it.  The old razor still works as good as new with the exception that it is only operational by using the electrical cord. If this Braun Series 7-790cc razor holds up for me as long as the old Braun has, I will be in my 90&#x27;s.  If you have never had an electric razor before, making Braun your first choice is the right way to go.  Braun is a longtime respected razor for quality.  I had my first one in Germany when I was in the Army in 1975.  Braun is a GREAT BUY and WELL WORTH your money.</li>
    <li> Only have used it a few times but it is far better than my 3 foil Norelco.  I bought my Norelco about a year ago to replace my 8 year old 7 Series Braun.  I basically disliked the Norelco from day one, but kept giving it a chance.  I finally bought this 790 Braun and have been very please.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the way Braun is trying to promote sales of their cleaning solution by having you clean your razor daily.  The first time I used my razor the display said it was at 75% on the hygienic sensor.  So I took off the head and completely cleaned it with water and a little soap and it was still at 75%.  I plan to ignore that sensor and clean it weekly with the cleaning dock and charge at that time also. Other than than small complaint (more of a disappointment in Braun) it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have  ever tried. I was forced to go electric due to an arm injury, and I dreaded it, but now I&#x27;m a believer. And the cleaning station is really helpful.</li>
    <li> I have worn out two previous Braun shavers and they were good.  This one, however, is very good.  It is a little pricey but after using it one time it is very well worth the price.  I can shave in less than two minutes in total comfort and it does not miss hairs.  If you haven&#x27;t tried a Braun or any electric, this one will win over even the most die-hard blade shavers.</li>
    <li> For over thirty years I&#x27;ve tried it all.  Single, double, triple blades.  Blades that vibrate, blades that have to be sharpened and stropped,  blades that are disposable, blades in a cartridge, blades in a safety razor.  Shave in the shower or shave before the shower or shave after the shower.  And electrics? Rotary heads that are dry and those that squirt a lubricant.  Foil heads (most that were Brauns).  I have even tried a gamut of shave creams, gels, oils and lather you whip up in a mug.  Over the years I have gone back and forth between electric and blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have ever wanted was a fast, clean shave. No fuss, no muss.  This is it.  A fast, clean and close shave in under five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning feature is terrific.  The base tells me when to clean the shaver, usually once a week.  I have only gotten half-way through the first cleaning cartridge and I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for over three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe what you will from all the reviewers that say it&#x27;s a terrible shaver, not as close as a blade, too hot, too loud, not easy to hold, too expensive, leaves a rash, and cuts up your face.  I have experienced none of these things and I know I have a thick, tough beard and fairly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is the fastest, cleanest and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Braun shavers for over 30 years.  They have always been quality devices that delivered great shaves.  The Braun Series 7 790cc is a complete disappointment. It has the typical Braun quality construction, but it doesn&#x27;t give a good close shave. I can shave over the same spot a dozen or more times and still feel a stubble. Within a few hours I feel like I need another shave. This shaver takes over twice the time to shave as did my old (5 yr,) Braun.  Now I have to follow up each shave with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this shaver I seen several reviews complaining about the same issue.  Based on my prior experience with Braun shavers, I ignored these reviews.  Braun has blown its credibility with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: The \\&quot;Pulsonic System\\&quot; is a joke.  It adds nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  10/07/2013 I have lived with this lousy shaver for a little over a year now. It is clearly falling apart. I finally purchased Panasonic&#x27;s best shaver and it is great.  Good, quick and close shave. No more following up with a razor blade. No more expensive cleaning cartridges. I used to love Braun shavers but since they sold the company, quality went down the drain.</li>
    <li> The title says it all. After trying 3 others over the past 2 years and having them all fail miserably, this is the best electric shave I have ever experienced. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have used. It gives me a super soft shave and doesnt pull my hairs. And unlike razors this does not cause me to have in-grown hairs which everyone knows is a pain. You can also plug the power cable directly into the shaver so that you can travel with it, it also brings a plastic case to take it with you. The only possible downside would be the need to buy the liquid refills for the cleaner, unless you dont want the automatic cleaner then soap and water will work as long as you use a bit of oil after.</li>
    <li> I have this shaver and it literally fell apart as soon as the warranty expired. The locking button fell off and the trimmer no longer fully retracts. I contacted Braun and they wouldn&#x27;t do anything. I would never spend this amount of money on one of these shaver again.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had!  It shaves so close, and even gets the pesky grey whiskers.</li>
    <li> It could be better on neck hairs although it is a good product. I still feel however i have to pass it over my face too much sometimes to cut off the hair, but i let my beard get a bit long before i shave so maybe thats expected</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver over the past ten years. This is, by far, the best of the lot. The three intensity choices make shaving almost a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Lots of razor choices out there but if you want the best for your money, and this Braun takes a lot of money, then a 790cc is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most significant improvement in electric shaving I have had in many years.  As the saying goes, Baby-butt smooth with little to no effort.  If your face is used to the Braun Foil Shaver, go right for the high/fast setting and enjoy a nice smooth shave in less time with less \\&quot;leakage(you know, those little beard crumbs that fall out of the head)\\&quot; in the sink.  Yes, leakage is about the only complaint I had from previous Braun razors.  Now, with the 790cc, there is hardly any noticable even after a full three day weekend of beard to blaze through Monday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this razor for two weeks and have yet to find a flaw or any detractions.  The body is comfortable to hold, has enough grip to not get dropped yet is not so grippy that it takes two hands to flip it or spin it for better presentation to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, as near a perfect electric razor as I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering going to scrape razors because my old Bruan was \\&quot;biting\\&quot; me and I couldn&#x27;t find any holes in the Foil.  That and the \\&quot;leakage\\&quot; was enough to make me want to give up on the whole electric razor thing after 30 years.  I am completely pleased with the 790cc experience and will once again be an electric(Braun ONLY) devotee for the foreseable future.  Nothing like it for speed, closeness, ease(cleaning and chargin happen in same stand), and overall enjoyment of one of the most tedious parts of being a man, SHAVING.  Makes quick work of it and you are on your way!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this razor is idiot proof.  I used to cut my face to smithereens using the Norelco electric shaver that had the lotion dispenser in it.  This makes my face baby smooth each and every time I use it.  No red marks, no cuts, just a smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a trimmer as well that slides out to even up your sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is great.  Put the shaver in the holder, push a button and it&#x27;s done cleaning in around 30 minutes (time varies due to how clean the razor says it is - all digital readings).  You don&#x27;t have to use the cleaning system every day, but I do.  The cleaning solution is an extra expense that will need to be purchased around every 8 weeks, but it leaves your razor clean and smelling like lemons every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I have to remember is to shave before I jump in the shower, which is what&#x27;s the recommended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a travel case for the razor (not suggested moving the cleaning station, the cleaning solution would spill out of it.)  But you can take the charging cable with you to directly plug into the shaver (otherwise, you have about a 50 minute shave charge, I believe).  You can disconnect and wash the razor head under water if you aren&#x27;t using the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I love this thing.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor. It&#x27;s as close as a lot of manual razors. It&#x27;s still possible to get a better shave, but not this easily. If you need an electric razor, then buy this one. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product would definetly recommend this for anyone&lt;br /&gt;Even my wife uses it she loves it too sometime things go right</li>
    <li> This is my second braun shaver, the first one is 5 series, which is relatively simple and I like it, at least everything does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this 7 series model, I expect a little bit more, however,the shaver&#x27;s locker key failed after several times use. The head of shaver is not gonna hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called the service, very very disappointed. long time waiting and stupid response, I was told to responsible the one way shipping for repair, and not even think about 3 weeks long time of no shaver to use. Can&#x27;t believe this is from such a big name.</li>
    <li> Just received my shaver today and used it immediately. This is my first electric shaver and oh buoy what a shaver. As advertised, for first timers it my irritate but no complains, it&#x27;s gives a very close shave and irritation goes away after 10 minutes. A piece of advised to impulsive buyers on Amazon, amazon will not take return of this product has per their policy the cartilage which is shipped along with the system has hazardous material hence no returns. You have to send it to Braun if you are not satisfied with the product. I bet that will not be the case and you will luv this product.</li>
    <li> 2 Weeks of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVE: Very close and comfortable shave. The skin becomes completely smooth, better than a 5 blade razor when shaving in the direction of your beard, but you still see the beard underneath, unlike a very clean shave as is with a 5 blade razor when shaving against the direction of your beard. I have a problem with my neck getting red when I shave with a machine or a razor and it does not happen with this. I put away my razor blades away now, I know I won&#x27;t be needing them anymore if I can cope with the noise...&lt;br /&gt;NOISE: I&#x27;m taking one star off for the amount of noise it makes when shaving and subsequently in a similar amount when auto-cleaning. I actually wanted to return it or get earplugs the first 2-3 days! Believe me it&#x27;s that loud!! I used to use the Philips Norelco AT830/41 and it was so quite. But the shave of this Braun Machine is a much higher level.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present to my hubby. He had used all kinds and brands of electronic razors but nothing had satisfying results until he got this. The Braun 790cc shaves close to the skin leaving it smooth. It also does not cause ingrown hair that creates bumps on skin. Although it costs to maintain and clean (because you need to buy the cleaning cartridge), I still think it&#x27;s worth it if your man feels and looks smooth every time.</li>
    <li> Please understand that I have used electric shavers for 15 years, so, I am not a novice, neither am I someone who has no idea what they are talking about when it comes to a close, non-irritating shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I have used Panasonic products and have been very satisfied.  Panasonic shavers can be used either dry or wet in the shower.  I have heard so many great review about the Braun Series 7-790cc, I decided to purchase one and give it a try.  Well, not only was the Braun shave not anywhere near as close as my previous Panasonic ES-8228 (which is a 5 year old shaver), but the Braun also tore up my face with minor to medium irritation.  I used the Braun for several weeks with no improvement in the shave or face irritation.  Granted, I do have sensitive skin.  However, having sensitive skin is no excuse for Braun producing a product that is not up to par with other shavers with equal standards and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I returned my Braun 790cc for a complete refund (thank God) and purchased a Panasonic ES-LV61-A in its place.  The Panasonic is a far superior shaver.  As a matter of fact, the Braun is not even in the same league with the Panasonic when it comes to producing a very close, actually razor close, shave that is non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I realize there are some who will say they do not want the Panasonic because it shaves better, wet, and many do not want to use shave gel or cream.  Well, I shave wet with the Panasonic and do not use gel or cream either.  I use a wonderful product called Shave Secret which can be purchased right here on Amazon at many participating stores.  I have used this product for years, and when it is used with a top of the line Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver like the ES-LV61-A or the ES-LV81-K, the result is the closest, most comfortable, non-irritating shave that can be achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are a current Braun fan, or are one who is considering the purchase of a Braun shaver, my advice is to give Braun a pink slip, get rid of your Braun, and try a Panasonic.  Yes, the price is slightly higher, however, once you try a Panasonic with some Shave Secret and just use a few drops of water to dampen your face......well.....you will never use a Braun again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is over rated due to the reputation of its shavers from over ten years ago.  Braun, in my opinion, has failed to keep pace with technology and the 790cc is no longer a relevant, competitive product when compared against the Panasonic.  My advice.  Fire Braun and hire Panasonic.  You will be much happier.k slip, get rid of your Braun, and try a Panasonic.

    <li> The Braun Series 790cc provides a good, close shave.  However, being a Black man and starting to get grey hair I find that it has problems with some of the grey hair because they are curlier than my regular hair.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I have never found a shaver that didn&#x27;t burn me, until now.  Great shave and no red bumps or anything related to shaving everyday.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because of the fact that I was expecting to be BLOWN away with the ability to get those difficult hairs on my face and although it does an exceptional job than any other electric razor I&#x27;ve used in the past. So what I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that I for an electric razor that has the foil to capture annoying hair to cut, plus the comb in the middle.....I still spent  time trying to get those damn hairs. Mind you I tried and continue to do the recommendations they specifically tell you in the instructions. Nevertheless it is a powerful and awesome razor and I wouldn&#x27;t get any other, was only expecting something MIND BLOWING lol.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a very close shave. I can actually get a closer shave on my neck with this Braun razor, than I can with a regular razor with out all of the irritation.</li>
    <li> It looks pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good gift for your family or your friends.&lt;br /&gt;I like the SED screen most</li>
    <li> I have the previous 790cc without the custom shave nor heated drying technology.  But the cutting and function is the same.  I am here to tell you that on Braun&#x27;s site it may state 7 year use but I am going 8 years strong and only replacing cartidges when needed and cutter foil every 1.5 years.  The Braun series 7 is without a doubt the most progressive and finest shavers on the market.  Truly a German masterpiece.  I have also found that Amazon has the cleaner liquid from a company to cut down on the expense of the costly cartridges.  Here is the link to it here on Amazon:  [[ASIN:B00CMQZFJG B00CMQZFJG]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system cuts close without irritation and is very quiet in doing so.  I rarely get a pulled or yanked hair either.  Only if you shave fast across your face and hit a longer hair will it yank it.  Otherwise, you take your time and do smooth strokes.  The result......a very close and fine shave.  If you are like me and constant razor burn from disposable razors the electric shaver may be your answer.  They have come so far in the past decade that they are not your father&#x27;s electric razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend replacing the foil cutter every 1.5 years.  This system is well worth the money and make sure once you get it to use it for two weeks to set up your face to get use to an electric shave.  Also I suggest using Williams Electric Shave as a setup lotion for getting your facial hair to stand up for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I cannot compare this unit to Norelco.  I am intrigued by the 3D system wet/dry use like the 1280 system by Norelco but am hesitant to give anything a try when Braun has always been there for me.  Call me a loyalist!  So if you are teetering I say jump in and give your face a nice reprieve!</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed in how well this shaver works compared to my Braun Series 5 that I had before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for several months now, and I still prefer my old $50 Norelco with the lift &amp; cut reflex heads. I know this sounds bazaar, but the Braun shaver does not &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; the clippings in the head of the razor, they fall out of the razor all over your shirt. I can&#x27;t believe they would sell a product so poorly designed. These big companies just keep dumping these junk products on consumers. They don&#x27;t care, and I assume that&#x27;s why they offer to cleaning tank, although using the cleaning tank does NOT remove that much of the hair..probably because most of it is already on your shirt. The Braun may shave slightly closer, but it marginal. I would not recommend it, especially to a friend!</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor and I have tried quite a few of them in my many years of shaving.  Very smooth and not irritating at all.  I would definitely recommend this electric razor to anyone looking for one. Hopefully it last me many years.</li>
    <li> Using it for over a year now as a daily shaver...  If I let it grow out, I just turn up the setting...</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! He has very sensitive skin and this series offers a close smooth shave while reducing the amount of in grown hairs.</li>
    <li> Used the Norelco for years Bought at the advice of a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco shaves closer quicker and is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Head too small.  Not a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Braun electric razor or probably 25+ years. When the blades are sharp &amp; the foil is intact, nothing beats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular razor is new to me. The type of Braun I used to own is no longer made. So, after reading the reviews, I made the purchase with a very slight measure of fear, knowing all too well that sometimes quality suffers even with the best of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I am quit pleased with the quality of this instrument. It provides me with a comfortable &amp; very satisfactory shave every morning to the point where I no longer look at this as a necessary chore. I am so pleased that I am actually shaving on the mornings of my days off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer looks &amp; feels a little flimsy but so far, so good. It has an LED display in the butt-end of the handle that lets you know how much of a charge is left &amp; whether or not it needs to be cleaned which, to be truthful, is after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are fans of Braun electric shavers &amp; are in the process of searching for a new, comfortable, reliable shaver, I strongly recommend you give this series your due consideration. I would also recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a better shave. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it is satisfying right out of the box.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaver. The self cleaning feature works very well. This shaver replaced my Norelco and provides a much better shave.</li>
    <li> Not that it gives a close a shave as a regular razor, but for an electric it&#x27;s o.k.--better than the Norelco.  AND--I don&#x27;t nick ,my husband&#x27;s face as much. It IS rather lacking on the chin, and I DO have to use  the Gillette Fusion in a few tough spots like over the lip, but generally-it&#x27;s all right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and I am a huge fan.  I&#x27;ve had several electric razors in the past and this one works really well.  I find myself not using the cleaner as much as I should because it dries out pretty quickly even if you don&#x27;t use it and it&#x27;s pretty expensive but the razor itself works great.</li>
    <li> Razor worked fine, but the cleaner did not. Could not return it so we were pretty much out a razor that we spent good money on.</li>
    <li> I loved it for the first 8 months, now I HATE IT! The problem is, it is made out of very cheap plastic. The first trouble started with the pop out trimmer. For no reason at all it just would no longer close. Next the plastic body next to the plastic trimmer cracked! Mind you I treated this razor with loving care, never dropped it nor mistreated it. The automatic washer no longer works. When it did work it left residue at the bottom of the washer. I can not imagine that this junky razor cost more than $10 to manufacture. I have been a Braun fan for over 30 years, my past Braun razors would easily live to be 10 years old or more. This piece of junk is good for a year. What happened Braun? Shameful. I have switched to a new brand. I am embarrassed that I paid so much money for this razor, feel like I was tricked.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband after he dropped some not-so-subtle hints requesting one. He seems to love it. I&#x27;d love it if he would use it every day.</li>
    <li> Cool that it cleans itself, i came from a norelco shaver with the 3 circles. I think that i may like that style better. This one definitely gets closer, but it takes me probably an extra 30 seconds that my old one didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, i like it! but i think i&#x27;ll go back to the 3-circle&#x27;d shaver the next time around.</li>
    <li> I got a Braun razor in the early 80&#x27;s, I believe it lasted about 15 years( 2/3 replacement heads). I believe it cost about $165.00. Prior to that I had other razors including a Noralco. Razors left my neck red and raw. I got another Braun that lasted about the same with 3/4 new heads. I was completely satisfied with the Braun, though replacing the cleaner cartridge was annoying. So when the Braun finally quit six months ago, I bought a Panasonic Arc 3. It didn&#x27;t come close to the shave I got from the Braun, after shaving with it I had to go over my face and pull out whiskers that the razor didn&#x27;t cut, also it seemed the blades quickly became dull and the shaves got progressively worse. My significent other bought me the Braun 790cc for Christmas. What a difference !  I am getting a comfortable shave that is almost as close as a razor, no more embedded whiskers. I noticed the refill cleaning cartridges are sold on Amazon at a far cheaper price than buying at retail stores. I&#x27;m glad to be back to the cleaning feature of the Braun. All the features of the Braun are appreciated, but its the close comfortable shave that I wanted and I am completely satisfied with the Braun. So it comes down to this &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. My advice as a long time user,  don&#x27;t waste your money for a cheap shaver.</li>
    <li> Have used Philips and Braun, I fell Braun more comfortable than Philips!  The shaver gives a close shave and comfortable! Recommed~</li>
    <li> The closest, smoothest shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Braun razor I’ve owned, and it&#x27;s by far gives me the best shave. Only thing is that the trimmer is a bit awkward to use. Definitely like the trimmer on my last Braun better. Seems to give me a closer shave, it&#x27;s much more quiet, and the grip is much nicer.</li>
    <li> Had a series three to see if I would like electric shaving. I had series three for almost a year.  The series seven is in a totally different category as the three.  Definitely worth the extra money.  No burn and a way closer shave at a quicker pace.  Unbelievable until you try it.  You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Everything that it said it was suppose to do and more.  Really like the cleaning station and the ease of use.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations! Great shaver&#x27;</li>
    <li> Got this shaver for Christmas to replace an aging Braun 5 series shaver. Although I get a nice close shave with the new series 7 the 5 series had a much better trimmer built in. If you don&#x27;t need a trimmer then this is a great buy if you do buy a series 5.</li>
    <li> I ordered this monster from Amazon. Got delivered fast and reliable. Tried it out and it works like a charm. Absolutely a super machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to buy the cleaning fluid at least every 8 weeks. You have to change the shaving machine head at least every 18 month. You have to be very carefull with placement of the clean station as it is filled with dangerous fluid that can ignite. You are not recommended to move the cleaning station after inserting fluid as it can tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that its pretty easy to use and the self cleaning works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get too long stubbles you have to use the trimmer first and then shaver but thats okay. Some times the shaver has problems getting the tiny hairs at the jawline, maybe because the size of the shaver head is a little big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy as I am enjoying my gift from my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. It shaves near a 100 %. Maybe around 97.</li>
    <li> Very smoot shaving, easy to use, I will recommend it, reasonable price, no irritation after shaving even after the first time.</li>
    <li> I was nervous after reading some of the negative reviews but my old Braun Activator 8585 that I&#x27;d been using for 8 years just wasn&#x27;t working as well any more, even with meticulous maintenance (regular foil cutter replacements and frequent cleaning using the Braun fluid).  It was definitely time to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go for the Series 7 since it should be a similar experience and I might not need a full 2-3 weeks to get used to it.  I figured if it didn&#x27;t do well, I could always return it and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it today just long enough to use it, and my first impression was - WOW.  I always liked my 8585 but this really blows it away.  There is a much greater degree of flex and movement to the foil and it gave an outstanding close shave under conditions where my 8585 would not have worked very well.  I also thought it was quieter and vibrated less than the 8585 - it was much more comfortable to hold and use overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the first experience with it right out of the box, it is a worthy replacement for my trusty old 8585 and if I get half as much useful life out of it, I&#x27;ll be thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do plan to keep it well-stocked with the Braun cleaning cartridges and replace the foil/cutter on schedule every year.  I know the cost of ownership is rather high with this line, but it still beats the price of the 3-blade cartridges I was burning through with regular blade shaving, and I never get any razor burn or serious irritation with these Brauns.</li>
    <li> I also bought one at Target and decided to try Amazon worked better than Target did now you know thanks again.</li>
    <li> It leaves a nice stubble on me. I was expecting it to be a little closer shave but maybe my expectations are a little to high with electric shavers or maybe its my type of hair is why I cant get a closer shave. My last electric shave was almost as good as this and cost almost half as much.</li>
    <li> I have used the shaver for six weeks now. It shaves 95% or better as close as a blade razor. I avoided electric shavers because of the time consuming cleaning with a tiny brush. The Braun cleaning system is worth its weight in gold! Just set the razor in the cleaner, press a button and walk away!  The cleaning solution lasts 30 - 35 days. $11.00 for a two unit refill pack at Wal-Mart . This shaver definitely deserves a 5 star rating...and I do not give out many 5 star ratings!</li>
    <li> Awesome! My boyfriend has had this for over 6 months and stills runs just like new! I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something like this.</li>
    <li> This shaver has gone to Afghanistan with my son.  He loves it and says it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever used (music to Mom&#x27;s ears).  Says it&#x27;s a great time-saver; does the job and beats standing over the sink, wet-shaving.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The quality of the shave is very good, the cleaning and charging unit works great. Unfortunately the head locking mechanism on the shaver broke within warranty period.  Although they will repair it under warranty, the nearest service center is halfway across the country, and Braun&#x27;s parent company (P&amp;G) requires you to ship it at your own cost which I consider unfair.</li>
    <li> I gave this razor to my husband for Fathers Day and he says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever owned.  He said it gets closer than a manual razor!</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor for 2.5 years, and have liked it. However, I am going to highlight a detailed August 2011 review that mentioned a problem with the silver paint covered plastic starting to bubble under the cutting ahead. I am having the same problem with my razor and the problem appears to be related to exposure to the cleaning process. My paint coating is bubbling and flaking. Conveniently, the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty is only good for 2 years. I reached out to Braun about this and received a generic response describing their warranty process. So no help there. For $200+ I expected this shaver to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;On the Braun 790CC some of the nice metal looking parts are silver paint covered plastic and this paint coating is now bubbling up at the back under the cutting head after a couple of years of use and Jet cleaning which is very disappointing.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is my second time buy this, good!</li>
    <li> Good but the head lock function does not work after a month of usage.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Shaver and I like this one the best.  I love the idea of being able to adjust how close of a shave you want by the press of a button.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver that I have used in many years and have found it to be superior in every way to anything I tried in the past.  The automatic cleaning is convenient and reduces the time required to get ready each day.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get all the hair off my neck. Otherwise, it&#x27;s amazing on my face and chin and the self-cleaning is great. It&#x27;s a bit loud too but that&#x27;s not too much of a problem.</li>
    <li> This was for my husband.  He likes the older models better because they were larger.  Larger shaving area &amp; handle meaning less time shaving &amp; easier to hold.  The new &amp;#34;vibrating levels&amp;#34; don&#x27;t seem to make any difference at all. The side burn trimmer doesn&#x27;t lock in place making it difficult to get a straight line.  Older models the piece was pushed up and locked in place.  He has been using this brand/type for over 10 years and prefers the older models more.  All that said, this is still a good razor but this latest model is lacking which means he will probably check out some other brands when it&#x27;s time to replace this one.</li>
    <li> Does not cut hair to the skin around the neck area. I have to go over all areas multiple times and finish up by using a dry disposal razor. The cleaner is very disappointing. My prviuos Braun was fantastis. I will try another brand.</li>
    <li> Best razor ever!  We love how fast it is and what a good job it does.  Makes shaving fun.  Real close shave and the cleaning aspect is wonderful.  Every may should have one.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new shaver since it gives him a very close shave &amp; the razor cleans itself.  He had another one l0 yrs. ago, that still works, but wanted a new updated one.</li>
    <li> Takes a little longer then a blade but no nicks.  The cleaning system does very good job also. Reviewed a number of electric shavers  and I feel this was the best choice.</li>
    <li> Very nice purchase, actually lives up to expectations.</li>
    <li> I have owned a lot of Braun and Norelco shavers and this one is the best. It shaves quickly and smoothly. The only downside is the need to buy cleaning fluid cartridges.</li>
    <li> He used to use disposable razers and always ended up cutting himself. I finally bought him this shaver, and it&#x27;s great! He loves it and never cuts himself anymore. It does it&#x27;s job well!</li>
    <li> Great item. Like the wet shave capability.</li>
    <li> replaced a rotary electric shaver.  The Braun 7 series FAR exceeded the performance of it as well as my expectations.  Close shave even with a two day beard growth.</li>
    <li> I wear a go-t (how do you write it)lol. Shaves great but I would still have to bust out the razor to line myself. Up.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shaver. He has had it a few months now and it really holds up and gives a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Best electric shave I have ever used. It cuts almost as well as a blade, but without the nicks. Cleaning system is very easy and efficient. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing. Shaves so close that it feels like you used a razor. Easy to clean and operate.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT shaver system. I owned a previous Braun for over 10 years, never really used the cleaning part or took care of it well, but it lasted for over 10 years and worked very well until the charger port broke on it. So it was time to get another one. I did a lot of research and based on how long the last one lasted me and how good of reviews this one got, I broke down and just got this one and I&#x27;m very happy I did. So far, I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it&#x27;s been very solid. It just works very well and does exactly what you want it to do. I do use the cleaning and charging station and it works nice. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the tilt because if it&#x27;s not in there correctly, it doesn&#x27;t hit the charge knobs inside. But that&#x27;s a very minor complaint. Other than that, I&#x27;d highly recommend this and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for a friend and I believe it was very much liked and appreciated. Great idea!</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used. Still has problems with neck hair but will eventually cut it. Not as close as a razor put pretty darn close. Cleaning system is nice but can get pricey if you use it all the time. I found a couple of times a week works well. I think I can finally ditch the traditional razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used. I switched from the top of the line Panasonic shaver because it would leave stray hairs that needs to be followed up with a blade. The shave is still not quite as close as a blade, but it is very good.  My only complaint about the razor is that the foil and blades are a single piece, making it difficult to get at the razor for cleaning when away from the base. The cynic in me thinks this was done on purpose so that you are forced to buy the propriatery cleaning cartridges. I used to use the Remington shaving talc, but I don&#x27;t with this razor because it gums up the razor and can&#x27;t be cleaned easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my partner as I got tired of him using mine every day.  I&#x27;ve owned mine for 2 years now and love the way it shaves, quickly with no pain whatsoever.  Had the previous version where the charger stem rose from the base, never had a problem with that one either which my partner has been using up to this point.  The battery was not holding a charge so the shaver had to be used with the power cord at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I would have is with the pop-out trimmer which isn&#x27;t designed as well as on the older model, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the shaver&#x27;s performance enough for me to not rate it 5 stars.  Great shaver if you give it enough time to break in so that your face gets used to it.</li>
    <li> I was initially going to keep my old braun as a back up.  I used this once and put the old one in the trash.  Never been let down by braun.  I wont go into detail about the product its been beat to death with over 600 reviews.</li>
    <li> the shaver I s great a works very well in shaving and the way that it cleans the slaver also,have used it a few time and would definitely would giv eit good makes work workmanship and how well it shaves your face</li>
    <li> the first shaver that could shave the neck sensitive area, when the hair is a bit long (like 2 weeks long) the shaver was able to cut the hair but sometimes it did pull few hairs which was a bit painful, but I guess the shavers are not designed for a long hair any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all, the experience was great, I&#x27;ve been using the Cruzer3 for the past years and I had trouble shaving my neck, also the cleaning was amazing, I checked it before and after the automatic cleaning, it was like a new! and also smells good, and I liked that my old power adapter for the Cruzer3 works with the series 7 which means I have a spare one now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying the clean&amp;renew cartridges and also a spare Foil &amp; Cutter cassette because this baby is staying for a long time with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job Braun, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I had used a Braun previously but was lured to Panasonic by claims of closer shave.  I came back to Braun after my Panasonic (high end) simply stopped working.  It will not be easy to lure me away from Braun quality again.</li>
    <li> Having switched from regular razors my skin has become so much better. No more burns or cuts and its very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that it took almost two weeks for my facial hair to adjust to the razor as it has been said all over the manuals. So if you dont get a close shave the first time, dont throw it out yet. Also, if you have a thick beard then you will need to trim it first, Its not a lawn mower.</li>
    <li> so cool,good shaver,Worthy of recommendation，A good experience。so cool,good shaver,Worthy of recommendation，A good experience。so cool,good shaver,Worthy of recommendation，A good experience。so cool,good shaver,Worthy of recommendation，A good experience。</li>

    <li> Quiet.  Several cleaning selections.  Great shave. This was a gift and he likes it better than his old Braun shaver system.</li>
    <li> A  good gift to my father.  He like it.. . .. ...  ..  .. .. . ..... . ... ....  ......</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an aging Braun 8595 that I got back in the early 2000&#x27;s (it&#x27;s still kicking strong!) and I have been very impressed with the big jump electric shaving has taken over the last decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- It is a lot quieter than previous versions and other similarly priced electric shavers, but it&#x27;s still loud enough that someone outside the bathroom can hear it even when the door is closed.&lt;br /&gt;- Feels very solid in the hand (like a premium product), has a great grip, and is easy to maneuver around the face.&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer works great for cleaning up around the edges and for cutting down sideburns. Big plus for me is that it pops up away from the main body of the unit so it&#x27;s easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery life is absolutely fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using it for just about 2 weeks every morning and it&#x27;s still showing me there&#x27;s a bit left (I take about 4-5 min a shave). If you get a full charge in you can rest easy in case you forget the charger over a long vacation.&lt;br /&gt;- Does a much better job at trimming down hair under the chin and on the neck than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;- Is water-sealed so you can use it with shaving cream etc. and clean it easily by just running it under a hot tap instead of having to buy those Braun cleaning/charging station refill packs.&lt;br /&gt;- Walk away every morning feeling like I got a great shave in (was definitely not true before with other models I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Pricey shaver compared to its competitors like the Sensotouch 3D (which I was cross-shopping with).&lt;br /&gt;- Pricey upkeep if you plan to use the cleaning cartridges for the cleaning/charging station (but you don&#x27;t need them to clean it).&lt;br /&gt;- Arguably you can be better off with the 760c over the 790c since you get the same basic shaving performance.&lt;br /&gt;- Takes at least a few days to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; and get used to how to use it (don&#x27;t give up hope if it&#x27;s not 100% at day 1).&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a while to full clean the shaver on a \\&quot;full\\&quot; clean through the cleaning/charging station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this shaver purchase is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve made and I have no regrets. Whether this is better than rotary styled competitors (like the sensotouch 3d), I personally think it is. It&#x27;s just a great shaver and using a foil-based shaver like the braun feels a lot more natural to me than the triple-blade rotary styled ones. Is the 790c worth is over the 760c? If you don&#x27;t need the extras like a well-made travel bag, silver color scheme, or the nicer back-lit readout then maybe not. I personally do like the nice travel bag and got a great deal through amazon on the 790c so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun simply isn&#x27;t going to cut as close as a standard non-electric blade shaver. But what it can do is give you a pretty great shave that&#x27;s pretty close to a blade, and save you lots of money down the road on replacement blades, shaving cream, etc. My last Braun lasted me nearly a decade and I have no reason to doubt that this one will do even better.ull clean the shaver on a \\&quot;full\\&quot; clean through the cleaning/charging station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this shaver purchase is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve made and I have no regrets.

    <li> it&#x27;s a very good thing。 i like it very much.i well buy it next time.i want have a sales next time</li>
    <li> i love it very  much ! so  prefect !  i love it very  much ! so  prefect !  i love it very  much ! so  prefect !</li>
    <li> I Love It,very much。。。。。&lt;br /&gt;I want have it more one，so，I will buy an other one。&lt;br /&gt;my friend like it ，thank you，amazon。</li>
    <li> The $40 promotion is awesome. It&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s multifunction &amp; easy to handle. BTW, when it cleans itself it will make some noise.</li>
    <li> The result using 790cc is that i&#x27;ve waiting.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very simple to use and ease to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another Braun Series 7 - my husband loves the shaver and had completely worn the other one out after many years of use.  Excellent shaver!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver.  I realy like it.  It is a lot smother than expected and cut my shave time in half.  I like the self cleaning it does so it is easy to take care of.  I get a quick smooth save and it leaves me with a smile.</li>
    <li> My previous electric razor (also a Braun) finally played out after about 12 years, so I decided to give this Braun razor a try.  I love it!  I like the shave that I get, &amp; really like the way the cleaning/recharge system is set up.  Hopefully, this one will last as long as the previous one!</li>
    <li> The best shaving experience ever, really no need for a Razor it shaves very close and does not cause skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is amazing, the cleaning machine returns the shaver to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;Need to highlight that it needs a little patience to complete the shave because it is not a razor... a clean shave takes max 10mins.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap shaver but it does a great job and is worth the money!  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I ever had by far. Smooth, quick, and very close. The cleaning system is extremely convenient too.</li>
    <li> Relatively quiet compared to the other Brauns I have owned.  Power gauge and use gauge are handy.  Looks like you can get at least a weeks worth of shaves without recharging.  Very close shaves, convenient trimmer.  If you&#x27;ve used a Braun before, you&#x27;ll need to get used to pushing the power button rather than sliding it.  Blade and screen is rated at 18 months rather than 12, which is a decent improvement.  Unlike older Brauns, you don&#x27;t need to push a lock button after setting it in the base - you just set it and push the power button.  Good design and performance improvements.</li>
    <li> this is the best electric shaver I have ever bought. works great for me. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be getting any other electric shavers for a long time.</li>
    <li> I decided to go with the top of the line model of the Braun Series 7 and it&#x27;s definitely my best shave experience!</li>
    <li> Great product albiet pricey.  You get what you pay for.  Shaves great and the cleaning system works well. Small annoyance is the bright blue LED light on the shaver stays on all the time when in the cleaning base.  At night it lights up the bathroom like a police car.  You would think the light would go off when the shaver is charged.</li>
    <li> Have been using daily for 3 weeks now.  Still in a trail phase.  Yes it give a good shave.  Much better by week 3 than week one.  Less irritation or rash/burn.  Not as close as a blade and you need to pull and push your skin to get to all the areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is simple but I am not looking forward to the added cost to replace cleaning fluid packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I will keep this , they give you 60 days to try and then return for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 months later.  I love this razor, very good choice.  Cleaning packs are not that expensive and they last a fairly long time.  Holds a good charge and the trimmer feature is excellent.  New best razor purchase ever!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this series.  It gives a comfortable shave.  The heads float well and as long as you do not push too hard into your face, it does not get too hot and remains comfortable.  As a hint I had received, with a rotary electric shaver, move the head in circles.  With a oscillating shaver like this one, you should move it in straight lines.  I am able to hear the stubble cutting with this unit which is contrary to other reports I had read.  The pop out trimmer is in a bit of an odd location for visibility reasons, but you learn how to adjust to that.  The only down side is the care necessary when shaving up to (but not into) any beard/goatee you may have.  Moving this razor along the edge of the goatee with the edge of the blade, you will snag and pull a hair or two.  You QUICKLY learn, shave up to it...much more comfortable.  The charging and cleaning system works well too.  Knocking out trimmings from the head is a little more difficult than older models due to the more complex design which captures trimmings within cavities.  The cleaner system cleans those areas well though.</li>
    <li> For the price, and with all of the fantastic reviews on Amazon, I expected the Braun Series 7 to be the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It definitely is not.  The problem is, it&#x27;s just terrible on the neck.  I&#x27;ve tried everything over the last year -- softer, harder, up, down, side-to-side -- and nothing has improved the poor results.  I even replaced the (expensive) shaver screen/blade before it was due to be replaced.  This is just too high priced of a razor to produce such average -- and below average below the chin - results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried another highly-rated electric razor and results were even worse.  Maybe it&#x27;s time for me to accept that the problem is me, not the razor technology.  Anyway, I gave this another star as it probably is better than most others, even if it&#x27;s not perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Amazon  has best price on this shaver. Nice shaver gives close shave no burning face feeling. Nice sideburn or mustche trimer. Sits in home station and cleans head with a cleaner for a always new and fresh smelling feeling.Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. It shaves much closer than his Remingtom shaver. The automatic cleaning is fantastic. Plus on vacation, he can take the adapter cord and use it.</li>
    <li> Have been a primary blade shaver (multi-blade)only using an electric rotary shaver on few occasions years ago. It was a miserable experience feeling like each hair was being plucked out.  Even using a blade, shaving around my chin is tough and thick and sometimes painful. Like cutting coarse sandpaper, you men know what I saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ELECTRIC RAZOR HAS BEEN AMAZING!!!!! Shaves REALLY close with no pull, I repeat, NO PULL whatsoever, including my chin. So quick. So smooth. Almost as clean as against the grain with a blade. I treat it like a blade, similar technique and shave pattern. I make one pass, flip over and make second slower pass. Works well for me.  A few minutes while shower heats up and I&#x27;m done. Touch up with razor on missed areas, as needed, still learning, but a DEFINITE must-have for me from now on. SO HAPPY TO HAVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self-clean is a dream, but I use it only once or twice a week. Rinse with hot water after each shave, using full clean cycle only after hygiene setting reaches red mark. I man-up my shaver, try to toughen it up so its not afraid to get a little dirty. Took others advice and remove cleaning cartridge after each use, re-seal and store it to prevent unnecessary evaporation of cleaning fluid. Keeps a charge really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to go with top of the line shaver, such a good deal and good reviews (70% 5-star) on Amazon. I do not regret it. Glad I made the investment. Pleasant, pain-free, close shave, hassle-free and quick. What more can you ask? No need for lathers either. No complaints. Worth every penny and then some to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-star recommendation. Better than expected.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this gift says this product is well designed, especially with adjustable shaving settings.  Another great feature is the self cleaning.  It is especially good for home or for travel use.</li>
    <li> It feels nice, very sturdy, but I don&#x27;t believe the shave received is worth the price. I have no problem dishing out the big bucks but if I do so, I want results. That being said, my main problem is my hair is pitch black and I&#x27;m pale-ish. So if this thing doesn&#x27;t get as smooth as possible it shows on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Cleaning system works well&lt;br /&gt;*Head is small enough to fit in &#x27;stache area&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to see and guide head of shaver&lt;br /&gt;*Feels well built&lt;br /&gt;*Decent to good shave in most parts of my beard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;*Cannot shave wet and the BRAUN 799cc WET/DRY MODEL IS COMING TO AMERICA THIS SUMMER Via/ BraunUS twitter personal response(only said summer, nothing specific). So save your money until then if you want the ability to wet shave and even if not, this should become cheaper when that arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Loud enough you need 2 shut doors between you and your sleeping housemates&lt;br /&gt;*Unable to get neck/jaw hairs shaved (would call it a trimming)&lt;br /&gt;*Alcohol smell was overpowering when shaving &#x27;stache area (though enjoyable when further away from the sniffer)&lt;br /&gt;*Trimmer is non-existent&lt;br /&gt;*Cannot realistically manually clean&lt;br /&gt;*Price is too high for just an okay shaver performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it isn&#x27;t a bad piece of machinery, but I was lucky enough to buy this from Walmart so I could return it hassle free unlike amazon which will not accept it back due to alcohol cleaning solution. So I ordered the Panasonic ESLV81K and will update this with a comparison when I get to test that out as well. Like I said, I don&#x27;t mind spending a lot if I get good quality. Hope that theory works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************Braun 790cc vs Panasonic ESLV81K Comparison update*************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to compare over what I feel the most important features are. I thought this would be completely easy to decide the winner, but as I write this, I still haven&#x27;t completely decided. So let me get started and I&#x27;ll have to make my pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality and Looks: Not much to say here, they both feel pretty solid. Braun \\&quot;feels\\&quot; better built as the Panasonic has more of a plastic feel to the outside. Panasonic seems to have smudges that I cannot get out from when I used shaving cream,  makes the shaver look stained. Cannot rightfully compare that with the Braun since I cannot use shaving cream with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: I would say the Braun feels like its meant to fit in your hand better though the Panasonic is by no means bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loudness: ESLV81K is a good bit higher in pitch, which seems to just barely creep past my 2 shut doors to my sleeping girlfriend. The Braun 790cc cannot be heard with 2 doors between you and it. Its lower buzz is more enjoyable to my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Station: The Braun&#x27;s looks way better but the Panasonic&#x27;s is easier to read and figure out for first timers. They both get the job done and the shavers come out as clean as when it was unboxed. Tossup here, can&#x27;t decide which I prefer until I mention the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Solution: I had to put this in a completely separate category because I don&#x27;t feel the cleaning station of the Panasonic is by any means inferior to Braun&#x27;s. Though the cleaning solution is just bad to me. I complained about the Braun&#x27;s alcohol smell going up in my sniffer when doing the &#x27;stache before but boy do I miss those days. the Braun 790cc comes out smelling lemony fresh and is so pleasant during 90% of your shave time and even then the alcohol smell isn&#x27;t that bad near your nose. The Panasonic on the other hand, it smells so odd... Hard to describe better, smells soapy but not a good soapy smell. Like soap trying to cover up a mold smell. The more worn the Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning cartridge is the less obtrusive the smell is though. But 100%, Braun cleaning solution is so much better on the senses. Though I would like to repeat, they both get the shaver clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual Clean: I know Braun gives you a brush but they shouldn&#x27;t, you cannot manually clean it, don&#x27;t even bother. The Panasonic&#x27;s manual cleaning is easy and probably as effective as the cleaning station. Heck, I would probably recommend people get just the shaver for the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the important stuff, the shaving experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I use Lab Series For Men Electric Shaver Solution when Dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: They both stink hardcore. Choosing between a turd and a pile of poo here. If forced I would pick the Panasonic&#x27;s trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-Day Stubble: Braun did way better than I would have thought, just some jaw hairs needed touching up. Panasonic looked just as good as 1 day stubble shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry Shave Experience: Both are very comfortable, feel as though I end up with more red bumps and irritation with the ESLV81K but might just be the closeness and its only around my bottom neck. Braun gives me some around my neck/jaw probably from all the skin stretching I do around that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet Shave Experience: Only Panasonic here, have I used it with cream? Yes, I won&#x27;t say much about it because I don&#x27;t like using cream with shavers because I think its messy but I will say it works. I use shaving gel, a little lighter and not quite as messy. With my gel (Eshu, had to throw the brand name in there, I love their stuff), the Panasonic glides effortlessly and gets a pretty close shave. I would say it&#x27;s only slightly closer than a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling: I NEED TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED A LOT BY IT! The Panasonic&#x27;s 5 blade head is not as big as it looks and it fits in my &#x27;stache area with ease. The big head doesn&#x27;t off-balance the device in your hand and the maneuverability of the head is admirable. I might say it is too maneuverable and you may need to put the lock on to press down harder to get an area. The Braun feels even better though, probably because the Panasonic moves left to right as well as up and down which I feel is overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Speed: Holy cow, Panasonic just destroys my facial hair. Cheeks and upper lip only need 1 pass most of the time. Neck requires an extra pass or two. Braun requires a lot more face stretching which adds up. The 790cc also needs a minimum of 3-4 strokes at one spot, the Panasonic is just way faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Closeness: That unholy patch of neck/jaw hair my Braun couldn&#x27;t get was shaved closer by the ESLV81K but not as good as I hoped. Would have to say besides that, the difference isn&#x27;t huge. Panasonic is just a little closer everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I required to pick a winner? Ugh, I think I may return my ESLV81K and hope the Braun 799cc does indeed come out this summer or the 790cc hits a big sale here on Amazon. I said the Braun wasn&#x27;t worth the price but the Panasonic isn&#x27;t either. Add the replacement heads of the Panasonic which, as I write this, are currently on backorder and are over $80 for the combo foil and blades! The Panasonic cleaning cartridges are cheaper in the long run but nowhere close enough to make up for the replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My winner comes down to the one thing I didn&#x27;t want it to, price... Even if you don&#x27;t mind throwing around money, the boost in shave quality with the Panasonic is so minimal that it&#x27;s not worth $100 more than the Braun. Let me finish by saying, I would be keeping the Panasonic if the Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution didn&#x27;t smell so very good.aun gives you a brush but they shouldn&#x27;t, you cannot manually clean it, don&#x27;t even bother. The Panasonic&#x27;s manual cleaning is easy and probably as effective as the cleaning station.

    <li> Although I only have it for a short time, it seems to be of a quality that is going to last.  It is well made, and it does the job that the literature says it will do.</li>
    <li> Other than being too expensive I really like the razor.  As others have said it takes a few shaves to learn how to use it but after that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the price to pay for each time you have to clean it. The only bad point for this great machine. FORGET IRRITATIONS ON YOUR SKIN!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace my 5 year old Braun 8595. I’ve been putting off the upgrade because I kept reading mixed reviews of this new Braun 790.  My preference is the Braun style compared to the Norelco style so I want to get that out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unboxed the unit and I must say that Braun does a first class job packing this unit. Everything was perfect although the unit did not have any charge upon opening.  Also, Braun only provides 1 cleaning solution.  For the money there should be 2 or at least some coupons, but this is a minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the unit for about an hour and then I started my first shave. My expectations were low, but my 8595 was starting to fail.  It usually takes me about 10-15 minutes with the 8595 to complete a shave.  I started to shave and I immediately noticed the difference.  The new razor cut effortlessly and quickly.  I finished my shave in about 6 minutes.  It reached all areas of my face even the difficult neck region.  The shave was the closest I have ever experienced from an electric razor.  In fairness, I have older blades on the 8595, but it never shaved this close with so little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the Braun 790.  I only wish I purchased it sooner and Amazon has the best price available as well.</li>
    <li> My facial grows really quick and is very dark that makes me always seem to have a five o&#x27;clock shadow. With my quick growing hair I also have sensitive skin so that using regular disposable razors (mainly Gillette) would cause &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34;. I have always used Braun electric shavers as it really helps with my sensitive skin as using this on my face feels pretty good. The foils on this shaver don&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way no matter what angel or direction I&#x27;m shaving in. Don&#x27;t really have to press this shaver to hard to your face as it gives a nice close shave. The LCD on the razor is a nice touch as it informs you easily with the &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34; status of your shaver and battery life remaining. The &amp;#34;Braun Clean &amp; Renew System&amp;#34; is great as I love having my shaver cleaned for me quickly with just a press of a button also the cleaning solution is easy to replace in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the negatives I have with this is that the shaver is really loud. There are 3 settings on this shaver based on your skin type and with my senstive skin I have it on the middle setting for my face and lowest for my neck though is loud in comparison to its older models. Also the cleaning of the shaver itself from the &amp;#34;Braun Clean &amp; Renew System&amp;#34; is REALLY LOUD. I really hate how loud it is as it can be heard from a good distance in the house. So keep this in mind if you wake up really early to go to work or whatever to not push the clean button maybe until you get home as to not wake up anyone else in the house as I find this to be annoyingly loud. Last thing I don&#x27;t care for is the &amp;#34;Precision Long Hair Trimmer&amp;#34; that is designed to trim your sideburns as it doesn&#x27;t cut very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this shaver as it is perfect for my sensitive skin as well as my thick facial hair. It gets the job done and provides me with an excellent close shave without any discomfort. I RECOMMEND this shaver to those that want a great shave without any hassle of clean up and &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34;.e without any hassle of clean up and &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Provides a smooth, close shave! Which is the most important aspect of this or any shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Added perks that I like is the cleaning system. There are indicators on the shaver for battery charge and cleaning. Drop it in the base and with the push of a button it does its thing. Walk away and its ready for the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other systems I&#x27;ve owned, the cleaning solution is in a self contained unit and doesn&#x27;t evaporate away too quickly. It lasts about three months before you need to install another cleaning solution tank/cartridge. Hey so much easier and less messy!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Over the years Braun has steadily been improving the closeness of the shave and the 790cc is a definite improvement over prior models. This is the third Braun shaver I have owned in a row and each has lasted a good three years without the battery degrading or other problems so I expect the same will be true for this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest improvements is in the shaver foil which seems to cut closer than past models I had experience with. The cleaning system works well and with subscribe and save from Amazon I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight annoyance is how bright the blue light is on the shaver when it&#x27;s in the cleaning base -- it really lights up my bedroom from the master bath at night so I end up having to close the door which I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Some one recommend this top-end product of Braun shaver series.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a real  user-friendly product .Sound quietly,hold comfortablly&lt;br /&gt;Most improtant of shaver is the effects of shaving,only word I can say is amazing (not amazong.......dry jokes)</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and held out for over a year. I compared top-of-the-line Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun. I finally took the plunge and am very, very pleased with this system. After 20+ years I switched from Norelcos and did not have to look back...at all.</li>
    <li> First electric razor that did not give me a rash!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving have always been a pain for me, but this product solved all my problems! now shaving is comfortable, fast and wont leaves any red areas on my neck,also cleaning system works perfectly, loved the digital indicator on the bottom and express cleaning option.</li>
    <li> Although there is no open it, but the packing is very good, very advanced</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for in a shaver. It shavers better than the previous model did.I would purchase it agin.</li>
    <li> The original is very good, look forward to next year Black Friday...</li>
    <li> This product was received before time, so it was cool because it was kind a suprese. I was exceptic before a I buy it, but I regret nothing. I recomend it.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this shaver to any one. I have never used a shaver that pulls your beard like the Braun Series 7. I used a Braun Series 5 for 9 years and had to replace it because the battery lost all power. I made a mistake by replacing it with a Braun Series 7 shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used a rotary shaver for as long as I can remember.  When I looked at the Consumer Reports ratings of shavers the Braun foil razor was rated higher.  I thought to myself, \\&quot;Do I want to change from a rotary that I have used for years to a foil at age 70?\\&quot;  I took the leap of faith and purchased the Braun Series 7 790cc Shaver System.  I have been using it for one month and I love the razor.  I do think it is terribly overpriced at 175.97.  The shaving system means that I can clean the razor by simply plugging in the cleaning and charging base and it does the rest.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver only once because it is a Christmas present but I wanted to make sure it worked OK and that it was as good as past Braun shavers I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s all wraped at this time and I will update after Christmas. The test shave was wonderful!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am on blood thinners and can not afford any cuts. This is the best shaver I have tried. Always giving a very smooth shave without irritation or bumps. I travel a lot, and the battery lasts at least 10 days (or more) without recharging. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of the Braun 500 series for 12 years.  I used it until the charger literally broke and would not charge/clean anymore.  I loved the razor and decided to upgrade but stick with the Braun.  After researching I landed on this one and have not been disappointed.  Although I am not a super hairy guy, I&#x27;ve been impressed with the quality of shave it gives.  It&#x27;s shaves better than my straight blade does (when shaving with teh grain) and its&#x27; very easy to use.  The clean and charge station is easier and a WAY better design than the older version that required you to press down and lock in the charging arm to charge through the bottom of the razor.  This one sits in the cradle easily and has no moving part to break like my old one.  It also has a great built in digital gauge to tell you how much charge is left in the razor, and how &amp;#34;sanitary&amp;#34; it is.  This helps guide you whether you are in need of a cleaning or not.  I tend to let it go through a cleaning cycle daily because I like having a clean fresh razor with each shave, but for those that would rather replace the cleaning solution less often, this helps you gauge whether you want to clean it or not.  Also has a quick clean option that will quickly clean it up for you in a pinch, though not as thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this razor, and assuming it holds up as my old one did, will likely have it for another decade to come!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 12-19-2012&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since changed over to the Panasonic Arc 4 and have not looked back.  It&#x27;s really night and day in my opinion.  I feel that the Arc 4 gets a much closer shave and does it quicker than the 790cc.  I liked the 790cc when I had it but I feel that the Arc 4 is way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED to 3 stars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over two years now and have been generally happy with it.  Several years ago I ditched my mach 3 and went with an electric for every day use.  I just find it to be more convenient, not having to deal with shaving cream/etc every day.  In any case, I have really liked this shaver in comparison to my old panasonic.  The cleaning system can be a little loud and it can take some time to go through the cycle so be prepared if you happen to turn it on at night.  Just when you think it&#x27;s done cleaning, you&#x27;ll probably hear it start buzzing again, especially if it hasn&#x27;t been cleaned in a while.  The cleaning unit seems to know how long it&#x27;s been between cleanings, not necessarily how dirty your shaver is.  I travel a lot for work mon-thurs and every time I come home it is always on the intense clean mode when I set it back in the charger even if I actually cleaned my shaver under water when I was away from the cleaning base.  Since there is no way that I know of to change the cleaning setting this can be a bit annoying.  Also, as far as cleaning goes, I usually find that one cleaning cartridge will last a few months before you have to replace it.  For what it is, I personally think that the cleaning cartridges are too expensive.  They do seem to get the job done though as every time I replace a cartridge, the old one is always full of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the shaver is a very good shaver, I find that I can finish up shaving in less than a few minutes.  Also, the battery lasts a very long time.  I&#x27;ve been away from home for more than 2 weeks at a time and the battery has yet to run out on me when I&#x27;m away.  The other nice thing is that this shaver comes with a hard plastic case for the shaver that&#x27;s not too bad.  After several years of use and probably more than 100 trips with this thing though, the case and the shaver are starting to show their age.  The case is showing its age as the locking mechanism isn&#x27;t as tight as it used to be and the shaver itself is showing age as well as the silver paint is starting to chip off all around the top of the shaver under the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has been a great electric shaver for me.  The problems I&#x27;ve had with the case, I suspect are normal wear and tear but the paint chipping I was not suspecting.  Luckily the paint chipping has no impact on the shaving itself.  This shaver should last me another year or so before I start looking for a new one.  I took off one star because of the expensive replacement cartridges and the paint chipping...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- One thing to note... after the first year of use I changed the blade.  It made a world of difference so make sure you follow the guidelines fairly closely to maintain a good shave!more than 2 weeks at a time and the battery has yet to run out on me when I&#x27;m away.

    <li> Nice electric shaver, my last Braun lasted for 12 years with life still in it.</li>
    <li> I had a previous model of Braun 8000 series for 8 years, and it was perfect all this time, only need to change foil and cutter, because it start to leave single hairs. So I&#x60;ve decided to change it on new model, which costs with delivery and taxes in Russia (sit if you stand) 300$. One unhappy day the courier bring it to me, I&#x60;ve collect my old one in the box, and charge the new. This device is a little slimmer and lighter, but the quality of shaving is so poor, so had my simplest Braun of 1986. They leave the same hairs, and worst of all, leaves the whole unshaved areas on neck, or in the middle of cheek. I think get back my old 8000, change the foil and shave next another 8 years. The Braun marketologist was definitely ashamed to call the new model 9000, they not without reason decreased it by 7000 series, and this is true - it&#x60;s a step down from 8000 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think twice to spend money!</li>
    <li> The shavers look pretty good. They are  gifts for my husband and my brother. I think them will like them.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good, and i really love it!</li>
    <li> So I was typical razor Mach3 shaver for the 20+ years.  I decided to try this out because like almost everyone out there.. I hate shaving.  So I tried this out.  At first I didn&#x27;t like it because it was different and I felt like it didn&#x27;t shave close near the neck and other sculpted parts of my face.  BUT!, I learned a few things... I found using this every day or every other day makes a big difference.  Don&#x27;t shave your face with it if you have a 4 to 5 day beard as it can pull the hairs a little bit and isn&#x27;t efficient..at least it wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I use it everyday or every other day, it works perfectly.  No complaints, I&#x27;m never scruffy anymore and for someone who hated to shave, actually doesn&#x27;t mind it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended unit, no complaints... I WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON IT AFTER THE FIRST FEW SHAVES, TRY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN... I also found it works great when my facial hair is super dry so I shave right before I shower and it seems to work good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning mechanism is great.  I first shaved when I had a 5 day beard growing (not recommended because it pulls a little) and the unit cleaned it perfectly.  There&#x27;s an INDICATOR that shows how dirty the unit is (3 levels)... it&#x27;s pretty accurate..  I put the unit in the charger, it shows how dirty it is, I push the button and I hear it cleaning then it&#x27;s ready for the next shave.  I&#x27;m not sure about the refills, some complain about the price of the refills but if you&#x27;re buying this shaver... a few bucks every few months for a cleaning solution isn&#x27;t bad... also there&#x27;s some websites that tell you how to make your own solution for cleaning..up to you and how much time you have on mixing your own solutions and buying materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW CLOSE DOES IT SHAVE: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as close as a regular razor, but it is super close.  For me this made sense because when I used a regular razor I would go a few days in between which would make me look scruffy because I hated to shave (and I own my company so it didn&#x27;t matter)  Now with this razor, I look almost clean shaven everyday... and the girls notice.. just kidding.. my wife does though :)  it&#x27;s ok to dream a little right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Truly impressed, a local barber shop recommended it and I was super skeptical...but have to say it&#x27;s great.ve (and I own my company so it didn&#x27;t matter)  Now with this razor, I look almost clean shaven everyday... and the girls notice.. just kidding.. my wife does though :)  it&#x27;s ok to dream a little right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Truly impressed, a local barber shop recommended it and I was super skeptical...but have to say it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> For many years I shaved with a blade.  And this shaver gets as close or closer than that.  It is an exceptional shaver.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually not certain why folks give this less than FOUR stars. I considered five, but it&#x27;s not quite there. This said, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve YET used an electric razor that deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using electric razors since my teen years. My skin was too sensitive for a blade. I&#x27;m now in my 40s. My last razor was a Braun 7 series and I loved it. Had it for several years but the battery quit charging and I travel a lot so that was not going t work. Honestly, I did not want to pay this much for the razor. So for my replacement I purchased a different Braun model. I used it once and returned it. I then ponied up and purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN sum it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I think one thing folks forget is that each time I (one) get(s) a new electric razor (about every 5 years it seems) there is a period of getting the face/beard used to the razor. I&#x27;m not sure why but that has been my experience. Once I used this razor for about a week or two all was really great. I get a nice close shave. I will say that the first two times, I would agree with the feedback on not getting the course beard, but after the period of getting used to my face it all worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still probably the best razor out there; although it&#x27;s a pricy bugger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: just saw the price is about $50 cheaper than I paid for it, maybe more. This is now a deal. Highly recommend and changing my star rating. Only reason for the four star was the price. I do stand by my above that it&#x27;s probably the best on the market, but my feeling was $250 for a razor mean I should expect something that is just WOW!. This razor is definitely worth the $170 and that is usually what I have paid for a good Braun. Not sure why others are giving it one start. I can see why some might give it three if they are not used to Bruans or do not follow my recommendation above. This price is very solid.</li>
    <li> Shaver is great&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is just ok</li>
    <li> Fast, clean shave day after day.</li>
    <li> Got it for my father inlaw and he loves it. He loves teh smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS SHAVER WORKS BECAUSE I ORDED TWO IN ERROW AND HAVE SPENT SEVERAL HOURS TRYING TO RETURN ONE OF THEM. THIS IS THE FRIST TIME I HAVE BEEN DISPLEASED WITH AMAZON. THEY DO NOT LET YOU CONTACT THEM OR SEND A RETURN LABLE. THEY SHOULD GIVE ME A PHONE NUMBER AND TELL ME WHY THE WEB SITE KEEPS GOING IN CIRCLES.HAVE A NICE DAY BECAUSE YOU MADE MY DAY GO DOWN HILL</li>
    <li> my trusty old Braun 7680 had served me well for ~7 years, so when it died recently there was no question that i was getting another Braun. (battery still worked; sliding on/off mechanism self-destructed, btw) the Braun 790cc earns top reviews everywhere (check out the wirecutter, for example) and for good reason: amazing, amazing shave for an electric. so close, but so gentle. no neck irritation whatsoever for this guy. simple, painless daily cleaning protocol may up the consumable cost from my 7680, but likely well worth it for maintaining the blades, my complexion, and a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> get it only for 126 dollars!!!!141 dollars with 15 dollars coupon,only for 126 dollars,it is so cheap in my opinion.Hope the quality will not be so  \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for 10 months now and it does give me a close shave.  I used a Norelco for many years before buying this.  I have a couple of gripes with this razor and the biggest is one I didn&#x27;t have with my Norelcos.  When I shave with this razor, I have to shave in different directions to get a smooth shave.  One pass doesn&#x27;t come close to getting it done.  With my circular head Norelcos, this wasn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second gripe is the \\&quot;self cleaning\\&quot; stand that comes with it.  I still don&#x27;t see what this does.  It looks to me like the razor sheds most of your whiskers on your chest while shaving.  I still have to open the razor head occasionally and blow out whiskers.  The stand seems worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, there&#x27;s no need for preshave or after shave.  My skin isn&#x27;t the least bit irritated following a shave.  The documentation didn&#x27;t let me know that preshave was not supposed to be used.  I found out about that after doing some web surfing.  I assume it might damage the blades but who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re after a smooth shave and are willing to fork over some major change, this razor is a keeper.  You just have to learn to be a little more patient when shaving.</li>
    <li> Theis is the best electric razor I have ever used. While the cleaning system is a bit of a PITA, the razor itself works very well !</li>
    <li> I previously had a Norelco shaver for the longest and decided to get this Braun shaver. The downside of my Norelco was that it left my neck irritated no matter how gentle I was when shaving. Using this Braun is night and day compared to that. I get no irritation at all and a close shave. I love the cleaning system and base for it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a &amp;#34;Home Run&amp;#34; in the electric shaver category.  It&#x27;s the most comfortable shave my husband, age 83, has ever had.  His face looks great and he&#x27;s willing to use it daily.  Couldn&#x27;t think of a better combination.</li>
    <li> I brought this unit because of the lift and cut technology on a flat hair and good reviews that I saw.  Boy I was wrong.  I am very disappointed with the product. I never get a good close shave I always can feel the hair when I touch my face. I always have hair left on the face. I have to use razor to do final shave.  I am going to send it back to BRAUN for refund since they have 60 day money back guarantee.  Never another BRAUN again.  I was using Norelco which was much better than this $200 product.</li>
    <li> If your wondering how good of an electric razor this is. I will tell you that it shaves just as close as an actual razor. I was skeptical at first, all my previous electrics never gave me a close enough shave to please my platoon sgt. I had a sensitive neck while using a razor, I would get little blood spots that would bleed specks on the collor of my shirt being in a uniform would be a problem. This electric razor makes shaving a breeze and it cuts very close. My skin feels smooth and no irritation. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in a good electric shaver.</li>
    <li> great product, works with my skin</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used. I go so far as to say, it is even better than using a razor to shave with. I would recommend this for anyone. It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin which is important because I have very sensitive skin. It gives a close shave just as good as any razor( Gillette sensor, Quattro or anything else. The Braun series 790 is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver although it has some annoying design/feature aspects. It is a fine replacement for a broken older unit. If you are considering whether to upgrade a working shaver to the new model, I say no - save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE POSITIVE ASPECTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides a very good shave. Not much better, though, than an older series 8900 Braun. It does seem a bit smoother on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the shaver is narrower than older models and it is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quieter than older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display contains a multiple segment display to show battery charge. That seems to work well, although no better than the LED-based display on some older units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is terrible. What is the opposite of green - brown? Lots of Styrofoam and plastic. It could easily have been packed in cardboard that would be more green and easier to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no plastic cap to cover and protect the shaver heads. Older units had this. Why does this $200 top-of-the-line shaver lack it? Who knows. So if you want to keep the shaver in a drawer where it may get knocked a bit then you will have to keep it in the case. You can just partly zip the case and it will hold the shaver while still being easy to take out the shaver for use. But the case takes up more space in the drawer than would the shaver alone. Silly and annoying design choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with a hygienic cleaner and recharger stand. If you use it, it solves the storage with no plastic head cap issues above. BUT: The cleaner/recharger is about 4x5 inches (10 x 13 cm) at the base. It takes a lot of space on the sink top and needs to be plugged in using the shaver&#x27;s charger cord. It has a replaceable tank of liquid solution for hygienic cleaning. The tank lasts about one to two months according to the instruction manual. The refill costs $17.49 on Amazon. Are they crazy? Clean it either by rinsing the shaver head under hot water and drying it or by using the very small brush to clean the housing and shaking the head assembly on a paper towel. Recharge it with the recharger cord. Those instructions are also in the owner&#x27;s manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit&#x27;s LCD display also has a &#x27;hygiene&#x27; status display with multiple segments. According to the manual it indicates when the shaver is no longer clean and needs a cleaning in the above-mentioned cleaner stand. BUT: According to the manual the ONLY way to reset the hygiene display is to clean it with their expensive solution. The manual says that since cleaning with hot water is not as hygienic it will not reset the hygiene status display. AND once the shaver starts indicating on the LCD display that it needs a cleaning it will continue to blink at you. It seems the ONLY way to turn it off is to clean the shaver in their cleaner/recharger stand with their expensive cleaning solution. Pardon - this strikes me as a bit arrogant. I suppose a small piece of masking tape could hide the blinking display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a pop-up shaver for long hair - e.g. mustache or sideburn. It extends out a fairly good distance. But the pop-up shaver has a convex shape! It is curved outward in the center. Other than to look nice given the design of the shaver body this is a bit ridiculous. Shaving your sideburn is clearly easier with a flat-edged pop-up shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes - it is a very good replacement for a failed unit. But it has some annoying aspects. And it certainly seems to have no attraction as an upgrade to an otherwise-working unit. The 760cc still has a battery charge indicator but no cleaner, and the 720s lacks both the charge indicator and cleaner. If I were repurchasing I might look closely at the 760cc.g the shaver head under hot water and drying it or by using the very small brush to clean the housing and shaking the head assembly on a paper towel. Recharge it with the recharger cord. Those instructions are also in the owner&#x27;s manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit&#x27;s LCD display also has a &#x27;hygiene&#x27; status display with multiple segments. According to the manual it indicates when the shaver is no longer clean and needs a cleaning in the above-mentioned cleaner stand. BUT: According to the manual the ONLY way to reset the hygiene display is to clean it with their expensive solution. The manual says that since cleaning with hot water is not as hygienic it will not reset the hygiene status display. AND once the shaver starts indicating on the LCD display that it needs a cleaning it will continue to blink at you. It seems the ONLY way to turn it off is to clean the shaver in their cleaner/recharger stand with their expensive cleaning solution. Pardon - this strikes me as a bit arrogant. I suppose a small piece of masking tape could hide the blinking display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a pop-up shaver for long hair - e.g. mustache or sideburn. It extends out a fairly good distance. But the pop-up shaver has a convex shape! It is curved outward in the center. Other than to look nice given the design of the shaver body this is a bit ridiculous. Shaving your sideburn is clearly easier with a flat-edged pop-up shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes - it is a very good replacement for a failed unit. But it has some annoying aspects. And it certainly seems to have no attraction as an upgrade to an otherwise-working unit. The 760cc still has a battery charge indicator but no cleaner, and the 720s lacks both the charge indicator and cleaner. If I were repurchasing I might look closely at the 760cc.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shaver purchase. I attempted a lot of research on types of shavers rotary vs foil prior to purchase. So far this Braun gives a fairly close shave but does not get as close or long  lasting shave as my twin or triple blade manual razor. Convenience of not being in front of a mirror is a plus. Overall good performance.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Braun Shaver that I have owned.  This model by far provides the best shave.  In the past I would have to touch-up with a blade but I don&#x27;t need to do that anymore.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied,great shaver</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to my husband. He says it is the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
    <li> Quality at amazing price...</li>
    <li> Coming from a Braun 7526.  It lasted a month shy of either 8 or 9 years, hopefully this will have the same life.  Shave has be closer and smoother, but takes a few more strokes than the old one even on the highest setting.  Can&#x27;t tell much difference between the middle sensitivity to the one above and below, but switching between high and sensitive has been pleasant.  I&#x27;m still not settled on preference for the trimmer.  Old style slid out, versus this popping out to close to 90deg from the unit and ~.  Each has its pros and cons.  New model allows much more visabillty and the slightly slimmer trimmer head allows much more versatility, especially around the mustache area.  But the old style had more sheer cutting ability, could just use a full-size trimmer without a guard for that though if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning system and is improved, and the auto-drying feature is great for those \\&quot;oh, missed a spot\\&quot; sections if you find one after putting it away.</li>
    <li> When you have a 3-4 days old bristle to shave, you&#x27;re up for a nasty surprise/painful shaving experience. It feels like a shaver&#x27;s ripping out some of the hair from your face one by one. Rather stunned, as my old 8985 does that (maybe…) after not changing the blade and the foil for over two plus years...</li>
    <li> Great razor! Highly recommended by &amp;#34;The Electric Shaver Buying Guide&amp;#34;. Been using it since September 2013 and no complaints. The self cleaning feature is awesome and makes it maintenance free.</li>
    <li> This razor shave very clean, worth buying .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean degree and manual almost, but save time belt cleaning center is also very good with convenient</li>
    <li> This arrived fast and in good condition.  I’ve tried many different electric shavers &amp; haven’t found one that works better for me than the pulse.  Some cut too close, others take too long, this one does a good job in the shortest amount of time.  You can take extra time with it if you want a really close shave.</li>
    <li> Braun makes the best shavers!</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Came on time (one day only after shipping!)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using manual razors for some time but turns out that they are very expensive to replace heads every few months. Was almost paying the price of electric shaver for manual heads replacement in a year. Decided to buy electric shaver and did my research that ended up buying Braun 790cc. After a couple of uses, I believe that I made the right decision. I have a tough beard and was really afraid that the shaver will not be able to make a close shave on my neck. I can finish a complete shave in less than 5 minutes with this shaver. Also, the cleaning station is really good. You do not have to worry about cleaning, just put the shaver back to the startion and push a button and it will take care of cleaning, lubricating and drying the shaver and is ready for your next use. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best ever, I am on my third and got this as a replacement for my Dad for Fathers Day. He loves it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it, he is retired Navy and a very close shave is very important to him. This shaver is doing just what he wants. Thank you !!!!</li>
    <li> Obviously this is not for me. It was for my husband.  He has loved the Braun series and really loves the upgraded shaver since his old one finally died. (lasted a LONG time). It cleans, shaves, is chargeable, and give a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver was amazing the first time I used it.  It provided the best refreshing and smooth shaving experience and skin feel I have ever had in an electric shaver.  It felt like a precise medical instrument right off from the outset.  I would go home at lunch just to use it it again.  In the evening after work I could not wait to use it to clear off a half-day&#x27;s growth to make my skin smooth again.  At night, I set my alarm for various times to power it up just to experience the way it would smoothly glide across my face and skin.  It was like having a face massage with fingers made of smoothly pulsing and vibrating highly precise cool blades across your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; feeling mysteriously disappeared after the first week... maybe the blades were used and broken in.  Now, it&#x27;s just a good shave, a good shaver, feels good, does its job very well, but that first week excitement is gone. I no longer schedule special times to use it just to feel its precise sculpting of my skin.  However, it&#x27;s still the best electric shaver I ever owned, and I would recommend the shaver to anyone.  I just wish that new shaver experience would have lasted a longer time.</li>
    <li> Awesome for an electric razor, but still no match for your standard razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Shaves very close to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Awesome cleaning station&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Cartridges for the cleaning station don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;-Beard must be short for it to cut.&lt;br /&gt;-Gets hot if you use for over 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to shave your neck with.</li>
    <li> My father likes it very much!</li>
    <li> Shaves clean, easy to use, self cleaning IF you read the brochure and push the button when you want it to clean.  I used it on my husband for 2 months and wondered why it wasn&#x27;t shaving well any more.  I went back to the booklet and discovered the button I had never used!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY!! NICE</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price.</li>
    <li> My shaver has been a good purchase for the most part.  I am still trying to figure out how to get a close shave on every part of my face.</li>
    <li> Very good shave however thought it would be more powerful since it&#x27;s the high line of the shaving series.  Doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation</li>
    <li> Great razor! I upgraded from a 3 series that was several years old and this one is head and shoulders better than my previous one. definitely has stepped up its game. I do not like the way the beard trimmer works (hard to see what your trimming sometimes with the way it is set up from the main body of the razor) but that is a small price to pay for a great razor!</li>
    <li> Had a problem with the power cord, but, Amazon sent the replacement in no time. The shaver works well for a close shave.  It is a little noisier than my older Norelco rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> my husband absolutely loves this shaver!</li>
    <li> I shave my head every day. I have tried several (albeit much cheaper) products, and this razor gets the job done much more quickly and without the risk of cuts. I cannot say whether you can find something perhaps half its cost with the same quality, but I will say that this razor is in fact high quality. I feel as if it&#x27;s price is more a fault of the razor industry in general, but you should know that your $200+ will in fact be getting you something nice.</li>
    <li> Love this razor, skin feels smooth as silk without bumps!, Glad i finally decided to purchase it!!</li>
    <li> Husband did not like it. Expecting a different product</li>
    <li> This Razor does it all and the more you use it the better it gets!!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun shaver I have purchased. Love them both. The closest shave I have ever had with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The Braun 790 is a great electric shaver. I bought it to replace an aging Braun 7680 and Amazon had a nice price. I dropped to four stars because I found the trimmer was to hard to use. When trimming my beard and mustache the view is blocked the body of the shaver. I ended up returning it to Braun after using it for a week.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this razor, because it didn&#x27;t seem to give me a very good shave, but you have to get used to using this razor. Don&#x27;t get in a hurry trying to save fast, go slow at first shaving against the groth of you wiskers.  But the main thing about this razor is to keep it clean after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;If you keep it clean you will get a very good shave</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My husband loves it.  He has very sensitive skin, and this razor does not irritate his skin at all.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver that stays clean and charged.</li>
    <li> I was ordered a NEW shaver, but now came with the a Clean &amp; Renew one!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good price and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Great electric razor,  close as a Fusion 5 blade razor;  and no irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 68 now and have been using electric razors since my late teens. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had. These days I shave only twice a week, so when I do shave, it was a real challenge with my last shaver. This one mows them down with no problems. I clean the head once a week, and it does fine. I&#x27;ve had it long enough now to say that I don&#x27;t see any problem with the cutter efficiency dropping off rapidly or with too much cleaner consumption. I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Not any better then my norlco.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever used.  I bought one for my son for Christmas this year. It does not pinch or bite your face.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Braun Series 7 about five years ago. I fell in love with it. It gives the best shave I have ever had with an electric. For us older guys it takes care of those longer hairs that just seem to show up. I just bought my second shaver. Five years plus seemed like a deal, and the new one feels better than the old one. Just one thing wrong and that&#x27;s minor.  The trimmer is a royal pain to use. It&#x27;s just at an odd angle.  I say buy it regardless.</li>
    <li> It seems build quality has taken a back seat at Braun.  Razor arrived and cleaning station would not recognize, charge or clean razor.  Also AC adapter got red hot.  If I plugged the AC adapter straight into razor it charges and stays cool.  That&#x27;s quite disappointing for such an expensive razor.  Braun wanted to send it in for repairs which could take 2-3 weeks.  No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon replaced the razor with no problems and even upgraded the replacement to two day shipping.  Excellent customer service and a good reason why I continue to shop here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself the build quality feels immaculate and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying a shave, just sucks that the experience had to be hampered by a faulty cleaning station.  5 stars for amazon but 3 stars for the overall experience.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very expensive but it probably shaves closer than anything.  If you are looking for a top of the line shaver, look no further.</li>
    <li> First time in my life trying an electric razor and I was pleasantly surprised. Makes shaving time a lot cleaner and quicker. It doesn&#x27;t get every hair, especially around the neck area. But after a few passes it gets 99%. The trimmer function is pretty weak and doesn&#x27;t really clean up the sideburns. The trimmer blade has a slight curve to it and so it takes some time getting the proper results. Overall I am happy to get rid of the razor and cream.</li>
    <li> Last Braun Shaver I had for almost 10 years and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasantly surprised how smooth and close shaving this one is.&lt;br /&gt;Am pleased with Braun shavers and so far, well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Still new to the cleaning system but so far working well.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these.  One for myself and one for my son.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> Great product gives you a really really close shave had my other Braun for 5 years this was the replacement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m visually impaired so I needed an electric shaver. After doing some research, I have decided to purchase the Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System from Braun, and I&#x27;m glad I did! I love this shaver. It is made in Germany instead of China like most products you see these days, it give a very close shave and the clean and renew system works wonderfully. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the performance of the Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System from Braun!</li>
    <li> Hopefully, it will work well!!</li>
    <li> Loved the shaver but after a few months it started to leak oil. Thanks to Amazon a replacement was sent at no cost to me.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a new razor and wasn&#x27;t sure what was out there.  After some research, he settled in the new Braun since he has had good experiences with his past ones.  So far he is enjoying it. It came quick and I didn&#x27;t have to go to a bunch of stores looking for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned other good electric razors (norelco and an older braun), but this one is by far the best. I prefer using electric razors over the blades and shaving cream, and this one was the highest rated i&#x27;ve found. it&#x27;s a quality product that does a great job without irritating the skin. i&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and works like new. well done braun</li>
    <li> Very  good razor.  Shaves incredibly close. Even thick beards. Takes a few shaves to get your beard use to it.</li>
    <li> Great for first month.</li>
    <li> I was using the Series 5, and the battery started to give out, so I ordered the Series 7. IMO the Series 7 cuts much better and quicker. I have a thick beard, and the new razor takes it off in 1/3 the time. Not inexpensive, but it does a very good job. Note that the old cutter head and foil cap have been replaced with a all in one part. It looks more complicated... but it works.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for head shaver for years and after reading Braun 7-790cc reviews from here I decided to give it a try. I am happy and shocked with the result, It completely shaved my head and no itchy or bumps after shaving. I can&#x27;t wait to shave again. Tip- since cleaning catrdiges are expensive dont throw away the lid away, when done shaving cover the catridge with a lid and store somewhere safe. Since alohol evaporates over time this technique might prolong your cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> The worst purchase I have ever made.  It does almost NOTHING! A huge waste of money.  I can&#x27;t believe they are allowed to sell this.</li>
    <li> Okay...FANTASTIC shaver!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Braun 7680 for 15 years now. Loved the shaver but after 15years its battery just doesn&#x27;t hold up anymore (even when fully charged doesn&#x27;t provide enough juice to fully power the shaver.) Time for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Wife saw a Philips Norelco 9400 on sale at COSTCO and bought it for me.....after 2 months I gave up on that shaver. It&#x27;s not a terrible shaver but just couldn&#x27;t hold a candle to my OLD one.&lt;br /&gt;Fastforward to now....purchased this Braun Series 7 - 790cc from Amazon. OMG!!!! the difference between this shaver and the Norelco are Night and Day!!!!!  Firstly the Norelco never did feel well made to me (never felt like it could/would last 10 years or even 7 years, let alone the 15 years of my previous Braun). This Braun Series 7 - 790cc feels exceptionally well made. Even my wife was like &amp;#34;oh yeah...wow...it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap&amp;#34; Everything about the BRAUN just feels and works better!!!! And the shave.....wow....from day ONE it was doing a better job than the Norelco did after giving it 2 months for my face to adjust (Norelco&#x27;s manual recommends 6 weeks i believe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAUN makes exceptionally nice shavers.....that&#x27;s just all there is to it.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had this product and I tried it once and immediately ordered one for myself. Easy to clean and really gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> Not as close a shave as expected.  I don&#x27;t know if its because I went from a rotary to a foil shaver and just need more time.  It&#x27;s a bit loud too.  I like the self cleaning.  Some reviews complain about the cost of the refills.  The razor smells fresh with each use.</li>
    <li> Got sick of paying for disposable razors&lt;br /&gt;close shave no rash cleans itself&lt;br /&gt;not cheap but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;no more cuts on face</li>
    <li> my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t even need to wait for 5 o&#x27;clock for his shadow to appear so this works wonders on his sensitive skin to be able to shave every day, great results, I even bought a second cassette for my personal use (under arms and legs) so we don&#x27;t use the same blade (eww that&#x27;s like using the same toothbrush to me)</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this shaver. It shaves nearly as close as a blade and couldn&#x27;t imagine shaving with a razor ever again.</li>
    <li> Did not give any better shave than old series 3, replaced shaving head and screen, no improvement, now screen has broken edges making comfortable shaving impossible.  Cleaning station too bulky to carry on trips, did not seem to clean any better than using brush and washing under hot water, unnecessary expense</li>
    <li> The razor works great and gets into all the problem areas.  I have not had this close a shave since using a blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers off and on for years but always revert back ti the &amp;#34;blade and shaving cream&amp;#34;.  I was looking forward to this one maybe being a better choice.  I use it once or twice a week and my &amp;#34;manual razor&amp;#34; once or twice a week.  The Braun leaves some stubble but gets it all about the same, just not slick and smooth as a blade.</li>
    <li> Shaves take twice as long and they are never smooth. My old one was 12 years old and did a better job. I would have kept it but the battery was dying and the chrome had worn off. This model...PASS!</li>
    <li> It is a joy to shave with this razor.  The auto-clean function works so well that you&#x27;ll think that you are shaving with a brand new razor.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly thankful, &amp; happy! This processs was beyond outstanding. Plus, this product is Great! I bought a Series 5 so many years ago, this is why I bought another Braun. These Elec. Razors are outstanding. Thanks Again!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear your face up! All other razors I&#x27;ve tried we&#x27;re cheap and didn&#x27;t last long! I&#x27;m extremely happy with my Braun!</li>
    <li> Cleaning system works great, with a nice refreshing shave after placing It into its Excalibur-like base after use.  Gets a bit expensive if you shave often and clean often (cleaning units only last a month or so), but they really do a superb job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is a dream- once you learn to do it correctly, the Braun Series 7 feels as if it&#x27;s clearing your scruff closely with little robot kisses. Lockable head enables you the focus on a particular spot that&#x27;s not shaving easily.  Charge appears to last a very long time-- I&#x27;ve never brought it close to empty, and the convenient LCD readout keeps me apprised of power and hygiene status. Feels like you&#x27;re holding a solid piece of German engineering in the palm of your hand that will last awhile.</li>
    <li> Have owned (1) Braun, (2) Norelco in the past 30 years, my most recent Norelco 1260x 3D died from an electric issue.  Deciding which to purchase now was fairly easy.  After purchasing replacement Heads for 1260x a little more than a year ago for approximately $40.00 and seeing the present day (ridiculous) price [almost $200.00],  Philips has ran me  off as a purchasing customer for the umpteenth time on this product and other products that they acquired thru buy-outs.  Reading the reviews for Braun 7 790cc here on Amazon and other website testing/reviews, considered Panasonic shavers but going by the OLD SAYING &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve bought this Braun 7 790cc and so far it is great.</li>
    <li> Would have preferred the return of this unit after first use, but return instructions stated &amp;#34;this item was not eligible for return&amp;#34;. Did not get the close shave I wanted with the Braun and had to resort to my manual razor to get the job done.</li>
    <li> A great electric shaver. Much better than the old ones I used about 10 years ago.  Still not as close as a razer, but I&#x27;ll be using this 90% of the time because it&#x27;s a little more convenient.</li>
    <li> if you never used an electric razor you&#x27;ll love this one...works great as they say &amp;#34;try it you&#x27;ll like it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Quality construction and operation.  Thorough and efficient cleaning system.  Compared to a blade, still takes longer to shave than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic electric razor. I previously had a Braun 390cc from the mid 2000s and the battery was finally shot. I was able to score a Philips Norelco 9300 on promotion but was hugely disappointed with that shaver. The build quality was subpar for such an expensive shaver and the cleaning station was a disaster (software bugs made it clean endlessly for hours and hours). I returned it and got the Braun 790cc. I should&#x27;ve got this to begin with...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The Braun has taken a turn for the worse. My Series 7 has made two trips to the repair depot because the cleaning station incorrectly senses the fluid level and thinks it&#x27;s empty, when it is not. It refuses to run a cleaning cycle if it senses the fluid level is empty. Braun service replaces the cleaning station but, based on the numerous complaints online, it is clear to me that this is a fundamental engineering issue with the Series 7 and not an isolated case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement foils are now very hard to find and prohibitively expensive. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider investing in a new foil/cutter block because my Series 7 will soon be out of warranty. My feedback for Braun&#x27;s engineering team would be to go back to basics and get rid of the complex electronic crap that breaks down and the customer won&#x27;t be able to fix once it&#x27;s out of warranty. You have lost a loyal customer.and the alcohol based formula leaves the shaver head sanitized and oil-free. I found the fresh lemon scent Braun uses to smell better than the cheap cologne scent Philips uses in the Norelco cartridges. I appreciate that after 10 minutes the lights on the cleaning station turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect this shaver to last as long as my old 390cc. Overall I&#x27;m very happy and will remain a loyal Braun customer so long as they continue to produce great quality electric shavers.</li>
    <li> Shaves very smooth and very quickly&lt;br /&gt;I wish I bought it sooner, but had to wait for a sale.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with the Braun brand of shaver.  I get a much closer shave than my previous brand of electric shaver, that I used for many years.  I think the Braun gives a better shave for me than using a safety razer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system makes a lot of noise but is very effective.  To soon to after purchase to comment on the cost of replacement cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever purchase it was worth the money</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shaver I have ever used.  I kept my old Braun way too long.  The new independently flexing heads feel great.  It gives the smoothest, cleanest and most comfortable shave I have experienced.  The new trimmer design is a little more awkward to work with but you get used to it quickly.  I also like the fact I can use my remaining cleaner refills with the newly designed base.</li>
    <li> This razor made me shave more often, so comfortable and every shave with like brand new razor !&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning solution seem to last very long, over a month</li>
    <li> It does a great job. Face left real smooth</li>
    <li> I am an African American man who has very sensitive skin which I tend to get razor bumps, ingrown hairs and razor burn after I shave. I have tried everything from depilatories, trimmers, and rotary shavers. The reviews for the Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver were the best of any other foil shaver on the market.  What the heck, I gave it try.  I was lucky to get this shaver on sale plus a $40.00 additional coupon.  I let my beard grow out for about 2 days before I decided to shave with the Braun Series 7-790.  This shaver rocks.  I used the next to the highest setting on the shaver which helped me achieve an almost perfect shave.  I had to stretch my skin slightly to get all the stubborn neck hairs. I didn&#x27;t get any irritation from the shaver, plus my face felt as though I had just shaved with a Gillette Mach 3 razor.  If you are someone with sensitive skin, please give the Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver a try.</li>
    <li> best cleanest shave with an electric i&#x27;ve ever had but it still isn&#x27;t a blade shave...</li>
    <li> Super great  out standing better than a blade Better the my old 5 years old Braun. its true .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for a little more than a year, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I don&#x27;t think it really saves me any time, and it&#x27;s never shaved me as close as a blade, but it works well.  I like how it cleans itself and recommends the replacement of certain parts that are readily available to keep it shaving like it&#x27;s new year after year.  I bought this on the recommendation of my father in law who has used this type of shaver for a lot of years and even handed them down to his sons.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver, but you will find yourself dependent on the auto-cleaner cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t they make cartridges that are reusable?</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had! It exceeded by far my expectations. The self cleaning and charging station works perfectly. The shave is smooth and comfortable even on the max setting. I&#x27;ve had 3 Norelco top of the line because I thought they were the best. Dumb me. I threw all 3 of them away. Took forever to shave and never got better than just to the point where you needed to shave. The floating heads with 3 blades wouldn&#x27;t stay on the razor. There is nothing holding them on except a plastic snap on. Garbage! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new Braun.</li>
    <li> Excellent! packaging perfect. works fantastic ! my husband loves it :)</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this new shaver.  I have found nothing to complain or improve.  It shaves so close, it is truly amazing.  The cleaning cycle indicators give me information about when to make it feel and work like new.  I have had it for a month and the cleaning cartridge is still full, even when I use it to clean every other day.</li>
    <li> Good razor at a really good price. Shaves close and smooth with no burn.&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes are that you need to have your chin/face over the sink as you shake because it drops alot of the shavings straight down.&lt;br /&gt;Also the power cord for the base is too short.</li>
    <li> Working great. No skin irritation like ones I used in past. Happy with purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my older Braun and this new razor is simply the best one I have ever owned. Light, yet sturdy it delivers a great shave and seemingly in less time. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This shaver paid for it self the 1st year hubby has not had to run out and buy blades or red skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Very close, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;NO razor burn!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Well balanced easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;I Don&#x27;t use the side trimmer.</li>
    <li> Just great machine I love it</li>
    <li> A good razor but would not have purchased if I had known Braun was a P&amp;G owned company now.</li>
    <li> My previous Braun Saver lasted 7 years before it fell apart and gave a great shave, this one is even better and I hoping with the same or longer longivity. I highly recommend Braun 7-790 for it&#x27;s close shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver because of my past experience with Braun Shavers.  This shaver is just as good as my past shaver and I would recommend this shaver to others.</li>
    <li> All other shavers are obsolete now.  this thing is smooth and wow does it work well.  Best money spent in a while.</li>
    <li> Good job, clean like a manual razor!!! Great building quality!  German Style!&lt;br /&gt;Good job, clean like a manual razor!!! Great building quality!  German Style!</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun clean and charge razor.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent，A close shave!Worthy of trust.&lt;br /&gt;Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver</li>
    <li> I own a Pulsonic 9000 (9596) Braun shaver, and when turned on side by side the 790cc is QUIETER! It also somehow feels lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new foil has larger holes (What they now call Optifoil) for an easier shave, and out of the box it effortlessly gave me a smoother shave. I did not even have to apply any pressure for it to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I only wished I did not have to unplug the charger/cleaning unit manually - an on off switch would have been great.</li>
    <li> this is a Yule gift and so I do no tknow how it works but the delvery was awesome. thanks</li>
    <li> I think this is very good, and the price is right.Shaving feel relatively comfortable.But the sound is relatively large.I love it.</li>
    <li> Individual needs,and use effect is very good,5 star praise.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends,tells website that they purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I never have this experience with very smooth shaving experience, and also the price for this shaving system is very good</li>
    <li> I had an older 5 series (I think) and it seems the clippers on that were a little better. I will say that the shaving part is much better, really love the system</li>
    <li> My husband says he has always been satisfied with the Braun products.  He says it gives him a good shavel</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years.  I was really surprised at the much closer shave I got with this Braun model.  I also like the automatic cleaning system and charger.</li>
    <li> Over the past (better than) half-century I&#x27;ve had Norelco&#x27;s, Remington&#x27;s, and an array of others and ALWAYS gone back to blades...Not this time. No pulling, no irritation, just a good close shave without the cutting and bleeding !</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot left out of the edging mechanism but the razor seems to lift the hairs on my face and cut them pretty good. I&#x27;m still judging how well it shaves my neck hairs. I&#x27;ve only used it twice. It could be a bit better than the 360 I own but the 360&#x27;s edging blade is better.</li>
    <li> I did not expect this razor work for me.  I made sure that the receipt and original packaging were in a safe place, because I was fully prepared to send it back before the 60 day trial period expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cursed with a very heavy beard AND very sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve seen two dermatologists in my life, and they both advised me to grow a beard and to give up on any hope of finding an electric razor that would give me a halfway decent shave.  I&#x27;m stubborn (and I can&#x27;t tolerate beards), so I&#x27;ve tried electric razors every two years or so over the last 20 years, looking for an electric that might work.  They have always been returned (with varying degrees of ease, depending on the manufacturer and the truthfulness of their guarantees).  In order to get a decent shave with a razor, I must press hard enough to take off the top two layers of skin and slowly enough to avoid cutting myself or causing any ingrown hairs.  It was a slow, painful process that I could only really endure about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to give another electric a shot, and the Braun Series 7 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System got the best reviews for shavers under $300.  The instructions say to use the razor for two or three weeks to give your skin time to adjust to an electric shaver.  I thought this was just a ploy to trick people into not returning the razor in time to take advantage of the guarantee... it&#x27;s not.  The first two or three shaves weren&#x27;t great.  The next few were a little better.  After about a week, I was stunned to find that I just given myself the first quick, effective and PAINLESS shave of my life.  Maybe it just took me a few days to figure out how to use it properly, or maybe they were telling the truth and your skin really does need to adjust.  It doesn&#x27;t matter, I LOVE THIS RAZOR!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now able to shave every day, even on weekends (a luxury I just figured I would never enjoy).  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and I could not be happier with it.  The cleaning system is nice, but only use it two or three times a week.  I figure that even with changing the cassette every 18 months and replacing the cleaning fluid every month, I&#x27;m still going to be spending less than I did on blades.  Even if it did cost more, it would be worth it for a FAST, SMOOTH shave that I can enjoy EVERY DAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that the trimmer feature is not great, but I don&#x27;t imagine any built-in trimmer attachment could do a truly effective job.  I&#x27;m still learning how to shave around my sideburns without getting them uneven, but there is a learning curve with anything.  I cannot recommend this shaver highly enough, especially if you have a heavy beard and never thought you would get to enjoy a comfortable shave.pier with it.

    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Great close shave with little effort, holds charge for weeks and consistantly fast reverberations even when on low charge, cleaning station really cleans and lubricates unit, nice storage pouch for travel, good indicators (except the hygene one is inaccurate, goes empty after 2 shaves).&lt;br /&gt;Cons: would like the unit to trap shaved hairs better.  Unit needs opening and shaking out after each shave or it will leak hairs. The trimmer is ackward.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase and will purchase more when needed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, he loves it. Had the 7 series before, loved that also. Gave that one to my son.</li>
    <li> It is a fine shaver but I did not find it to be an upgrade from my 6 years old shaver. I had to return.&lt;br /&gt;Buying experience from amazon was the worse ever.&lt;br /&gt;Two major problems:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should have stated clearly in product description that is it not returnable. You have to return it to Braun! that includes phone calls, paper work and a long wait for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Second was shipping. I paid for shipping and did not take the free shipping hoping to get it sooner. Well it took 2 weeks to receive it, so paying for shipping was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Bed Bath and Beyond had it for the same price. So I could have got it same day without the hassle. I should have searched local stores before buying online.</li>
    <li> I have had several Braun and Panasonic razors over the past 20 years; this is clearly the best.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This shaver really works great, good smooth shave every time. i have always liked Braun shavers i would recomend this shaver to anyone looking for quality but the trimmer does take a little getting use to.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun 7000 Series for over 10 years and have toyed with the idea of upgrading to the Series 7 for several of those years.  Having finally made the jump, I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed.  this unit gives me a far cleaner shave than the 7000 and doesn&#x27;t have the same tendency to miss certain parts of my beard.  Count me as a believer!</li>
    <li> The best shaver. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It pays to pay a little more.  Cheap shavers get tossed so fast, or put on a shelf, that you might as well spend the extra for great quality and a great shave.  This is according to the two men I gifted with this.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> If you ever want to buy an electric shaver, this is the one to buy.  I&#x27;ve never had as good a shave and love the self cleaning.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver met all of my expectations. I like the cleaning function, the adjustable shaving head, and the comfort of the shaves.</li>
    <li> been buying cheap to medium price shavers for years, this is like driving a Corvette instead of a yugo. Great product</li>
    <li> A worthy successor to my veteran old Braun.  The little hygiene and power indicators aren&#x27;t all that helpful, but the shave is very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been a Norelco user for 40 years, and was thinking about getting a new one.  I read the reviews of new shavers; wasn&#x27;t impressed with reports of Norelco durability and customer service.  Folks who&#x27;d bought the Braun liked it, so I decided to try it.  After a month of use, I&#x27;d say those folks were right: it&#x27;s a pleasure to use, and I&#x27;m getting a smoother shave than ever before.  The cleaning/charging stand works great, and the refills, which apparently last a month or two depending on frequency of use, can be had for $5 - $7 if you shop around: not bad.  If this Braun lasts 10 years, like my old Norelco, I&#x27;ll be well pleased.</li>
    <li> Every few years for the last 30 years, I&#x27;ve had this urge to buy my husband an electric shaver for his birthday and, each time, he&#x27;s gone around for a couple months with razor burn before swearing off electric shavers forever and going back to disposable blades (which also give him razor burn - he apparently has terribly sensitive skin).  This time, I researched for days before deciding on this model, and we&#x27;re both a little bit stunned.  On the very first use, with no acclimation, he got an incredibly close shave with absolutely no irritation to his skin. It&#x27;s been a couple weeks now, and he just loves this thing. Instead of putting off shaving for as long as possible, he&#x27;s like a kid with a new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the cleaning function sounded a little gimmicky, but it turns out to be another fantastic feature for guys like my husband who tend to be lax about maintaining their tools.  There&#x27;s no need for any manual cleaning at all, the charging base does the cleaning and lubricating with the touch of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus, for us, is that the charging/cleaning base is smaller than the 6.3\\&quot; x 6.3\\&quot; dimensions cited here: I have exactly 6\\&quot; of depth in my medicine cabinet and this unit fits inside perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works Well still getting used to adjusting the pulse strength.</li>
    <li> Love hate relationship. Love the shaver... hate the beard trimmer it&#x27;s only about 1 inch wide......I maintain a close cropped beard, shaved neck, this trimmer is way to small. Additionally the trimmer is slightly rounded? why? So....even less than one inch touches you face. I bought the Braun Series 3, love it and the beard trimmer is about 3 inches wide and flat.</li>
    <li> This shaver met my expectations.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for a long time because they give me the closest shave possible with an electric.  Before I got this one I was using the Braun 8595 and was very happy with it. I used it for 5 or 6 years and it finally stopped holding a charge.  I found a refurbished 8595 on Amazon and had been using it until I dropped the cleaning unit which broke from the fall.  I started looking for the latest Braun and found a great deal for the Series 7-790cc on Amazon about a month ago and have been using it ever since. It gives an incredibly close shave and the cleaning system makes it feel new every time I use it.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a close shave with an electric</li>
    <li> I replaced an 8595 braun that was failing to shave properly.  I just thought maybe my hair had turned to a hardened steel or titanium because my old shaver that shaved great a year ago would just not go through the hair, even after replacing the foil and cutter twice.  As I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain and pulling anymore I opted to purchase another and was glad to find out it was not me.  This shaver seams to do better then I remember my 8595 doing when it was new.  I am glad I upgraded.</li>
    <li> Having not used an electric shaver for about  20 years I figured it was time to try out the new technology. It took some getting familiar with especially under the nose area as I still have some difficulty shaving this area well. This shaver gives a closer shave than I had anticipated but also takes many more passes. I thought I would be saving time from using my sensor excel but was greatly mistaken. On average I guess it takes me 10 minutes to shave well with this shaver vs the 5 minutes it took with my disposable razors. It feels well made it is slightly awkward to hold. I am surprised at the level of noise which is a bit annoying and made my 18 month old cry when she walked into the bathroom while I was shaving. While overall I do like this shaver I am not as amazed as I expected to be with the 20 years of technological  advancement since my last electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Even better and quieter than my previous Braun Series 7 shaver.</li>
    <li> My first electric razor, I think it shaves smoother than a straight razor. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to go electric.</li>
    <li> it is a present to my father&lt;br /&gt;and he likes it very much&lt;br /&gt;i think it is easy to use to an old man</li>
    <li> I usually try to put effort into my reviews, but what can I say that isn&#x27;t already posted?&lt;br /&gt;Excellent close shave without the irritation I used to have with my cheapie Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system leaves the razor dry and the cleaning solution leaves a pleasant faint lemon scent.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the humongous base station - I have to keep mine in my bedroom because the base station consumes my bathroom sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this razor and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Husband feels it&#x27;s pricey, but works well so far... Had it a little over a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah</li>
    <li> unfortunately I had to return this item as it didn&#x27;t work as promised. I wasn&#x27;t getting the clean-shave I hoped for. The positive side is that the return process worked flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Works well , even on tuff facial hair. Easy to use , self cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First electric razor  I&#x27;ve used that comes close to a blade.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor!Because of work, was received today!He looks very high-end, like it!Comfortable shave feeling.As the shaving is a pleasure!Men should have something!</li>
    <li> After researching this razor and several others I decided to purchase this one. There are two things that make this a great option. The first is reading the instructions. After doing this I discovered that in order to shave the neck and chin (the area that all razors fail in) there are two adjustments that can be made to make this razor work, and it does. The reason I got rid of my last electric was the smell of &#x27;Lectric shave. After some research I found Lab Series pre-shave. It has very little sent and works well it is also the second reason I purchased this razor. It will take two weeks for your face to adjust to this razor completely. After that it will be the best shave you can get. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Long lasting power and precision - outstanding purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. I had a previous Braun which belonged to my father. I used it for several years until it conked out. This model is even better in every respect. A great shave and long-lasting charge.</li>
    <li> First shaver lasted over 10 years. This looks like it will do the same.</li>
    <li> It is  OK！ I  like it !  give  my  baby  ！ YES  ！Speed quickly, but it&#x27;s a bit expensive！Still can buy next time</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband.  The razor is a bit of a disappointment after all the rating I had seen.  It does not shave as closely as his old Norelco Spectra 8883 XL, is very noisy, and was expensive.  I would not purchase this razor again.</li>
    <li> I had all but given up on finding an electric shaver that actually worked so I was back to the Mach 5. I figured I&#x27;d be bound to a Mach 32 by the time I could ever switch but the cost of the Mach blades forced me to take another look. A friend told me he used the Braun Series 7 and that I should try it so I did. I&#x27;ve had it now for about a month and I love it. I get a quick, close shave anytime I need it. I don&#x27;t need to worry about cuts especially with a couple of mole&#x27;s on my face. If you have one and have ever cut it you know how difficult it is to stop bleeding. I am done with razors. Way to go Braun!</li>
    <li> + Good shaving result&lt;br /&gt;+ smooth&lt;br /&gt;+ not irritating skin&lt;br /&gt;- noisy&lt;br /&gt;# # # # # # # #</li>
    <li> I used a Braun 8585 for several years and I remember it doing a pretty good job.  People complained about the newer foils and/or cutters, so I took their advice and stuck to the older ones.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a less expensive shaver that could be cleaned using water at the beginning of 2011.  I went with the Panasonic ES8103S.  It seemed like it took longer to get a close shave than it did with the 8585, but I could get a very close dry shave in 10 minutes or less.  The Panasonic had poor battery life and a poor trimmer.  The battery life declined from lasting 4-5 shaves to 3 in around a year, but it did actually shave my face pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 7 is easily the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It has good battery life and the trimmer seems like it will hold up for a while.  As far as design goes, it&#x27;s great.  Those are the only reasons it gets 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried shaving for much over 10 minutes, but I still haven&#x27;t gotten a close shave out of this razor in the 2 1/2 months that I&#x27;ve had it.  I don&#x27;t shave in front of a mirror.  I never have with an electric and it&#x27;s never been a problem.  I&#x27;ve noticed that this shaver misses the area immediately below my sideburns, the area on the side of my jaw under my ear, and it&#x27;s terrible above the lip and on the neck.  I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow within about 3 hours of shaving.  I&#x27;ve tried concentrating on areas to see if they get any smoother and that doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference, especially above the lip.  I&#x27;ve also tried using the different speeds.  I can&#x27;t tell much difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how this is the highest rated shaver on the market according to the research I did.  It might work well for people with thinner beards, but it is relatively ineffective for someone with a medium to thick beard.  The Panasonic I tried is well under half the price of this one and it does its job.  Buy a separate trimmer, if necessary, and charge it twice/week instead of once and you&#x27;ll get a far superior shave.rior shave.</li>
    <li> This Razor works great. The cost is a little high but well worth it. I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> The product is very well, and the package is so well! Everything is good over my expectation. It can be used as a good gift!!</li>
    <li> Love this razor. I agree with the majority of the folks who have reviewed this product and given it rave reviews. So I wont spend any of your time rehashing what others have already told you. Having had this model for a couple years and an earlier 7 series model for about 10 years, I have discovered a few tricks along the way that I thought that I would pass along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: This is the most important thing when it comes to these shavers. I used to replace the cutters frequently on my old 7 Series. Once I started doing a better job of cleaning the shaver head, I found that they lasted for years and gave much better results (See tips below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of Shave: I get great results from this shaver. I have what I would consider to be a fairly normal beard. The hair is not too thick nor too fast growing. I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow a few hours after shaving like some people do. So I think that it&#x27;s pretty hard to say that this shaver or any other is going to perform well for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips that I hope will be helpful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I find that the best way to clean the razor is using compressed air. I have a small air compressor in the garage and I blow out the shaver head once a month. The shaver will feel like new again. I know that the average person may not have a compressor... But if you do, this is the very best way to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Always clean the razor head before you use the Clean &amp; Renew system. If you don&#x27;t, the reservoir can become pretty disgusting.I know it sounds crazy to say clean the shaver before you clean it... What I really mean is to remove the excess debris. Tap the base of the saver head on a hard surface and poke around with the brush that comes with the shaver to remove the as much of the hair as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You can find pretty good prices on Amazon for the Clean and Renew replacement cartridges... But it&#x27;s still not a cheap date. Like the cartridges in an ink jet printer, the liquid will evaporate and you will have to frequently replace them. A neat trick that I have found can really reduce the frequency of replacement. New cartridges have plugs that have to be removed when installed. I now keep the plugs. I insert the cartridge, clean the razor, and then remove the cartridge and put the plugs back in. This prevents evaporation and greatly extends the life of the cartridge. In addition, evaporation concentrates the yucky residue. So preventing evaporation tends to keep the solution cleaner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. When it comes to the quality of the shave... I have never had a better shave from an electric razor. That being said, I would agree with some reviews that state that the Pulsonic does not handle an extra day&#x27;s growth as well as the older Braun models. I find it helps to make a first pass without pressing the razor tightly to the skin and then go back and do the finish cut so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this info helps perspective buyers.t printer, the liquid will evaporate and you will have to frequently replace them.

    <li> I just printed out my return sip to send this electric razor back to Braun. Real quick, here&#x27;s what I found to be the issue and the advantages of this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;--I thought after years of using a disposable razor, I would try out an electric one: convenience, cost, efficiency, less nicks...etc.&lt;br /&gt;--I thought I would purchase a &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; electric razor, knowing that if I didn&#x27;t like this one, well, I would probably not like the other ones&lt;br /&gt;--The problems: charging unit light is so BRIGHT (too bright for a bedroom); there is no way to get to all the spots on my hairy face; useless when wanting to trim neck hairs (unlike a razor, that I can anywhere on my body); when it came in contact with my sideburns, it would &#x27;pull&#x27; the hair(s) it came in contact with (meaning I had to place my finger as close to the hair line of my sideburns, and trim as close as I dare.

    <li> Great shaving experience.  Long battery life.  I can use for 2 weeks with one full charge</li>
    <li> its best razor its very easy&lt;br /&gt;Auto cleaning - I love the cleaning station from Braun series 7 790 cc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and also very fast ship</li>
    <li> i hated to shave before this system.  now i used it nearly every day.  i love the cleaning system, makes it feel brand new everytime i use it and the cleaning cartridges last a long time even using it everytime i shave. plus over the holidays they had a price special running on amazon, what a deal!  i will never go back to regular razors ever!</li>
    <li> Have used it for a couple of weeks and it has done a great job.  I would recommend it for aperson that wants a electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I tried Norelco years ago and it just irritated my face so much I didn&#x27;t stick with it and went back to a razor.  The Braun is so comfortable I have skipped aftershave several times and my face is very sensitive.  I am actually getting a closer shave than with a blade and honestly I don&#x27;t know if it is because I am taking more care and time with the electric or maybe it is because I don&#x27;t have to shave in a foggy mirror.  I don&#x27;t know why exactly but the closer shave is the truth.</li>
    <li> I cannot exaggerate how difficult it is for me to shave.  I would grow a beard but when you are old the white/gray makes you (me) look much older.  Plus my wife won&#x27;t let me!!!:)  This is the 1st shaver i have ever used that is good enough to have only one pass over my stiff beard without leaving me sore most of the day.  The cleaning station works great.  I have a Norelco if you want me to sent it to you:)  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not enjoying this product.  If you do not have sensitive skin you can easily get a shave as good as any blade.</li>
    <li> Just spent the past 30 minutes on the phone with Amazon, only to reach a very rude supervisor who span off into a belittling tone (which I had not used with her) while spitting clerical responses at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me rewind a bit and explain why I&#x27;m frustrated, but also why I rated this as 5 stars. My very kind sister bought this for me as a Christmas gift about a month ago while I was in France. Unfortunately, I am looking for a rotating blade razor, so I thought \\&quot;no problem, it&#x27;s Amazon, I&#x27;ll just exchange it for the one I want.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From all of the reviews, it seems like this must be a darn good razor, hence the 5 stars (after all, it&#x27;s not Braun&#x27;s fault that Amazon hires rude representatives). But, basically because of some hazardous materials asterisk when my sister was purchasing it, they&#x27;re refusing to exchange it, making me become an INDEPENDENT RESELLER just to get a gift that fits my needs. The killer was that a \\&quot;hazardous materials representative\\&quot; told me that if I had \\&quot;moved faster,\\&quot; they&#x27;d have taken it back--but I wasn&#x27;t even in the country!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my bottom line is, unless you&#x27;re 100% sure with all your heart that you want this, just buy it from your local Walmart ([...]) or whatever superstore you prefer. That way, you can always exchange your unopened item if you come across something more fitting (or even decide a day later that you want an electric toothbrush instead!). Isn&#x27;t that something you should be able to expect for an unopened item?</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about two months. The cleaning system is nice but it is having trouble shaving my mustache area which I think it the easiest compared to the neck area. Felt it was not as good as the previous made in Germany shavers. Little disappointed considering the price.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I had an earlier Braun model (5 series) that was starting to act up (mostly, I suspect, because it had been dropped multiple times!). I&#x27;ve tried the rotary shavers with limited success and was considering going back to blades, but thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. I&#x27;ve never had a smoother shave. Rivals the blades.</li>
    <li> I quit my razor after receiving the Bran Series 7-790cc over a year ago.  I get the closest shave.  No more cuts or skin irritation or missed stub.  The washer system is also good.  I run the washer once a week and clean-out the shaver by hand once a month.  This saves on cartrage fluid.  By conserving on washes to once a week, the fluid cartrage lasts about 4 to 5 months, and then needs replacement.  Be sure to buy at least an extra 1 or 2 cartrages.</li>
    <li> My husband said shaved very clean, very like the style and function relatively well,Detail inside the razor is very detailed, really very nice, hoping for relatively long point</li>
    <li> I suppose there might be better ones out there, but this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  And it makes cleaning/recharging stupid simple.  I&#x27;m really pleased with this after three months of use.  Sure, it takes longer to get as close a shave as a good safety razor allows, but you don&#x27;t risk nicking yourself and you don&#x27;t have to be wide awake to do a good job.  I can shave in the morning in a semi-comatose state before showering.  The instructions recommend that you shave *before* showering which is counter to everything that I had ever heard or read before, but it works pretty darn good.!</li>
    <li> I was using a $40 Remington foil shaver for the past 5 years....thinking that I was getting a good shave.  Boy was I wrong.  Believe the hype......the Braun is head and shoulders above the cheapo shavers.  I only use the cleaner once every other shave......and re-cover the cleaning fluid after use to avoid excess evaporation.  So far, I could not be happier with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Just buy it. It is reliable and does a great job!</li>
    <li> More than met my expectations.  Fast comfortable and close.</li>
    <li> WOW THIS IS GREAT, MY FIRST ELECTRIC SHAVER... I GUESS I GOT THE BEST ?</li>
    <li> fast shipping and a top of the line product.  This model requires use of a cleaning system which I like but some may find cumbersome.  It does a great job shaving even the most difficult angles like next to the nose.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older Braun with this one. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Ordered this Braun Shaver for my hubby.  He LOVES it!  Closest shave he has had in a long time.  Would definitely order again from Braun!</li>
    <li> My husband just loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my older Braun 8000 series shaver.  This one is quite an improvement.  The shave is closer and the battery lasts longer.  The only issue that I had was that the beard trimmer is a little smaller.  I find it tougher to trim sideburns straight with it.</li>
    <li> First I am a little bias as this is my 2nd Braun shaver with the last one lasting about 7 years with 2 head replacements. I must say that it gives a very close shave for an electric shaver and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive facial area sore or irritated in any way. I know it may seem expensive but if you consider razor prices and that you will be using this almost every day of your life it is more than worth it! Close shave, no irritation and self cleaning is huge. The only thing I wish it had was a place to put the little brush for manual cleaning as they are easily lost. Plus I personally liked the way I could self clean my old one to help the cleaning cartridges last longer this one does not have that feature which can be good if you are lazy or bad if you are cheap and like to save where you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - Best Electric Shaver I have ever used and have been recommending it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Martha bought this shaver system for me and it is the best shave I ever had.  My only problem is that I can not get the pop up trimmer to engage.  When I push on the area indicated in the instructions nothing happens.  Maybe someone has an answer.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System was purchased for my husband as a gift. I looked at various different options and the 790cc was the ideal fit. My husband is extremely sensitive to shaving and the results have been wonderful. Its an incredible shave and very gentle. The cleaning feature ensures it says clean even if I am not cleaning it! :) The long batery life is wonderful for weekends away, you don&#x27;t have to bring the entire unit. All in all this is a wonderful shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for the last week.  Setup was easy.  All you do for the cleaning/charging stand is push a button to open it up, open up the plastic cartridge full of the cleaning fluid, slide it into the unit, and lock it down.  The initial charge didn&#x27;t take very long all.  A couple of hours I think, but don&#x27;t hold me to that because I wasn&#x27;t keeping track.  The razor itself came with the blade cartridge installed, so I didn&#x27;t have to do anything to the razor itself.  I haven&#x27;t tried changing the blade cartridge yet. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s another review here that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the performance of the razor itself, this razor glides over your face like a hockey puck on the ice (in a good way).  LOL!  I had the razor set on the highest setting for the thickest beard.  I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  I actually had to run my hand over my face to convince myself that this thing actually cut any hair at all.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, even in the hard-to-reach areas. The spot trimmer (or whatever it&#x27;s called), pops out of the side of the unit with the typical slide type switch.  It&#x27;s slightly inconvenient to use in that the razor head itself gets in the way of trying to see what you&#x27;re trimming.  But I can live with that.  And I really can&#x27;t see how else they could&#x27;ve done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it wasn&#x27;t necessary, I tried the cleaning cycle, after my first shave.  The only thing I can really say about it (since I know the razor wasn&#x27;t dirty yet...) Was that the cleaning cycle was loud.  If you store this razor in a bathroom off your bedroom, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest kicking off a cleaning cycle right before you hit the sack, especially if you have trouble falling asleep. I&#x27;d do it during waking hours. This is by no means a deal breaker.  Buzzing coming out of the bathroom, I can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also comes with a sturdy carrying case for travel.  The case will hold the razor itself, and a cleaning brush, which they provide with the unit.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend packing the cleaning unit for trip, as the fluid could spill out. (I think but I&#x27;m not sure.  Somebody else chime in if you know better.) If you do need to take it with you, remove the cleaning fluid reservoir.  I would suggest buying a new, unopened reservoir and packing that, to avoid any possibility of spillage in your baggage. It&#x27;s also possible that the reservoir can be resealed with its original cover, but I don&#x27;t know that either.  Use your own best judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all things considered, a wonderful purchase.  I may have to pick one up for dad.acking the cleaning unit for trip, as the fluid could spill out.

    <li> Outstanding product.  Use for both head and face, and get closest shave ever on both.  Have been using Braun shavers for many years so this is somewhere close to my tenth shaver. Cleaning system is loud when operating, but who cares, I don&#x27;t stick around to listen. Cleaning solution is expensive for only lasting 30 days per container, but does an excellent job cleaning.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver.  Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Keeps itself clean and charges quickly.  Comes with travel case.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. What more can a wife ask for?</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver that I have ever truly liked.  Ive tried Norelco 3 Head shavers before but they could never get the neck area very well.  This is the 1st Foil style shaver ive tried and I love it.  Ive been using razors for the last 15 years and got tired getting in the shower and realizing the blades were dulled out, or running out of hot water in the shower because shaving my face took too long (yeah I like to waste hot water, whatever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does about 95% the razors job.  when I need a blade close shave, i&#x27;ll use a razor... but for going to work and nothing formal this handles all of my shaving needs now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaner is nice too.  I got the 760cc at first, but then upgraded to this model because I wanted the fast clean... turns out I never use the fast clean, and the all black look of the 760 looks better than the pewter finish of the 790.  They use the same head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Im thrilled with this purchase... its does a good job- its quick, clean and fast.</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as I expected. I had a Panasonic shaver for several years before I purchase this unit recently. I&#x27;m not that happy with it as I should return it. It lacks the power to perform a good shave and this is Braun&#x27;s top of the line model?. I will most likely never purchase another Braun product again. I thought the name said it all, they seemed to have a good reputation as this is what I thought, but I was poorly mistaken.</li>
    <li> I have owned several  Phillips Rotary shavers for 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer of the Braun 790 stopped working in 1 year: I would have used it around 10 times at most.  6 months later ie 18 months after purchase,  the shaver  stopped working.  Though I have lost a lot of money, it may be blessing in disguise for my co-workers.  The shave was not at all good  and left a lot of hair. ( I dont have a beard and have light daily growth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phillips shavers never died on me and the shave was far better.  I though I was upgrading by buying an expensive german product: it was a disaster.</li>
    <li> The Series 7-790CC is my fourth Braun shaver in the last thirty years and it is by far the most technologically advanced model that I&#x27;ve owned. The shaver gives a typical Braun shave. Close and comfortable.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect gift for my leader ,and i plan to buy more for my friends! You must know that the price of this prouct is at least four times higer than that in Amazon !So,it is really a good product that i love so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for more than a decade.  When my first Braun shaver finally took one drop too many and started limping a bit, I decided to replace it.  That was the first Braun 7900, a joint effort with Gilette.  I&#x27;ll spare you the details, but it was a tremendous disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the current revision of the 790-cc, Braun has gotten back to its roots and delivered an incredible product that innovates the way you shave.  I realize that sounds like an ad, but really, it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shavers have always had adjustable power levels, but this razor&#x27;s lowest power setting is incredibly good for shaving sensitive areas like the neck where even at the lowest power in previous razor&#x27;s I had a hard time with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomics of this razor are awesome, and there are a ton of other little refinements too. They&#x27;ve clearly been listening to their customers and have fixed a number of annoyances I had with previous models.  Things like the hard plastic case for previous models which was brittle and prone to break has been replaced with a soft cloth/plastic case that provides protection and is sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning features of this razor work much better than the last model as well, which tended to have clumps of hair build up in the base that needed to be teased out by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love this product and would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive skin or anyone who wants a really good, convenient shave.  Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a braun shaver for many years.  I bought this new one becuase of the technology advances and good reports from other users.  The 790cc is a huge leap in technology and better than any electric shaver I have ever used.  It is ergonomicly friendly, easy to hold and use.  It is powerful when needed and gives a very close shave.  The new cleaning tank/reservoir is a bit awkward and has to many buttons, but that has nothing to do with quality of the shave.  If you like quality equipment that lasts, buy a Braun 790cc.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to switch back to an electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve owned Braun in the past but that&#x27;s not why I purchased this one.  After comparing several brands and models on-line (pouring through ratings and reviews like the one I&#x27;m now writing), I settled on this model for my \\&quot;Cadillac\\&quot; shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a razor (I haven&#x27;t found one that is).  But, it&#x27;s darned close without the nicks and cuts.  I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the cleaning function.  But, after several months, I have learned to really appreciate it.  The foil and blades are kept fresh and I actually like using it better right after a cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the shaver when it indicates a required cleaning cycle.  I was concerned that I would be running through cleaning cartridges (I even purchased a 3-pack in anticipation).  But, after 6 months of daily use, I am barely halfway through the starter cartridge.  And, as I mentioned, I clean it when the light indicates cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a week long trip and it easily lasted the entire time.  There were even days I shaved twice.  I think the charge might have dipped to half before I got back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a great shaver and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> I kind of gave up on electric razors some years ago.  For my tough beard, I found that I didn&#x27;t get a close shave and skin/neck was often irratated and red due to hair in multi directions.  Read review for this razor and thought I&#x27;d try one again.  This razor has been excellent so far after a month using almost daily. Close shave w/o having to repeat areas.  Vibration is noticable but soothing.  Battery charge is good so far, don&#x27;t have to recharge very often.  Travel case is a little small.  Only gripe I really have so far is that the foil area doesn&#x27;t catch some of the cut hairs, so have to be carefull what shave over since have a small layer of hair falling. Past razor caught more of the hair.  Ovreall very happy with purchase, despite higher price. It gets used!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I wanted an electric shaver that was good on the face and neck and great on the head (bald).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of reviews on this item but no one ever rated the shaver as a head shaver, so I took a chance with the Braun 7 series 790 CC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing. It shaves closer than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used on my head and because it&#x27;s not a razor I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my head, or showering before every shave just to soften my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on the face and neck also, but I mostly use it on my head and it really does provide a very smooth close shave that is as close, if not even closer than a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is wants a bald shaved head I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a few reviews about the locking mechanism not working, so let me just clear the air. The locking mechanism only works when the shaver head is pointing in the direction of the lock switch &amp;#62;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 - honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad shaver and it certainly has good looks and seems to be very well made but it is definitely not worth the price.  I received it as a gift but I would never pay the crazy price for this shaver.  This shaver screams \\&quot;redundant and unnecessary features\\&quot; from top to bottom.  The battery meter and hygiene meter are at the bottom of the shaver.  I don&#x27;t understand why there is a need to have a hygiene meter there when there is one on the cleaning station.  The meters are difficult to read since they are dark and the glass provides a lot of glare. Why not light up the meters on the shaver or provide an LED readout?  The cleaning solution does nothing more than what a good cleaning under running water would do and the shaver is still wet and oily up until the next days shave.  Not to mention that you have this monstrosity of a cleaning station on your bathroom counter.  I could live with all of that if I got a good shave with it but I don&#x27;t.  There are 3 power settings which is quite funny since the strongest setting barely does a half way decent job of my pretty soft daily growth.  I keep wondering what kind of beard would need the lightest setting.  After a couple of months, I still can&#x27;t shave my jaw line and neck without way too many passes.  It takes me a long time to get a mediocre shave.  I know everyone is different and all of what I just mentioned may not make a difference to everyone using the shaver so remember that shavers are a very personal item and what works for one, may not work for another.  Within the last 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve switched to the Panasonic ES-LA63s shaver and from day one, it has provided me with a surprisingly easy, close, comfortable shave without the voodoo of cleaning stations, solutions, meters and other assorted gimmicks.  If you like gimmicky gadgets and don&#x27;t mind shelling out anywhere from $11-$15 a month for unnecessary fluids, this may be the razor of your dreams.  If you like simple, inexpensive, get-the-job-done-well gadgets, keep looking.ts, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I brought this shaver because it came highly rated. It is a good shaver, but nothing special. I have had Braun shavers that have lasted me over 15 years and cost less than half what this shaver cost. There is really nothing that blows me away about this shaver except for the price. If I could do it all over again I would have went with a much less expensive Braun shaver. The cleaning liquid is an absolute ripoff. I barely use the cleaning cycle and I think I might get 4, maybe five cleaning cycles out of it before the machine says it needs to be replaced. I clean it the old fashion way by blowing on it and using a small brush. The overall quality is good and I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 years now with no problems, but none of my previous Braun shavers gave me any trouble either at the 2 year mark. The battery does last quite a long time and I charge it maybe once every 2 weeks, but I do not have thick facial hair either. For the price this shaver should have blown me away, it didn&#x27;t. Save your money and buy a less expensive shaver that does not require constant refills of the expensive cleaning agent.</li>
    <li> Thought I was spending too much for a shaver but this is well worth the money.  It gives a very close shave with no stubble residue left on your face.  I love the fact that it is cleaned everytime after I use it.  I am finding that the cleaning solution is lasting longer than stated in other reviews.  I bought this because I was placed on blood thinners and was told to not use a blade razor.  Even if I am taken off the blood thinners I will not go back.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I was glad I picked this razor.  It is easy to use and the cleaning feature works great.  You do have to go over your beard at different angles for the close as a blade shave.  Skin feels soft and I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn going from my blade to this razor.  The cleaning feature works great since I don&#x27;t have to spend time taking apart and brushing and using electric shave on face.  The cleaner fluid works great after a month and no issues at all!</li>
    <li> Awesome,&lt;br /&gt;Realy a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver a few months ago and never realized how much I loved it until it was lost during a move. I can&#x27;t afford a new one, but soon as I can i will replace it. This shaver leaves my skin with less irritation, ingrown hairs, and redness than any manual or electic shaver I have ever used, which is saying a lot. Wish the price was lower because I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. I have used electric shavers for years. As far as the shave itself, you can&#x27;t beat this model. The cleaning/charging base seems to work well so far too. My only issue with the whole thing is that the \\&quot;flip-up sideburns trimmer\\&quot; is on the front of the shaver instead of the back. With the angle of the shaver case, trimming sideburns/mustache/etc results in the regular shaver head catching other hair. Additionally, it makes for difficult visibility when trying to line the clippers up as well. In my experience, shavers with the flip-up clippers on the back side of the unit, with the shaving head angled away from their work area, are much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, from the main shaving aspect, this thing is great. I&#x27;ll just have to buy a separate beard/mustache trimmer for cleaning up those other spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note... I was wary of a \\&quot;self cleaning\\&quot; shaver at first. It has been a nice feature to have. The cleaning cycle is a little noisy, but since I shave before walking out the door in the morning there is nobody to be annoyed by the 10 minutes of cleaning that it does. I also haven&#x27;t been going through the cleaning solution nearly as quickly as I expected to, and I cycle it every day.</li>
    <li> The razor is awesome.</li>
    <li> it works good,and will buy more</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever used. I use to be a Norelco guy but they kept breaking. I decided to spend a little more money and bought this. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> purchased for my husband &amp; it&#x27;s his favorite razor</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the bees knees. It takes the thinking out of shaving. Since I got it, I haven&#x27;t had to try digging around for an old razer, or worry about forgetting to charge my old electric, or make sure it was clean. With this, simply take it out of the dock, shave, stick it back in and push a button. You can&#x27;t mess this up. It should be easier to use your own cleaning solution though. Kind of a rip-off.</li>
    <li> Why shave with a blade when this electric shaver is so good!</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  More recent version of a long line of great shavers.  Sturdy, no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things worth noting- Check shipping requirements if you order one that includes alcohol-based cleaner.  The cleaner will restrict shipping options.  This isn&#x27;t great if you wait until your shaver breaks to replace it and speedy delivery isn&#x27;t available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning device is fairly large and less than attractive, especially if you don&#x27;t like clutter and your bathroom is less than spacious.  You can put it away between cleanings but it does have liquid in there to slosh around.  I haven&#x27;t had it spill though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you loose the power cord, you&#x27;ll likely have to choose a compatible power supply since the simple power cord that comes with this shaver is less than simple inside and very hard to replace.  The compatible power supplies tend to be bulky and conflict with hairdryers for receptacle space.  Like the cleaning device, it&#x27;s one more bulky thing to put away if you want a tidy work surface for your personal grooming space.  The trick here is *do not loose the power cord!*  On the other hand, these power cords are so deceptively good, we use one from a tech&#x27;s shaver out of desperation to keep a new factory running during a shortage of the one needed for our equipment.  So, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It looks awesome, I love this one</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  He really liked that it is self cleaning.  He said that the shave is really close and the razor is very easy to set up and use.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> Sorry, this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> is incomparable. I always suffered when cut my beard but I&#x27;m happy with this razor</li>
    <li> very nice, my husband likes it very much.</li>
    <li> first of all,too loud, not so clean after the 1st attempt,i have to shave forward and backward several times.may not the best choice for its price</li>
    <li> I have used razors since I joined the Army when I was 19. I am now 27, and have struggled with sensitive skin since my first time with a razor. I am African American, and sensitive skin runs on my dads side of the family. As of last week, I finally called it quits with a razor and purchased a nice electric razor. I googled &#x27;best electric razor for sensitive skin&#x27; and this electric razor was the first to pop up. This has been the best purchase of my life. The first time I used this razor I immediately noticed results. No irritation to my skin what-so-ever. No redness. No nicks. Just smooth skin. Great product for any person experiencing shaving difficulties. Especially thoughs in a career field where shaving is a daily necessity.</li>
    <li> Amazing shaver. I bought this one for my dad because I bought one back in 2008 and loved it so much. There are tips online on how to keep the cassette fresh and alcohol full so you may want to check up on that. I&#x27;ve saved quite a bit since switching to this. I don&#x27;t get any bumps or cuts and I always get a good shave with it. Very close and rarely miss a spot with it. Best shaver out there right now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco rotary razors for many years. Always had trouble getting a good shave on my neck. I became frustrated enough to want a change and bought one of these. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It easily gives a very close shave on my neck and I no longer have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. After using this Braun I realize how poorly the Norelco razors did all these years.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. It does the job quickly and painlessly. It&#x27;s a bit more $$$ than the average shaver but it&#x27;s well worth it. I hate using razors and this is the best alternative. The shaver hold a charge for a very long time. The self-cleaning is ok but the self-cleaning needs to be cleaned out periodically and you need to buy replacement cleaner cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would whole-hardheartedly recommend this shaver and consider me a Braun convert for life.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t purchase a better razor.</li>
    <li> I was forced to replace my 10+ year old Braun series 5 razor after the charge chord would not carry a current.  I searched for a replacement chord, but due to the age of the razor, the best price I found was $130 – for a chord.  This is my 3rd Braun shaver, and each one has been a step up from the last.  After three weeks of daily (with a few lazy days here and there), I feel confident in my review…&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;-The 790 Shaver does a great job on my beard, better than the old 5 series did.  Even if I take a few days off from shaving, the 790 leaves my cheeks and neck smooth without dozens of “redo’s”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Braun uses the same cleaning cartridge on all of its models so the two I had purchased for use in the 5 series will not go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Auto shut off after cleaning/charging cycle is complete, a nice feature since I will set it to charge in the morning and will not be able to unplug it for 8+ hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This shaver feels comfortable in my hand, not bulky or slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have not gotten used to the pop up trimmer.  I liked the design better on the 5 series.  This one closes by itself if I push it the wrong way.  Rather than being close to the shaver head it juts out a few inches and it at an awkward angle.  I am sure I will learn the right way to use it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It indicates it is time for a thorough much more frequently than the 5 series ever did.  Not a con per se, but an annoyance.  Looks like I will be replacing cleaning cartridges a bit more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, my “cons” are minor, and I LOVE the resulting shave I get from this shaver.  Big thumbs up from me.</li>
    <li> So far meets my expectations. Still pricey overall, but like the shave compared to my previous Braun shaver. Good buy all around!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. Had it for an year now. The blade (cartridge) still feels new when shaving. Sample cleaner liquid that came in the box lasted 3months. Never bought refills after. Washing the blade in running water and leaving out for drying does the job. Water Did not damage the cartidge. I like to wash it myself instead of the portable base station machine. I use the base station to charge only now.  I will get a wet and dry shaver next time. Never bought a single disposable razor again and It saved me lot of money and irritating burning/itchy/green tinge skin that result from a razor use. Braun brand is introduced into my households item after this item. Next on list is Braun thermoscan ear thermometer.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. He is on oxygen 24 hours a day and it has effected his skin. Other shavers did shave him. This does.</li>
    <li> This electric razor works like a charm. It has a new feature that the older one did not have. It has a feature that saves use of the&lt;br /&gt;replaceable liquid cleaner, such that it does not have to be replaced as often.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used. My job requires me to be clean shaven every day and i get razor burn fairly easily. I do not have that problem with this razor. Its almost as close as a straight razor shave with no razor burn. The cleaning station also works great. It helps a lot with removing the bult up hair inside the razor.</li>
    <li> I began using the Series 7 790cc several years ago.  Shave quality varies depending on where you are shaving.  It works great on flat areas such as under the chin and on the sides of your face.  It does not do a good job around the nose or places where the skin is not reasonably flat, especially compared to my old Norelcos with the rotating cutters.  In addition, the cleaning base now leaks fluid every time I turn it on and I am running through paper towels and fluid at a rate sufficient to begin search for a new shaver.  I&#x27;ve looked at the O-ring on the impeller shaft and it&#x27;s OK so I have no idea why it throws fluid out or leaks.  The pop up trimmer also will not latch now and must be held down with a finger when shaving.  Durability of the razor is fair, but the cleaning system is messy and expensive.  I&#x27;m looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Very close shave.  I used to get razor burn with my old electric razor and now I do not.</li>
    <li> I sent it to my friend as a gift ,and he like it very much!If it have special discount again,I will buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun shaver years ago and liked it.  Then, I replaced it with a Panasonic that I really liked.  When that one stopped working, I heard this newer Braun was highly rated.  Turns out it is not as good as the Panasonic or my original less expensive Braun.  The shave is not as close. In particular, the neck area.  To avoid hairs getting caught on tee shirts, I need to go over my neck with a regular razor after using this one to get a closer shave.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using less expensive Braun razors for many years and I always had to use a Trac-2 in addition for a close shave. When I first got this I tried just using it by itself with some electric shave and I was really impressed with the shave and the comfort. Then, I started using it with no electric pre shave lotion and also before not after a shower as I had always done it. I don&#x27;t even find the need to use any razor burn relief lotion. It&#x27;s one of those things that make my life a lot easier. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. One thing though, I put it in it&#x27;s stand and clean and charge it every day after I shave. the replaceable cleaner cartridge last me about 45 days and cost about $4 to replace. It keeps it nice and clean and gives you it&#x27;s best that way.</li>
    <li> Replaced my 30-year old Braun with the Series 7 and WOW - what a technology leap.  A month ago, for health reasons, had to stop using a blade and the Series 7 gives an amazingly close shave.  It far exceeded my expectations and the cleaning system works great.  Am really glad that I made the decision to spend the extra money to get this shaver.</li>
    <li> As a woman unable to shave with a traditional razor due to psoriasis (skin condition) this is the best electric shaver ever! I am also unable to shave my left underarm with a normal razor because I am a young adult breast cancer survivor who had several lymphnodes removed. Any cut to that area can cause me lymphedema (extremity swelling) which can be very serious. I&#x27;ve never gotten a nick or any irritation with this electric shaver. This electric shaver works significantly better on legs (and knees), underarms, and bikini area than any electric shaver, especially those designed for women which are the worst. I have tried the rotary type electric shaver also and each time they would leave my skin scratchy with some razor burn. If while using this electric shaver you pull the skin tight on your legs they&#x27;ll feel as smooth after using this as if shaved in the shower with a normal disposable blade razor. Well worth the money and the battery lasts plenty long enough to complete all my shaving in a single use. For travel I simply take the power cord and shaver in the carry case that it comes with. So, it takes up as much room as 2 razors with disposable blades.</li>
    <li> It is powerful and I enjoy the shaving with it.</li>
    <li> Good item,good price,good service!</li>
    <li> Once again Braun came through.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after using my last electric shaver 10 years ago and wasn&#x27;t happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I thought of giving it another try - no cigar.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shave half as close as a regular blade, shaving the neck is impossible and I have to shave my neck with a blade which makes the whole purchase a waste.&lt;br /&gt;It does work which is why it got 2 stars but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of research on the Braun shavers. I decided to go with the Series 7, and I&#x27;m happy I did. The blades are sharp and pick up the fine stubble. For a quick shave without using shaving cream, or getting ready for the work week after the weekend, the Series 7 is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Before this model, I owned a Series 3 Braun Razor. It was on its last leg, so I decided to upgrade to Series 7. Probably the best decision I&#x27;ve made in a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It now takes me about 5 minutes to shave instead of 20 (my Series 3 was THAT bad) This gets 99% of the hair the first time over, while in return doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put the razor in the base, it will automatically charge and tell you how dirty the razor is. There are three levels of cleaning, and the razor will tell you how much of a cleaning it needs. You then click the start button and the base takes over from there. My series 3 would clean every time, no matter how much you used it. It&#x27;s great that you get to choose because you end up saving on cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself has a screen that shows hygiene levels and battery level so you know when it&#x27;s time to plug it into the base if you don&#x27;t keep it there all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has three levels of speed, a slower speed to get the sensitive areas like the neck, and medium speed for normal shaving, and a high speed for when you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while and need an extra boost of power. The pop out trimmer is also great for cleaning up lines and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best electric razor I have used since 2005!</li>
    <li> Easy to hold, no cords to get in way. Efficient, effective, no nonsense shaver. I bought this as well as the Norelco beard trimmer/vac system by Phillips.Never had a blade shave as close as this one. The pivot head works very well and the options of it make it very easy to get the best shave. I love the cleaning system, and kit keeps the razor out of the shower. No more beard stubble in the tub makes wife or GF very happy  (Shave before showering).</li>
    <li> It has been awhile since I used an electric razor.  This one by far has been the best.  In the first two weeks I used it just about every day.  Smooth shave and great cutting ability!  Even gets the hard to shave areas really good.</li>
    <li> goood sooo goood  // i bought t for my brother and he likes loooooooooooooove t sooo much t&#x27;s quilty goood sooo goood</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun shaver with cleaning system for about ten (10) years or so.  The last few years I kept it going with tape and makeshift parts.  Before I had always used a disposable razor as I had not found an electric that quite did the job.  The Braun changed that for me.&lt;br /&gt;Well this one beats the old one--both on shave and design.  The side burn cutter has been completely redesigned and now works great for sideburns as well as ear and nose hair.  The shave is amazing and the battery life super.  Just took it on a week and a half trip and didn&#x27;t need a charge once.  The cleaning and charging process is now automated even in deciding how much or if any is required.  Can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about this one.</li>
    <li> I got this as a x-mas gift for my husband &amp; he absolutely loves it! Cuts great &amp; leaves his skin very smooth. I highly recommend this prouct!</li>
    <li> Good razor, goes thru the cleaning cartridges pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I only wish I realized that I was paying double to use some screwy system that gives this shaver a bath in alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used it and found I can easily pinch the head off and shake it out and still get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Better than my other 3 headed shaver, whose parts fall out all the time when a cleaning attempt is made and doesn&#x27;t shave as closely or comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy the one without the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I have been down the Norelco path in the past and had issues with them tearing my neck up.  So, years ago I made the jump to Braun shavers.  My most recent was a 7500 series, but without the cleaning system.  Worked very well for many years.  I had to replace the battery recently and decided to pass the 7500 off to my son.  This gave me the opportunity to upgrade to the newest Braun, the 790cc.  What a great choice!  I have never had a more comfortable closer electric shave than with this shaver!  It may not be as close as with a straight edge, but pretty darn close!  I believe that the cleaning system in conjunction with the new foil design is the game changer.  I highly recommend the system.  I reviewed most of the negative reviews on this shaver before purchase and to be quite honest, have not run into any of the issues that were raised.  I would purchase this shaver again without any reservations!</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVER, MY SECOND BRAUN IN 11 YEARS, AND I STILL USE MY FIRST.  NOT SURE THE PRICE IS THE BEST...SHOP CAREFULLY, BUT IT IS A MAGNIFICANT SHAVER AND DOES A GREAT JOB</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, who hates to shave. He LOVES it. Shaves everyday now. Truth is, women don&#x27;t like beards. Please shave!!!</li>
    <li> its been a couple of years since I bought this and use it pretty regularly.  It works fine and travels well. I would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I decided to finally upgrade from my old braun 7650 (no digital screen)&lt;br /&gt;Started getting razor burn and after changing the foil/razor set it only helped a little.&lt;br /&gt;Ran across the [...] on youtube and started listening to the types of beards and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;After a bunch of reviews vs the other brands that were WAY more $ I chose the 790cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE difference in my opinion. My face is almost as close as a disposable blade which was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My wife was shocked and thought this purchase was a waste until she felt how smooth my face was.&lt;br /&gt;Not really a huge fan of the trimmer as its a little too close to the main shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;The BOSS edition looked really slick but no one had if for a reasonable price but honestly the only difference was the color of the shaver to me since this one comes with the same shaver travel case.&lt;br /&gt;Also I love the fact that the foil piece pushes in and out when you bring it closer to your skin. my old one would really end up scraping my skin if i pushed too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way I am sold and everyone that has an older shaver should upgrade.</li>
    <li> My beard is really hard on electric shavers but this Braun handled it like a champ. Easy to clean with the cleaning system and overall a decent total cost of ownership. Great quality</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this razor because of the self cleaning feature. For the last 10 years I had been using a top of the line Norelco - but not the new one with a swiveling head (Sensotouch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1- Easy cleaning function&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1- Takes MUCH longer to shave than the Norelco&lt;br /&gt;2- Does not cut anywhere as close as the Norelco&lt;br /&gt;3- Does a lousy job on my neck at any of three settings&lt;br /&gt;4- Many times noisier than the Norelco&lt;br /&gt;5- Cleaner mechanism failed after less than 1 year. (when my son had it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a good 5 minutes with the Braun,I gave up. Picked up the Norelco and in an additional 30 seconds got a baby-smooth shave. I am 76 and have pretty average whiskers. I shave every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be giving this electric shaver away to my son. Perhaps it will work better for him. I feel I just wasted $200.</li>
    <li> I received my shaver yesterday on time as stated. I have an older version braun product and my shave was always okay. It was time to upgrade to a new one since my old one was over 12 years old. I have never experienced a clean shave like this new 790 series shaver. This is a more expensive shaver but for as long as they last the price is very cheap. Spend the money and get this shaver!</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for just over one year. I had an activator before this model. This razor does all that I want in providing a good shave in minimal time. I clean it after ever third or forth shave. The cleaning fluid lasts for about six to seven weeks. I travel quite a bit so the redisigned case vs. the activator case provides better protection and convenience. In conclusion, I am very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> The features are good in theory. The shaving quality leaves a lot to be desired. I have a 40 year old Ronson that I haven&#x27;t changed the blade or screen in for about 5 years and I get a smoother and faster shave than I do with this one. I will search for another brand  next time. The cleaning solution cost is outragious.</li>
    <li> Ive been using premium razor blades since the Gillette &#x27;Mach3&#x27; came out, a year later the schick &#x27;quattro&#x27; and more recently the &#x27;pro-glide&#x27; but after being diagnosed with blood clots and having to take a blood thinner, I can&#x27;t use razors for fear of over bleeding. I decided to research available high end electric shavers and chose the braun series 7. This thing is awesome and lives up to all of the 5 star reviews posted. The series 7 gave a quick shave and left my face just as smooth as the premium blades I thought I couldn&#x27;t live without until now. Not all of us can use razor blades unfortunately so I am especially grateful for an affordable electric alternative that rivals those expensive blades!!</li>
    <li> Very, very good. Works as described. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using rotary razors for 45 years and this razor beats them all I love it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver.  Feels like a face massage.  Doesn&#x27;t cut up my face.  Only problem is 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (slight).</li>
    <li> I have used to circular head shaver for years, it did not give me a close shave, this one does! I would recommend it to anyone. Only issue I have with it, the led light on the shaver while in the base is very bright, lights up bathroom at night.</li>
    <li> excellent product , I recommend it 100 %</li>
    <li> Very good and quality product. Works and looks great. I am very pleased that bought this product. Recommend to all.</li>
    <li> An excellent electric razor!  Following my experience rasping my cheeks with another brand twenty years ago, IU was reluctant to try another electric razor, but as I&#x27;ve got older the number of cuts from a safety razor has increased.  The Braun, though expensive, does the job very well without abrasion, and my wife also uses it to shave her legs.  Another couple tried it, and they have also gone electric now.  it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> have used in the past. good and reliable performance. would recommend to anyone.fine ergonomic construction. very good features and ease of cleaning.</li>
    <li> I love the machine because it gives me close shave with very little irritation.  The only reason it does not get five stars is because it asks me to clean it almost every time I shave and the hygiene bars go done really quickly.  Feels like I will be spending a lot on the cartridge refills.</li>
    <li> Great upgrade from my Braun Series 3 shaver that I got 7 years ago. I saw a great price over the holidays for this shaver and just couldn&#x27;t resist getting an upgrade. I was worried if a case comes with this shaver as I will start traveling often for my career and wanted to make sure the shaver will be safe to travel with. The case is included and it is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The annoying part is that every three shaves, the hygiene level is at one bar or blinking to wash. You can still use the shaver without using the clean and renew washing method but it always blinks even when you put the shaver in the case for next day which I am always worried it will use the battery although it is very very very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the battery by the way I had no issues so far as it is still new and lasts me more than 10 shaves and it can go longer although I put it on the base to wash and it charges automatically so no battery issues.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason why 4 stars is because I was used to my 3 series where I would just detach the blade and shake in the sink and not worry about needing to wash it every 3 or so times. I know that this series is meant to be returned to the base after every use and it renews and cleans the blades for next time, but I just have a feeling the manufacturer just did that to sell more clean cartridge refills although they are not so expensive and I still have my original cartridge after 3 months at 75% full and that is after using it every 3 to 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace  my triple head shaver, I thought I would try a self cleaner one. this has been y best buy in a long time, I am very pleased with this shaver..  recommend it to every one. Ed</li>
    <li> this is the best razor  i have ever used ,its the closest shave i have ever had , i used to use  a rotory  and i will never go back to one. they say to give to your face 30 days to get use to the different shaver but i did not have to , it felt smooth from the first time. i used to have a shadow in the morning after shaving at night , now i can go 2 days without shaving if i want to , thats just how much closer this perfect shaver works. the price was worth every penny. i would buy another when have to, but not for a long time because its supposed to last for up to 5 years. , i also the fact that its a cord/ cordless, that means you can plug it in and use it if the batt. goes dead,</li>
    <li> Typically I use Gillette sensor excel. I switched to the braun series 7-790cc, all I can say is amazing. Too soon to say if the blades and cleaning solution are economical, they are supposed to last longer than my Gillette and the Braun shave is smooth with no bumps.</li>
    <li> Quick and clean shave, but it has just as much trouble on the neck as any other shaver. The cleaning unit is great, too!</li>
    <li> llego en perfecto estado y rapido, quisiera saber si puedo resibir ofertas del vendedor directamente para comprar mas rapido, en estos dias seguire conprando sus productos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years now and can say it&#x27;s the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I had a problem with it getting all the stubble efficiently at first, and it took too long to realize (6-8months) that I was pushing down too hard while I was shaving. Once I started just gentle shaving with it, it made a world of difference.</li>
    <li> I needed an electric shaver to replace my two old ones that had far outlived their useful lives - both Braun made.  This replacement is highest rated, and Amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> Quality of shave is great. Only con is that the plug sticks out of the wall 3&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t hinge.</li>
    <li> For an electric shaver it beats the competition but when I want smooth clean shaven skin, nothing beats the Gillette Mach 3 and Edge Gel combination. This is about convenience. I can&#x27;t use a Mach 3 in the car. My first Braun top of the line Pulsonic Series 7 shaver broke several times within the first three years with the first issue occurring 3 months after the warranty expired. The trimmer parts become misaligned and the unit had to be sent to a Braun service facility which repaired it for 43 dollars and the trimmer broke again on the first use. Deciding not to go back to the authorized repair center in Fort Pierce, Fl, I took the liberty of trying to repair it myself and discovered that the magnet that keeps the trimmer head flush with the body was missing. The repair shop failed to put all of the parts back. After 5 years of intermittent service, I finally retired it.  Being left with the choice of replacing the shaver with another brand, I decided to take it up one notch and purchase the 790cc for $149 on Amazon instead of going with Norelco or Remington, which I have had problems with in the past as well. Remington is a joke. Norelco triple header was bad out of the box and non returnable however it did provide a good shave with the exception that the battery lcd display was cracked, which had nothing to do with the performance. When the Norelco triple header finally died after 10 years, I decided to try Braun. So this is my 2nd high end Braun. Hopefully, the Braun Series 7  790cc Pulsonic will provide years of uninterrupted service and an outstanding shaving experience. Should it fail me this round, farewell Braun and back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> It is quiet, and it delivers a smooth finish on my skin... Its why I purchased the device.  The long-hair cutter is very effective too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not so sure about the cleaning system it employs.  It seems very good, but I wonder if it is overkill.  It might be Braun&#x27;s technique to generate on-going revenue - my last Braun shaver lasted me over 20 years... the business needs to get more from my wallet than one purchase every 20 years I suppose.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations. I got a quick clean shave, and it&#x27;s not so noisy.It&#x27;s easy to clean, with just the brush,</li>
    <li> Love the close gentle, non irritating shave.  Does the job fast with no effort.  Best of all with the push of a button it self cleans.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband he likes it so far (only had it a few days). Charging system is bulky with an ugly design (looks like a body part) taking up  bathroom sink. Have to buy the cleaning solution periodically which will cost more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for just over 4 years now and it works as good today as it did 4 years ago. I have used a few Remington shavers in the past and after about a year of moderate use, every single one couldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for a single shave, dulled down quickly and began painfully snagging my beard hair ultimately leading to replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have these problems with the Braun Series 7! While I do keep it in the charging base between shaves, the battery meter only ever loses one dot after a shave and I&#x27;ve never had any snags. I have even yet to replace the foil on the head after all this time as is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave 1-2 times per week on average and at that rate I only have to replace the cleaning cartridge about once every 2-3 months. Currently the cartridges are on amazon priced under $20 for 4, so for me it&#x27;s roughly $20/year to keep my shaver clean. While the added cost of cleaning cartridges may be a turn off for some, I believe it&#x27;s well worth it and it keeps the shaver running flawlessly over the years (also remember the cartridges are optional if you don&#x27;t want to clean it).</li>
    <li> i tried philips norelco 1290x and panasonic LV 61K before.  Philips was terrible for my skin and did a poor job under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic did a good job but wasnt kind on the skin.  With five blades it offered a very close shave, but irritated my sensitve skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun with 3 blades gave a close enough shave, but had settings for sensitive skin.  It did not cause much irritation or rashes even during daily shave . it does not provide smooth shave as the panasonic but I can use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely something to consider for sensitive skin folks.  The shaver has indicators for battery and cleanliness but the shaver gets dirty pretty quick requiring cleaning every couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning module is the only pain since we cannot transport it easily.</li>
    <li> If you are interested in buying this item from Amazon, don&#x27;t. Buy it from a brick and mortar as Amazon will not accept returns. I&#x27;m not sure where all these awesome reviews are coming from , but this thing does a terrible job of shaving. My husband can shave in half the time with a gillette razor and have smoother feeling skin. If you are used to an electric razor then it may be good, but it does not compare to a standard shave. I do not recommend this item and now I&#x27;m out 200 bucks with a piece of junk my husband won&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Series 7 shaver, and my third Braun overall. While I’ve only had this particular unit for a relatively short time, it works very much as the previous one, except it’s quieter. I finally wore out the previous shaver after half a dozen years, which seems pretty reasonable for something that I used almost every day. I read a couple of reviews where they talked about a quick death for the shaver, but so far this one is humming along nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two negative comments: First, I have a tough beard, and while I get a very good shave, the blade only lasts about half of the recommended 18 months before I feel I have to work too hard to get a clean shave. Again, this doesn’t seem outrageously bad, but it does fall short of the advertised ideal. I also found that the finish next to the shaving head deteriorated over time due to the cleaning solution, which I’ve read in a few other reviews. You would think that surface might be replaced with a small piece of stainless rather than the current approach (which appears to be painted plastic), just to maintain the appearance of the unit. It didn’t affect the performance, but it did degrade the overall appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the feel of the unit, it fits nicely in my hand. I like the way the blade conforms to my face while I’m shaving, and the ease of using the popup trimmer. I guess I have average sized hands for a guy, and the shaver is very nice in terms of the comfort holding it, and the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I’m very pleased with the shaver, and assuming it lasts like the previous one, I’ll probably get another one when I finally wear this one out. My true rating is probably closer to 4.5 stars, just due to the minor glitches, but given the overall performance and life of the shaver, I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt with 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year later. Still running flawlessly. I recognize that any electronic/mechanical gizmo can fail, but my experience is that these things really do last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted above, the blades do not last 18 months, at least with my beard. I&#x27;m usually closer to the nine or ten month mark before I feel it&#x27;s too much effort. I went to Amazon to order a new blade, and found that the price I paid last year of $31.45 has now tripled. All of the previous offers on the Internet in the previous price range are &amp;#34;out of stock.&amp;#34; Prices on the Braun site are now about $85.00, with prices on the Internet running up to the low hundreds. That jump in price, coupled with the original price of the shaver, makes this a much more expensive option. I wouldn&#x27;t have even flinched if the price had gone up some, but tripling seems like Braun is just attempting to fleece it&#x27;s customers. While I still think this is a nice shaver, the total cost of ownership no longer makes sense if the annual price for the blades is $85.00+ (plus the original cost plus the cleaning solution). This jump in price is why I changed my overall rating. Buyer beware!il, but my experience is that these things really do last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted above, the blades do not last 18 months, at least with my beard.

    <li> This is a great electric shaver. It works much better than I anticipated it would. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now.</li>
    <li> Just brilliant. Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver. Even on the neck it cuts really close.</li>
    <li> The old ones are better than the new ones</li>
    <li> Wonderful,I&#x27;d like it</li>
    <li> Too bad the liquid can&#x27;t pass through customs. Overall very efficient!</li>
    <li> Worst Braun product I have owned in 20 years as a loyal customer.  Had this for over a year and going through my reviews noted I never did one on this.  Does not give a clean shave</li>
    <li> very good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like it  very useful  I  should  buy</li>
    <li> Husband loves this razor!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this to replace an old Braun Syncro. What a difference! The old one was really just acting up and not getting all the hairs on my face. This thing is smooth, powerful and very gentle around the neck area too.</li>
    <li> This item is great as a gift for my Dad，and  the price is cheap! I love it ! But where is my 40$-reward credit</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, quiet and handles functionally</li>
    <li> I have switched back and forth from blades to electrics many times.  Funny how electric shavers advertise how they \\&quot;shave close as a blade\\&quot;.  The blade is still the standard by which electrics are measured.  That said, this Braun is truly the best and most \\&quot;blade like\\&quot; shave I have ever had from an electric.  Most striking was that I normally expect, and the user guide even says, to need a month for your face to adjust from blade to electric for best results.  Nope.  First shave out of the box this thing was giving me perfect results.  I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have used this razor for a year and once again am going back to blades.  Why?  3 reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The noise of this this shaver, especially first thing in the morning, is really annoying.  It is loud.  I mean really, really loud next to your ear.  Rotary shaver are much quieter because they simply spin while this must oscillate.  I really thought I would get used to it but in fact have become more annoyed with the noise over time.  Maybe it is louder now than when I first got it.  I don&#x27;t know and have no way to know for sure.  But the noise is bad.  Real bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Maintenance.  I got the whole system with the cleaning base thinking it made sense.  And yes, the cleaner really works well.  The shaver is absolutely clean after you pull it out.  The issue is that even when only putting it in 2 or 3 times per month to clean and charge I have gone through 12+ refills in one year.  Braun says they should last 2 - 3 months.  No, not for me.  I think the dry climate where I live could be a factor.  The refills appear to simply evaporate rather than get used up during cleaning cycles.  My last refill was only used one time before I got the red light saying it had to be replaced!  I have tried water cleaning and it does not work well at all compared to using the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Shaver is wearing out after one year.  Braun says head could last 6 years but they recommend replacing after 18 months.  After 12 months mine is definitely cooked.  I often get at least one particularly course hair ripped right out by the root when shaving if I have gone more than 2 days between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Braun because I got so fed up with the ridiculous price of razor blade refills I decided it would be no different cost wise to go electric long term when compared to buying $15 worth of blades and $5 worth of shaving creme each month.  That&#x27;s $240 per year to shave with blades.  I think the reality is that the long term cost of using this electric is no different than blade shaving.  Even with amazon&#x27;s subscription for the refills they are over $4 each.  And at my burn rate that&#x27;s over $50 per year.  Now add another $34 per year to replace the head.  Amortized over a couple years with the cost of the shaver and we&#x27;re talking over $180 per year cost to own.After 12 months mine is definitely cooked.

    <li> So good and I love it. Braua,I love u lol.can I type Chinese is not 20words.  Come on.  20 20</li>
    <li> good,i feel good and the packing is nice, i trust the brand ,so if have new model, i will buy</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews on this product I decided to buy it for my husband for Christmas. He hasn&#x27;t used one in years. Love it...very nice close shave and it doesn&#x27;t pull. Would recommend to anyone wanting a very nice quality shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too cheap so it is too worthwhile.I am very like it.And I want to buy another one to give my friend.</li>
    <li> With the 60 day return if I did I was not satisified with it, I decided to see il the hype for this model was justified.  In a word, YES! I have used the Braun 7526 shaver (one of the first I believe to use the cleaning system) for the past 7 years. The new Series 7-790cc shaver was worth exceeded my expectations. The shave was definitely smoother/closer and shaving time was also less.</li>
    <li> This model is quieter, very comfortable, and adapts to the shape of the face or areas that need to be shaved.  The floating head is the part that allows it to adapt to various shapes.  There is less (or no) skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I like Braun.  I would say that you are either a Braun or a Norelco person when it comes to electric razors and shaving. I do not use a regular bladed razors because they are expensive, you cut yourself and have to have shaving cream....all a pain... Electric razors take two weeks to get your skin used to using.  If you don&#x27;t want to have two weeks of trying it then don&#x27;t bother investing the money.  Braun razors (I have owned 3 in the last 15 years) typically last 3-5 years.  I prefer this one because it can clean itself and all I have to do is throw it into the base and hit clean once a week.  I shave daily and it will hold a charge for a good two weeks, if I don&#x27;t charge it up.  The cleaning refills are cheap and you only need to replace them every other month if you wash out the razor prior to dropping it on the base.  Love this thing and if you try it you will as well.</li>
    <li> This shaver will take you back to that first month when you started shaving.......now I mean when you actually started shaving ( not just the peach fuzz ) and you were excited to shave; to take that step into manhood.  Then unfortunately you got so bored with it and then realized this hurts.  Well with this shaver the excitment is back and best of all it takes you to a new hight of enjoyment with it ability to give a precision shave that only German engineering can give; along with the micro pulse technology that is somewhat soothing , almost massaging your face.  There is virtually no razor burn associated with this shaver since you can set the strength at which the shaver will shave your face... In a word this is an amazing shaver. I have not tried the 3 or the 5 series and went straight for the 7 790cc but this shaver does make me question as to how much better a shave can get along with almost being evnvious of those guys who get a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow..  Also did i mention that when you shave every morning the unit is clean and sanitized so it&#x27;s like a new shaver every day.  This is such a nice blend of technology and equipment that it is an overall pleasure to use and ontop of it all, it is packaged in an extremely asthetically pleasing unit.....slightly futuristic but not over the top to where you need the manual to run. Forethought was a definate requirement for this unit as all features are welcomed and I can actually see a use for them.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Great buy.</li>
    <li> yes this is $$$  but well worth it. I have sensitive skin and I still love this shaver. spend the money you will not be dissapointed</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I have purchased and used in quite a few years. I COULD NEVER FIND ONE THAT WOULD GIVE ME A CLOSE ENOUGH SHAVE. But this one does the job.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this Not sure its worth all the hype.  It has a few different settings but I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  The self cleaning feature is a nice thing... I have to admit I rarely cleaned my old one and this one is just  a push of a button.  My only gripe with this one is that there is no precision trimmer pop out.  Its hard to get the hair above the lips completely with this style.</li>
    <li> excellent product, shaving is very smooth and burn free. I like the auto cleaning technology they have, sometimes I still have to manually clean it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Series 7 and the Cruzer Face 6 because I had a terrible need of an electric shaver. I read the reviews, nearly all of them, starting with the negative then moving to the positive. I was not impressed by the reviews but Brauns money back guarantee gave me the courage to buy the products and try them out, so I did. These are my thoughts on the Series 7 and how it compares to the Cruzer Face 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 7 is a shaver primarily. It does have a trimming feature that shapes up the side burns, and it does a great job of trimming and making a line, but with it&#x27;s angle, it&#x27;s so awkward to use. You can use it to shape your mustache and beard line, but it would a cumbersome and most unpleasant task. The Series 7 does have 3 different settings, but the blue setting is too rough for my skin. It gets hairs more quickly but it leaves me with an agitated face because I have such sensitive skin. The light blue, almost white setting takes several passes to get about 98% of all the hairs under my chin, while the blue setting gets about 99% of all the hairs. I still have to knick a few hairs with a razor because my skin has crevasses that the hairs try and hide between. Stretching my skin helps, but it also adds to the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and you want to keep a goatee or shaped mustache, the Series 7 is not the shaver for you. The Cruzer Face 6 excels in all areas except that with the foil shaver, it only gets about 95% of the hairs under my chin. The Series 7, is bulky... square like, so trimming a mustache shape under the nose or grooming a nice facial hair design is grossly undesirable. I am keeping both shavers, but if I had to choose to have one shaver, it would be the Cruzer Face 6. It&#x27;s cheaper and it performs almost as well shaving with many more features to enjoy. The trimmer on the Cruzer Face 6 is a God send and the foil shaver has never irritated my skin, not once. I can&#x27;t say the same about the Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as maintenance, both shavers are easy to clean and maintain, so with the Series 7, it makes the purpose of the cleaning station almost negligible. It&#x27;s just more of a hassle to have to keep buying the solution for it although it is low maintenance to use. Also, if you are a cheapo like me, you can make your own solution. It&#x27;s just 70 proof rubbing alcohol mixed with several droplets of lemon scented oil. You can get lemon scented oil off Amazon and put maybe 30 drops per tank of 70 proof rubbing alcohol and that&#x27;s a much cheaper option than buying refill packs. As I said before, both these shaves are so easy to clean and maintain that it shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in making your purchase. The Cruzer Face 6 is the best shaver I&#x27;ve come across.as maintenance, both shavers are easy to clean and maintain, so with the Series 7, it makes the purpose of the cleaning station almost negligible.

    <li> I have used a number of Braun Shavers since the early 60&#x27;s (I still have that model and it works fine to this day). This new Braun 7 has to be the very best of all, I love the versatility it offers, the closeness of the shave is superior to the previous model which was 10 years old by the time I bought the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remove the shaving head after every shave and clean with the brush, then one a week place it in the charger and do the automatic clean and recharge. Apart from my daily beard shave I do the whole head about once a week so it gets a lot of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Braun model to all those who have used electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from on older Braun that just kept wearing out blades to this one. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I must say this shave is so much better and cleaner. Smooth and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be built well. Hopefully the blades will last longer than 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Specs say 18 months. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is the top dog for a reason</li>
    <li> I have an older model Braun I have had for several years and I really liked it but then my son went off to collage and it went with him. This new Series 7 is much quieter and gives you a closer shave. I love the way it cleans itself.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> gives good close shave for electric shaver ! better than rotary i had before ! battery life seem to be good</li>
    <li> I think the shaver may be more suitable for people in America and Europe.Because of their hair is more dense.But my father said to me like this.Sometimes you buy things may not be suitable for, however, is the one you love love.This is the reason I buy.Well, forgive my poor english.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Norelco shavers and most recently the Braun Series 5.  The difference between the Series 5 and Series 7 is nearly unbelievable.  The 5 was rough and took several passes to actually get a decent shave.  The 7 is quick and smooth!</li>
    <li> I picked this item because it is a top pick in Consumer Reports. It hasn&#x27;t let me down. I&#x27;ve been getting comfortable shaves and in a quarter of the time it used to take me with my previous shaver. The cleaning chamber was easy to install and the device came with one cleaning fluid cell which is good for around 30 cleanings. The cleaning fluid even has a pleasant smell. The hygiene and charge gauges are very useful.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor, but maintenance can add up!  Cleaning cartridges will last longer if you disconnect the head and simply blow out the shavings before inserting the razor in the cleaner-recharger.  Not to do so will shorten the life of the cleaning cartridge.</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to get used to Electric Razor, but I am doing it,  Still use regular razor once a week.  That said, if you want to try an Electric Razor, this Braun is REALLY REALLY NICE!!!!  You just have to get used to/learn how to use Electric Razor.  You WILL like!!</li>
    <li> I had never used an electric razor before but was increasingly tired of the razor blade market scam of ridiculously high prices for a cheap little throwaway item, so I went high end -&lt;br /&gt;Blame me but I didn&#x27;t understand that buying and using this thing would require rearranging my bathroom counter in order to accommodate  the HUGE base that it lives in and the the glowing blue light would not only fully illuminate the bathroom but would also spill over into my bedroom and cast shadows at night! Nor did I know that I would have to buy little tanks of &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; stuff for the rest of my life. I would have preferred a one time transaction related to this process (shaving).&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself doesn&#x27;t shave my not especially heavy beard as close as a razor and in certain areas, e.g., the vertical margin in front of my ears/below my sideburns, seems to miss nearly altogether. It&#x27;s as though the outer edges of the razor don&#x27;t work. Overall, it does the job but I often have to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; my shave.&lt;br /&gt;Not too pleased.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean to sound like the angry old guy -- because I&#x27;m not -- but Braun is not what it used to be and is now trying to make money over making good products. I had to replace a 13 year old Braun rechargeable shaver with their top of the line shaver and I have to say that it&#x27;s a huge step back. The shave from the new 7 series is not even as close, and I now need to pay for these stupid cleaning cartridges. I went 13 years with only replacing the foil cartridge every few years. Now I went on a several month trip and needed to find isopropol alcohol in fun places like india because the shaver was pulling hair like crazy. That shaver cost a lot, but I would *happily* pay that again to not have to put up with the series 7.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because I didn&#x27;t know what else to get him. He absolutely loves it! I wish I could give a more detailed review, but obviously I&#x27;m not the user. All I know is that it cleans itself, and has a travel bag where you can take it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year and it still works great. I have to be clean shaven for work, so it is used 5 days a week. The battery will last over two weeks between charging if need be. The cleaner works great. Just drop your razor in and hit the start button.</li>
    <li> Out was better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Previous to this shaver (790cc) I used a a Braun 7526 shaver for about ~10 years. The Braun 7526 still works great but the battery is slowly going out. My review is therefore partial in comparison to the Braun 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I have been using the 790cc for about 3 months and have been satisfied. I get a pretty close shave and I have medium course facial hair. The battery seems to hold up for a number of shaves so no complaints there. The shaver has an indicator to let you know the &amp;#34;battery&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34; status. The &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34; status indicates cleaning about your 4th or 5th shave. The cleaning process is pretty straight forward, just place it in the cleaning apparatus and let it do its business. It can get kinda loud (not ridiculous though) and can last about 3-5 minutes (haven&#x27;t actually timed it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a couple of times, when I have not shaven for about 3-4 days, that the shaver seems to catch on my beard. Was not expecting that, but if I shave really slow I can mostly avoid the tugging. This is not a problem when my beard is shaven every ~2 days. I suspect this is due to screen/foil, was never an issue with my old shaver (Braun 7526). Have not read that this has been a problem with other people, must just be me.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction and product!</li>
    <li> Nice selection of razors and found what I wanted. Great Price and free shipping seals the deal. Braun makes a great razor that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Just as good as everyone says. I needed a shaver that I will not cut myself with because of blood thinners ...... Smooth shave!</li>
    <li> This is the very best electric razor that I have ever used.  I have an older model Braun that I have used for about 5 years.  I thought it was a great razor until I began using my new Braun.  The new razor is light years ahead of my old one.  It has independently floating heads which allows it to conform to the shape of your face.  It gives me the best shave!  I love it and would buy another one if this one broke.</li>
    <li> used it to shave my head and face. They don&#x27;t wear out , just buy a new blade, new razor</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there not to like? The power is in the feel when you first turn it on. It cuts cleanly without tugging and pulling. The self cleaning feature is welcome. It tells you how much cleaning is necessary and only runs enough to do the job. The carrying case is sturdy like no other I&#x27;ve owned. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a year now and can&#x27;t complain. I can shave everyday without worrying about cutting my face.</li>
    <li> You know that feeling you get when you buy a product and feel really good about the purchase after using the product for a while?  This shave gave me that satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives you a very close and clean shave.  I&#x27;ve never used blade, only electric shavers.  Now I don&#x27;t worry about shave bumps.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised with how great this razor works.  I have used electric razors in the past but have been unhappy with the shave and effects on my skin.  This one works great from the first shave and on!</li>
    <li> My husband asked me to buy this razor for him as a Christmas gift. He has been using it since December 2012 and loves it (as do I). He has sensitive skin and would frequently breakout after shaving with traditional razors in the past, particularly on his neck. This razor has been a dramatic improvement! It is gentle on his face and gives him a close shave. I love it because his face feels very smooth after he shaves, and he doesn&#x27;t have to suffer the painful red bumps on his face and neck anymore. My husband also loves the self cleaning feature on the razor, and the long battery life. Great product overall, we highly recommend it to anyone (especially guys with sensitive skin).</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun razors for over 20 years and this is the best one I have ever used. It has a natural feel when holding it and the variable sensitivity setting is something none of my previous Braun razors have had.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It gives him a real clean shave and he does not have to use his razor any more.&lt;br /&gt;Shave with this and looks good to go and ofcourse handsome as can be.</li>
    <li> Had an older 5-series for years, but travel and wear-and-tear finally wore it out. Bought this as a replacement and it&#x27;s great, as you expect, from Braun. Holds a charge for a week no problem; and does a nice job on your face in about 5 minutes of careful use. Get one!</li>
    <li> I have used just about every electric shaver, and all of them were the same, did not shave close, had to go over my face multiple times until I got tired, or they were just a plain piece of crap. I thought why invest all this money in a Braun if it was like all the others? Will after years of nicks and buying ever expensive cartridge blades, I grew a little beard and put this Braun to the test. Absolutely fantastic results, my face has not felt this smooth since forever. The Braun worked so well and felt so good that I decided to do the impossible, I cut my STACHE off too!  I hope my wife recognizes me. LOL!!</li>
    <li> nice product works well refills a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> i love Braun series7-790ccpulsonic shaver system,silver and fit as expected.very good.i love it so much.i love braun&#x27;s.fit as expected.i love it.</li>
    <li> i talked to several people who use electric razors and they claim to have no issues with them. they told me they shave like a blade. so after using a disposable razor for years i decided to give one a try. this was my first electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this shaver works well on most of my hair that grows perpendicular to my skin. that&#x27;s 99% of the stuff above my jaw line. it even gets as close as a blade or closer in places. i know this because i used a blade right afterwards and can tell where it&#x27;s actually cutting my beard. for the other 1% ( a few hairs) i have to run it back and forth over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;below my jaw it does not get as close and it misses hairs randomly. no matter how much time i spend i can&#x27;t get a decent shave. these are hairs that grow close to parallel with my skin. but a blade gets them fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you may want to take a close look at your beard and see how the hairs grow out before getting this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so it&#x27;s going back to braun i guess. if they don&#x27;t take it it&#x27;s being sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s disappointing because i really looked into electric shavers and this one got high marks. wish i knew amazon would not take it back because the of cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: braun does have a 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee. but the process is a real pain. the manual lists a general number to call, you go through the menu system and then get a recording rattling off what to do, address, etc. listen to that about 4 times to get it right. then print your receipt, package it up, insure it, and wait up to 10 weeks for the refund. we will see if i ever get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line, unless you know this product and like how it works on your face don&#x27;t order from amazon. returns are a major pain. i love amazon in general though.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, to the point that I haven&#x27;t shaved in 5 years. I don&#x27;t like rocking the red irritated neck.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this with not much hope that I would use it much.&lt;br /&gt;4 months in and I use it almost everyday. My wife is having to get used to a clean shaved face.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little getting used to. I use the highest setting on most of my face.  For my neck I use the &#x27;white&#x27;, or gentlest setting. The first few times I used it my neck would get irritated. Then I got the hang of applying very little pressure to my neck and going with the grain. It might take a few passes that way but its close and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Its what you expect from a Braun shaver, the very best you can buy in my opinion and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Been using Norelco for 25 years. This shaver cuts extremely close and easy to clean. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;No more in grown hairs!!!!</li>
    <li> The shave is close and my skin is not irritated a bit! The cleaner is a little pricey, but so far it seems worth it</li>
    <li> i liked the cleaning device, but the shaver it not that perfect specially for the neck area, maybe because i have i thick beard</li>
    <li> I consider this to be the best on the market. I&#x27;ve probably had four since 1978 when I started using Braun. I replace them after  about seven years for the newest model. Not much to say except I&#x27;m happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> 1. It shaves me absolutely clean. I feel no stubble whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;2. It shaves me fast. Really fast.&lt;br /&gt;3. I L-O-V-E that every night I can put the shaver in its base unit, and the shaver gets auto-cleaned and lubricated. It is perfectly clean the next morning and has a clean, very light lemony scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, I had an old electric shaver. I forget the brand. I hated having to brush it out all the time. I never really felt like I got it one hundred percent clean. And, the spray lubricant I had back then did not agree well with my skin. I went back to blades--much easier (better shave, too)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this Braun shaver has none of that. I love that it self-cleans and lubricates every night. Yeah, you have to buy the solution every few months. It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Still need razor to get neck and side burns .  Also iif your in a rush I just use a razor.  It take awahil to get all the hair.and im not hairy atalll</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations! Great product. Great reviews!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best electric shaver that I have ever used</li>
    <li> Outstanding performance.  Best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor and so far so good.  No complaints really; does a good job of providing a close shave and the cleaning system is awesome.</li>
    <li> Despite all the hoopla about great the shave is with the Series is supposed to be  I really didn&#x27;t find that much difference between this Braun and a much older one that I have.  A few hours after shaving it feels like the stubble is back. Still doesn&#x27;t come close to shaving with a blade. Disappointed with the performance given the cost. Can hardly wait to see how much the liquid refills are going to cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various electric razors over the years and have never been really happy with their performance.  So I read the reviews and figured I&#x27;d replace my Panasonic with the Braun.  Out of the box - no instructions :-(.  Read the manual online, and watched a user video.  Controls are pretty simple, so no major problems.  Footprint is similar to the old Panasonic, with a similar cleaning mechanism.  Once charged, I gave it a try and was not disappointed.  The Braun did a good job on shaving off about 3 days worth of growth and didn&#x27;t leave as many patches as the Panasonic.  Perfect?  No, but the best so far.</li>
    <li> This shaver was over rated.  I did not get a close shave and returned it.</li>
    <li> This thing worse $1445 in china!!! oMFG</li>
    <li> Best one yet, and I have had Brauns for the past 10 years or more.</li>
    <li> Like so many others, I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotary shavers for almost 40 years.  My last one was the Architec which, unlike it predecessors, did a terrible job on the flat neck hairs and, unlike it predecessors, you could not remove the cutters meaning it was almost impossible to clean well.  Running it in a small bowl of alcohol cleaned some of it but. . . .&lt;br /&gt;The Braun gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It shaves as smoothly as a blade, at least for me.  With a bunch of acne scars, blades just don&#x27;t work on my face so finding an electric that shaves this well with absolutely no irritation is wonderful.  Wish I had made the switch a long time ago.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love It. Quieter than other shavers I&#x27;ve had and shaves close. Easy to handle and good trimmer too.</li>
    <li> It does not shave as great as I thought. I bought this for my boyfriend as his shaver is getting too old. After shaving with this, you can still see where his mustaches are (the blackheads), where as with his old one you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> I had a Series 5 razor for almost 4.5 years, and decided to upgrade because I needed to both replace the foil/cutter assembly and the charging/cleaning base, which was no longer cleaning properly (all the stubble would just collect at the bottom and not go into the cartridge).  Although comparing a well-used Series 5 with a new Series 7 probably isn&#x27;t fair, the Series 7 provides a much better shave.  It takes fewer strokes, shaves more closely, and is smoother.  Again, hard to know whether that&#x27;s all due to the features/performance of the Series 7 or the age of the razor it replaced, but I have no regrets.  In addition, the Series 7 (790cc model, at least) comes with a nice and compact, semi-hard, zippered case; some earlier runs appear to have come with a much cheaper plastic case.  (Not sure why Braun does this, but I&#x27;ve been using their razors for over 25 years, and the quality of the travel cases waxes and wanes.  Fortunately, a good quality case right now.)  There are a few downsides: There is no little plastic cover that clips over the foil when traveling, so it&#x27;s not as well protected.  The trimmer is step backwards.  It extends out so far (and is narrower than those on the Series 5) that it magnifies movement and is harder to control.  I suspect I&#x27;ll get used to it eventually.  The button to extend the trimmer also is right where my thumb rests when shaving, so you have a tendency to push the trimmer out/open when shaving unless you pay attention.  But for those quibbles, a real improvement over the Series 5.  It&#x27;s worth noting that the battery in the 790cc is lithium ion battery.  The 790cc also has an electronically controlled sensitivity/power function, which controls the intensity/speed of the pulsations, as far as I can tell.  Seems to work, but I just use the medium setting.  The swivel lock function (lock either on or off) makes more sense than the three-position switch on the Series 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price for the 790cc right now is so good that it&#x27;s hard to justify getting a lower model Series 7, since they are about the same price.  The Series 5 is significantly cheaper (by about $50), and served me well, but I think that the extra amount for the Series 7 at Amazon.com&#x27;s price is worth it.  I do hope that the cleaning/charging base for the 790cc proves more durable/reliable than the one I had for the Series 5.it&#x27;s hard to justify getting a lower model Series 7, since they are about the same price.

    <li> This razor is simply amazing. I can get a shave that is as close as one with a blade razor. I get no razor burn and my face feels &amp;#34;baby skin soft&amp;#34; after each shave. The razor has an adjustment to power it up for tougher beards. I use this selection for shaving my neck hairs which are somewhat harder to shave and it does it perfectly. I use the feature that locks the moveable shaving head in place to shave the area under my nose and it is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cradle the razor sits has a larger footprint than I expected. The various indicator lights for charge and level of dirt in the razor&#x27;s head is a nice feature. The cleaning process that is performed in this cradle is a nice touch. My only concern is the additional cost of the cleaning fluid that is contained in a replaceable cartridge. Not sure what that cost of the cartridge is, but that part of the unit was an unexpected surprise.</li>
    <li> Gives a very close, comfortable shave</li>
    <li> the cleaning station arrived not working, I had no invoice or warranty in the box. I had to take it to Braun maintenance after one week. disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This product is better than the 5 series and 720 I had recently.  I have almost given up on getting a decent shave from an electric.  The braun product has been very highly rated but I still prefer my Gillette Mach3.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin--Especially my neck.  I have been shaving my face for over 10 years now with a Whal Peanut which is a personal trimmer/groomer unit used by a lot of hair care professionals.  It has treated me well but does not even come close to a razor shave.  This means that I must shave everyday and still walk around with A LOT of stubble.  I have tried so many other options.  I have tried all the different razors and different techniques.  Razor burn on my neck every time.  I have also tried numerous electric shavers but have never found a unit that actually shaved all the hair quickly without pulling or irritating certain hairs and leaving others behind.  I was more than a little skeptical about spending this kind of money on yet another attempt.  SO GLAD THAT I DID!!!  For the first time in a decade I have a shave that is razor close.  The neck may be just a tad outside this range, and I mean barley.  My neck hairs grow sideways and curly though.  The braun took them off quickly and with no pain or irritation.  I have been walking around all day feeling my face in disbelief.  I never thought I would feel this close of a shave again.  NOT ONE RAZOR BUMP EITHER!!! This is the first review I have ever written--the product performed that well.  It made me want to sit down and let someone else who may have the same problems I did with razor burn that there is a solution.</li>
    <li> This shaver is excellent. Shaves almost as close as a razor without the razor burn or the need for smelly stupid shaving cream</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s day.  He loves it, said it was the best razor he has ever used .</li>
    <li> I would have said that this was the best electric razor I have ever owned. It worked flawlessly-until today! My razor stopped cleaning today for no apparent reason. I even tried putting in another cartridge, even though the other one was not indicating that it was time to replace it. I guess I will be packing it up and sending back for warranty repair.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Buying and perfect attendance. All they offer fulfilled. I bought on a trip to New York and everything has been perfect. It was bought as proof of service and has been easy, the only thing is that you should carry the code of the last email received accerder to the collection in the Staples store where I went.</li>
    <li> The impeccable craftsmanship, powerful function, collection is currently the most advanced technology, although expensive but worth, belonging to men enjoy, recommended</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because of the excellent reviews, however I was very disappointed with the quality of the shave. I found that within a few hours my beard was back. I have a medium to heavy beard. I have switched to Panasonic and find it much better.</li>
    <li> Better than my last Braun razor.  Smoother, quieter and faster.  Absolutely worth the money and cheaper here than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who was a long-time Norelco user.  When his Norelco finally died, he purchased another electric razor, and then another but they were miserably ineffective and only generated a number of complaints and expletives from my husband.  He LOVES this new Braun which gets the job done quickly.  His face is so smooth and soft and he says, &amp;#34;This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had!&amp;#34;  It was worth the money just to have our Sunday mornings expletive-free once again.</li>
    <li> I bought this one after over 11 years with my Braun 7526 shaver.  This bad boy is even better and worth it!  You can spend more, but I recommend giving this one a look.</li>
    <li> There are some great review on Amazon for this already, but I wanted to just throw in my observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return this after about two weeks of use. It just wasn&#x27;t working for me at all. Amazon wouldn&#x27;t take it back because it&#x27;s a razor. Since I paid so much for it, I decided I better give it a few more weeks. I&#x27;m glad I did because I discovered a couple small tricks: I rub my beard with my hand in the opposite direction of the growth in the few trouble spots and, boom, no longer trouble spots. Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to shave in a weird pattern. You will find the pattern you need to shave in, and once you get that part down, your shave times will be cut way down and the quality of the save will go way up. My first few weeks, it took me several minutes to shave and I had to clean up some areas with my Mach 3, now it&#x27;s much closer to 2 or 3 minutes and I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m very glad that Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns for razors. I would have been missing out.</li>
    <li> Noisy, poor shave, and overall mediocre and disappointing product.  Given the Braun name i was extremely disappointed with this product</li>
    <li> I have used a rotorary razor for about 30 years. I tried a foil wet/dry razor a few years back but it did not last very long. My last rotorary razor only lasted 3 years and when it died I took it apart to see what happened. Turns out the connector to the battery corroaded away and could not be repaired. If the cleaning method for this razor is to wash it with water would you not expect it to be waterproof? Guess not their loss. That is why  decided to try the Braun foil, and the very high rating it gets on consumer review sites. I have been using the Braun for about three weeks now and due to the cleaning system it has not even seen water. This razor shaves very close, I do not use a blade anymore. But the real secret to this razor is the cleaning system. I was sure this was just some useless selling feature but I was wrong. It works great! It is like doing the wash.First it washes the head and then it drys it without you doing anything. No more rinseing and brushing. I would say this product is one of the finest I have purchased in quite awhile. And yes I really do love it. My advise to you is &amp;#34;just buy it&amp;#34;, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> The best shave I ever got with an electric razor!</li>
    <li> I haven yet to see any flaws with using this product but if i come across any problems i will be sure to repost</li>
    <li> This shaver is awsome. I didn&#x27;t shave at all before. I use to use a beard trimmer with no guard because I would break out bad from shaving. My GF&#x27;s parents bought me a shaver for x-mas. I took the hint, my gf wanted me to shave. The only thing is they bought me a cheap rotary one. I used it and it sucked. I fingered if I was gonna shave I was going to spend some money and get a good one. I read a lot of reviews and finally decided on the 7 series. Best choice I made. I don&#x27;t break out like I use to at all. Not even close. I use aftershave lotion and this shaver. I guess one reason I like this one is that it&#x27;s not a rotary one. Those the blades were cutting my skin from all directions. This one the blades cut in one direction so I can control the direction that I&#x27;m shaving. Yes it&#x27;s almost $200 but it&#x27;s worth it. I know you probably read that a lot but it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ll pop the blade off while shaving and dump it out then shave then pop the head off again and that&#x27;s it. When I&#x27;m done I&#x27;ll stick it in the base and start the self cleaning cycle. I read reviews that the self cleaning is loud. It is if your right there in the bathroom with it but I shave last so when it&#x27;s cleaning I&#x27;m gone. If your in another room you don&#x27;t even notice it. The price for cleaning solution isn&#x27;t bad when you look at how much you&#x27;d spend on mach 12 blades in a year. The razor blade for this shaver say there supposed to last 18 months, so far mine are still cutting good after about 4 months so far. Oh yeah and I&#x27;ve gone about 3 1/2 to 4 days without shaving and then used it and it went through that kind of growth no problem. Well I mean after 4 days it does take a little longer than if you use it every day but it&#x27;s still good. It has a side burn cutter on it that fold out, I use it to touch up edges and it works good to. I actually use this for my head to. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with my head at all. For me the hard part is to get my neck under my jaw, that seams to be where this shaver has the most problem for me. The head angles up and down and not side to side so getting my neck is kinda hard. I end up not getting as close a shave there as I&#x27;d like. But all in all I really like this shaver or I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time typing this review out. OK well that&#x27;s it. hope you pick this over some cheap one.he most problem for me. The head angles up and down and not side to side so getting my neck is kinda hard.

    <li> I though a long time before buying this razor.  My first gereration unit did not shave well, pulled wiskers if I was at a 3 day growth, the trimmer kinda&#x27; worked and it was LOUD.&lt;br /&gt;All those negatives are positives with this unit Except the pulling wiskers.&lt;br /&gt;It has three power settings, the strongest is still many factors quieter.  I find low is plenty powerful for me. The trimmer, I think I could use as clippers if so motivated. It shaves much closer than the former, BUT still pulls at times.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought it, I would love to speak to the company about modifying the &#x27;head cassette&#x27; to not pull, I believe I know why. However, if you hold the razor at an angle not the recomended 90 degrees, you can cut things down in a single pass, then use 90 degrees for the final touch up.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps your decision.&lt;br /&gt;Cordially a Motor City Guy</li>
    <li> This is easily the best electric shaver I have ever used. For the last 6-7 years I&#x27;ve used the Phillips Norelco Architect. I paid a hefty $130 for it many years ago. I liked the Architect because I knew it was a premium protect and it did a good job. However, this Braun razor beats it in just about every respect. What I like most about this Braun is it causes very little irritation on my sensitive skin, it gets hard to reach hair on my neck easily, and it self cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is the price, but you are getting probably the best electric shaver on the market for your money.</li>
    <li> I have the 760 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look and feel are great.  Futuristic.  The manufacture is very good indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the neck.  It is great for the face, but the neck always needs a retouch with a different electric shaver that SHAVES the neck better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick beard hair,  and I find that the grid profile that gives the smooth feel of this shaver,  skips many flat hairs in the neck.  So you spent more time trying to get the flat oriented ones in the neck, that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a full shave with blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, if you are not a thick bearded person you can enjoy this machine a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get better shaves with cheaper Remington&#x27;s, but I won&#x27;t get rid of this Braun, because the gadget is cool, and it smells like lemons in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auto cleaning is not cheap, but gives a superb feel of asepsis and cleanness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Braun should let a 2mm band of the center grid raw  with 90 degrees border to catch better  the horizontal oriented hairs, but I don&#x27;t think they read this review.</li>
    <li> I owned Philips Norelco before, although not.bad. I would say foil is much accurate.and I think faster. Sound is tolerable. Overall I recommend Braum.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. Locking mechanism broke the first day. Essentially does nothing on my neck area.</li>
    <li> My husband says everyday since useing the Braun that he LOVES it.  Made my day as it was for his birthday and we always want to make our guys happy.</li>
    <li> This electronic shaver is amazing. I recently bought one of the top ranked panasonics, and was sorely disappointed. (see my review of it). This one is far superiors. Smooth, reliable, perfect.</li>
    <li> German engineering perfection. Love it; the AMG version for your face.</li>
    <li> It gives a nice close shave,and it cleans itself very good. I had previously owned a Braun Series 7-760 and this one is alot better overall.I recommend this shaver to any man out there.Sincerly John L. Gonzalez</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Shaver,and  is far superior  than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily with no skin irritation ,burning,or itch.When you are 88 your skin tends to dry out leading to these things!&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly endorse this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom C.</li>
    <li> My husband had the 5 series before. Loved it. This 7 series shaves closer, battery lasts longer, does everything better except trimmer is less convenient. The shaver is made in Germany, the other accessories are made in other countries.</li>
    <li> This is my second shaver. My first is still in use after 10+ years and is wonderful. Don&#x27;t know how but this new series 7 is even better. It is a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> Great shaver, easy to use and clean.  Found the cleaning solution on Amazon.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Shaving was not easy ever....until I got it. I was having hard time to shave before, with Braun 7-790cc no more pain on my face.</li>
    <li> Price was the best I was able to find, the shipping was great and delivered on time.  There has been an improvement in shavers since the shaver replaced was also a Braun, but about 12 years old.  This one shaves so much closer than the old one.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my fianc&amp;eacute; and he absolutely loves it! He&#x27;s been using it for about a month now and he has not had any bumps on his face. It gives him such a clean smooth finish (which I also love). He also loves the self-cleaning system it has. Overall, he would highly recommend this product to all men. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun shaver in the last 14 years and I could not be happier. It shaves incredibly close with no razor-burn at all (I have relatively sensitive skin on my neck). It feels incredibly well made, like a Porsche, and is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a quibble with it; it would be the trimmer that pops out. It kind of sticks out and isn&#x27;t really in a place that makes it as functional as my previous model. If I could I would give it 4.5 stars because of the trimmer, but since I can&#x27;t I&#x27;m going with the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would 100% recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used a Series 7 Braun Shaver System for more than 10 years and I like it so much I decided to get one for my Son-In-Law as a gift since he had never used a Braun before and had a bad experience with Norelco&#x27;s previously.  After one month, he loves it.</li>
    <li> replaced the same razor i have had for a couple of years, i guess it was OLD HAT and i was expecting some type of improvement.  anyway will use it for a while...at this price a long while</li>
    <li> for the price you are getting a great piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;so far (a few months) i have used this as my primary shaver and my wife has giving it her approval.&lt;br /&gt;there have been a few times i will touch up my neck with a straight edge razor b/c i am in a hurry, but this tool does a good job and the tricky spots if you give it time and take several passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its wonderful that it cleans itself, really helps keep every shave a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus the cleaning cartridge lasts a long time, still running on the original that came with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;strongly recommend to others</li>
    <li> My older Braun was much better....Over priced....This does not give a smooth shave  and the blue strip is missing compared to my other Braun...</li>
    <li> I have used electronic razors from time to time eventually migrating back to the blade when the need for a close shave just meant more than the convenience of electric. Here is razor that delivers on closeness, comfort, and ease. Well built, with a cleaning system that works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun with the cleaning station for years and it gave the best shave possible. I bought a Series 3 which was terrible, but I ised until the long hair trimmer broke. Bought the Series 7. While I love the features, it grabs and rips single hairs out which hurts like heck. It gets very frustrating. For $190 it should give a more comfortable shave. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This Braun series 7-790cc is the BEST shaver I have ever used.  It gives me the closest share I have experienced and the shaver is easy to use.  I look forward to shaving each day.  Thanks Braun for creating this Great Shaver.</li>
    <li> I switched from the 5 blade razors that cost $45 for 15 to this.  I used an electric razor years ago and I hated the shave, it was never close enough.  Well, an electric will never get as close as a blade, but this gets pretty close.  And the fact that I don&#x27;t have to lather my face up and cut myself all the time is a good trade off.  I am actually shaving more since there is so much less preparation and clean up.  Oh, and it cleans itself, that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> five star ， but its has more discount after i bought it  oh~~~ be a little  disappointed</li>
    <li> I had already owned a Braun Series 7-790cc shaver, when my wife&#x27;s electric shaver had broken down, so she needed to borrow my Braun shaver  for the day. Well, she fell in love with my shaver. She loved how it shaved compared to her old shaver, and how the shaver cleaned itself up by either running it under water or by placing it into the cleaning fluid station. My wife was so impressed with the shaver, she bought her own Braun Series 7-790cc shaver. I like how you can get parts at your local stores for this shaver&#x27;s foil &amp; cutter cassette along with the cleaning cartridge when needed. It seems to be a well made product that preforms  great for getting a close shave. I use to always use a razor to shave, but now I don&#x27;t hesitate to grab the Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors in the  past, but have mostly been a manual razor guy. Getting tired of the pulling and irritation from my blade (Gillette Fusion), I decided to go back to electric. After reading way too many reviews, it came down to the Braun or the Panasonic. Since I&#x27;ve had a Braun in the past, and it got more positive reviews, I pulled the trigger and my wife bought this for me for fathers day. I&#x27;ve used it every day since, and absolutely love it. I do a full clean in the base every other day. So far, after 4 weeks of use, the base still shows the cleaning solution to be full. I do use lectric shave pre shave lotion. My face has never felt smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this to anyone trying to decide if they want electric. Obviously, don&#x27;t spend the money on this model if you lack full facial hair. I purchased my razor on amazon and saved $90 over what they wanted at my local stores.</li>
    <li> Performs well. Convenient cleaning/charging system. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It can always shave my thick beard very well.</li>
    <li> Takes sometime to get use to this after years of circular razor, but so far clean shaving every morning . The cleaning mode is excellent.</li>
    <li> This was a Father&#x27;s Day gift to update his Braun Series 3 shaver that had finally quit after 8 years.  He absolutely loves it!!!! Braun has once again surpassed his expectations in an electric razor.  He loves the way it glides on his skin and does not hurt.  We will continue to buy Braun.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver, however there are few things to consider before plunking down hard earned money towards it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The shave is pretty good.  85% of what you&#x27;d get using a double edge razor.  Good enough for me on a day to day basis, especially because it&#x27;s fast and you don&#x27;t cut yourself.  I actually like the shave intensity buttons.  They are great for me because my neck is prone to getting red from a hot electric razor.  This one is really good about avoiding that.&lt;br /&gt;2) The cleaning station is great.  I&#x27;ve had Norelco&#x27;s in the past and the ALL broke.  Every single one of them broke.  This works consistently and leaves a great smelling razor.  Worth the $5 every month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;3) The fast clean option is a waste of money.  I regret getting this razor over the less expensive version without the fast clean.  For some reason the sterilization level on the razor itself never resets all the way...  If you are in a rush than just popping the head off and brushing it is a better idea as it keeps the razor dry.&lt;br /&gt;4) Speaking of sterilization level- pretty gimmicky.  Not sure I really like having LCD bars that give sort of random and useless info.  Again the razor which is one level down is less expensive and uses a less gimmicky LED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) This gets its own line because it&#x27;s a huge pet peeve of mine.  The product I received was clearly a returned product.  Much of the plastic wrap was missing, and the standard packaging was not complete... the box itself was sealed with one piece carelessly applied tape.  For the record I chose &amp;#34;standard packaging&amp;#34; instead of frustration free packaging.  I don&#x27;t know how long the previous owner used it, if they abused it, etc.  It is completely unacceptable to purchase a $200+ item and receive somebody&#x27;s sloppy seconds.  I recommend taking Amazon&#x27;s price and finding a brick and mortar store that is willing to price match (many do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I&#x27;d buy this razor again.  I&#x27;ve owned a lot of Norelcos and a few Brauns.  This one is the best I&#x27;ve tried (including the newest Norelco... tried that twice, once the cleaning station broke after a month, the other time the razor was just DOA).  To scared to try a Panasonic because of battery QC issues.  This is the best I&#x27;ve had so far, but I&#x27;d definitely rather buy offline if I had to do it again.a lot of Norelcos and a few Brauns.

    <li> I love it, it makes me happy everytime i will shave. like never before.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Big improvement over the earlier Braun.</li>
    <li> i have  this  item for 3 month  iit was working fine but blade got bad in 3 month  i dont find the number to contact</li>
    <li> Great Shaver.. only one complain, little uncomfortable and skin irritation in neck and mustache area.. I am giving 4 stars because I am new to electric shaving so I think I have to give it little more time to get used to electric shaving...</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun 5 series for over 4 years.  I decided to get the 7 series and I love it!  The shaver head is very different in how it feels as compared to the 5 series.  This one gives a quicker and smoother shave when compared to the 5.</li>
    <li> There are easy ways to greatly extend the life of the cleaning cartridge.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. This is the second Braun shaver I have bought in the last twenty years. I hope this one last as long as the other one.</li>
    <li> Wow, wow, wow. It took me months to pull the trigger on buying this... Shouldn&#x27;t have waited! I&#x27;ve always used normal razors, 3,5,100 blade whatever was newest. I ALWAYS got razor burn on my neck, no matter how I shaved. First use with this glorious machine, no burn and just as smooth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for the past few days and have been extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is great. The shaver feels great in your hand. It&#x27;s solid, has a hefty feel, but not too heavy. It&#x27;s made of quality materials that justify the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave was great - extremely close - nearly the same as a razor. And I&#x27;ve just switched from a rotary shaver so the Braun will probably shave even better once my beard/skin adjusts to the new way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning module/charging stand is fine. Cleaning is a breeze and the LED indicators make it easy to know when to clean and when to change the cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review after a few weeks, but first impressions/first shaves have been above expectations.</li>
    <li> I had tried various different electric shavers in the past. I always wound up going back to blades due to poor shaves. Unfortunately I knick myself with blades once in a while. Due to this I would never shave every day. A friend recommended the Braun Series 7 shaver, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricy, but after having used it for 2 months now, I am convinced. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It will not shave as close as a blade, but comes close. Easy to use &amp; self clean.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver!.  Cut close and no nicks.  Cleaner works great.  I rinse the head very well prior to putting it in the cleaner cartridge which will prolong the use of the fluid.  Use some pre electric shave fluid on your face which helps to lift the beard for an even closer shave.  I have to touch up a bit with a Gillette power but only every other time and usually on the neck.</li>
    <li> I have used rotary shavers for many years, but their inability to deal with longer beard hairs is frustrating. After reading many favorable reviews of this shaver, I decided to give it a try. Result: much closer shaves, and no long hair problems. Also, it is much faster than the three-head rotary. However, I think that I could do without the charging/cleaning cradle. When I travel, I don&#x27;t take the cradle with me, and I don&#x27;t miss it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Very close shave every time, I have very sensitive skin and this gives no irritation to my face.</li>
    <li> This shaver is by far the best unit I ever used.  It is adjustable to 3 different whisker types, very smooth and fast. Worth the money. Is is superior to my 2 other Braun shavers and rotary shavers.</li>
    <li> Good electric razor.  Still not as good as the blade.  I do like  it and could recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> It does a good job. There isnt that much of a leap from the previous model I bought in 2009 from this one. It is sleeker and better designed and has a more engaging led display. But as far as the actual cut it is very similar. I like braun and they do a good job. I use this every morning.</li>
    <li> My daily shave is so close I can almost skip the next morning, in fact, some days I do.  I have owned Sheik, Remington, the 3 head Norelco among others.  This is head and shoulders above them all in my book and on my face.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t it had it long...........but so far so good! Had an electric corded razor so having it cordless is really nice.  Husband walks around the house while shaving! Nice super smooth shave!  Would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Nice razor.  Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my high-end rotary razor but a good comfortable razor.</li>
    <li> good shaver and fast delivered.</li>
    <li> When I read all the comments I thought this is the best shaver ever,  but when I purchased it i noticed it differs from what I had heard or read.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the plastic parts are sooooooooo cheap, most of the parts are made in china.&lt;br /&gt;But more importantly this shaver is NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR SHAVING AROUND THE NECK! I have to spend long time to shave the neck area and even at the end I see the shaving is not uniform. Some parts are shaved and other parts or left unshaved. Even  for other places on the face I have to work really hard to have it clean, and at the end its not the way company was advertising it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I spent hefty amount of money to get a so called good quality shaver that I can keep it for a long time, but you don&#x27;t believe me that I had to go and buy razors again!&lt;br /&gt;So very unhappy with it and would never recommend it to anybody else. My money was literally wasted.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if the Panasonic model is better or not, I wont trust the advertisements anymore.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  It gives a quick, close shave.  But, the loudest electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have now had this shaver well over a year.  I purchased it based on the reviews and it is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system works well.  The shaver shaves closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve ever used.  Is it as close as a blade?  Well not quite, but similar to a blade shave after maybe 4-5 hours, so not bad.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but nice to switch off from a blade on the weekends.  (I have a light, spotty beard which does not look good if I don&#x27;t shave.)  Would I recommend? Highly.  Would I repurchase?  Definitely.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend and he really enjoys it !</li>
    <li> As good as it gets!  I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic for years - which is an excellent shaver.  But I&#x27;ve had to replace two head sets on the Panasonic because they wear through and get holes which gouge your face.  They cost about $60 a set, and its coming up time to do another.  And the battery&#x27;s life is dropping off.  So I knew it was time to get a new razor, and I trust Consumer Reports who rated the Braun #1.  I got the 790 for just under $200 with free shipping.  I LOVE THE CLEANER it has - much nicer than doing it by hand - and plugging in the Panasonic every 5 days or so to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun shaves a little closer than the Panasonic - not a night-and-day difference, but a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d caution people who are tempted to refill the cleaning tank.  This is an expensive shaver, and putting inappropriate fluids in there  - or ones without the proper lubricant - could result in a shortened shaver life.</li>
    <li> Better than anything available in this country.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a few weeks now. Very good shave. Needs to be cleaned every few days to keep performance up. I don&#x27;t use the cleaning station every day, only when the shaver battery needs to be re-charged, so the cleaning cost is fairly low. Love the shaver.</li>
    <li> Good shaver does most of the things I ask it to do but it has its limitation. I like getting a close shave but this will not give me that, maybe a change of head piece will fix it.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever used. Male sure you order it with the cleaning and recharging base.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought it would.  Had older Braun shaver which still works but the series 7 has a much closer shave and in less time.</li>
    <li> I have to offer a different opinion than most of the reviews for this razor.  I&#x27;m in my 70s and have been shaving a long time with a Philips Norelco with 3 rotary blades.  It was time to change the blades again, and I thought perhaps I should purchase a new razor and see if they had improved over the years.  My conclusion: they have not.  I found this shaver much nosier, but it did not cut any closer than my Norelco - and it was much warmer on my skin.  Bottom line, I&#x27;ve gone back to my Norelco because it shaves just as close, is much quieter, and cooler on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love it, awesome Shaver</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as I would like. Have to go over same area multiple times. However, little irritation and the self-cleaning features makes it worth the price alone.</li>
    <li> A bit noisy; take 3-4 shaves before face gets used to it; but a great shave after that;</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Braun with the Series 7.  Smooth operation, close shave and painless cleaning.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD  I LOVE IT SO MUCH</li>
    <li> Have had this for over a year now. Works great and have had no problems. I would recommend this shaver. I had my other Braun for 9 years. So I hope this one will go the distance also.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shave.  Never was a big electric razor fan (even though I have had many for convenience), this one changed my mind.</li>
    <li> I thought the best way to review the 790cc is to compare it with my previous Braun Syncro System 7526. I have used 7526 for 10 years now, until last week. It is a rock solid shaver! (See my review on it here on Amazon) After 7 years, its batteries died but functioned great on power cord. In about 6 years however, the Cleaner/Charger unit failed big time. I had to pay $60 for replacement. Clearly cheaply manufactured piece that is below Braun standards, what a shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, all about this Braun 790cc: Very close and quick shave. Very powerful. No skin irritation. It completes whole shave in under 5 min. The three modes of speed is not useful to me as I need power and speed. This set is multinational: the Shaver is German, the charger/cord is Chinese, and the Cleaner unit is Hungarian. It comes with a nice carrying case but missing the foil protection cap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Closer and quicker shave than 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Clean&amp;Charger unit looks more durable and solid, expect it to last longer than that of 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- Clean&amp;Charger is very loud when compared to 7526. I can hear the motor even from behind a closed door very clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- It has a display that shows battery and hygiene percentage left, 7526 did not have this. I understand the battery remained, but do not know how it evaluates the hygiene of the shaver, the manual does not say anything about it. I checked but it does not measure how long it ran! But I don&#x27;t think that it would measure the residue on it, since if you wash it, it does not detect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5- The display however is not very clear, it looks more like some old technology black&amp;white LCD unit with stains behind a glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6- It is missing the foil protection cap the 7526 had. It protects the foil and was so durable and I used it the entire 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-Comes with a nice carrying case. The 7526 came with one but not very usable as it was bulky to hold the charger/power cord as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8- You can get a better grasp, it has a slim design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9- The cutter/foil has also a better design and more functional, and also a single block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10- The pivoting head lock button is a lot less convenient than 7526, as you have to use two hands to activate it. On 7526 it is the power button and a lot easier to go back and forth, this is definitely a down side, and downgrade from an older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11- The release button is also difficult to operate when compared to 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12- The cleaning cartridge is exactly the same with the 7526, I can use the leftover from 7526, huge plus of standardization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13- The charger and power cord set has a better socket design, but looks cheaper.er/power cord as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8- You can get a better grasp, it has a slim design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9- The cutter/foil has also a better design and more functional, and also a single block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10- The pivoting head lock button is a lot less convenient than 7526, as you have to use two hands to activate it.

    <li> So, far my husband thinks it is the best electric shaver on earth !</li>
    <li> Shaver cleans very close and clean! Also like cleaning system provided. Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have used in 40+ years</li>
    <li> This is to replace my Braun 8000 series which I believe is now the 5 series.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 series was excellent. When I read reviews about this 790 I imagined it would be better than my older model. I have used the new razor for a week. It feels good in your hand and is contoured better. It is not a better shave but it is at least just as good which was already a very good shave. I recommend the Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent in every way.</li>
    <li> Great system. Very easy to use, and shaves closer than any electric I have used with no razor burn. I like it because it is a dry shaver. Also, easy to clean, and good automatic cleaning system. BUY ONE.</li>
    <li> gift for leader, have not open it ,but the package looks well。five stars！</li>
    <li> A great razor, I&#x27;ve used the earlier Braun models and 7000 series is the best yet.</li>
    <li> Amazing shave. I am old school and have always loved my razor with a blade. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. I use it to shave my head and this is a fantastic shaver for that. By far the smoothest shave I have ever had. It gets all the little hard to reach hair and I do not have to worry about any nicks on my smooth bald head! Guys, get this one if you shave your head. The cleaning system works great too!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. He is African American and his hairs curls into his skin creating in-grown hair bumps. So far, since using these clippers he hasn&#x27;t had any problems with that happening. The shaver shaves close, but doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation. He really loves these and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Bought as a present for my BF for Christmas because I have been lecturing him on shaving more consistently, but he has sensitive skin. He now uses this thing all the time and it doesn&#x27;t bother his skin as much as normal razors. He loves that it cleans itself and as long as he keeps up with the shaving, he says he can shave very quickly.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this nice Braun shaver system!</li>
    <li> Razor works great. I have had it for over a year and replaced the blades once. I only use it in between straight razor shaves.</li>
    <li> Great product and high quality.  Shaves like a blade without the downfalls of using a blade. No razor burn in sensitive areas. I would highly recommend this product.  I was very skeptical about using anything but conventional razors until I finally tried this one.</li>
    <li> It is a great razor, but too complicated for the senior citizen we got it for.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband. His words &amp;#34; it works great &amp;#34;.  It is always good to know your gift is a hit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after being a 6 year Phillips Norelco Speed XL user and doing a lot of research into it. This Braun shaver beats the Speed XL in all categories. I was used to having little stubble left over every day but with this Braun shaver, I get a clean shave that reminds me of the days when I used a razor blade. I clean this shaver every day using the cleaning feature on the docking station and it&#x27;s been at least 3 weeks and the cleaning liquid level is still high. I was worried about this as I thought I would have to keep purchasing those cleaning pods but at this rate, it looks like I will rarely be replacing them. I would definitely recommend this product as it is by far better than anything I have ever used before.</li>
    <li> Fast, clean shave.  Better than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried.  Worth the higher cost.</li>
    <li> I purchased and received this razor about the middle of June.  I have used it every day since it came.  It does give a close shave and it does shave fast, but most of all it is very easy to clean.  One of the things I hate about an electric razor is the cleaning.  I clean mine every day and I really love that aspect of this razor.  The solution lasted a little over 40 days cleaning every day.  Not too bad.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my father...he loves it.. Delivers a great shave without any of the mess or fuss.</li>
    <li> Great shave, easy to maintain with the included clean/charge station</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 6 months now and I love it. It gets a very close shave very quickly and with minimal effort. The battery life is excellent, I went on a 3 week business trip and after shaving every day the charge level was still above half. The self cleaning feature works very well, it gets every tiny particle of debris clear of the blades all while disinfecting and lubricating. My daily shave is about 30 seconds, however after a weekend of not shaving it takes a little more effort to clean up a few days of stubble growth. I used to use a Mach 3, but never again.</li>
    <li> The 7 series has not changed much over the years.  The head is the same.  Changes have been mostly cosmetic as far as I can tell.  This is a solid shaver and good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I do like the feel of this shaver and how quiet it is. The only thing is that after the first shave, it deducts 2 notches out of the 6 or 8 for hygiene. I feel the it forces us to clean it and replace the cleaning cartridges faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not bad of a shaver.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very good product.almost everyone can be glad to own one.this good work so well that i can&#x27;t leave it anymore.but the loud noise is a problem.everytime i use ,i am always afraid.</li>
    <li> Just a great shaver. I had a Norelco years ago, but that can never compare to the great Braun I purchase from Amazon. The first time I used it I got the cleanest shave I ever got in my life. And to clean it was and is very easy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Braun Shavers I have ever owned.  It gives a premium shave&lt;br /&gt;and is closer than a blade. I really enjoy this wonderful quality.</li>
    <li> Best German Shaver with excellent Cleaning system.</li>
    <li> The shaver is for my husband&#x27;s birthday, he very love. The shaver with very convenient, than before he use that money better, now he every day will use a.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun shaver for my husband at Christmas. He LOVES LOVES it. He no longer complains with his new shaver.</li>
    <li> worse than any shaver...... does not remove hair completely.... leads to skin irritation also</li>
    <li> Shaves just as good as a blade...but without the nicks! Much better on my neck than my norelco. My norelco would irritate my neck and still not get me smooth. Wished I tried this 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> I have used all the major brands (Panasonic and Norelco) and this Braun series 7 is the best by far.  It gives an almost blade- like close shave and is a pleasure to use with the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> There is a lot one can say on reviewing anything electronic in general but I&#x27;m not one for useless words. I will say two things (that most people or all people should care about when buying an electric shaver):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Shave closeness-You will never find an electric shaver that gives a shave as close as a razor but simply said this one comes as close to it as possible.  If you are like me where a razor and shave cream effects your complexion you live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The Cost-Yes it is quite expensive. Again, simply put it is totally worth it for 4 reasons; it cleans itself, it is expensive to buy good razors and replacements (so it will pay for itself right there because you only have to replace the head every two years $30), convience in the fact that it is a lot faster then a razor shave, and last closeness of the shave (yes it is also a sub catogory of cost but needs its own review because that is the purpose of the product).</li>
    <li> I got this on sale, and its my first electric shaver. I am very happy. it gets so close to the skin and my hair grows in thick</li>
    <li> Highly recommended to me by my son and I am very pleased with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Great deal, great product, super fast shipping!! A+ all the way.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition. Packed very well.  This shaver gives a very close shave and does it quickly and quietly. I strongly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Very Good ! Very Good ! ! Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System  is  the best of all  shavers!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the close shave!</li>
    <li> This razor gives me the most cofortable and close shave I have ever had from an electric!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver the five stars because it met all of my expectations.  It shaves close and is comfortable to use.  Also, I am impressed about the quality of construction which I found to be top drawer.</li>
    <li> I am replacing the first generation of this model after six years, and can not say enough positive about it.  Why?  It provides the closest shave with the most comfortable and fast experience.  The cleaning system really does make it feel like new, even after six years.  The only reason I replaced the first generation model was that the flip-out cutter broke, and Amazon (price) +Braun ($15 off coupon) made it cost-effective to replace it.  The only thing that could be improved is the flip-out cutter is based on a plastic mechanism, which is unrepresentative of the build of the rest of the shaver and base in long-gevity.  I&#x27;ve owned Norelco prior, and nothing beats this unit from Braun.</li>
    <li> Access on time&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Packaging&lt;br /&gt;New as in the description&lt;br /&gt;good good good good good&lt;br /&gt;good good good good good</li>
    <li> so far this is the best shaver i ever had</li>
    <li> There are some negatives. The cleaning-charging system seems a little funky and the travel case is very flimsy compared with the Norelco. Other than those couple of minor details I really believe this is going to one of my best puchases ever. One other thing. This is the first product evaluation I have ever done, so i hope this isn&#x27;t too long and has been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;11</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelcos for over 35 years.  Braun gives a waaay better shave.  I will never get another Norelco again.</li>
    <li> Full sense of science and technology, excellent quality, and attractive&lt;br /&gt;I hope every man has it&lt;br /&gt;the men is  nice for it</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned.  It&#x27;s much more comfortable and a whole lot faster than the rotary style shaver I was using.&lt;br /&gt;I had doubts about spending the money but it has proven to be well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATERIALS&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels sturdy and well-built.  My old shaver feels like a cheap toy compared to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;My old rotary-style shaver left my neck looking and feeling like I had used a sander.  This shaver gives a close, comfortable shave and leaves no redness on my neck, even at the most intense setting.  I also no longer have those annoying stray hairs or patches that I would always find sticking out there later on (if you have light colored hair like I do, you probably know what I&#x27;m talking about).  It takes me less than half the time and effort it took to shave with the rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE&lt;br /&gt;At first, it seemed a little loud to me.  But when I compared it side-by-side with the rotary shaver, it was not any louder.  The sound is a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; instead of a \\&quot;whir\\&quot; but not louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING&lt;br /&gt;This part is awesome.  There is no real cleanup.  You place it into the base, hit the button and walk away.  After cleaning, I have popped off the head and found it looking like new with no hairs to be found.  It also smells fresh and clean.  No little hairs in the sink and caked on the inside.  You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Very nice unit and a really close shave.I bought a few electric shavers and I was debating on going back to the razor blade..after using this shaver a i&#x27;ll stick with this Braun very satisfied.</li>
    <li> it is a very good shaver i love it very much  .  and it is  cheap enough good item hey</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun electric for over 8 years.  It had always done a great job as long as I replaced the heads every 18 months or so.  During the last year I had been having a hard time getting a good shave even with new heads.  I decided to try a new razor and with the satisfaction I had had with the previous one I ordered the 790.  It provided a great shave from the first try.  I have it set to the strongest setting and have had no problems with it shaving close or causing any irritation.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a decent shave from an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver out on the market right now, no doubt. I picked it up on here for $150 and amazon has the best price on this shaver. The shaver has 3 modes which is amazing. The shaver is quality built. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Really it&#x27;s worth it&lt;br /&gt;No pain in shaving and very clean and quick</li>
    <li> Absolutely the finest electric shaver available. It is an incredible shaver that is easy to use and does a remarkable job of shaving .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and it is a fantastic shaver. It&#x27;s so easy to use (and pain free), so he shaves more often which I love!</li>
    <li> Have not used a razor since purchasing for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I just got this shaver, and it&#x27;s much better than my rotary shaver. I can&#x27;t imagine an electric razor shave being any better than this.</li>
    <li> my son researched this and I ordered for xmas present  he loves this shaver  serves his needs to a tee</li>
    <li> i looo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo oo oo ooo ooo oo  oooo  oo o  o oo  ve it</li>
    <li> after 2 years engine died</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> As close to a straight razor shave as you can get, IMHO. Odd that it fits into the cleaner at an angle - but it just does...</li>
    <li> close shave, painless, but difficult to clean- must run through cleaning twice, slow- must pass over each facial area twice.</li>
    <li> Whether I have a 5 day old beard or a 1 day old beard, this shaver gets me a very close shave every time and I don&#x27;t get neck burns.  I think I&#x27;ll keep using this one.</li>
    <li> This is the third electric braun razor that I have owned.  While I am statisfied with the performance so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as cleanly as the previous generation.  I have to work a little harder to get all of the stray hairs on my neck.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a new razor.  I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for years and this is the first self cleaning one.  Five stars for this one.</li>
    <li> Best shaver i have ever owned, no irritation, amazing cleaning system, long lasting battery!!!</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Greatest razor I ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Nicest razor I ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Best razor I ever had!</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver, not please with results.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift and this shaver surpassed our expectations. Well worth the money. Would recommend to anyone without hesitation. Great close shaves time after time. Would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> My 6-years-old Phillip  shaver was dead, so I had to buy a new one. After research, I selected Braun 790cc.  Maybe my old one is obsolete, and I was so impressed by the result. The automatic cleaning system is amazing as well. I usually clean it after 3 or 4 times shaving.  I don&#x27;t have any experience of using other latest shavers, such as Phillip and Panasonic, but I am very satisfied with this one. I would like to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver purchase. My first one, I had used it for 3 years, got lost/stolen in Paris hotel on a business trip. I am very happy with this product. Very reliable. I use it everyday. Very easy to clean. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think it is very good.I think it is very good.I think it is very good.I think it is very good.</li>
    <li> I changed from phillip shaver.  No more red bumps on my face.  After the washing and cleaning, the head of the shaver smells clean!.  It shaves as smooth as my son&#x27;s butt... well, I am exaggerating a little bit. But it shaves as good as any razors but with no cuts!</li>
    <li> mustache shaved not too clean&lt;br /&gt;mustache shaved not too clean&lt;br /&gt;mustache shaved not too clean&lt;br /&gt;i do not like it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I never gave electric a real shot, but glad I listened to my father in law! This is a great razor, very happy with it. Leaves face really smooth, and no neck bumps.</li>
    <li> This shaver feels like a 2nd day shave, not a clean shave (I hope that makes sense)  For $200 I was expecting my husbands face to feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 gives a decent shave.  I have a pretty tough beard, and as long as I shave each day on a regular basis, it does a decent job.  It struggles with some closeness around the chin/mouth edges, and as with most, ingrown hairs put it to shame most of the time.  The trimmer does not trim very close at all unless you&#x27;re looking to gross trim the sideburns.  I do like the ability to clean/sanitize it, but before you do, take the screen/head assembly off and rinse well under hot water.  ergonomics a pretty good for holding.  Read the directions well-- you CANNOT use this in the shower, something I maybe would like to do.</li>
    <li> Very Clearn, very modern! I like it ,very very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope you all love it!&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful machine</li>
    <li> Although I do like the shaver, the alcohol based cleaning system gets residue on your face so do it before a shower or wash your face after.  Oh and sometimes it makes a loud sound like it is getting jammed on a thick hair.  This shaves a little bit better then my old 3 blade rotary shaver, but I doubt it is much better then the newer rotary shavers.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 790cc and the saler contacted me and said they shipped the wrong one and would return the difference.  So far I love it.  I have not used the cleaner and I am not sure if I ever will but my last Braun was bought over 10 years ago and still works just the battery is getting weaker.  I have replaced the blade a few times and the screen once.  So if this one has the longivity of that one I will never buy another brand.  And did I meantion the shave is amazing.  If I want it really close I can just use shaving cream but for a day to day shave on the go for work, I am in the military, it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this Braun razor, it performs better than my expectations as far as closeness and ease of cleaning. Compared to my past electric razors this one is far superior to any. I would certainly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I never realized how nice an electric razor would be until I used this. I will never go back to blade razors again. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to take with you, easy to get a great shave!</li>
    <li> I think all the features are great. I like the digital display on the bottom that shows how dirty the head is and how much battery you have left. I like the charging base that also cleans and lubricates the shaving head. However, in order to save on the cost of getting new cleaning solution so much I usually give the head a rinse before I put it through a cleaning cycle so it doesnt have so much to clean. Something worth knowing, the digitial &amp;#34;hygiene&amp;#34; scale on the bottom that tells you how dirty your shaving head unit is does not do this with any kind of sensor. it knows how long the head has been running in between cleaning cycles and figures, &amp;#34;ok, it&#x27;s probably this dirty.&amp;#34; I have given it a thorough cleaning and the gauge doesn&#x27;t reset until I run it through a cleaning cycle on the charging/cleaning stand. I still like having the gauge despite this because it still gives me an idea of how long it&#x27;s been since I (or the base unit) have given the shaver head a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest disappointment is the shaving quality. In order for me to get a close shave I have to really push the shaving head against my skin. I have found that pushing as hard as I need to to get a great shave will pretty much always give me some pretty bad ingrown hairs. The vibrating heads are supposed to help lift hairs up into the shaving head but often times I will have hairs that I wont get shaved unless I pinch my skin so the hair sticks straight out and then put the shaver to the hair. You can adjust the intensity of the vibrations (lighter for more sensitive areas, stronger for the more thick and tough areas) but I run into the same problem I just stated. I put it on the sensitive setting and it doesn&#x27;t shave as well; I put it on the more intense setting and I get ingrown hairs. I usually just end up getting a mediocre shave and only one or two ingrown hairs verses having a great, close shave and 10 bad ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its easy to maintain, you can get it wet, and it does OK at shaving so I give it a three star rating but I will not be buying another one when my current one dies.it wet, and it does OK at shaving so I give it a three star rating but I will not be buying another one when my current one dies.</li>
    <li> as a 50yr user ofr norelco i was really surprised by the excellent shaveswi received much closer then all previous norelcos.</li>
    <li> Braun changed their shavers a few years ago and none of them shave as close as the older models and older foil design.  The new foil and cutter design doesn&#x27;t leak out hair dust like the older sets but the close shave has been sacrificed.</li>
    <li> I am in the military and must shave every day to stay in regs.  My face was just so worn out from using a manual razor every day that I started to look for an electric.  I was concerned about the closeness of the shave, because I am held to a high standard.  The Braun 790cc has been the answer to my concerns.  It gets me in regs every day and saves my face from razor burn.  It of course does not get as close as a manual razor, but no electric will.  If it keeps me in regs through out the week then I am happy!  It also cleans itself which is nice.  Sometimes I wish I could shave in the shower but not a big deal.  I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a solid electric.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, in regards to Shaving Systems. I have very rough and coarse facial hair, and while it takes me about 15 minutes to shave, I can&#x27;t honestly complain about that. Not when I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn, or buying stupid blades every two weeks. Buy this thing, and save yourself some trouble.</li>
    <li> This razor seems to do a good job especially for someone else that is doing the shaving.  I have not had to use the refill cartridges yet.</li>
    <li> You really don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles on this thing but after a week, this thing really performed great! The trimmer is a little hard to push out at first but it only took a week or two for it to smoothly open and close. The charging light can be doubled as a search rescue light too. That thing is bright! Very smooth and clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Braun shavers, each adds improvements.  This one follows suit. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> It gives a very close shave and easy to use. I like the cleaning and docking station. It recharges while cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shaver that I could use every day. When I didn&#x27;t have to shave daily I preferred to use a double edge razor (merkur 37c with feather blades). But a double edge shave is too close for a daily shave. I have tried a few other high end electric shavers but they never got close enough for my liking or they were just too harsh on my face. So they weren&#x27;t good for daily shaving. I read many reviews that the braun was a great razor but the reviews of other razor were great too. The braun got my face smooth enough in all areas except the sideburns. The high end Panasonic got me just  as close but wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable of a shave. My face is more comfortable after shaving than it has ever been. I have had the razor for about a week and have been shaving everyday with zero irritation or redness. Another thing that&#x27;s amazing with this razor that I haven&#x27;t seen with others is the long battery life. I can get 5 15 minutes shaves before needing to recharge. Though I&#x27;ve never ran it down completely so it could be more. My shave time with the Panasonic was 20-25 minutes and 30-35 minutes with the norelco. I feel that this is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had though not the closest. But my goal is to look clean shaven at all times.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about how good it could be, but this is easily the best razor made.  Cuts as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> Far and away the finest electric shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I actually look forward to shaving with this razor.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but it shaves as close as my razor. And my beard is pretty thick. While you can clean it manually,  I would recommend purchasing the cleaning fluid as well. Unbelievably close shave. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have been using a norelco razor for years and decided to tray something different after looking at the ratings in consumer reports.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this razor to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I switched to the Braun after doing some research on the best electric razors and while the machine is nice and functional, I seem to have a lot more problems with my skin after shaving.  I find that it also leaves a lot of neck hairs and it also takes twice as long to shave as my previous razor.  I am switching back.</li>
    <li> This shaver is exactly what I wanted.  No more loose hairs to fight over when try to get a really close shave.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Being a life long manual blade user after a disappointing experience with a rotary electric razor in my twenties, and after much research, I purchased this razor.  And I have to say it was money very well spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard and sensitive skin. This razor comfortably and cleanly gives me a close shave with no skin irritation. It quietly buzzs the hair off. It&#x27;s was an easy adjustment from the blade to this electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station is great.  It keeps the razor clean and functioning at peak performance. It is worth paying the extra for it.  The  blade always smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research paid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Thanks to Tyler at Electric Shaver Guide lots of good information</li>
    <li> I received a Remington MS2-390 back in 2006 as a gift and used it for 6 years before looking for a replacement.  The Remington was still working, but the rubber button on the on/off switch was falling apart (though the unit was still working excellently otherwise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a dry-shaver. I shave about 15 min after my shower every day and use Lectric Shave before every shave.  I am clean shaven, have fairly course straight hair, but the hair on my neck does not always stick out in the same direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Remington MS2-390:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington was a nearly perfect unit.  It rarely pulled any hairs, cut cleanly and quickly.  It was easy to clean, water resistant and could go for 2 weeks on a single charge even after 6 years of daily use.  It is also super cheap about $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my favorite feature of the Remington was the sideburn trimmer.  You press a button and it rose up about 1/2 inch from it&#x27;s resting position.  While this was supposed to be for sideburns, I used it on my neck once I was done shaving to catch all of those long neck hairs that were missed.  These hairs were not always trimmed super closely, but they were pretty close and were then easier to get at for a final pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that you could get a super clean shave quickly with almost no long neck hairs left out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 790cc:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing much research I bought the Braun thinking that the ActiveLift would do the same thing I was doing with the Remington for shaving my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is much heavier than the Remington and took a bit of getting used to.  Once used to it, I notice that my overall shaving time is roughly the same.  For the non-neck regions the Braun and Remington give almost the same shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be very careful with the Braun about the direction in which you are shaving.  The foil is not quiet edge to edge (you can even see this in the picture) so if you pull the shaver horizontally across an unshaved area the Braun can easily give you a nasty pull on your hair.  I see this as a disappointing design flaw coming from such an expensive razor, but if you are careful in your shaving routine, this is avoidable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Braun you also have to be super careful around your lips due to the always constant activelift.  If you do not angle the razor properly the activelift turns into an active lip nicker.  This is likely unavoidable if you are to include this feature in a razor.  Just be aware that you will have to angle this razor so only one of the two foils is touching your face when you are around your lips.  Again this is not an issue if you are careful in your shaving routine, but it does take more passes in this area to get a close shave since you are only using one foil instead of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun does do a good job in the neck region, but it does take a lot of passes.  The method I used with the Remington does not work with the trimmer in the Braun and thus I have to use many passes and hope that the activelift does it&#x27;s job.  If you spend enough time the Braun can give you a better neck shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system of the Braun is the major selling feature.  It is very convenient and even though the Braun is slightly longer in cutting, the cleanup makes up for it.  The cleaning system is very loud when it runs.  I wish they would program in a delay option to let it run 15 minutes after you press the button so you don&#x27;t have to hear it while you are finishing getting ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the Braun 790CC better than the Remington MS2-390?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Is it $140 better? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun shaver is ridiculously expensive compared to the Remington which gives you almost as good a shave.  The Braun also has small quirks like lacking edge-to-edge foil coverage which you really would expect in such an expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it over again, I would have purchased another Remington.  However, I do have to admit that the Braun 790CC is a great overall razor and does produce better results when shaving your neck.s small quirks like lacking edge-to-edge foil coverage which you really would expect in such an expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it over again, I would have purchased another Remington.  However, I do have to admit that the Braun 790CC is a great overall razor and does produce better results when shaving your neck.</li>
    <li> Auto cleaning is a real advantage of this model but in shaving quality I still like my Philips 3D better.</li>
    <li> My old Braun still works, but was getting very noisy.  After reading the reviews I decided to spring for the Series 7-790cc and am glad I did. Not only is it much quieter, but it shaves quicker and closer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband that has used an electric razor before.  He swore he would never use another one.  He absolutely loves this shaver.  I purchased it for his birthday.  It gives him a very smooth shave.  Better than the Gillette manual razor or the electric Norelco he&#x27;s used in the past.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  It&#x27;s also self cleaning.</li>
    <li> The 790cc is the best shaver I used! Ever!&lt;br /&gt;Shaves closer and cleaner than my previous Philips and best of all, self cleaning at a touch of a button.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver almost 2 years ago to replace a venerable Braun&#x27;s Series 5 8985, looking to take advantage of the newer pulsating technology that my brother and some friends I trust told me was amazing. My brother has a beard as thick as polar bear fur, so if this shaver can go through that and survive -and satisfy him-, it was a very simple decision for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving result is definitively better with the series 7, I get a smoother face and where the Series 5 had to pass several times, the 7 gets it done in one or two passes. This in turn reduces irritation to the skin; I get none or only once in a while bumps and ingrown hair with this shaver and it last longer. And the ability to change the intensity of the shaving is very helpful for the neck and when you just want to retouch and still have very short hair; nice shave at minimum contact thus less irritation. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the end result and the premium over the series 5 is justified, this is a better, more modern machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not free of shortcomings. Even if the rubber grip is welcomed for a safer grip, the design is not that ergonomic and it takes time to adapt and find the proper way to handle it right, it feels just awkward for a few days. Then there is the strangely placed trimmer: by placing it on inside and not on the outside like the Series 5, the body of the shaver combined with your hand blocks your view when using the trimmer at certain angles, particularly your left hand sideburn if you are right-handed (and it would be the opposite if you are a lefty). The only way to unblock the view is to switch hands, which is not only silly but dangerous for the health of your sideburns. Also, after two years of use the paint on the border of the shaver&#x27;s body close to the head is peeling off, apparently caused by the long time use of cleaning agent (made also by Braun by the way); it has no impact on performance but it looks bad and cheap. Painted plastic in the 21st century? Really? Common&#x27; Braun!  And don&#x27;t try to get it repaired or replaced easily, I live in Florida and have to send my shaver to Massachusetts! For service! And in the mean time I shave with... a kitchen knife?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue might be the duration of the cleaning agent when compared to the Series 5, it lasts  at least 30% less time, but this might be more an issue of a lighter cleaner than a different cleaning system, so I don&#x27;t blame it on the shaver. I noticed the cleaning solution have changed as sometimes it leaves an oily, yellow residue on the sides of the shaving head, thing didn&#x27;t do in the past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, this is a Ferrari on a Geo Metro body. If Braun could pay more attention to design and body quality, as well as product testing on the trimmer, they would have a really amazing, extraordinary product. Right now they have just a nice onehe 21st century? Really? Common&#x27; Braun!

    <li> Best shaver I ever own.</li>
    <li> I have tested quite a few shavers over the years.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive skin and every other shaver I tried irritated it badly.&lt;br /&gt;This one have been amazing since the first use. No irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great power, it shaves very nicely, no irritation, and the cleaning base... is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I used it until it gets to the red mark (time to clean), put the fluid on the base (I don&#x27;t leave it there all the time. It&#x27;s alcohool based and will evaporate) and push the clean button.&lt;br /&gt;Next shave, it is as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the build quality. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> My husband needed a replacement for his previous Braun razor which lasted 6 or 7 years. This razor did not disappoint and he is very happy with it. A great price through Amazon. We will definitely shop here again for this razor when this current one dies.</li>
    <li> I was questionning about having for one time a good shaver. My beard is hard and with my previous shavers, after 2 pm it was Like if i didn t shave. serie 7 790 is just a perfect shaver. Quality parts. Good battery. Can be used during 1 week without charging. So close shave. I recommand it.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is a great razor and I would highly recommend to anyone interested in it.  Thank you much</li>
    <li> My husband had been wanting this for a couple of years. I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much, and we stuck to discount shavers. I saw a great deal on this, and even though it cost more then I wanted to spend, I bought it for him. He LOVES it, and says it would have been worth it to buy full price. He is in the military, so needs to be clean cut. He uses it daily, and has done so for the last 4 months, and has no issues with it. He tells everybody he knows to buy one. He will never go back to off brands again.</li>
