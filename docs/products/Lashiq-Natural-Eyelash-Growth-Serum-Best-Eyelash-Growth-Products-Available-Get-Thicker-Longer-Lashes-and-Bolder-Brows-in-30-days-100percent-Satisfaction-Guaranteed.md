<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been very pleased with LashIQ! I have used other similar products which have stung when used. This product is easy to use, gentle, and effective. My lashes look great, are in great condition, and are definitely longer. Thanks LashIQ i feel smarter every day:-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and it&#x27;s amazing!! Lashes are noticeably longer! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try this because i have been using lattise for the last six months.  I stopped using the latisse about 8 weeks before starting use of this product. My eyelashes had gone back to their &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; length and mass.  After weeks of use, it really seems to be working.  Only time will tell because i have just about two more weeks until I have been using it long enough to get the full benefit.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference in three days! I think this is money well spent!</li>
    <li> In two weeks I saw results. My lashes are longer and thicker. I will definitely buy again. I have used Babe lashes and other eyelash serums and after a two weeks of using it I didn&#x27;t see any more growth, and with LashIQ I still see results and it has almost been a month .</li>
    <li> Great product.  Saw an increase in thickness of lashes within 2 weeks. The price is definitely more affordable and it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lashiq for about a month. After pulling a few lashes out with my curler, I hoped to fill in the bare spot as quickly as possible. I can see a difference since starting Lashiq. I&#x27;m anxious to see the change after 2 months!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lashig Natural Eyelash Growth Serum for 6 weeks and it does work. My lashes are noticably longer and thicker. I started seeing results after just a few weeks. It is as simple to use as applying your mascara. This serum is all natural and did not cause me any eye irratation or redness. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I have only been using for a few weeks but have noticed a difference. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I adore this serum. I have been using it to add more definition to my brows, basically making it more visible/bolder/bigger/etc. My eye lashes have definitely grown in length and I love how it looks. Throughout my life my lashes have always been short but now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, and she loves it!  She used to complain about the price of similar store bought products.  She didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her I bought it for so cheap!  Easily a 10/10, better than name brand!</li>
    <li> I have been using LashIQ for about 3 weeks. I am starting to see a definite increase in the length of my lashes. I&#x27;m confident with continued use I will see an increase in the fullness of my lashes. The product has not irritated my eyes or caused any redness, like previous eyelash growth serums I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month. I have noticed a growth on upper and lower lashes. Not as fast growing as I had hoped. Still a good product with results.</li>
    <li> I have a personal issue that caused my lashes to be minimal and scarce...I have only been using this product for about 8 days and I am so HAPPY!!!!...I have lashes again and they look great!!...will be reordering and would definitely reccomend</li>
    <li> Love the product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye. I will be using it for long time.</li>
    <li> did not use for to long..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I have seen a significant increase in my length and thickness of my eyelashes. I have tried other serums before and I love that this is all natural and don&#x27;t cause any irritation. You only apply it once a day which is very convienent and I can&#x27;t wait until the full 30 days to see how great my eyelashes will look. I am only giving it 4 stars now because I haven&#x27;t completed the full 30 days but I am certain at the end of the that time period, it will defintely get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product!  I have tried other similar products and this has been the best by far. My sister recommended another serum she uses but the price point was way beyond my budget so I passed.   LASHIQ is very economical and gives great results.  I have used this serum for about 3 months already and can&#x27;t stop bragging about my new longer, great looking, eye lashes. I started seeing results within the first 3 weeks of use. Very easy to apply with simple straight forward directions you cannot go wrong.  I recommend it to anybody with small lashes that is trying to get that extra length. My husband noticed the difference right away and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I am so confused why people like this product! I try to listen to people&#x27;s reviews before buying any product and I would have to say, I am pretty disappointed in this product. I don&#x27;t see any results at all! Spend money on something that works</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with results.  They were exactly as advertised and help my lashes stay longer and stronger.  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> does not work at all. Have been using it for more than 2 weeks and  I am now even more skeptical about eyelash growth product thanks to this one :(</li>
    <li> I love Lashiq!  My eyelashes are really thick and long since I have been using Lashiq.</li>
    <li> I bought this beacuse, i had a part of my right eye lashes was not growing. had tryed castor oil for months not work. Took Special vit..:( After using this product nightly for a week i see a differance..:) Yeaaa.  I put where i see it each night. just a dab will do.  Now  my Eye Lashes are so healthy looking. Love this  Product Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Although I was a little hesitant to try LashIQ because I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before it has worked very well.  After about 4 weeks I really noticed a change in my lashes and it has definitely made a difference. It&#x27;s easy to apply just once a day before bedtime.  My lashes are noticeably fuller and healthier and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I’m not one to wear much make up, generally if I do anything make up wise it’s mascara and some eye liner and that’s about it. So, my eyelashes are important to me. I’m also not willing to put just anything on them or near my eyeballs for that matter. I won’t be discussing mascara or eyeliner  though. Before trying this out I wasn’t even aware there was a natural eye lash growth product! This by the way can be used on both your eyelashes and your eyebrows. I however do not need help in the brow department and if those babies aren’t tamed every now and then I might look like caterpillars are invading my forehead… moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a few weeks before starting posting this and I was a bit more excited than I thought I would be when I saw a few little eyelashes sprouting up. This stuff actually works. Length wise I’d say currently at only a few weeks it is minimally noticeable, the fact that it has only been a few weeks makes me believe long term the results length wise will be more dramatic. The fullness of my eyelashes has increased, little itty bitty eyelash hairs sprouted out and started to make my eyelashes look fuller! In just a few weeks it is noticeable! Again, with extended use I’m sure the length and fullness will be even more dramatic! I’m really surprised that the quick growth claims were in fact accurate as I thought it’d take longer to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that I had a bit of flakyness in the mornings only on the inner bit of my eye. It was not extremely bothersome. I just would wipe my eyes in the morning and I was golden. I did not get any bad reaction to this (my sensitive skin has been happy), no weird side effects nothing negative really to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not sure if you can see the difference but I sure can! I can see it, feel it and I love this stuff! Props to Lash IQ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> 11 days 0 results, will write back later, hoping that it will work after longer use, but so far nothing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I saw results within a week. Just so you know this was a purchase on my part not a freebie. I was skeptical after having tried some different brands from the drugstore but boy am I glad I did. I have always has skimpy lashes and after several weeks you can definitely see a difference. Do not hesitate to try it. I have had no side effects and it is simple to use. Just brush it on at night before bed and done! Excellent product I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using lash IQ for about a month now. I do notice that my lashes are longer, but they are not thicker or any darker then my normal blonde lashes. I like that the product does not burn your eyes when you put it on unlike some other products. I hope that continuing to use it, my lashes WILL get thicker and darker!</li>
    <li> Great Product - easy to use.  Definately makes lashes thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I always see these types of products advertised and I was pretty skeptical but when I saw a friend who&#x27;s lashes were visibly longer and thicker I decided to give it a try. After using the product for about 2-3 weeks I saw significant results. Several people asked me what  mascara I use but I told them the secret was not in my mascara, it was LashIQ. This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Did not use long enough to see if it&#x27;s effective. Not impressed with an applicator - it&#x27;s either defective or poorly designed. Need to be very careful to avoid dripping. The serum itself does not cause any irritation or redness. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now - see a hint of lash improvement. I think I may like the product eventually if I don&#x27;t loose a lot because of this dripping problem.</li>
    <li> This February I had eyelashes put on and the next morning I had knocked off the middle portion of the eyelashes.  I could not get the rest off so I cut my eyelashes!  I then began searching for an eyelash serum and Lashiq had good reviews and seemed easy enough to apply.  It is now mid March and my eyelashes have come back and look healthier and better than before.  You simply apply to lash line at night before bed.  Very happy with results!</li>
    <li> Product did not work on my lashes. Used for 4-5 weeks, nightly and had no growth or thickness to lashes. Was very disappointed.  Also not easy to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> NO DIFFERENCE! Been using as instructed for about 3 weeks... Nothing. I used once a day at night per instructions. I&#x27;m going back to my salon weekly for faux lashes until I can get a product really works!</li>
    <li> no colour. It is a serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and see no difference.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and even more sensitive eyes. I have had no issues with irritation. It is early in the treatment cycle, but I have to say my lashes are looking healthier and thicker. Product is easy to use.</li>
    <li> LashIQ Natural Eyelash Enhancing Serum is really easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it so it will not cause any irritation. I use LashIQ for 4 weeks on the base of my eyelashes and my results are amazing. I usually experience eyelash breakage and while using LashIQ my eyelashes were stronger, and they even grew longer. I&#x27;m impressed with LashIQ Natural Eyelash Enhancing Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Sent for review purposes via LashIQ. However, the opinions expressed are honest and my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my mother in law and myself and is has been working on both of us amazingly! I definitely recommend it, I have small thin eyelashes and lashiq is defiantly helping them get longer and thicker.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my lashes have thinned. I saw this and thought I&#x27;d try it. This stuff is AMAZING!  My lashes look full again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I am noticing my lashes are getting longer!!  I even got a compliment from a friend about how long my natural lashes are without wearing mascara.  I will continue to use the product!</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product. I have only used it for about 3 weeks. Previously I had tried another but after 3 weeks so no difference. With this lash conditioner I see that my lashes appear longer especially when I apply mascara and use a curler. So far, I am impressed with it. Also  with the previous one I tried my eyes were sensitive to the ingredients and this one seems much better with little irritation.</li>
    <li> This product is working nearly as well as the prescription brand.  More convenient to purchase and better price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this on my lower lash line as well and have definitely noticed a difference. My lower lashes are so long! I&#x27;ve had to switch to waterproof mascara because otherwise they smudge because they touch my skin. They even have a curl to them. They look like upper lashes. (I haven&#x27;t noticed as much of a big difference In my upper lashes because I wear extensions). That&#x27;s why I purchased lashIQ, so it would help strengthen and fill in any gaps. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a little more than two weeks now, but I have noticed some eye lash growth. Loving it!</li>
    <li> I started using this on April 19 (Sunday) and waited 3 and half weeks to write this review.  Out of all the other eyelash grow serum, Lashiq really caught my attention.  Did this product work for me?  I applied this every night on my eyelids.  I even applied this on the bottom eyelids, I know its not necessary but decided to give it a try.  I must say, it does work.  Made my eyelashes both top and bottom thicker and darker, the length of my eyelashes only grew tiny bit.  Will I buy this product again?  I&#x27;ll see what happens.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it until the bottle is finish.</li>
    <li> This product gives the desired results of thicker and longer lashes just as Lashiq serum advertises.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply and caused no irritation of my eyes. I have used other more expensive products and it&lt;br /&gt;left a brownish tint on my eyelids. Lashiq only needs to be applied once a day and as stated only took about 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;to notice a different in the length of my lashes.  I love the difference it makes in my lashes. I would definitely recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my lash serum, I saw new growth, fullness and length after using it for about one month... I cannot wait to see how much better they will be after continuing the product for the next months to follow, based on the results that I&#x27;ve gotten. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I tried eyelash extensions and hated them. My eyelashes were so damaged after. I use LashIQ at night. It does not irritate my eyes. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference but they are coming back to my normal length, which is good to have them back.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash serum ever made! I saw results during the first two weeks. It eccited my expectations!</li>
    <li> So far so good, I switched mascaras and started using LashIQ at night and my lashes are in way better condition than they were before! Can&#x27;t wait to see what they look like after a couple weeks use!</li>
    <li> I have ordered the pricier lash growth products and while this product might not work quite as well, it is definitely close enough to merit reordering in my book because of the difference in price.</li>
    <li> Within a couple of weeks, I noticed that my lashes were thicker and longer.  My lashes look so good, I don&#x27;t mind going out without mascara!</li>
    <li> did not notice any difference in my lashes at all.</li>
    <li> All I have to say about this product is wow!!! These people know how to make eyelash products, I have applied about 3 times already and I absolutely LOVE it. I am going to be buying from them again and again!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!!!! I have tried several eyelash growth formula over the years but this one was most assuredly the best. I purchased it based on its high reviews and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. Its WORTH the money. My job requires me to wear safety glasses every day and after about a month I found my eyelashes so long they were hitting the glasses when I blinked. Whatever they put in here it works. The formula also doesn&#x27;t sting if you get it in the eyes. Iv used products that hurt a lot if they got in your eye but this one is the best so far. The eyelashes are also much stronger. If I rubbed my eyes before in any way I would often take away several lashes with me. I haven&#x27;t lost any since I started using this.  I WILL be buying this product again!!! But one bottle is VERY effective!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Be careful. If you get any in your eye, it burns. But the real problem with this product is that it just doesn&#x27;t work. I used it religiously every evening as directed, but now additional growth. I used La Lash in the past with no irritation and great succcess. No luck with this product.</li>
    <li> My wife had been wanting to try this. I ordered it to surprise her.  She has been using it everyday and loves how they make her lashes look longer. She&#x27;s hooked...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m running at three stars because I&#x27;ve only used it a few times since I have received it. I don&#x27;t really know if it works yet or not because I was using another brand of eyelash growth serum. The only thing I know is that it stings like crazy when he gets in your eye</li>
    <li> I very much like this stuff I am seeing great results.  I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> The Lash IQ serum is designed to give you a fuller, more noticeable eye look and I believe it does just that. A swipe across the top of my eyelid/bottom of the lashes, once daily at bedtime was all that was needed to get fabulous results. The ingredients like Pumpkin Seed and Cucumber Fruit extracts allowed this to be much more satisfying that I had originally expected, and it is so compact, you can take or store it almost anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is all natural, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on my face or into my eyes. It is clear in color, so it doesn&#x27;t show on your eyes  or leave a mess on your pillow, and it works in just 4 weeks. Honestly, it worked in less time for me. I noticed a more full, and longer looking, lash line after about 2 weeks of daily use. My eye appeared more defined and the thicker looking lashes drew attention to them right away.  A thin swipe of mascara was all I needed to get a nice, even look for a night out too, instead of having to swipe back and forth with the wand like before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample item for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! No more falsies! I noticed a BIG difference after using for only for 1 week.  No irritation to my skin or eyes and very easy to apply. Love it so much I ordered 2 more for my mom and sister and 2 more as back ups.</li>
    <li> Does not grow lashes as product indicates. After use for a few days, eyes get swollen and puffed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and I&#x27;m  very happy  with my results.  I bought it with the intention of trying it for my eyebrows.  It has definitely made them thicker!!!! I don&#x27;t have to use an eyebrow pencil any more.  Yay!! No  noticeable effect on my eyelashes though.. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I am seeing results!  I didn&#x27;t think this would make a difference on my short, stubby eyelashes but they definitely have added length to them!</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than expected, the packaging was nice and cozy.I have received this product as a gift from one of my friends, as of now i have seen some changes in my eye lashes it became more thicker. This was very easy to apply and you only need to apply once a day no need to reapply again, it doesn&#x27;t itch or anything 100% safe, so if you want to have a nice and long eyelashes I suggest you start getting one now.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have using this for four weeks with no results. I will give a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> Verdict&#x27;s still out for me on this product. I&#x27;ve been using it now for several weeks. My left eyelashes appear somewhat thicker, but the length is unchanged, and this is where I hoped to see improvement. I will, however, continue to use it and hope I&#x27;m just a late responder to Lash IQ. I&#x27;ve used Latisse, which worked great, but turned my eyelids a horrible color which took a long time to resolve. I like that Lash IQ does not have that effect.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are full and long since I was born. So, I didn&#x27;t have to use fake eyelashes. Unfortunately, lately I found out that my eyelashes are not as strong and long as they would be and sadly I lost many of them. It is so obvious that in middle age, if you lose something like hairs or eyelashes, it is difficult to earn it again.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about eyelashes serums a few months ago and I start search some information about different stuff and brands. I read a lots of reviews and a lots of specialist points of view and finally I tried one of the eyelashes enhancer. It was not easy to apply a serum on my eyelashes with a tiny brush but it wasn&#x27;t all, I didn&#x27;t see any result within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Then I received &amp;#34;Natural eyelash product&amp;#34; free of charge to write a review. It includes natural ingredients and contains Biotin, Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Retinyl Palmitate, Pumpkin Seed. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the results but I started all over again and after a few weeks, I really impressed with its quick results!&lt;br /&gt;It works really cool!&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes remarkably started growing in a few weeks. Just fantastic results I didn&#x27;t expected that much though. It was very easy to use, as simple as applying an eyeliner and it help to have a longer, fuller and healthier lashes! And that makes a sexier look!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product after a month of using once per day the results are awesome, my lashes are fuller and thicker and the reason I am so excited it because I have the lashes I had when I was younger, I could not have asked for more from a product, I highly recommend this product. I just applied one time per day usually in the morning and received excellent results.</li>
    <li> One month and thicker lashes, I was a compulsive false lash user but never again!</li>
    <li> so far so good. This serum seems to have thickened my lashes a lot. I&#x27;m not sure if they are lengthening, but they are certainly thicker which is helpful. I&#x27;ve only been using for about 5 weeks now, but I expect good things by the time the bottle is finished.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working! I have been using it for 4 weeks and the bald patches on my eyelids have started to fill in. I have very sparse, thin, and light eyelashes (as do all the women in my family). This product has not changed that. But it has corrected the bare spots I had so that now with eyeliner and mascara my eyes have definition. The progress has been slow, but it hasn&#x27;t had much to work with. I will definitely continue using Lashiq hoping that more new lashes will continue to come in over time.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working well and conditions my lashes.  I have been using it for approximately 3 weeks and I can see a change in the length and fullness of my lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t stain or cause darkness or redness near my lash base as another lash product I used did. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth or change in my lashes</li>
    <li> I found it to to make my eyes itchy after about a week to ten days of use. I used it once a day, before bed.</li>
    <li> This item by far is the best eyelashes growth to have . I have seen some changes to my eyelashes although I don&#x27;t use it everyday .</li>
    <li> Love this product! This serum worked within a week! not only will I purchase this product again, but I have reccomended this product to others.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY. THIS STUFF DIDN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL FOR ME. I APPLIED IT TO CLEAN EYELASHES AND BROWS EVERYNIGHT AND NOTHING HAPPENED. GOING BACK TO LATTISSE. IT&#x27;S EXPENSIVE BUT AT LEAST IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> Bought this over a month ago, however was not using every day like instructed...mostly every other day. I am so amazed by the following results:&lt;br /&gt;a) Brows have grown in and are thicker. My eyebrows had been thinning over the years and I was using pencil to fill in. I now only need to pencil in a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;b) My lashes are now longer and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely post product reviews but this one gets my 5 Star review!</li>
    <li> After using the product for several weeks, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
    <li> This was obviously a knock off. It did not even come in a box, rather it was shrink wrapped. After a few days ink on the writing even smeared on the tube. Not to mention, it did not work at all, the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; is more like water and does nothing.  Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Lash IQ is easy to apply right before I go to bed.  It does not irritate my eyes and it dries pretty fast.  I have not noticed a huge change but I have only been using it for about two weeks.  It arrived on time and I an excited to see it if helps my lashes grow.</li>
    <li> I had tried other eyelash growth serums that were twice the price and they worked, but made my eyelashes very thin and fall out easily.  I also got some irritation with the other products.  But with Lashiq I have no irritation and the product has thickened as well as lengthened my eyelashes.  It&#x27;s so easy to use....I will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> Has helped my lashes grow and strengthen.</li>
    <li> I have now used one entire tube of Lashiq. My lashes are short, almost non-existent. Prior to Lashiq, I used RapidLash which definitely made my lashes longer,but I&#x27;ve been looking for something that might improve the thickness, so I decided to try Lashiq based upon the reviews. I do like it for length, but I don&#x27;t see any discernable difference in volume or thickness. I will purchase again and see where I am after a second tube.</li>
    <li> This Lashiq seems to be working great helping my lash look long and full.</li>
    <li> As much as I anticipated, the product caused mild irritation. My eye area is sensitive, though, so I just sat through it. In about a month, I could tell that my lashes were longer, and maybe a little thicker. I won&#x27;t call this a miracle, but I will say that it does its job. All you need is patience, and consistency.</li>
    <li> I was satified with the product.  This worked just as well as much higher priced brands I have used.</li>
    <li> amazing! works fantastic! I already see a growth in my eyelashes and its been about two weeks. It gives such a natural look to my lashes which has lots of compliments so far of my face. Changed my whole face into a completely different person</li>
    <li> Great product, I can not believe that it actually grows your eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;At first I was very skeptical of buying this product, but I can safely say this product is great and it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly reviewing this, There are no flaws and it is deffinently a 10/10 product, to bad I am only able to give it 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recomend!</li>
    <li> It works while using it but it is irritating to the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was skeptical, but my lashes really have grown! I saw a difference probably within a week or so. Enough to where I went and showed my boyfriend...then he noticed it, too. I ordered another bottle right away! Good price, too. I think it is worth it. I should have taken before and after pictures... I have tried other products but never saw a difference. I wanted to go see the doc about getting that lashtique or whatever for $175...but now I don&#x27;t have to! THANKS!!! Deb</li>
    <li> Product does what it says. I used the entire tube (lasted almost 3 months with daily use) and I&#x27;m purchasing another. When used as directed (daily, prior to sleeping) I noticed an increase in the length as well as abundance of my eyelashes. It&#x27;s easy to use, safe, all natural and I&#x27;ve had no problems. For $35 dollors and almost 3 months of use - it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work used the whole tube.  As with any of these things not everything works on everyone.  so take your chances know you may or may not waste $.&lt;br /&gt;By the time the tube is gone it will probably be too late to return this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  The reviews I read actually had me thinking that this natural and reasonably priced product would work. After a couple weeks I noticed some very minor lash growth, however, it did not stay or continue.  So... today I invested once again in Latisse-crazy expensive but it works!</li>
    <li> Want longer lashes or bolder brows, how about both? Want it in 30 days with a 100% Satisfaction Money Guarantee? Give LashIQ a try. Containing a robust formula of handpicked ingredients designed to transform your thin and short hairs in to luscious alluring lashes or bold and beautiful brows. With the help of biotin, Pumpkin Seed Extract, Cucumber Fruit Extract and more.This all natural growth stimulator is clinically proven to increase the hair density up to 82% in just 4 weeks. With no sulfates, parabens, or chemical preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I appreciate how easy it is to apply this. I usually have a problem with other lash growth serums I have tried because of the applicator. This one I have no problems once so ever. Yes, you are not going to see a magic growth over night. Sorry but would have to be magic. However, as you use it over the month or so you can see a change. Certainly glad that it is a nice and thin formula, nothing heavy and chunky or dries weird. Also, quite happy there is no chemical nasty scent. With it so close to my nasal area that would cause me not to use it but I have no problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews here on Amazon, I was excited to try LashIQ. I love the fact that there are no sulfates, parabens and absolutely NO chemical preservatives. There are no side effects! One of the prescription growth serums says that it will change your eye color?! NOT with LASHIQ!&lt;br /&gt;A big bonus for me is this serum only needs to be used once a day before bed. It’s also doesn’t require a prescription or a trip to the doctor’s office!! The biggest bonus for me is I can AFFORD IT!!! Actually, the BIGGEST bonus for me is that it works!! It works! It Works! IT WORKS!! Not only are my lashes fuller and LONGER but they are healthy too.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use. LASHIQ looks like a tube of liquid eyeliner; using the same type of brush, very thin narrows to a point. Going along your lash line stroke the clear LASHIQ on. Leave your eyes closed for close to 2 minutes to allow LASHIQ to dry. That’s IT! Super easy!&lt;br /&gt;With 81 out of 94 FIVE star reviews Amazon!! Seriously? With that kind of feedback you know that LASHIQ is liquid gold!&lt;br /&gt;LASHIQ works for women and men alike! It will work on your eyebrows as well!&lt;br /&gt;I’m obsessed with LASHIQ!! I love this stuff!! I can not only feel the difference I can see the difference!! This is not an over night BAMB long lashes; this takes a couple of weeks. Be patient. LASHIQ does WORK!!!!! This is my 4 week journey. I can’t wait to see how my lashes look at the end of next month!!&lt;br /&gt;There is no color to LashIQ and no scent either!&lt;br /&gt;I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> Product arrived a little mangled but the seal had already been broken. I was already hesitatant on purchasing this product and this just made it easier to decide to use a different product/seller.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever bought! It doesn&#x27;t work to the point that I wonder if it is just water!</li>
    <li> After just one week my lashes look fuller!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lash growth serum and decided to go with Lash IQ because it had the highest customer rating. I put Lash IQ on my eyebrows as well as my eyelash line. After about two weeks of use, I noticed that my eyebrows and eyelashes were thicker and darker. In another week, I noticed that my eyelashes were longer too. This product really works!! Lash IQ is part of my nightly routine now. I wash and dry my face and put it on, takes me two minutes. I am happy with my purchase and I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> This really works, friends comment on my lashes, asking what am I doing new, or is it mascara? Have referred my friends too!</li>
    <li> I have used Lash IQ for four weeks now. I followed directions as I was told. This product hasn&#x27;t worked as yet...hoping that continued use will get some results...I may need a longer time to get results...</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Lashiq. In just 2 1/2 weeks, my lashes are longer and darker than they have been for years, and I am 63 years young again!&lt;br /&gt;I thank you Lashiq. Please keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I have been using the lash iq for a month now and I have noticed a huge difference I definitely love it !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different lash enhancing serums (GrandeLash MD, Latisse and RapidLash). While I have received results from all 3, I have to say that Lashiq Eyelash Serum is by far my favorite, and the best bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I have to say about the other serums I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;GrandeLash worked over time, but not as well as Lashiq, and not as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Latisse results were comparable to Lashiq, but Latisse costs over 3x as much as Lashiq.&lt;br /&gt;RapidLash changed their formula about a year ago, so now I don&#x27;t even see any results at all from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a lash serum that works just as well as Latisse for a WAY better price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since I bought it (more than a month ago) and I don&#x27;t see any difference on my lashes.. it doesn&#x27;t work at all.. I wish I can return it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to wait to write my review to give it time to work or to see if it works and sure enough it really does!  My top eyelashes are thicker and longer.  I want to keep using it.  Now that I know it can be put on the bottom, I know want to use it on the bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I have long enough eyelashes, so therefore, I got this for my sister who hardly has eyelashes. She applied this before applying her daily mascara. This was easy to apply, did not cause irritations (she never really gets irritation) and you only need to apply it once. It was almost as if her eyelashes were instantly longer. Once she applied the mascara it was almost like she had completely different eyelashes!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have recently had a health crisis and an enormous amount of stress.  I noticed that my eyelashes and eyebrows were suffering too.  Lash IQ has been a blessing as it has been helping my eyelashes return and even look better than ever.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome and performs as promised. And no eye irritation!! I can&#x27;t take that. I had to remove my eyelash extensions after a brief illness so I needed to do something about my now, stubby, little eyelashes so I did the research and decided this was my best bet. Former users said over and over again, no scratchy eyes, so that was it for me. I noticed growth in one week. I thought I was imagining it, but week 2, I realized that this was for real!! Still filling at less than 30 days, and I look forward to my long lush lashes again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 1 month and definitely felt my lashes have grown.  It&#x27;s more difficult to see if my eyebrows have grown in, but they are somewhat blond to begin with.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used for over a month everyday and didn&#x27;t notice any growth. Waste of money! There are other brands that will work better.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a nice little gift for my wife and she loves them.  She has done everything from the mink eyelashes and the glue on and none compare to the fullness she gets with this serum.  It was a win win for me, she loved the gift and saves me money.  Great product, great price and arrived quickly.  Will be ordering more very shortly!</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my girlfriend. She has short eyelashes and wanted to have longer ones. It was a good purchase because it worked on her and its natural. No more fake eyelashes. I just love those long and natural ones that this product produced.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i was looking for this but i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere as cheap and as high quality as here. I am totally recommending this to anyone who is looking to buy this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working! Great product at half the price of others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now. And I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s some crazy miracle worker, BUT it does definitely work. I noticed my eyelashes getting thicker and longer. It&#x27;s a slow process but still worth it and a pretty good price point for a product that works just as good as or better than much more expensive products.</li>
    <li> Bought this about a week ago and i love it! My girlfriend said my eye lashes were thinning and suggested this and it works great! My eyelashes seem to be not only back to normal but also a little bit longer! Ill definitely be buying more and i recommend this to anyone on the fence about buying! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I must say I&#x27;m very impressed with Lashiq&#x27;s Natural Eyelash Growth Serum, the package arrives in a nice box once opened you&#x27;ll notice a 0.17oz tube with a fine tip applicator brush. This product is very reasonably priced and gives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; remarkable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best results when applying to a clean dry face/eye without any makeup once a day in the evening or before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product everyday for 3 weeks I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic difference. My eyelashes are longer thicker, and darker. Another reason I love Lashiq is the fact that it is 100% chemical free, and is made up of a natural mixture to enhance your eyelashes; giving them a healthier, longer, more fuller and sexier lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion. Everything stated is 100% truthful and my own personal views.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Ordered this because I needed to grow my eyelashes since I&#x27;m severly autistic. It was really simple to apply and it works great too. The product dosen&#x27;t bother me at all and I reall love it! Totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> Product works great for the money! My wife has always had mannish eye lashes and wanted them to look more feminine and nice. After using this product they look thicker and just look better and they have greatly improved my wife&#x27;s self esteem.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 weeks and it WORKS!!! I&#x27;ve tried other serums in the past which didn&#x27;t give me these fast results. I am super satisfied and will definitely purchase this item again !!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyelash serums in the past, and have spent a lot of money on the serums with little or no result at all. I was searching Amazon on a rainy day and found LashIQ. I read a few of the reviews, not really going by what others said, however there were many good reviews. I did purchase the LashIQ at a very reasonable price. I have to say i am very happy with the results, longer, fuller lashes in about 3-4 weeks. I couldnt be happier. No more expensive lash serum that does not work. Like i said i have tried many even from my hair salon, LashIQ works the best. Needless to say i will be ordering another tube very soon. You wont be sorry.....</li>
    <li> i have used many eyelash growth products but Lashiq. Natural eyelash growth is by far the best. I love the fact that it is made from natural ingredients. I saw results within 3 weeks. This is the product I will order again and again</li>
    <li> I have only been using LashQ for about 3 weeks but i can already see darker lashes and i can really tell a difference after applying my mascara. This stuff is no joke, it works!!!!</li>
    <li> it seems to be working</li>
    <li> Althought I was skeptical at first, since I have tried so many of these products and even homemade ones, this product truly works! I have only been using it for just under two weeks, and the results are already there!&lt;br /&gt;LashIQ truly does work and I am excited to continue to watch the transformation of my lashes. I have been a Falsies wearer for so long that my own lashes have become sparse. I was looking for a product that would not only add some length to my already long lashes, but more to add thickness. LashIQ has hit the mark for me! The picture I added was at the week and a half point of using LashIQ every night at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product deserves one! Any of you out there that want fuller, thicker, longer and healthier lashes, this product works! I am excited for my 4 week comparison and will definitely continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Saw results after week 1!&lt;br /&gt;No side effects like redness or dark circles as reported reviews are for Latisse.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m posting under my fiancé&#x27;s account cuz he has prime, he would prob not be amused by his name above a post about eyelash growth haha I love this stuff. I really have seen a difference. I looked through tons of different brands on Amazon and though there were others that sounded a little better with their guarantees that their product would work they were just too expensive. I thought lashiq was very reasonable in price and figured the reviews were good so I&#x27;d try it. i wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s going to make your eyelashes look like when you have fake eyelashes on but it makes a noticeable difference!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this lash serum.  I have used many others over the past few years and this serum proviided results in much less time.  I noticed my lashes becoming thicker in just 2 weeks!  I would highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I used several other eyelash growth serum including Rapidlash. They made my eyes very itchy and uncomfortable. This one goes on very easily. No itch at all. Only used it for one week. Hard to say if it is working or not. I will update my review when I finish my tube.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this eyelash growth serum it has made my eyelashes grow longer and thicker within days. Great product I reccomend to all the other ladies that have thin eyelashes.</li>
