      <li>A more \\&quot;mauve\\&quot; color would be \\&quot;Not So Bora Bor-ang Pink\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Love this color.  </li>
      <li>TOO light.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this color at the grocery store in an effort to quit biting my nails...</li>
      <li>/&gt;it looked like and had the name of a true mauve.  </li>
      <li>GREAT neutral color---not too pink, not too peach--goes with everything!  </li>
      <li>&quot; It&#x27;s more of a brick/coral, which is a nice color, but not what I expected.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Super fast drying, stays shiny for a long time and the color is nice!</li>

      <li>Love it... call me &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; but I am not into the bright and crazy colors--love this one that I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores anymore</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The color is more pink than &amp;#34;mauve&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;java&amp;#34;, so I think the name is a bit misleading.</li>
      <li>Perfect color and impossible to find in stores.  </li>
      <li>There are only two problems with this one: First, I could have gotten the polish cheaper at my local ULTA store ($9.00 a bottle) because there was no shipping and handling charge, like the one I incurred with the Amazon  purchase.</li>
      <li>I like OPI nail polish, Java Mauve- A is an older color and is super hard to find.</li>

    <li> I like OPI nail polish, Java Mauve- A is an older color and is super hard to find. Not I know where I can purchase it!</li>
    <li> Love the color and was nigh to impossible to find anywhere.</li>

    <li> Perfect color and impossible to find in stores.  so happy to be able to order.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite summer shades &amp; difficult to find in the retail stores</li>
    <li> Love it... call me &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; but I am not into the bright and crazy colors--love this one that I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores anymore so found it here.</li>
    <li> Super fast drying, stays shiny for a long time and the color is nice! Two layers are definitely enough and its very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it looked like and had the name of a true mauve.  When I received it, it was almost a cocoa color.  In fact, I took it to my manicurist and it almost matched perfectly with a cocoa that she already had on her shelves.  I like mauves which is why I ordered it, it was not what I anticipated, so I gave it to a friend who really liked it.  It is my opinion that this was not advertised as what it was.</li>
    <li> OPI makes a good product. There are only two problems with this one: First, I could have gotten the polish cheaper at my local ULTA store ($9.00 a bottle) because there was no shipping and handling charge, like the one I incurred with the Amazon  purchase. Second, the color is not really \\&quot;mauve.\\&quot; It&#x27;s more of a brick/coral, which is a nice color, but not what I expected. A more \\&quot;mauve\\&quot; color would be \\&quot;Not So Bora Bor-ang Pink\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this color at the grocery store in an effort to quit biting my nails... and I ended up LOVING this color! I received a compliment every time I wore it and always had friends asking to borrow it. eventually ran out and had to order it from Amazon - still the same great product and color! Woo!!</li>
    <li> Love OPI, the color is great and it lasted good on gel nails.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  Was exactly what the picture indicated it would be.  Better price here than at a salon.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have had this before but the color this time wasn&#x27;t the same. I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the color</li>
    <li> Nice but paler than expected.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  I will be ordering more.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Convenient delivery of the best nail laquer!</li>
    <li> GREAT neutral color---not too pink, not too peach--goes with everything!  OPI, please don&#x27;t quit making this wonderful color!</li>
