<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells badly, it says cream but it is a lotion which makes a big difference for my skin. I tried it twice but it is not good.</li>
    <li> Good product - as usually Dr Haushka is always a good brand</li>
    <li> Lightly scented, easily and quickly absorbed. Excellent product. I use this under make up or alone, but it is not tinted.</li>
    <li> I love it. Makes your skin look beautiful.</li>
    <li> Not quite as emollient as I had hoped for but good overall.  Used to have oily skin but now, at 55, it&#x27;s become a bit more dry and in need of additional hydration via my moisturizer.  Love the scent of this product!  Dislike a rose scent so didn&#x27;t purchase the Rose Night Creme - wish they offered an alternative.</li>
    <li> This Day Cream has been my favorite for several years now.  I love the glow that gives to my skin.  My skin is normal with tendency to be dry if I don&#x27;t take care.  I began to use this kind of product holistic after getting some knowledge of the additives in the other products like Lancôme that use for so many years.  This Day Cream is compare to \\&quot;Absolue\\&quot; or something like this from Lancôme.</li>
    <li> I love all of Dr. Hauschka face products , the formula is not oily and very absorbent, and perfect for my dry face, and only really needs application once a day. Also a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> No grease,no oily feeling, just quick, smooth, obsorbsion. you feel like you have a baby&#x27;s skin after using it. Works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I use it for both day and night and have noticed the difference after the first half of the bottle. My skin is dry and rough  but this is the only brand that has worked so far. Worth the money spent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, but forgot that you need to &amp;#34;press it on&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t get an immediate result. Despite all that negativity, I really love this liquid based moisturizer. It must be great as I&#x27;m past sixty with very dry skin. It really works, just using it you feel part of a special club:-)</li>
    <li> Amazingly moisturizing for such a light cream and not at all greasy.  Great for every season except for the very coldest part of winter.  I still use it in winter but I supplement with the Dr. Hauschka Rose Cream.  The combination does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, with peri-oral dermatitis, generally at the touch of a product and that&#x27;s what happened here. This one made me break out and it did not work with my skin. My skin is slightly dry and I know this is better for those with oily skin, so I&#x27;m going back to the Quince Day Cream.</li>
    <li> I found this product at Whole Foods.  Pricey but worth every penny.  A little goes a long way. Not greasy. My skin drinks it up. Has a very light, pleasing citrus smell.  Even my husband uses it.  Love the pump.  Easy to use without contaminating the ingredients.  $20 cheaper on Amazon.  This is on my top ten list of favorites things.</li>
    <li> I used to use Olay Regenerist but after reading countless wonderful reviews of this product I finally purchased it and I absolutely love it. Olay&#x27;s moisturizer smelled good but sometimes my face would become too oily in spots and dry in others and after applying it my face would sting a little. NONE of those things happen with this product. I started off using Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s lip balm stick (which I absolutely love also) and it has that same herbally smell but it goes away. This moisturizer is wonderful whether you are bare faced or put on a ton of makeup for a night out. I love the glass bottle, give it a little luxury feel. I will repurchase and slowly but surely Dr. Hauschka is taking over my skin care routine. I really recommend this product. No breakouts during my cycles, either!!! Amazing.</li>
    <li> I used for a few weeks and its very good and smooth. I love it. I recommend because it good for different kind of skin.</li>
    <li> The odor of this product is unbearable. I considered keeping it to use on my hands, but I cannot abide the powerful aroma. I&#x27;ll stick with the Rose Day Cream.</li>
    <li> Had purchased this many times thru Amazon.  The price seems to be different every time I order it.  I have used this cream for several years now first purchasing it at Whole Foods.  I have very sensitive skin &amp; so far this has been the facial cream that moisturize my face without leaving it greasy or make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am subject to periodic bouts of rosecea, so I have to be very careful what I use on my middle-age face. I&#x27;ve been using this daily in the morning for 3 months and my skin looks great-- much healthier. Not only do I notice, so have friends! It is more expensive than many other moisturizers, but a little goes a long way and I can&#x27;t argue with the results.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle and it is still my best day cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best daytime moisturizer I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve been using it for 15 years, and I appreciate Amazons access to it with ease!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this cream.  It does not cause breakouts (I have sensitive skin)  and leave my face feeling good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for twenty plus year and I love it. It keep my dry sensitive skin moist all day long, it&#x27;s very light,  is easy to apply, and absorbs well. it is a little pricey, so I always willing to try other moisturizers, haven&#x27;t found better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she won&#x27;t use anything else, me too.  Also, the price is the best on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best Day Cream I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  I really have hard time finding a moisturizer that I like for my skin, this is perfect and has a great smell.</li>
    <li> LOVE! Best price. I have bee  using this product for years and got it cheaper here</li>
    <li> I love Dr.Hauschka products and wanted this to be the right cream for me...the size, the ingredients, the smell...all terrific. Unfortunately it irritated my dry sensitive skin and was nowhere near moisturizing enough. Sad. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka has the only moisturizer that I can use without getting a rash. I love the product. Every time I try to switch for a new product that is cheaper my skin gets rashy and sensitive. I highly recommend any of the Hauschka creams or lotions.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great service from Amazon</li>
    <li> I love the product but the dispenser was broken. Recycled the box before I realized it.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! The best I have tried so far! I truly enjoy it and have been using it for years! My face looks so much better and it is never thirsty!</li>
    <li> ALWAYS A GOOD product, DR. HAUSHKA rocks!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by the stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I would use it more if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. What in the world could make it cost so much?</li>
    <li> smells natural and feels great on my face!</li>
    <li> This is the by far the best moisturizer ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*It effectively moisturizes my skin (I tested 10 products at a local Wholefoods and this cream worked the best! Since it was 69 + tax, I decided to buy it on Amazon. Guess what? It&#x27;s at least $15 cheaper on Amazon. Hooray!)&lt;br /&gt;*The effect of moisturizing lasts VERY long. Usually longer than 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;*All the ingredients are natural.&lt;br /&gt;*Animal testing free&lt;br /&gt;*No oily film after application&lt;br /&gt;*Good for my sensitive skin! (no tingling sensation)&lt;br /&gt;*Works as a sun screen as well (I am not sure how it does so, without any chemicals, but if it&#x27;s true, this is a grand slam! )&lt;br /&gt;*Application is real easy! Just one pump does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Quite pricey for a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;*The smell of this cream isn&#x27;t particularly pleasing although it&#x27;s not necessarily unpleasant either. (-&amp;#62; This is actually a plus point for me. I don&#x27;t like the idea of putting some perfume on my face.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****If you&#x27;re buying this, make sure to use it up before the expiration date since it&#x27;s preservatives-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely recommending this to ma mum &amp; sister!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and can&#x27;t say enough for the product.  My daughter is now using it as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - have used this for several years now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years now.  I love it.  Lightweight, wonderful herbal scent and works beautifully for my fairly dry and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I loved the texture and feel, it is not at all heavy and very refreshing when applied. The bet moisturuzer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> 1st off I have allergies and this stuff made me sneeze, my eyes water which in turn created the sunken dark circles because of all of the allergies going on with the ingredients. To top that off, I have very dry sensitive skin and I broke out with acne, not just pimples, the acne that leaves scars. It took forever to heal and I am permanently scarred!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I&#x27;ve started using this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy and it moisturizes really well. I love it.</li>
    <li> Best skin product in the universe</li>
    <li> Great product been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and smells good, my skin looks good</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Came quick.</li>
    <li> Loove this product . My husband just bought this for me from Whole Foods ,way overpriced .&lt;br /&gt;Soothing ,but maybe not quite enough moisturizing for cold Jan.NY months.&lt;br /&gt;Love it anyway .</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product line for a long time and she is very satisfied with the quality and effect.</li>
    <li> this is the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used and i&#x27;ve gone through many, often stopping use before finishing other brands. i use this religously, does not peel, keeps skin smooth all day. body lotions are only okay, but the face moisturizer is great!!!</li>
    <li> Use this cream daily and it makes my skin very soft. Can only recommend this product. One time applying in the morning is more than enough. Good results &#x3D;&amp;#62; good skin.</li>
    <li> I like it, but, unless I wear powder over it, it leaves a greasy sheen on my face.  It is sometimes difficult for me to tell if moisturizers really outperform one another, but I like to think that more $ &#x3D; better product.  Ha!  :-)</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, rich but moderately light lotion. My skin is soft and luminous now. It is, however, perhaps a bit rich for use on summer mornings and is best for after-shower or night moisturizing. Love this brand.</li>
    <li> The best cream I have ever used. Not only does it feel great going on, my skin honestly has never looked or felt better.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I was excited about finding a natural moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily but lasted. My skin is extremely dry... So when I got it and used it I was a little disappointed... because it IS very thin and pretty oily. (Not like cetaphil which I still like as a moisturizer). I did however find one great thing about this product though. IT MAKES A GREAT AFTERSHAVE LOTION. So I don&#x27;t use it as a daily moisturizer but my endless search for a natural aftershave lotion has come to an end. I would definitely recommend this product for that reason  alone :)</li>
    <li> Very smooth and fresh feeling - seems to help keep the wrinkles at bay and you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
    <li> Anyone sensitive to oil based moisturizers, this is the one for you. I break out with the first dab of oil in a face product.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best ever. This bottle lasts a year!</li>
    <li> A very light moisturizer that feels like it is immediately soaking into your skin on application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Hauschka Moisturizing Day Cream for nearly a decade and I love it.  Previous moisturizers irritated my eyes and some even made my skin waxy.  This cream soothes and protects my far-from-young skin all day.  A little goes a long way so a 3.5 oz bottle lasts me about 8 months.  It is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> After complaining , I did not receive my original order...(lost at Post Office system), I was immediately sent a new order,&lt;br /&gt;I so appreciate your prompt response , I knew Amazon would help me right away.&lt;br /&gt;I love Dr. Hauschka...Even though I am 82, I still love my &amp;#34;facial Creams&amp;#34;, have been using Dr. Hauschka, for over 30 years....&lt;br /&gt;I do find that Amazon seems more complicated when ordering than when I ordered last year...I called my daughter and she came by and figured out my problem.&lt;br /&gt;My children give me Amazon gift cards for everything...I love it...Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;ruthblynch@msn.com</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite! I appreciate that&#x27;s it&#x27;s both holistic and effective as a moisturizer. Better than any dept. store face lotion.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I use it daily.  I&#x27;m a dude.  Damn spendy, but worth it.  It has also massively reduced a scar on my forehead from MOHS Surgery last winter.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my mom for Christmas and she was so happy as she had just run out of it that morning.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing face cream I have ever used. I have rosacacea and this product doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
    <li> Great but expensive product. Am 70 and skin still looks great and is very soft. Wish they would bottle it so that it was easier to take when traveling.</li>
    <li> Actually, I am disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 30 years. It saved my skin when I started and has preserved it on into &amp;#34;maturity.&amp;#34; It now has a new name and, I guess, a new formula. It seems thin to me, which means I use more and since it&#x27;s expensive, that&#x27;s a problem. It also arrived without a top and with the spout in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position.</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka moisturizing day cream is a nice light moisturizer. It&#x27;s actually a liquid not a cream. It absorbs quickly has a very very light fragrance. I have been using this product for several years and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> love this product. have used it for about 18 years. penetrates and stimulates. not heavy or oily. clean feel and fresh fragrant. i&#x27;m a retired cosmetologist and am selective when it comes to skin care products.</li>
    <li> I like Dr. Hauschka Moisturizing Day Cream because it not only moisturizes but also seems to smooth over some fine lines in the face.&lt;br /&gt;Also just a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Hauschka Day Cream for years. I only use very pure products on my skin and it shows! Dr. Hauschka Skin Care products come from biodynamic farming methods in Germany and I love them.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer!  It keeps my skin supple all day long! One of the best products on the market. Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, or should I say the absence of that perfume smell in many lotions.  It is light, absorbs well, and softens skin.  It is a day cream as it says, so you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you expect it to substitute for a night cream.  I love the list of ingredients as well.</li>
    <li> So wonderful. The smell, the feel - this bottle has lasted me months. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Sent expired product.  Didn&#x27;t realize until the product took on a funny smell...</li>
    <li> I would be giving this product 1 star, but I figure that it may be the case that this product simply is not for my skin type.  Anyway, I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.  It caused me to breakout pretty bad around my nose - never been the type to get breakouts. At first I thought they could be cause by something else, but after addressing a list of possible causes, I finally decided to stop using the product.  I switched to another moisturizer - something I had used in the past - and within a few days the problem went away.</li>
    <li> feela amazing on my face! Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve uaed and I am a product junkie. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> While the cream feels nice on my face, if I rub my eyes and some of the residue in, then my eyes start tear and itch.</li>
