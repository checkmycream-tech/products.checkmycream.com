      <li>Other than this gap, great item.  </li>

      <li>Got here quick.</li>

      <li>This little croc works great.</li>
      <li>it swivels 360 degrees so no  crazy twisting tangling.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair and for me, this Baby heats up quickly and works great.</li>
      <li>The pink color is very cute and fun.</li>
      <li>My hair becomes pretty straight and smooth just by blow drying it.</li>
      <li>I bought this specifically for a Europe trip and although it does get warm, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything.</li>
      <li>i really really like this product!  </li>
      <li>It has a case that can be used even when the iron is still hot</li>
      <li>so I need something that gets really hot.  </li>
      <li>it heats up sooo fast (within 2 minutes!)   </li>
      <li>i like it so much that even though i have used it once, i had to write a review immediately!  </li>
      <li>It gets really hot</li>
      <li>good price, decent size for a mini. makes my hair really soft and doesnt take long at all to heat up</li>
      <li>This straightener is really helpful with its own little carry heat protected case that rolls out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with pink baby croc,it came in time..straightened my hair in 5 mins,</li>
      <li>Love the pink color!</li>
      <li>but if you want a straightener that really straightens invest in the Normal size Croc</li>
      <li>I got this to take on another trip down under as it has dual voltage and is a lovely compact size.</li>
      <li>Yea, i am a sucker for cute packaging which is why i bought this!  </li>
      <li>I only use a flat iron for touching up my hair after blow drying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still useful to have a tiny straightener</li>
      <li>then once it is hot enough, this does the work fast.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had over 5 flat irons in the past year and this is my favorite and definitely better than some of the larger ones!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to hair irons.</li>
      <li>It came in sooner than expected was in the same shape as listed, I would buy form them again. &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>I dont know if having a gap when u close the blades is a normal thing for flat irons in general (this is my first one ever in life).  </li>
      <li>I only really straighten the front of my hair as I wear plaits a lot</li>
      <li>I really like this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Not a super powerful straightener, but for the size I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this if you are short on space and don&#x27;t want to have to lug extra goodies with you (converters that do not convert and such).</li>
      <li>However if you have long or extra long hair I would not recommend this product, because you must use small sections with it &amp; this product wasn&#x27;t really made to use for long hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>so I just had to take my time doing small portions of hair nice and slow.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to people with thin, fine hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this baby croc flat iron is by far the best one I&#x27;ve had!  it heats up sooo fast (within 2 minutes!)   the only drawback is that you can&#x27;t lower or raise the heat..it just has an on &amp; off switch.  overall, i definitely recommend this product!!!!   I&#x27;ve had over 5 flat irons in the past year and this is my favorite and definitely better than some of the larger ones!  it does the job and it does it well (:</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to use for traveling purposes.  It does not heat up enough to use on a regular basis.  I have very thick hair so I need something that gets really hot.  I would recommend this product to people with thin, fine hair.  This is not a very good product for individuals with long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> The size is nice and package too, I dont like that it doesn&#x27;t get that hot, so it&#x27;s not a perfect flattener and it seems imposible to make waves.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted it for trips but I am not sure It will do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my trip to Belgium and even though i have long hair and its much smaller than my regular flat iron, it worked like a charm. I cannot recommend it enough especially for traveling.</li>
    <li> This straightener is really helpful with its own little carry heat protected case that rolls out. There is no levels of heat to choose from it goes up to 400 (i think) automatically. It heats up quick. It is small, but that is what to be expected. I bought it for the short side of my asymmetrical haircut and it does wonders, I also use it to make tight curls on the longer side. For straightening short hair and styling medium length hair, I recommend this product. However if you have long or extra long hair I would not recommend this product, because you must use small sections with it &amp; this product wasn&#x27;t really made to use for long hair quickly.  I gave this review a 4 because, sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t heat up all the time in the amount it should or that it does not straighten. However these are just minor things that might be my human error and not the product. so 4.5 or 5 would be better, but i&#x27;m not that lenient ;) because ease of use is very important for consumers.</li>
    <li> I ordered pink, the packaging said pink, but somehow they sent me black. Not the biggest deal, but I did actually pay more for the pink version, so I am a little disappointed. Other than the fact that I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted, the flat iron works well! Great for European travel.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  It gets really hot so if that is a concern to you, you do not need to be worried.  Actually, I wish it got a little less hot, but as you may or may not know, it is very hard to find an adjustable mini flat iron.  I use this to keep in my desk at work and do touchups during the day, though I have been known to forgo doing my hair altogether until I get to work and then do my entire hair with it in the morning!  Just don&#x27;t tell my boss!  Just so you know, my hair is pretty fine and does take well to straightening.</li>
    <li> i really really like this product!  i like it so much that even though i have used it once, i had to write a review immediately!  i have asian poker straight black hair....almost impossible to curl.  I agree with everything the below reviewer said.  it does take about a min for it to heat up but that&#x27;s pretty quick.  then once it is hot enough, this does the work fast.  i can curl my hair in 10 min or less with this bad boy, and i have mostly shoulder length hair.  i looooove the girly pink color of this iron:  baby pink colour throughout this item even the cord.  Yea, i am a sucker for cute packaging which is why i bought this!  I love how the end of the cord is tangle free:  it swivels 360 degrees so no  crazy twisting tangling.  Probably my only complaint (hence one star off) is the iron blades of this item:  when you close the blades, there is a tiny gap between the two blades.  So when i put my hair between the blades, my hair slips so easily esp. when i reach to the end of my hair b/c of this gap (and I do grab a good amount of hair but not too much that this iron would be ineffective).  I dont know if having a gap when u close the blades is a normal thing for flat irons in general (this is my first one ever in life).  Other than this gap, great item.  If i get a chance, will post pic of this defect.</li>
    <li> I have a full sized CROC flatiron, which I just love to bits. The last time I made an overseas trip down under I bought what I thought to be a voltage converter. I thought wrong. It blew up my beautiful full sized CROC. Luckily I got a lovely new one and am now happy. So before I bore you let me get to THIS product. I got this to take on another trip down under as it has dual voltage and is a lovely compact size. It does the job quite well for being a travel sized counterpart to the regular one. No it is not as wonderful as the full size but what can be expected for a compact version. Yes it takes longer to flatten your hair but I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you are short on space and don&#x27;t want to have to lug extra goodies with you (converters that do not convert and such).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with pink baby croc,it came in time..straightened my hair in 5 mins,wow.&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s dual voltage,so I can carry it anywhere in the world!it came with a heat pouch in a small zip lock bag..</li>
    <li> Thia is a great iron and a great deal. It&#x27;s good for close to the scalp. I recommend it. G</li>
    <li> I have not had the chance to use this item yet. I bought it for an upcoming trip and have not tried the flat iron. It is compact and perfect for traveling. It has a case that can be used even when the iron is still hot so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool off before storing it.</li>
    <li> Arrived as I expected and was protected in shipping works great for a travel size but if you want a straightener that really straightens invest in the Normal size Croc no comparison this one is great for maintenance only.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron! I have shoulder-length, fine, wavy hair. My hair becomes pretty straight and smooth just by blow drying it. I only use a flat iron for touching up my hair after blow drying. Because my hair is wavy and fine, I&#x27;ve never had luck straightening it after air drying it. When I do that it usually becomes too flat. Blow drying gives it body and straightens and smooths it. Then I use a flat iron to touch it up. I had heard great things about the big croc, but I decided to get the mini since I have fine hair and I only use it for touch ups. This little croc works great. The thin plates get close to the scalp and can hold a pretty wide chunk of hair. It has \\&quot;floating\\&quot; plates that adjust to your hair. That is why the two plates don&#x27;t line up flat against each other as an earlier reviewer noticed. This is not a defect. It&#x27;s designed that way on purpose. It heats up very quickly. The carrying case/heat resistant pad are wonderful for traveling. I love that I can rest the hot iron on the pad and not worry about burning something. The pink color is very cute and fun. The cord swivels, so it moves with you without restriction. This iron probably would not straighten an entire head of thick, long hair after air drying. It&#x27;s best for short hair, fine hair, touch-ups, and/or travel.</li>
    <li> i love this for my medium length hair that is wavy. if you want to curl your hair with a flat iron this  works perfectly.the only problem is that it is smaller than i thought it would be</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron great for my hair I loved my purchase</li>
    <li> Was just too small for what my wife needed. She likes it big.</li>
    <li> Works well for my hair. Even before I cut 15 inches off it held its own just as good as my regular size straightener.  Looks nice and I adore the heat protective case. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this mini flatiron. I have short hair with side bangs and it is works perfectly. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is mini and compact for small storage space plus traveling! I use it daily for small touch ups and smoothing my front layers and bangs. It works great just don&#x27;t leave it heating up to long, i recommend using it a minute after turning it on to insure it won&#x27;t get over heated. The safety case it comes in is a lifesaver because it is heat proof so you pack it up safely when on the go. Love the pink color!</li>
    <li> Small but does the work.</li>
    <li> Got here quick. Little smaller than Expected but does the job to say the least. The color is really cute too. Oh yeah,</li>
    <li> It came in sooner than expected was in the same shape as listed, I would buy form them again. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to hair irons. This one went on easily, stayed on, got reasonably hot and smoothed out my hair. Light weight so great for travel --also works on 120-240 voltage</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for a Europe trip and although it does get warm, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything. I thought that maybe it was defective, but when I got home, I tried it and it works just fine. It&#x27;s still useful to have a tiny straightener but it wasn&#x27;t helpful for my travels.</li>
    <li> Love this compact iron.  It heats up fast and gets really hot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great size for travel and comes in a nice pouch with a heat-proof mat that it can be stored in while it&#x27;s cooling.&lt;br /&gt;The small size makes it perfect for straightening bangs.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and for me, this Baby heats up quickly and works great. It travels like a dream and I can wrap it in its heat proof sleeve and throw it in my bag immediately after use. It&#x27;s also pink, and I must admit that the color is what sold me on the iron initially.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my trip to the US later this year. I plugged it in with an adapter here and it seemed quite good. Not a super powerful straightener, but for the size I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be. I only really straighten the front of my hair as I wear plaits a lot and it was sufficient for doing so. I have very thick hair so I just had to take my time doing small portions of hair nice and slow. Definitely will do for my trip! Plus it&#x27;s a really cute colour :P</li>
    <li> good price, decent size for a mini. makes my hair really soft and doesnt take long at all to heat up</li>
