      <li>:)  3)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I came here to buy more and - gasp - it&#x27;s gone out of production.  </li>
      <li>It still has that same wonderful scent.  </li>
      <li>My mother-in-law used this lotion on all the grand kids.</li>
      <li>The rose scent is light indeed.</li>
      <li>I love smoothing it on before bed.</li>
      <li>It made for a PERFECT mother&#x27;s day gift -- I ordered three regular sized bottles.</li>
      <li>I brought me and a friend a bottle we love it</li>
      <li>This lotion has a true rose petal scent, and that is all I could ask for.</li>
      <li>Smells SO good, not fake</li>
      <li>Just like roses, but not too strong that it&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
      <li>im very happy with my purchase its everything I expected and more....</li>
      <li>just the right amount of scent..used with yardley rose soap</li>
      <li>The smell is authentic to the original smell and the texture is creamy .</li>
      <li>It can easily be knocked off the dresser or bedside and could roll out of reach under furniture.</li>
      <li>I liked this product very much.  </li>
      <li>it has the smell of rose and is exactly what I used to but at the store.</li>
      <li>I love the smell too and it reminds me of fresh cut roses from my garden.</li>
      <li>still has the same great scent.  </li>
      <li>she confirmed it was in fact the lotion she remembered.</li>
      <li>great smell brings back the past,&lt;br</li>
      <li>Omg, guys you know this lotion made yoi happy back in the day?  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it!!!</li>
      <li>Other wise I am very pleased and will certainly buy again when said friend runs out!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not slipping into a silky peignoir made of rose petals, to be sure.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it was still being made, then I decided to look it up on Amazon, and sure enough it is still available !  </li>
      <li>I remember this lotion as a child and was excited to purchase it again .</li>
      <li>This lotion absorbs quickly without being greasy and has a wonderful fresh rose scent that&#x27;s not overpowering nor too weak.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and leaves hands soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Rich and sweet.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice rose scent - not as pungent as other rose-scented products I&#x27;ve tried, which I appreciate.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hands nice and soft.</li>
      <li>the product is the same and just as good.  </li>
      <li>I loved using it back in the 1980&#x27;s, but gradually fewer stores were carrying it</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to those who like the old fashioned rose milk smell.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and I can feel the difference right away.</li>
      <li>But I won&#x27;t be overwhelming innocent souls who must work next me to or sleep beside me.</li>
      <li>but mainly I just love it for my childhood memories of it.</li>
      <li>Nothing a quick wash couldn&#x27;t fix, though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is nice though, smells faintly of roses if you&#x27;re looking more for a rather understated fragrance.&lt;br /&gt; No oily residue, good lotion</li>
      <li>I used to use Rose Milk lotion years ago (not necessarily this brand) and loved it, I would receive compliments constantly.  </li>
      <li>The smell does remind me of my late grandmother, but like the other poster, in a good way :D</li>
      <li>Despite the nostalgia factor for some, as someone whose grandmothers did not use t, Ido not associate it with little old ladies at all, except that I think it would be a wonderful, useful, well-enjoyed gift for Nanas everywhere.</li>
      <li>The picture looks like it, but when I got the lotion it came in a white plastic bottle with the Rose Milk label pasted to the front of it.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes that skin very well, and it has a soft, fragrant rose scent that lingers through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this lotion, smells really good.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  I used to use Rose Milk lotion years ago (not necessarily this brand) and loved it, I would receive compliments constantly.  This Rose Milk has a slight fragrance while still in the bottle.  Once you put it on your body it dissipates.  Probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I got this for my mom because she was feeling nostalgic about the scent of Rose Milk lotion and how it reminded her of childhood. It made for a PERFECT mother&#x27;s day gift -- I ordered three regular sized bottles. The only thing that concerned me was the packaging...it wasn&#x27;t in the displayed pink bottle, but rather in a white bottle with simply a sticker of the Rose Milk brand logo etc.  Once my mom opened it and tested a small amount on her hands she confirmed it was in fact the lotion she remembered. Glad it worked out and happy to have found this on Amazon (albeit a bit pricey for lotion, but worth it).</li>
    <li> I adore this lotion!  Every night I drift off to sleep to the delicate scent of rose petals - Rose Milk on my hands, elbows and knees is the last thing I do before turning out the light.  Sweetness.  I came here to buy more and - gasp - it&#x27;s gone out of production.  PLEASE, if you want this brought back, visit the Vermont Country Store website and make a &amp;#34;Product Suggestion&amp;#34; under the Customer Service page.  Restocking out-of-production items is one of their specialties.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of my favorites.  The pros:  It sinks almost immediately into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of greasy feeling.  It also has a nice rose scent - not as pungent as other rose-scented products I&#x27;ve tried, which I appreciate.  It doesn&#x27;t knock you out with a heavy scent.  The cons:  Really just the price.  It&#x27;s quite expensive compared to other lotions and isn&#x27;t something I could afford to use on a daily basis.  On that note, it might be something to keep around to just use on your hands, or perhaps to use on your entire body every now and then on those humid days when a heavier lotion makes you feel worse than before you put it on.  I will continue to purchase it on occasion and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I buy that actually smells like roses. It&#x27;s not overbearing. It&#x27;s the same Rose Milk I&#x27;d sneak and rub all over my body when I was little and my favorite aunt used to come and visit.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff so much but was unable to find it at any local stores. I found it here and was frowning at the price. It&#x27;s 4.99 at CVS website, shipping is 5.49. Here last I saw; 8:97 and 4.99 shipping. So.. $10.48 vs 13.96. Some people may not care but a 3.48 difference matters to me. Still kind of up there but I Love this lotion. The smell does remind me of my late grandmother, but like the other poster, in a good way :D</li>
    <li> I thought this product was discontinued.  I loved using it back in the 1980&#x27;s, but gradually fewer stores were carrying it and ultimately I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  How happy was I to see it available through amazon, and at a great price!  This lotion absorbs quickly without being greasy and has a wonderful fresh rose scent that&#x27;s not overpowering nor too weak.</li>
    <li> I remember my aunt bringing this back to my mother after visiting the Biltmore dairy farms in Asheville, NC every year.  Hands feel soft, never sticky or tacky and the scent is delicious (roses and milk).</li>
    <li> im very happy with my purchase its everything I expected and more....thank you for your outstanding service...absolutely satisfied&lt;br /&gt;again thank you</li>
    <li> Not only is it a good value for the money, this lotion smells just like roses and lasts a long time. You don&#x27;t need much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a product that has been around for ages, and I love it. My mother used to use it and the smell gives me pleasant memories. I&lt;br /&gt;t does a decent job of moisturizing my skin but mainly I just love it for my childhood memories of it.</li>
    <li> My mom uses this and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores where I live.  It&#x27;s very silky and not at all&lt;br /&gt;sticky.  The fragrance is very delicate.</li>
    <li> This, in MY opinion, is NOT the Rose Milk Lotion of long ago.  The picture looks like it, but when I got the lotion it came in a white plastic bottle with the Rose Milk label pasted to the front of it.  And the label was too big for the bottle.  I was very disappointed and felt it was WAY over priced.  I will not ever buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I personally love roses and the smell of roses, so I love this lotion, because it smells just like a rose (with no added &#x27;sweetness&#x27; that many fragrant lotions have).  I don&#x27;t usually buy lotions that contain mineral oil, but this lotion is light enough that I do not feel the heaviness mineral oil can cause in lotions.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap dollar store baby lotion with a hint of rose scent. The packaging is a joke, it looks like they slapped a cheesy label on another product. Very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I remember this lotion as a child and was excited to purchase it again . The smell is authentic to the original smell and the texture is creamy . My only issue is with the packaging and price . The label looked awkwardly placed and did not fit the bottle . $8.99 is rather pricy for an item that is so poorly marketed and advertised. Overall, it was a fun purchase but will not repurchase again ,</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Moisturizes without being greasy and has a wonderful smell.  So glad to be able to find this product that I remember from my childhood.</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much.  It is nice but could also have a stronger scent.  It makes my hands nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what my mother in law had not been able to locate locally.  So she was happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> the product was excellent. Brought back memories of Grandma and the farm from the 1970&#x27;s. still has the same great scent.  it works really good for dry skin and the scent remains for a long time on the skin.</li>
    <li> I Purchased this product in March. It is no where near the same as the original product by Lee. I have used that problem for over 30 years so I noticed straight away the difference. The consistency is awful and the smell is not the same..I noticed that it is being manufactured by a different company now. I am so disappointed in the quality and will never purchase it again unless it was like the original again. The price is awful too.</li>
    <li> I can still remember back in the 60&#x27;s when someone hung a sample of ROSE MILK on our door.  Mom tried it, LOVED IT, and it immediately became her preferred skin care lotion.  It moisturizes that skin very well, and it has a soft, fragrant rose scent that lingers through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t seen this item in quite a while, so when I saw it on Amazon at a very reasonable price I just HAD to buy a bottle for myself.  It still has that same wonderful scent.  I think of my mom every time I use it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not like when I was a kid, the smell lasted for hours but it is a good lotion. thank.</li>
    <li> this is just what I was looking for. it has the smell of rose and is exactly what I used to but at the store.</li>
    <li> While the bottle is not the same as displayed, and it does have a poorly placed sticker on it, I don&#x27;t care. This lotion has a true rose petal scent, and that is all I could ask for. It&#x27;s amazing, almost as if smelling a boquet of roses,  and thats what I was lookjng for. Not too overpowering, either! Im very happy I bought this product, and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This has a beautiful rose smell and reminds me of my grandmother.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product, unless you&#x27;re buying it because it reminds you of days gone by. Otherwise, it&#x27;s made of too many unrecognizable ingredients, and the rose scent is dull.</li>
    <li> For its price (non expensive) is nice, smell very soft like roses, I use it everyday after shower and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  The milkman (remember those?) used to sell it.  Although  the container has changed (it used to be shaped like a milk bottle) the product is the same and just as good.  It absorbs completely and leaves no greasy residue.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for anything rose-scented, especially body products. I eyed this Rose Milk Skin Care Loton for a very, very long time before I finally thought &amp;#34;what are you waiting for?&amp;#34; and ordered it. I must mention that have no nostalgia tied to the product, no memories of my mother or grandmother smelling of its elegance-by-association with as they kissed me goodnight.  So, with no pre-set expectations, I opened it immediately (even as other family members were clamoring for their part of the order)(it was the dogs) and breathed it in: a powdery, true rose scent, almost old-fashioned somehow. Just the way I like it. I let out two sighs, one of relief, and one of delight.  I&#x27;ve first I applied it a few times to my hands and arms, and later my body&#x27;s shoulders, décolletage, legs, and feet.  My reactions:  1) This is far more moisturizing than I expected! Many perfumed lotions will wind up only drying you out (Bath &amp; Body Works, for example, has never satisfied my skin. And I only use one kind: Pink Peony, because it includes notes of rose.)    a) The alcohol content of Rose Milk is not specified, but it does come towards the middle of the ingredients list, meaning the prime ingredients are: water, mineral oil, and glycerin, before the various types of alcohol start popping up.)(Comparatively, my B&amp;BW list reads water, glycerin, petrolatum, and then cetyl alcohol launched the longer list of ingredients.)    b)  Maybe that mineral oil is giving it some staying power? All I know is, my skin feels so good, and I won&#x27;t be reaching for the bottle again and again. That&#x27;s a relief.  2) The rose scent is light indeed. I&#x27;m not slipping into a silky peignoir made of rose petals, to be sure. But I won&#x27;t be overwhelming innocent souls who must work next me to or sleep beside me. It&#x27;s my personal fragrance in my personal space. I like that.    A) This stuff does NOT smell like grannies! Despite the nostalgia factor for some, as someone whose grandmothers did not use t, Ido not associate it with little old ladies at all, except that I think it would be a wonderful, useful, well-enjoyed gift for Nanas everywhere. :)  3) The lotion is creamy enough for a little to go a long way. A dime-sized amount is enough the moisturize both my hands and arms.  4) I&#x27;m noticing the fragrance seems buildable, perhaps. Apply in layers to carefully strengthen the scent!  5) I have but one complaint: this is not a pump bottle nor does it have a snap cap. A loose cap is a challenge, no matter who you are, no matter how old you are. It can easily be knocked off the dresser or bedside and could roll out of reach under furniture. If there are dogs or children around, yikes! Danger! It&#x27;s quite, quite frustrating, as I have a tough-luck history with such things (no, not children and dogs, but runaway caps.)  Ultimately, I had to take away a star (I wish I could only dock it a half star) for the loose-bottle-top issue.  But otherwise, this Rose Milk is a romantic, soothing, skin softening treat and and excellent value over luxury brands I haven&#x27;t even mentioned.</li>
    <li> I brought me and a friend a bottle we love it</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a good friend of mine. She absolutely loves it!!! She said it smells amazing and every single time she sees me she thanks me again for buying this for her. It does smell really great. Just like roses, but not too strong that it&#x27;s overwhelming. She told me this has been great for her dry/cracked hands. My only complaint is the plastic wrap it came in was filthy and dusty. Nothing a quick wash couldn&#x27;t fix, though. Other wise I am very pleased and will certainly buy again when said friend runs out!!</li>
    <li> Have alwAys loved the scent.  It was one of my grandmothers and my mothers favorites.  Nice feminine scent from yesteryear.</li>
    <li> I having been using Rosemilk since I was teenager to keep my skin soft after shaving. The rose prevents follicle bumps better than ointments like Bikini Zone and smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of my Grandmother! Smells SO good, not fake</li>
    <li> Omg, guys you know this lotion made yoi happy back in the day?  Come on now!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a rather faint rose scent, this is good.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a more strong, noticeable rose scent, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a stronger scent, something that you rub on and smell like you walked through a fine mist of rose oil.&lt;br /&gt;This is nice though, smells faintly of roses if you&#x27;re looking more for a rather understated fragrance.&lt;br /&gt; No oily residue, good lotion, I just wished it had a stronger scent to it, also wish it was bigger quantity, kinda a slightly hefty price for the small quantity you get, it fits in about the length of my hand. Oh well I&#x27;m content enough.</li>
    <li> I remembered this as a child being put on by my mother. I loved the smell. I saw this and the nostalgia kicked in. A wonderful buy this was. Its exactly the same as I remembered. Rich and sweet. Love it. I wish thete was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of scent</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law used this lotion on all the grand kids. Rose Milk lotion is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a stocking stuffer for my 46 yr old daughter..... great smell brings back the past,&lt;br /&gt;as she remembers her late Grandma.</li>
    <li> I had a pretty high expectations of the smell... I dont like the smell. It was not nice smell... Not like a baby smell.</li>
    <li> This is still one of my favorite lotions.  The scent is still the same as it was years ago.  The scent is light and not too heavy.  I love smoothing it on before bed.</li>
    <li> Very happy with lotion. Happy to find it on Amazon. Not able to find in our area. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I have recently discovered the rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;I remember this product from my childhood and thought&lt;br /&gt;I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a very pleasing scent and works well.</li>
    <li> Everything was good except the price. This is so over priced it is a shame. My 83 year old mother wanted it so I bought it. Shipping was swift also.</li>
    <li> Smells like roses and makes my skin fell great. It goes on smooth and I can feel the difference right away. I love the smell too and it reminds me of fresh cut roses from my garden.</li>
    <li> This lotion has been around for a very long time, and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store anymore. Wasn&#x27;t sure it was still being made, then I decided to look it up on Amazon, and sure enough it is still available !  I love the scent of this lotion, and the softness it provides, with out feeling greasy.  I am so happy to have found it again !  It feels like the same old formula.  Sometimes new is not always better !!!  Thanks for still making this wonderful Rose Milk, hand lotion !!!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to those who like the old fashioned rose milk smell. This is the same product in different packaging. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells just like my Grammy did!</li>
    <li> Same smell and everything. I used on my baby and smelled like a little rose :) It doesn&#x27;t have that fake rose smell most have its really close to the real thing.</li>
    <li> I just got this and the only reason I really bought this is because it reminds me of my grandmother.  I remember her always having this lotion and I remember as a little girl lathering it all over..  I love this stuff... if not for anything else the memories</li>
    <li> I have used Rose Milk for years, and since I cannot get it in the store anymore, I had to ask my daughter to help me order it on line. I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel,  very smooth.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy, even use it on my face. The fragrance is pleasing and not over powering. I wear Tea Rose cologne, so this does not conflict with it.</li>
    <li> Very light weight lotion. Smells beautiful.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and leaves hands soft and smooth.  Had a hard time finding Rose Milk.  Now I can buy more.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Terrific product. Smells divine! 😄 Wish they had a spray as well.</li>
    <li> just the right amount of scent..used with yardley rose soap it is perfect.  wish they sold it in stores still</li>
