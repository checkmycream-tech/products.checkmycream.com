      <li>She says it soaks right into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
      <li>Best of all it destroys dry spots with minimal applications.  </li>
      <li>My first bottle didn&#x27;t pump right, and they sent me a replacement.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it really soaks into my skin quickly and there is no smell.  </li>
      <li>I would say this is as good a lotion as any out there, but nothing special, at least not for me.</li>
      <li>For both hot summer and winter days, the cream fully protects your skin from the elememts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But had no ill side effects at all.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more in the future!!</li>
      <li>My husband finished his previous lotion and started to use this and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing I would like to say about the cream is that the 354ml quantity is very generous for the price compared with comparable products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a very keen sense of smell, though.</li>
      <li>Emu oil absorbs into the skin fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Although it works okay its not what I expected.  </li>
      <li>AND IT REALLY WORKS</li>
      <li>Thanks for your product.  </li>
      <li>I really like your product.  </li>
      <li>SEA Lotion works really well on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I finally made the decision to switch to more natural products.  </li>
      <li>I have not noticed that it has any greater effect on hair, skin, etc., than any other oil or moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy, absorbs quickly, a light scent that doesn&#x27;t hang around long.  </li>
      <li>Light, absorbs completely, makes my skin looks years younger.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>We enjoy this lotion - natural, light, moisture, with just a very subtle natural smell to it.</li>
      <li>I am quite a fussy one when it comes to using moisturizing lotion, as I have an extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>She likes the way it keeps her skin soft.</li>

      <li>I have not found one, including this one, that moisturizes my skin very well or keeps it moisturized for very long.  </li>
      <li>This lotion got quite a few rave reviews, so I thought I would try it, especially since it is fragrance free</li>
      <li>As an individual with highly sensitive and ever-often dry skin, I am very sceptical about the types of products that I use on my skin and always aim to choose wisely.&lt;br /&gt;SEA</li>
      <li>I use pure Emu oil in the winter for patches of dry skin I get on several places on my face.</li>
      <li>, I occasionally get dry skin around my legs but while using SEA moisturizing premium lotion, it blends in very well into my skin and no need to reapply or worries about stains on clothes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This superb product contains all natural ingredient, its fragrance free, the creme blends easily into the skin, continuous use provides skin with a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife who was looking for a moisturizing lotion that doesn&#x27;t have junk ingredients. This brand is paraben free, has no irritating fragrances, and no petroleum products in its makeup. Those are the 3 facts about the product that drew me to it. It says it is made for men, too - but I am just not into adding creams and stuff like that to my skin, so I leave it to the gals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it also contains EMU oil and I am even a fan of that. Emu oil absorbs into the skin fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.I use pure Emu oil in the winter for patches of dry skin I get on several places on my face. Emu oil takes care of it quickly. I might try this moisturizing cream myself this Winter on those spots. But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this stuff. She puts it on her arms, hands, legs, and feet every night. She says it soaks right into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. I can attest to that since I sleep with her and haven&#x27;t had any problems with her slipping out of bed or leaving greasy film on the sheets. She likes the way it keeps her skin soft. If she is happy, I am happy. So that is why I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect for the whole body and keeps the skin moisturised without being too heavy. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin being made from natural products and my whole family love it! I will be recommending this cream to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Great lotion!! Not sticky and makes your skin look and feel great!! And it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Using it for over 3 weeks and I am loving it, I occasionally get dry skin around my legs but while using SEA moisturizing premium lotion, it blends in very well into my skin and no need to reapply or worries about stains on clothes. All I can say is \\&quot;don&#x27;t run out\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The lotion is wonderful and put a lasting soothing effects on my skin. It&#x27;s organic with no any allergy on my skin.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product in our home for the past couple of weeks now and we can already see the difference on our skins especial our 5 month old son who has some patches of dry skin. We love this product as it is made from natural ingredients that the skin can absorb. Would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly and well protected, and I immediately used it all over my body. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling great. It is not entirely unscented but has a very unobtrusive hint of cinnamon that I find quite pleasant. I have a very keen sense of smell, though. My husband still thought I smelled like me after I applied it- he did not detect cinnamon at all.</li>
    <li> I really like your product.  My husband rubs it on my feet and it has helped my ruff dry feet.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it really soaks into my skin quickly and there is no smell.  Thanks for your product.  I will be buying more in the future!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many lotions and this definitely is the best.  It goes on really nicely and spreads evenly.  It has a nice aroma and my skin feels well moisturized and it is nice not to have to reapply.  I will be ordering again and recommending to all my friends &amp; family</li>
    <li> This lotion got quite a few rave reviews, so I thought I would try it, especially since it is fragrance free and I am always looking for unscented, fragrance free products.  I am 62 years old with aging dry skin and have tried almost every body lotion out there with pretty much the same results.  I have not found one, including this one, that moisturizes my skin very well or keeps it moisturized for very long.  It did seem to work well on my face as far as moisturizing well, but I have discovered that I am allergic to emu oil so I stopped using it.  I have also tried several emu oil products in addition to this one and cannot figure out what all the fuss is about.  I have not noticed that it has any greater effect on hair, skin, etc., than any other oil or moisturizer.  I would say this is as good a lotion as any out there, but nothing special, at least not for me.</li>
    <li> As an individual with highly sensitive and ever-often dry skin, I am very sceptical about the types of products that I use on my skin and always aim to choose wisely.&lt;br /&gt;SEA Moisturizing Body Lotion was introduced to me by a friend that suffers from the same dry/sensitive skin issues as myself and she advised that soon after she began using the product she started to see a real change with improvements in her skins appearence and feel- seemed like it was working for her and so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;That was months ago and I am still using this product to date! It leaves the skin feeling soft, smooth, moist and better yet, is easily absorbed into the skin without being greasy. It relieved my dry skin without feeling heavy on, contains natural ingredients/essential oils and is also non-fragranced- so for a sensitive/dry skin like mine it was perfect! It is a product that I have already recommended and will continue to recommend to others with all skin types!</li>
    <li> Moisturizing? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;Soothing? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting effect? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family and I use SEA Premium Moisturizing Body Lotion and we are loving it. Every application to the skin blends in smoothly giving you a soothing and moisturizing feel and look without a greasy touch. On a few occasions, I have had to touch water based products shortly after applying SEA, it was comforting to find my hands were still moisturized and not slippery or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one word for SEA moisturizing body lotion ... AWES-MAZING (coined from awesome and amazing, courtesy of my sons)</li>
    <li> Okay..where to begin..this lotion has worked wonders for my hands which were so cracked and dried out..after about a week or so of using this lotion before bed they have been transformed. They are softer and feel so much better. Love this stuff and that it&#x27;s natural. I would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I am quite a fussy one when it comes to using moisturizing lotion, as I have an extremely sensitive skin. However,  since I have used SEA my skin has visibly improved and it looks radiant and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my quest to find the perfect cream after all these years is finally over, thanks to this Fanta-zing and Splend-abolous moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can wait for more from this line. as  I want all the products!!!!!!! YES!!!! SEA, U had me at moisturizing and organic!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Sea Moisturizing Body Lotion is easy to use and comes in durable packaging. It is not oily so it does not stain your clothes. It is smooth, silky and soft to touch which makes it really easy and quick to apply for both adults and children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fragrance free allowing you to use your favorite perfume with ease after application. It comes in a 12fl.oz bottle so suitable for weekend breaks and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really lovely body lotion - don&#x27;t take my word for it - try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big lotion kinda guy, but this stuff is really great.  Not greasy, absorbs quickly, a light scent that doesn&#x27;t hang around long.  Best of all it destroys dry spots with minimal applications.  All it needs is a sunscreen added and I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> We enjoy this lotion - natural, light, moisture, with just a very subtle natural smell to it.</li>
    <li> The issues with my skin are a mile long.  I finally made the decision to switch to more natural products.  The process has been hard and extremely expensive.  Thankfully its OVER!!  SEA Lotion works really well on my skin.  I have been extremely pleased with the results.  I usually go through a really bad dry skin phase when the seasons change but not this time.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great.  My other lotion was beginning to cause my skin to itch.  This is nourishing and no itch.  My first bottle didn&#x27;t pump right, and they sent me a replacement.  Good service.</li>
    <li> It is too expensive for the results it gives.  I do not find it any more effective than good drugstore brands and far more costly. I would not order it again.</li>
    <li> I chose to go vegetarain a few years ago and that was when I began my romance with organic products. While shopping for a body cream, I was immediately drawn to this cream (Sea)because of its oragnic base. I tried it out and instantly loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is smooth , soothing and gentle on the body. It is not too light on the skin, neither does it feel heavy on the body. For both hot summer and winter days, the cream fully protects your skin from the elememts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I would like to say about the cream is that the 354ml quantity is very generous for the price compared with comparable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would 100% recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> This SEA premium moisturizing lotion is GOOD.</li>
    <li> I am using this for stretch narks and love it.  It has hydrating properties that are so good for your skin.  I will continue using this.</li>
    <li> my only hesitation for a 5 star rating is the price. I think I paid closed to $20 for this product with shipping and I thought it would be a larger quantity. I have very sensitive skin and, while not being overly moisturizing, it did not cause any irritation which is a great testimony for the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> What more can I say?  Light, absorbs completely, makes my skin looks years younger.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Although it works okay its not what I expected.  I thought it would be much more  moisturizing. I will use the remainder of the lotion.</li>
    <li> Oh yes this is a great lotion.  My husband finished his previous lotion and started to use this and really liked it.  It soaked in nice and he felt it made his skin nice and soft after shaving.  He would like me to get his some more.  It is one of the more expensive lotions we have tried.  But had no ill side effects at all.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A PRODUCT I CANNOT FIND IN THE DRUG STORE AND IT REALLY WORKS</li>
