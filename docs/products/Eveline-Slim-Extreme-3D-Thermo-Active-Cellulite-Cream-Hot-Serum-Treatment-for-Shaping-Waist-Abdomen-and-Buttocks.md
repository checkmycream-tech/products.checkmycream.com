<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a 5 star rate service packing delivery and the product is  great thank you</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Using on my stomach with a corset to flatten and firm my stomach.  Trying to get rid of baby bump.  Only been a few days and skin feels like it tightening already.</li>
    <li> I like the sensation it gives after putting it on. I&#x27;m not sure if its working but I&#x27;m waist training and can see results that way.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the Eveline product line , lots of natural ingredients and satisfied results overtime smoother look on thighs and buttocks</li>
    <li> I love the way this Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active serum feels upon application. This is very different from other &amp;#34;cellulite&amp;#34; creams and lotions I have tried. This has a gel consistency and a little bit goes a long way. It does take a few minutes to dry and absorb into the skin, so be aware that this is not a apply and get dressed thing. You will have to wait a few minutes before you can get dressed. After you get dressed you will start to feel a warming sensation and even may feel your skin get very warm/hot. I personally think the warmer the better, it just feels like it&#x27;s working. It is different cause it is a warming sensation and not a burning on fire sensation like some others may be. It does have a herbal like scent as well. I have notice a firmer feeling of the skin. My cellulite is not gone, but it does feel firmer. If you are someone who will apply this consistently, I think your results will be much better than mine. I apply it a few times a week, cause I am always in a rush and wake up late and never have the time to apply in the morning, but I can say when I was applying consistently there was a firmer feeling. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect me thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> Heats up but not to hot, feels like its working. Use it while working out. Smells good</li>
    <li> I use this every time I work out and I&#x27;ve got to say the warming effect makes you want to go even harder on your work out! Makes you sweat like a pig but it makes you feel great once you&#x27;ve finished your work out! Love it and I have noticed my legs have gotten less bumpy!</li>
    <li> This is great for working out. Once you out it on it starts creating this warm sensation on your skin and helps you sweat even more. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Works well used it today you can feel the difference</li>
    <li> I use it in combination with foil cling! Burns even better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Then 20 min on the running machine or Stair master and you will sweat big time!&lt;br /&gt;Success guaranteed.</li>
    <li> It made my skin itchy !! But if u wear alone it wont work! If u wear it with a waist  trainer it will work n u feel it getting hot!!</li>
    <li> Loving it .....really makes you sweat .</li>
    <li> Love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;OK been using for a week now and I find it is better during workouts. I feel it working and I love the part where it get tingling sensation and very warm so I can sweat more during my workouts!!! 😍</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with a waist trainer and I&#x27;ve had fabulous results from it. I really recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very good product, love it !</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream and I&#x27;m already in love with it. At first I was skeptical,  but now I am a believer.</li>
    <li> Not like the other slim extreme. It&#x27;s ok I don&#x27;t like how warm it gets. It gets hot on your skin.</li>
    <li> This works awesone!!! I used it worth my kutting weight suit and was very impressed!!! The warming was really soothing. I lost about 2 pounds in 1 week alone with exercising.</li>
    <li> Everyone is looking for a miracle weight-loss product where they have to do absolutely nothing and still get results. I&#x27;m not afraid to admit, I&#x27;m one of those people but I am a little bit more realistic. Come on, who doesn&#x27;t want to sit on their bum all day and still get a slimmer waist? If you said you wouldn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re obviously lying. However, even if you can&#x27;t sit on your butt all day and lose weight, you can do moderate exercise and use products that will accelerate your weight loss or the shrinking of your waist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, so I am lazy and I can admit that. I am lazy and love food (maybe a little too much love) but I know that if I ever want to see results, I need to get off my lazy butt and do some sort of exercise. For the laziness most people seem to face, I would suggest starting with just walking for a few minutes everyday. It&#x27;s something you do regardless so why not take a nice relaxing stroll in the park or around your neighborhood? Now, just walking isn&#x27;t going to make you drop pant sizes drastically but it is a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, exercise and diet alone isn&#x27;t enough. If you are losing a lot of weight, chances are your skin is going to sag or become dimpled or you may have cellulite. I know from previous weight gains and loss, my skin has stretched and has become loose and I am not afraid to admit that I could use a little bit of help to get rid of it. This is where Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Shaping Serum came to my rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently gotten back into exercising after taking a hiatus for almost a year (I was in the middle of college courses so try not to judge me too harshly) and while I have noticed that I feel healthier, I realized that I looked almost completely the same. Yes, my pants are starting to fit a bit looser but my skin still looked flabby and wasn&#x27;t toned at all. I decided to give this shaping serum as try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I noticed the red gel like substance that came out of the tube and was instantly intrigued. I have never seen a gel or serum that has had that color before so I was interested to see how it worked. It has the consistency of a gel so it absorbs into the skin quicker than a cream would. I used a little bit of this serum on my thighs, love handles, and abdomen to begin with since those are my most troubling areas. (*I have heard that if you use too much serum it can cause discomfort so less is more)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt a warming sensation and as I began my regular workout routine, I felt myself heating up and sweating a lot more. I wasn&#x27;t over exerting myself but I felt like my workout was a lot more effective than all of my previous ones so I continued to use this serum. I didn&#x27;t notice any results right away but after about two weeks of doing this, I noticed that my skin looked tighter and more toned. My dimpled upper thighs were starting to appear more smooth and creamy, they no longer looked like cottage cheese!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, since no topical product has ever been proven to get rid of cellulite, you can&#x27;t expect this serum to make all of your cellulite disappear. It has helped improve the appearance of my cellulite but I know it is still there, with continued exercise it should hopefully firm up enough to where you will no longer be able to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this product. While my results might not have appeared quickly and sweating isn&#x27;t my favorite thing to do, I was surprised at some of the results that I have seen thus far. If you do decided to also give this product a try just remember one thing: you CANNOT expect this product to work if you don&#x27;t get up and moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.tube and was instantly intrigued.

    <li> Feel the burn lol I love this stuff it hurts at first but as you keep wearing it, you feel the burning sensation lessen so it doesn&#x27;t bother you as much as the first time. But I like it! It does the job. I wear it with my waist cincer when I go running. I&#x27;ve seen a little difference but you HAVE to workout and you MUST have a good healthy diet in order for it to work.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a change yet</li>
    <li> Freaking amazing!!!! Smells so good, I love the tingling (you know its working). And after a week (along with better eating and exercise) my mom flab (I have had two kids) isn&#x27;t as flabby. Definitely a great toning lotion. I just had my husband order me another bottle because I NEVER want to run out! Ever, the only way I&#x27;ll stop using it is when I get pregnant with our last, and as soon as that baby is born I will go right back to it!</li>
    <li> I love this! I noticed a difference the first night I used it. I have loose cottage cheese kind of skin since I have had 2 children, most recent child 4 months ago. My skin is so much tighter than it was before. It was a noticable difference that my husband even saw. Very pleased! and yes, the first night I put it on, I was very surprised the burning feeling. It just feels like you are in the tanning bed and only last about 15 minutes. Not bad at all!</li>
    <li> Follow-up on initial review...I have now been using this for a little over a week (in combination with diet &amp; exercise) but I have noticed tightening, especially on my derriere :) ...pretty visible difference...my skin looks smoother, alot less bumpy, def tightening up...however keep in mind A LITTLE BIT goes a long way...that was my mistake in the beginning.. I usually apply twice a day...a little in the mornings after a shower...&amp; it builds up to a warming sensation (lasts 30-40 min)...in the evening I increase the amount...it&#x27;s a little more difficult to tolerate but not impossible and your body starts adjusting to the sensation. I really like it and will continue to use it and order it...def 5 stars once I see full results. Just to compre I&#x27;ve been using the product on abdomen, butt but not thighs and there&#x27;s a very marked difference in the appearance of these areas...which at least let&#x27;s me know that it&#x27;s the product &amp; not my regular routine (diet, exercise).</li>
    <li> The heat sneaks up on u, love it. Must Must use while working out, feels like u will have fast results so keep it up. I wear it during workout n at night at bed time while wearing a waist trainer. Luv it</li>
    <li> So far nothing, but I do enjoy the warming I&#x27;ve on used for like a week though so we&#x27;ll see :-)</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome!  I use it with a waist wrap during my work out.  It warms up  a great deal but not to the point where it burns.  When I take it off there is a ton of sweat around my midsection.  I&#x27;m not looking for it to perform miracles.  I eat a healthy diet and work out on a daily basis.  This just helps me to feel like I&#x27;m getting something extra out of my workout.  I will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love it!! only been using this for a week and I already see results.. Although Im not a huge fan of the warming effect .. I DO love the results and will continue to buy this until i have reached my desired results!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Will not order again!!</li>
    <li> I am rating this three stars only because I have not used it consistently. So it may be an unfair review. I can&#x27;t say what it would do if used as directed, but I will say that it definitely has a warming sensation that you can feel and that in itself will make you think it&#x27;s working. I will continue to use it though.</li>
    <li> Very warming sensation. I&#x27;ve lost weight n inches jus by rubbing gel on my belly n wearing the Ann cherry waist cincher. Still see results after 2 weeks so I&#x27;m gunna keep using it. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase n will buy again</li>
    <li> It does get warm, now waiting to see if my waist gets smaller.</li>
    <li> First I bought Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Cellulite Serum (8.8 oz) for my legs and it worked well. So, I decided to order this one for the abdomen. This come in a shape of a gel and once you applied it feels hot and itchy, but it actually work. You have to take a shower and then when the skin pores open then you apply it. I lost an inch of fat :) so I think it&#x27;s good in a 2 week usage.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this product since the tube looks just like the 4D belly fat reducer cerum. This product burns painfully and at times is unbearable.  I hate applying it but since I spent my hard earned $$ I have no choice. It seems to be working,tightening my belly and reducing cellulite.  If you can stand the pain which lasts about 30 min then go for it!</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works..My legs are smoother and more firm. Between this product and my Ann Chery waist trainer my waist is getting smaller and &#x60;love handles&#x60;are gone:)</li>
