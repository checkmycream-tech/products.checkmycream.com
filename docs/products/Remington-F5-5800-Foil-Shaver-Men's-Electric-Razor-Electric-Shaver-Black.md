<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> trimmer sucks on it not a good angle for trimming.</li>
    <li> One of the screen covers broke within a few days.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it. It shaves much closer than his old shaver and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> After only 2 months the blade ate through the foil! Do yourself a favor, get a Norelco!</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. It shaves well, easy to clean with soap and/or water, stays sharp. I have purchased very expensive Braun razors in the past and Remington razors are cheaper and superior.</li>
    <li> This shaver works better than most I have had in the past. The best ever that Remington made was back in the 70&#x27;s when they made a triple head corded shaver. I have a tuff face to shave because of a lot of acne scaring.  Most razors I have used I would have go behind them with a regular razor and blade to do a great job. This razor is good, as it get most of my bread . I would say to anyone that this is a great buy. I would buy this again if i needed a new one.</li>
    <li> I have had it about a week now and so far so good. Not too expensive and works well. For some reason, other brands don&#x27;t shave well for me and have been using Remington shavers for the last 20 years because of that. The rotary-blade shavers don&#x27;t work well for me either so I always use this type instead. This is the first Remington I have had with a pivoting head and I do like it. Sometimes I hit the power button by accident because of it&#x27;s placement on the device and either turn it on accidentally while carrying it to the car or turn it off while shaving, but I figure that I will get used to the placement of the button eventually.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and the shaver head fell apart after the 2nd shave. Returned the shaver and replaced with a Braun.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  I had used Remington&#x27;s older model for years before, but when it became difficult to find .... I went with the F5-5800 model.  It&#x27;s a little bit bigger, but a lot more &amp;#34;elegant&amp;#34; in design and function.  It&#x27;s a winner in my book, and the price right..... real right!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two Norelco triple head rechargables for probably 15 years and been mostly happy, but the high cost of new heads, and the fact that the batteries were not holding charges made me decide to try something new.  After reading reviews and looking at costs I decided to try this and so far have been very pleased.  Battery life is good.  Shaving action isn&#x27;t perfect - still a bit of stubble unless I really work - but for day to day shaving it works fine.</li>
    <li> I have used a different brand foil shaver for the last ten years.  Things only last so long and I had to replace my old shaver.  I purchased the F5-5800 only on price.  The shaver shaves closer and quicker than my old shaver.  So far I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Yay, my husband loves it! He is super sensitive to shavers, and this one gets super close without irritating his skin.</li>
    <li> This maybe one of the best value on here as far as electric razors go I have been using this razor for almost a year and I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  It&#x27;s got pretty good battery life I have charged it maybe 10 times since I have had it.  For the money this razor is well worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent product which is also easy to clean,</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shaver. It gives a much closer, more comfortable shave than previous electrics, and very close to what my blade shaver gives. The battery charge lasts for about 10 shaves, and recharges quickly. Recommend the per-shave &amp;#34;face saver&amp;#34; stick and the &amp;#34;shaver saver&amp;#34; spray for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great shaver its a must have for on the go!!!</li>
    <li> A really nice, affordable shaver.</li>
    <li> It does a real good job. I used several but this by far is the best one I used</li>
    <li> The foils wore out after only two months of use. The replacements cutters and foils cost more than the shaver. I will never buy anything from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This design has much more noise and vibration than rotary heads. Cuts very well. Buzzes like a box of bees. Good value, but I hope I find my rotary razor. I keep accidentally touching the off button.</li>
    <li> For a price bracket of around 30$ this is the best you will find. It is also multi-functional as one can use it for shaving and trimming. The blades are not rough, but if you push too hard then definitely some roughness or skin burn is felt.    In order to get a clean shave you have to move them over the skin in a direction opposite to the direction of hair growth. This is my first ever shaver and I can tell you that it shaves close enough to be compared with the shaving with razor blades, I used to use earlier.    Edited: I am reducing 2 stars from the rating because the screens of the shaver heads have started to fall off after just 4-5 shaves. I think I need to return/exchange this product now.    Re-Edited: +1 star for the prompt service provided by the Remington customer care in handling the issue. They gave me a new piece of shaver head.</li>
    <li> I was given this item from my better half and I have to say that she did good. I enjoy using it each day. I shave my very close (I LIKE IT!!).</li>
    <li> Shaves great. I got tired of safety blade razors after 50 years and went for this Remington. Shaves close and battery lasts a long time. Make sure you read the directions and charge 24 hours before using. Then once a year run battery all the way down. My stupid mail carrier drove up in my driveway and tossed the package in the middle of my carport floor. When I drove in it was dark and I crushed the package with my car. Amazon had a replacement at my door the very next day. Can&#x27;t beat Amazon for their outstanding service. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have owned a braun series 5 and a remington sp390 and this by far out beats them ALL. The main problem i had with the other shavers is neck hair. This totally makes neck hair a problem of the past. I used to have to pull out the trimmer on the other shavers and go over them several times with the trimmer then shave over the trimmed cut hair, pain in the azz. This totally eliminates all that, a few good passes over the neck area problem solved. I also noticed how it works with just a few passes, totally impressed.</li>
    <li> does not shave as well as the older Remington Titanium foil shaver I used for years, but it&#x27;s better than the rotary shavers others offer.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver. Good job Amazon as this is the best price I have seen online so far for this shaver.</li>
    <li> though the Interceptor system is not new for Remington shavers, it is always a very useful resource for those who have very thick beard as I have.&lt;br /&gt;It really cuts the long hair while the foils clean up the short ones. The price is fair for such technology. I would buy another one</li>
    <li> works better than expected  very happy</li>
    <li> So,so, clumsy to hold, fingers hit the on/off switch allot, pain to clean, cuts 75%, finish with a good rotary.</li>
    <li> Good electric razor. Easy to take apart to clean inside plus the cutters remove too.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. Love how it tells you when the battery is low. Gives a nice close shave. I would recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price. Worked as expected.</li>
    <li> Motor sputtered within three months, completely died within four. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> this electric razor actually gives me a better shave than I was expecting. Anyone needing an electric razor would be very pleased with a Remington F5-5800 razor.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty well but you can&#x27;t properly clean it like others, you basically just have to hold it under water to get hair out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Remingtons for years now, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. Not the most expensive, obviously, but the best.</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY WELL. MUCH BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS MODEL. I AM MOST SATIFIED</li>
    <li> Wonderful electric razor. Really shaves close.</li>
    <li> Had it for a couple of months only but it&#x27;s running fine and does the job with pretty long battery life.  Pretty impressed so far!</li>
    <li> I had this same model of electric razor for many years. The foil on it finally broke, and would scratch/cut my skin when I used it. So in looking for a replacement foil, I realized that buying a while new razor was only $5 more than the whole new razor. Well that was a no-brainer... I bought a new razor. Fresh batteries, new motor AND a new foil. Works great; I like it much better than the rotary type ones. Holds a charge for a long time, and even gets those &amp;#34;hard to shave&amp;#34; areas on my neck that can sometimes have difficult to remove stubble.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a replacement for my existing razor of the same model. It represents such good value for money and was almost the same price as new screens and cutters.</li>
    <li> Good and comfortable shave. Glad that I took a chance on this razor.</li>
    <li> I find the F5800 to be a very good shaver coupled with an inadequate trimmer. I recently switched from an F5790, which is both a good shaver and good trimmer, because replacement screen/blades, at $17/ea, were wearing out every 3 months, or less.  I&#x27;m hoping that the F5800 will do much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;After a blade/screen break-in period, I find that I get a very close, comfortable shave of my face and head, with the F5800.  The &amp;#34;Interceptor&amp;#34; cutter does seem to deal very well with those rogue hairs that sometimes go unnoticed until they get too long to miss.  The trimmer, on the other hand, may be good for sideburns (I don&#x27;t have them) but it&#x27;s not much use for anything else.  It doesn&#x27;t cut well and is very awkwardly positioned.  I have a moustache and goatee, and I pretty much have to rely on scissors to shape and trim.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning brush is a toy.  Fortunately I have a cleaning brush from an old shaver, and I&#x27;m using that one.  The F5790 had a very useful shaver stand that allowed it to charge in an upright position.  Nothing like that is offered for the F5800, which is disappointing.  I had to modify the F5790 stand for use with the 5800 (not easy).&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I can highly recommend the F5800 as a shaver, but if you&#x27;ll be depending on having a good trimmer you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. Hes had one for 5-6 years but the blades were getting dull. We found it cost $5 more to buy another razor than to buy blades for the old one. So we bought a second one. Great product ....Buy one!</li>
    <li> I read so many positive reviews.  I thought I would get a smoother shave.  What do I expect for 23.99?</li>
    <li> Does everything I expected!</li>
    <li> Got it right on time my husband loved it no complaints</li>
    <li> My grandson used it and said, it was a really close shave, he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is good foil razor, no doubts about a close and comfortable shave.  Has a good weight in the hand, and doesn&#x27;t pull or nicks the skin, goes on smooth.  A couple of items on the negative side is that it&#x27;s a bit noisy and it \\&quot;leaks\\&quot; some of the hairs it has shaved off.  I sort of expected the former since I&#x27;ve had other foil Remingtons and they are all a bit noisier than the triple headed Norelcos I&#x27;ve owned, but they do shave a lot closer and in less time. As for \\&quot;leaking\\&quot; of shavings, well, I just don&#x27;t know.  Not sure if it&#x27;s due to a defect in the Remington I got, or whether all the F5-5800 models do the same.  To say the least, it&#x27;s a bit annoying that the razor can&#x27;t hold the shavings and they get over you.  And it doesn&#x27;t matter that the razor&#x27;s \\&quot;pocket\\&quot; is emptied a couple of times during the shaving; give it a couple of passes and it starts to \\&quot;leak\\&quot; again.  Oh, and by the way, I have average facial growth that I shave off each morning, so the razor is \\&quot;leaking\\&quot; an average day&#x27;s facial growth.  I gave it three stars due to the \\&quot;leaking.\\&quot;    UPDATE - 12/31/2014  Had rated the shaver with three stars and an \\&quot;OK.\\&quot;  That review triggered the following email from Remington, and I quote: \\&quot;Hi, thank you for providing your feedback regarding your Remington product. We are sorry that our product did not meet your expectations and want to ensure your concerns are resolved. Please contact us at Contactus@remingtonproducts.com and reference case ID number 1257649 or call 1-800-736-4648, so that we may better assist you.\\&quot;      Did not expect any communications or offers to \\&quot;assist,\\&quot; so I was curious and responded.  This was Remington&#x27;s response, and I quote: \\&quot;Thank you for your reply. I would suggest cleaning the shaver once you are done with half of your face, then continuing on with the other half.\\&quot;    Folks, that reply really and truly peeled my onion, so to speak.  I do not need Remington to offer \\&quot;assistance\\&quot; that is keyed to make their customer feel they are stupid or idiots who just fell off a turnip truck!  So here was my response to their \\&quot;assistance,\\&quot; and I quote: \\&quot;Wow!  So the answer to a possible manufacturing defect is to cleaning the shaver once I&#x27;m done with half my face?  And what do you honestly think I have been doing all along?  Do you really believe I needed that kind of obvious advice - come on now, you must believe I was born yesterday and couldn&#x27;t possibly figure out that option on my own - no kidding?  Any way, it seems you are trying to gloss over a defect in these shavers, so I plan to return mine for a full refund.  You know? Before your cavalier response I was just going to accept the \\&quot;leak\\&quot; and bear it, but after your simplistic and who cares? \\&quot;workaround\\&quot;  to the problem, you have indeed opened my eyes to what I&#x27;d call the true Remington approach to a legitimate, annoying defect I&#x27;ve had the misfortune to stumble upon.  Many thanks for wasting my time in responding to your first communication - this shaver is absolutely going back for a FULL refund, even though I was planning to keep it, and based on your response it will likely be the last Remington I care to buy.  Wish your brand the very best wishes - rest assured you have just made me a Norelco customer.\\&quot;    Bottom line:  Retracted my original three stars to one, and strongly suggest DON&#x27;T BUY! this razor or any other Remington product for that matter. And Remington, rest assured I will make it my mission in life to let everyone know your company treats their customers as if they were idiots, let alone that you have a defective product line.</li>
    <li> I bought this device because I was tired of cutting myself on a daily basis.  Besides it cost less than a package of expensive blades.  You have to be patient and go slowly to get a close shave.  So far no cuts, no blood, no errors!</li>
    <li> Woks awesome. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Gives a great close shave and was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> The charge lasts a long time, and it is easy to clean, but it just doesn&#x27;t shave well.  I have extremely tough facial hair and it grows fast. I can dull a blade in two shaves.  Perhaps it works on other types of facial hair.</li>
    <li> Good shaver with a few minor issues.&lt;br /&gt;Big and somewhat clumsy for small hands but okay for most.  If one doesn&#x27;t clean the pop off cover which will fly into the sink all to easily, it blesses him with frequent doses of whisker powder.  Forget the detroit figures or in this case 60 minutes.  Figure on slightly more than half that and actually going into the red at maybe one third of that figure.  Still works in the red just fine.&lt;br /&gt;All in all its still well worth the money and I&#x27;d definitely do it again.</li>
    <li> I think we&#x27;ve finally found a razor that works for my husband.  We&#x27;ve tried every type of razor available for my 85 year old husband and nothing was working.  He said he would never use an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; razor but if it came down to having me shave him, I wasn&#x27;t going near him with my wobbly hands and razor blades.  He tried it!  He liked it!  Hooray!</li>
    <li> Great Shaver! closest shave of any shaver I have owned.</li>
    <li> Works just like we hoped!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. No complaints. Lived up to what I read about it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can not get a close shave with this.  It may not be an issue with the Remington... It might be that my perception of a close shave may be different from others.  I have used straight razors for the past 50 years so I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor since high school and I&#x27;m retired now.  Patches of stubble were left and it wasn&#x27;t smooth.  I did use a pre-shave powder stick.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband.  He returned it due to less than acceptable performance.</li>
    <li> Not the top of the line as a shaver, but it works for me .</li>
    <li> does not cut as close as I expected.</li>
    <li> After use. I have big problem. In midle head have cut metal. It cut my face all time when I used it.I have two order can I exchange anorther ?</li>
    <li> After reading countless reveiws on many models i decided to take a long shot and buy this one. I am a young middle eastern male who&#x27;s facial hair is noticeably thicker than the average person. That being said this machine does an outstanding job, I get a very clean, smooth shave, no stubble left behind or anything. CONS: there are minimal cons such as in order to get a clean shave you must pull your skin tight and go over the area 2-3 times, but you will get a close shave in reasonable time. Overall im very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend this to a freind</li>
    <li> I like the charge indicator.  Very noisy compared to the rotary I had been using and doesn&#x27;t shave as well.  Have used it now for 6 weeks and am going to take advantage of the Remington 60-day return policy and ship it back to them for a refund. :(</li>
    <li> I chose this shaver because it has a similar profile &amp; shape as my old Panasonic, only a little larger with a larger cutting head due to the double blade system. It still manages to be lighter than my old, smaller Panasonic as well. I was able to jump right in with very little learning curve. From other comments I&#x27;ve read, some people have had trouble using this shaver but I think changing from one way of shaving or from another type of shaver, may be the issue, not the product. The larger head covers more space making for a quicker shave &amp; of course the double blade system cuts that larger swath more smoothly as well. Be alert when choosing a shaver. Some do not allow use with the cord. I&#x27;ve never run any shaver down to needing the cord but it&#x27;s good to know it&#x27;s available &amp; another plus for this product.</li>
    <li> No razor burn with the Pivot and flex blades :-) I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the money, first time I have ever used an electric razor and I love it!</li>
    <li> not bad , nothing beats a blade for close shaves , no pulling like others&lt;br /&gt;I rate it 4 out of 5 stars</li>
    <li> Purchase 2 months ago. Liked it at first but already it&#x27;s so noisy andvibrating so much I have to stop using it. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Does not cut as close as advertised, but it is OK for a quick weekend shave. I use a blade for work days and special occasions. Still new, but seems to be a quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months. Please note that this takes twice or even thrice the amount of time that it takes to shave with the regular razor depending on how clean a shave you want. But believe me that you get a very clean shave which is as good as that you get from a regular razor shave if you spend enough time using this (Note: I know there are people who do SUPER clean shaves and this razor is not for them). I really don&#x27;t mind spending a long time shaving with this (it takes around of 5 to 8 minutes for me) because I hate shaving with the regular razor. The hair on the neck around adam&#x27;s apple area doesn&#x27;t go off easily with this (my four stars rating is because of this). You have to run the razor multiple times in a circular motion around that area to get rid of all the hair in that area. Remember to keep your skin taut as against loose as otherwise you might hurt yourself a bit (I have never hurt myself but I read from reviews here that people get hurt). That said, if you get hurt then it&#x27;s going to be only lightly (like a sharp pinch) as the razor switches off automatically if it pulls the skin. If you are someone who is not looking for a perfect shave but at the same time hates razor shaving then this one is the right one for you.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced an older Remington whose trimmer quit working.  The newer one has a couple of modifications that make it a nicer product such as the green light showing battery condition.  Both did a credible job of removing whiskers.  The battery has plenty of reserve and I have been running it on red just to see how long it will go.  A good product!</li>
    <li> My husband got this razor and is well pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve shaved with razors for most of my life, barring a post-apocalyptic scenario wherein electricity is in short supply and we discover a dehumidified depot of endless pits of mint razor blades and Gillette cartridges, it&#x27;s a practice I&#x27;ll be glad to be rid of, not least because it is time-consuming, tedious, reliably blood-letting, ultimately more expensive than buying this product, much too wet and messy, and requiring too many other objects that themselves require even more time to differentiate from each other, try and use until they run out even if you don&#x27;t like them, and then write reviews for that get buried under everyone else&#x27;s reviews.    Nah. And what&#x27;s with the 3-prong electric razors? Who goes in circles unless they&#x27;re shaving their head?    This thing works. The motor is powerful. Cuts as close as you&#x27;re willing to go, and takes less than a minute to get a good shave. Moisturizer then I&#x27;m good to go. The pop up trimmer is useful.</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first 2 years, now the retractable mini clipper on the back has stopped moving completely. Main part works great though, just requires the occasional emptying</li>
    <li> Met expectations.  Long lasting charge.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad and it works great.  It does not have an annoyingly loud hum nor do you feel with one wrong move you may scrape your cheek.  It is easy to clean and very reasonably priced.  You can also use it to trim the back of your neck between haircust.</li>
    <li> Works ok but the head is so big that it&#x27;s hard to get into smaller places on my face. I spend a lot of time mashing my face to try to get the stubble up against the shaver. Holds a charge pretty well so it doesn&#x27;t need to be recharged too often.</li>
    <li> The foil part works decent enough for the price paid.  I&#x27;d buy this razor again if the beard trimmer didn&#x27;t break.  I use the trimmer maybe 2 or 3 times a month (catching stray hairs on my neck).  Started using razor in Jan and trimmer broke in April.  So I got about 15 uses out of the trimmer and now I have to find another solution to catch the stray hairs on my neck since the foils don&#x27;t always get my neck hairs.</li>
    <li> You should add a few more stars for this razor, it is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many types and brands over the years. I can&#x27;t stand the pain using a rotory. About 10 years go I started using a Braun which was the best I had found. I looked at this one, the Head looked like my Braun, but he two things  it has that Braun needs is the angle in the shape of the body and a decent sideburn trimmer. I decided to try one, and  it shaves every bit as well as my Braun, is easier for me with the angle in the body, and is almost $200.00 cheaper. The Braun does come with auto head cleaner and charger which I do miss.&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t pull the head off to clean it, so I just hand it to my wife and she can do it easily.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a fault in the razor, the problem is that I am 87 years old and severely  handicapped and only have the use of 3 fingers on my right hand., it is a great razor.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m female. Have been wanting a good rechargeable shaver that actually shaves my legs smooth. Found it! This little dude shaved my legs a lot smoother than the Ladies Shavers I have worn out. I found it on a one day sale and decided to buy it. It isn&#x27;t dainty. I expected that. It can&#x27;t be used in the shower or tub. That has never appealed to me, anyway.  And, I find I don&#x27;t have the 5 hour stubble like with other shavers. It does exactly what I want, so am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> gift for a disabled veteran who requested this brand</li>
    <li> Shaves smoothly with little irritation. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit heavier &amp; larger than I would consider ideal.</li>
    <li> Shaves great./  Holds a charge forever and great feel in the hand.  Excellent product replaced my Norelco.</li>
    <li> Works well. Would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Remington Model 5800 Foil Shaver, here on Amazon.com. As I have come to expect, I received my purchase in a very timely manner and in as advertised condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using my new shaver now for about a week. I researched many shavers as my previous shaver a 3 head rotary shaver was on its last leg. I have used this type of shaver now for the past 25+ years and wanted to try something a bit different in the Foil Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington Model 5800 is everything it was advertised to be, I get a close shave, not as close as a blade, but still a good shave. My new shaver is very easy to clean, much easier than my rotary shavers and I like the battery charge light indicator letting me know how much charge I have left. I also really enjoy the floating head of the foil blades that follows comfortably the contours of my face, a bonus is the pop up trimmer for mustaches and side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver and its features, you can get cheaper shavers, but you get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> A better shave than I get with some more expensive electric razors.  Fits my hand well to not slip while shaving.  Small charger with works quickly.</li>
    <li> fine inexpensive shaver</li>
    <li> I had this for 2 months now and used it right out of the box(fully charged). It&#x27;s still at 80% and I haven&#x27;t charged it. Easy to clean as well. As far as shaving, it is easier to use than my Norco although it doesn&#x27;t get tighter. It is also significantly louder than any brand I&#x27;ve used before. Though if you don&#x27;t mind the noise and just use it for a quick shave you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Happy with the razor, although only a safety razor gets a real shave. Shave looks good but not the feel of safety razor. However tired of nicks now and then!!</li>
    <li> This razor is for my husband, who is in skilled nursing, so I shave him; what a FABULOUS JOB IT DOES. We are both very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love this..why did I wait so long? I have a fairly heavy beard, and this works just fine, and with no nicks and cuts from cheap blades any more.</li>
    <li> Gets short and long hairs!  Much better than rotary equivalents.</li>
    <li> Shaves very close, to close!  Be careful it took a gouge of skin out of my face.  The center support bar moves up and down slower then the two shaving heads, make sure that you keep it level with the part of your face you are shaving.</li>
    <li> This was a truly pleasant surprise.  I&#x27;d been using a Braun 1775 that I&#x27;d had for quite a while.  It was my first electric razor, received as a gift, but I forgot to pack it for a recent month long business trip.  I needed a quick replacement, so - after looking at reviews here - gave the Remington a shot. I didn&#x27;t expect it to surpass the Braun in almost every way, but it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important, it gave me a closer shave, faster  and with less skin irritation.  I had replaced the blades on the Braun fairly recently, so it wasn&#x27;t that the old razor was dull, the Remington simply did a better, easier job. Hard to ask more from a moderately priced shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it seems everyone&#x27;s face and whiskers are different, so your milage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one area where I still prefer the Braun is the pop up beard trimmer.  The Remington&#x27;s trimmer comes out at a 90 degree angle from the body of the razor, and I find that a bit trickier to use with the same accuracy as the Braun&#x27;s trimmer, which pops up past the foil, and works best at the same angle as the foil head itself.  But I may adjust to the Remington with time.  The trimmer is also smaller, with a narrower width.  Again, for the moment I miss the Braun in that area, but that could change with use.  It certainly hasn&#x27;t made me go back to the Braun now that I&#x27;m home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington also charges very quickly, and the ability to clean it with water is a nice plus, as is the easy to read gauge showing how much battery power is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are better shavers out there, but I suspect you&#x27;d have to spend a lot more.</li>
    <li> As good as a razor as the more expensive ones, has all the features one needs.</li>
    <li> This is the third shaver that I purchased for my father this year and the only one he&#x27;s liked and it is half the price as the last one which was Norelco top of the line.  He is 94 years old which is why I&#x27;m purchasing for him on Amazon and it&#x27;s difficult for him to use properly or clean, but this shaver works well and is easy for him to use.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. However, the precision trimmer doesn&#x27;t quite meet expectations. It has a tough time cutting but it could just be my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Works great and a great price !</li>
    <li> Not fair to review just yet, the other reviews of this product is what sold me. He&#x27;s only used it once, seems to work well, excellent shipping speed. Very satisfied with service</li>
    <li> Brought razor for my husband he loves it!! Fast shipping and works well!!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this model before and was very happy with it so he ordered another one.</li>
    <li> This has been working fine.  The battery lasts forever.  The little center blade catches longer hairs and takes care of business.</li>
    <li> Really good value for money, didn&#x27;t think I would manage to shave every day. This is definitely one of the best purchase I have done in years!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!! He never uses a razor because he breaks out bad and I hate getting poked by the little hairs from just trimming. This is perfect! Doesn&#x27;t cause him to break out and doesn&#x27;t tug. It gets around the chin line and his neck very close which he likes. He actually said the words, &amp;#34; it makes my face beautiful&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It knocks the stubble down, but if you are wanting a close shave it&#x27;s not going to happen.  I think the only way for a close shave is to use a blade.</li>
    <li> This was my husband favorite razor.  Great size to handle.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and at a good price</li>
    <li> Great shaver surprisingly.i recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> After 50 years of shaving with blades, I decided to try an electric razor thinking that I may save time shaving. Reviews seemed pretty good for this razor. Although I do not believe I have sensitive skin, it left my face a little raw after I used it, more so than blades normally do. It took as least as long as a blade, and I kept going over my face because it didn&#x27;t shave close enough for me. I have to qualify this review a bit by repeating that I don&#x27;t have any experience with other electric razors, so can&#x27;t compare it to others. Maybe I&#x27;m spoiled by using blades. Gave it to my son, and going back to blades...</li>
    <li> Have been loving this product so far. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver and one of the best I ever used, As of now I&#x27;m hook to use this product as long I need one .</li>
    <li> Nice shaver, works great</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Better shave than my older remington. Haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to open the screen to brush the blades.  Otherwise works well, even the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband and he is not very happy with the closeness of the shave.  He has decided to use his old one.</li>
    <li> Just started using, but does a good job.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave real comfortable in your hand . I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> grandson loves it!!!  Christmas gift and works excellent!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, it was great. Works great.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaces an older Remington DA-307 that was losing it&#x27;s battery storage capacity. This shaver is larger than the one it replaces but does a good job. I like the swivel head and that it can go for many days between charges. I also like the LED &amp;#34;fuel level&amp;#34; gauge that gives you an idea of how much charge is left.</li>
    <li> Nice razor for the price</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of electric shavers and i can easily say after several weeks of use that this Remington is the best i have ever tried.After trying expensive ones from Braun and Panasonic I say hands down this Remington model is the much better value of all three.  It has a nice weight to it and feels comfortable in my hand . It&#x27;s very quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Subject shaver meets all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Bought this so I could shave after neck surgery. Not a bad shave and easy to clean for someone who can&#x27;t move their head.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Remington Microscreen 3 that had a battery that was starting to go (down to four days between charges), and needed new screens and blades.  Since I could not find one of those, I decided to try this.  In general I would both recommend it and buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Very close shave, closer than the MS3.  The &amp;#34;Interceptor&amp;#34; technology has prevented my having to use the trimmer on the long hairs that always seemed to pop up - in fact, they no longer get long enough to be noticeable - this is a very big plus that overcomes my &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34;.  Good charge retention, so far, and the charge indicator is nice&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Bigger than the MS 3, so more awkward when traveling.  The trimmer is at a very awkward angle to use on touching up my beard and mustache, so I put the razor down and get out the beard trimmer (not a daily event, so not so bad).  There is less &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; on where the shaving action happens compared with the MS3, so I for the occasional hair starting to pop up near my mustache I have to resort to the beard trimmer&#x27;s shaving head - or risk shrinking the size for mustache and beard.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean. The battery seems last quit long for each charge. Just, its a bit bulky but for the price, its a good deal.</li>
    <li> One of the cheaper electric razors I have ever purchased, but I would not know it by the performance.  This gives a very close shave, charges quickly, is easy to clean, and has a nice pop up trimmer.  I would recomend this to anyone looking for a qualtiy shaver.</li>
    <li> I am a senior with a light beard. I bought this shaver because of the long life battery figuring I would not have to bring a charger with me on trips. After a recent three week trip, I still had 40% of the battery life left with shaving everyday. And the shave is better than my previous and more expensive Panasonic shaver. And for $40, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> bought for my son, everything good so far</li>
    <li> My husband was satisfied with this razor, works good so far.</li>
    <li> very impressed with this shaver especially for the price</li>
    <li> I had a Remington and when the battery died I switched to Braun. I never felt like the Braun did as well so when the battery died I switched back to Remington. Next time I&#x27;m going to figure out how to change the battery.</li>
    <li> Long battery life and works good.</li>
    <li> First off I have to say I was able to purchase this from Amazon for $29.99, which informs heavily on the value score.  A long-time owner of two consecutive Braun 8k/9k systems, here is what you get.  There are no quality nor perk frills here, this is about as spartan as it gets- no stands, no little bag, no cleaning system.  The Remington is lightweight and not well balanced.  Despite largely plastic construction, it looks less assuming or intrusive in the bathroom than the Braun in its mountain stand or any Panasonic with their loud colors and chrome; however, those others come with stands and the Remington could really use a stand.  This unit is loud, which is not an auditory concern so much a reflection of overall quality.  Like so many other shavers nowadays, this one features incredibly bright and annoying dancing LED lights, because the power status of your shaver is definitely something you need shoved down your throat when you visit the bathroom at 3 a.m.    Shaving performance is good, I have pretty easy demands; heartier or more complex hairs may demand more.  My travel Panasonic does substantially better primarily because it has a faster motor, but this does the job as well as my Braun ever did and I do not feel I need to save more time on my shave.  The foils are wider than I am used to, makes it hard but not impossible to negotiate the soul patch.  The pushbutton power button took some getting used to and I have accidentally shut it off a couple of times; it feels like something that could break eventually.    Overall, the unit feels fragile, I would hesitate to use this as a travel razor without some substantial protection added.    The verdict?  Probably did not sound that great above, but at thirty bucks this is a steal.  Fact is, a large number of people are dissatisfied with their razors costing 5-7x this one.  If this unit failed in one year, I probably got my money&#x27;s worth.  I did not buy a razor to be quiet or to come up with clever ways to clean it.  This one simply does its job as asked.</li>
    <li> This shaver did well on my neck but it seemed to irritate my face after shaving.  You have to really press down on your face for it to shave the hairs off.  Meh.</li>
    <li> excellent razor. Every 3 days is all I have to use it.</li>
    <li> I had put off getting a new one for 30 years, but my old &amp;#34;cord powered&amp;#34; Remington (bought at an estate sale and already 15 years old) began having issues with getting screens and cutters. Now I feel silly for waiting this long to get something new, this shaver is as good as my old one that ran on 110 volts!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It beats Braun, and my other Remington. I purchased this one as a gift for my 18 year old son. He thinks it&#x27;s great too! It shaves very close, it&#x27;s comfortable, and it almost quiet. (It&#x27;s probably the quietest electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned) My only complaint is that when you pop out the trimmer it sticks out at a 90 degree angle, making it somewhat difficult to trim long whiskers in certain areas under the chin, but I consider that a livable inconvenience compared to the performance and quiet that you get with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, instantly comfortable.  Great value when priced at $29.</li>
    <li> Got this for a gift and he&#x27;s really please with it. Nice quality and stays charged a long time.  Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a real good shaver im a barber an even with the thickest hair its removes it completely smooth</li>
    <li> We just received this item in the mail.  The first time I ordered it (as a Christmas gift for my husband) the wrong item was sent. We instead received a hair clipper.  I contacted the seller via Amazon and without incident I was given a shipping label at no cost with which to send the wrong item back.  At the same time I reordered this razor.  We received it in about a week and my husband tried it immediately.  It came very nicely packaged in a box with the charging cord and full instructions and warranty information.  Also, it was fully charged (nice touch).  I even used it on his sideburn area myself along with under his chin.  It works great.  In fact, we think it works better than any of the other razors he&#x27;s had over the years from Norelco to Remington, to Braun.  It&#x27;s great that his quest for the best razor seems to be over at last.  It cuts close without irritation especially on his problem area: the chin and under his chin and jaw line.  On top of that the price was really inexpensive.  It definitely isn&#x27;t true that the more you spend the better in this case.  I had first seen a very similar Remington razor in the Sharper Image catalog and decided to see if Amazon (which I&#x27;m addicted to) had a better price which they did--about 20 bucks cheaper.  I decided to give this almost identical one a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I&#x27;m happy and more importantly, he&#x27;s happy.  The head pivots back and forth along the face making it easy to get where you want it to go.  It comes with a cleaning brush and very specific instructions on how to clean and maintain the razor which comes apart for very thorough cleaning.  And you can and should hold the head of it under running water which is really nice.  He says it feels good in his hand and is just the right size and weight (he had a more cumbersome Norelco before this one).  Overall it&#x27;s been a very positive experience both buying/replacing and using this razor.  Also, you can order replacement foils.  It has that info in thebooklet it came with. In the future I would definitely buy this again and the seller was great.  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Husband says it works really good. no pain and is better than a wet shave</li>
    <li> Works good and has nice power!</li>
    <li> GREAT I shave everyday and it holds a charge for 2 weeks not as smooth as a blade but still a good shave LOVE it</li>
    <li> I have been using only electric shavers to trim my facial hair for more than the last 60 years. I probably have used at least one of every available brand, but the Remington shavers have been my favorites. This new F5-5800 model is the best yet. It easily accommodates my particular desires for how an electric shaver should perform. I am really impressed with this machine. After all the inadvertent surgeries my sweet face has endured during my life&#x27;s morning shaves, it is a profound pleasure every morning to fire up this tool as the best performer I have ever known. Congratulations, Remington, you have allowed me now to enjoy what used to be my &amp;#34;daily displeasure hour.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This WAS a great shaver the 1st 6 months but I took the top of to clean it out as I normally do and for some reason this time the top wouldn&#x27;t go back on. I had to go to the trouble of contacting Remington and mailing the shavor back to them. It has been almost 10 days and I am STILL waiting for my New replacement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Norelco,Braun series 3 and an $80.00 Panasonic and this Remington shaves just as good if not better than these more expensive shavers. For the $30.00 I paid for this shaver I could not be happier with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> the speed of the cutting blade is slow,so is uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. It holds a charge forever, it&#x27;s quiet, and shaves really close.</li>
    <li> not as close a shave as advertised by okay for the price</li>
    <li> great.  cheap.  dont buy disposable razors, they get thrown into landfills, hard to recycle the metal and plastic together.  save money.</li>
    <li> My husband hates shaving. Complains about it all the time. Two Christmases ago I bought him a new razor because he asked for one, but he never really liked the shave it gave him--wasn&#x27;t close enough and gave him a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Christmas, as a surprise for my hubby, I scouted all of the razors on Amazon that I could find with a 4-star and higher rating. Many were very expensive, and as I only needed a stocking stuffer at that point, I looked for something cheaper. This had the best reviews, and when my husband tried it, he found out they were right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He raved and raved about this razor, saying how smooth it glided over his skin and how it didn&#x27;t irritate it. It cuts very close, as my grateful cheeks and hands can tell you, and his shaves last longer. He also commented on how much faster it is to shave with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would most definitely purchase again and recommend to friends. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This shaver recharges very quickly, the run time is very satisfactory in that it uses up very little of the battery&#x27;s charge, it does not shave as close as previous Remington shavers I have owned, I feel the foil guard is a little thicker than in previous shavers, I do not use the trimmer, but I like the way it is stored in the shaver&#x27;s body, it is handy and out of the way at the same time.  My personal rating of Three Stars reflects the smoothness of the shave, it requires repeated coverage of a shaved area to &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; obtain a nice smooth result, which is the only disappointment I have in this model of Remington shavers.  If I am going out to a more formal event I use an old Model 5MF1, non-rechargeable, shaver, I have had this shaver for more than Twenty years and it still works, heavy and cumbersome, but shave close like a blade. So if you&#x27;re wanting a score, between 1 (low) and 10 (high) I would  rate the F5-5800 about a 8.5 or 9.  A closer/smoother shave on the first go around would bring it up to a solid 10, in my estimation.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever tried, better that Braun! Happy with the purchase!!</li>
    <li> Works great and gives a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Hi folks, for all the first time shavers, do read the instruction manual, it must be used in a specific way against the skin for effective and painless experience. Over all i loved this shaver, its well built, good on battery and easy to clean. go for it...</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> not good for any close shaves. returned for replacement.</li>
    <li> This razor was a very good value for its purchase price.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my grandson and he said it gives him a great shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because it has a battery use indicator.  Although that feature worked well, the rest of the shaver is not good.  It is noisy.  It does not give a good shave, especially in the mustache area.  You cannot clean the inside of the shaver.  Running it under water, as instructed, does not clean out all of the hair.  The shaver head is quite big, making the shaver awkward to hold.  I do not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> It does feel much cheaper and flimsier than my old remington, but it shaves fantastically!</li>
    <li> I have used Remington razors for many years.  While product performance has been exceptional, recent renderings have had durability problems.  The F5 provides an excellent shave but requires significantly more time than other recent models  I have used to achieve the desired result.  However, that does not detract from the final result--the product does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington for years that I loved. I finally had to replace it after it being dropped one too many times. This one is not even close to the quality of the old one.&lt;br /&gt;It would be ok (barely) if the trimmer part on the back didn&#x27;t keep popping open. There is literally nothing holding in down. I wrapped mine with tape to make it useable. I will not be getting another Remington after this.</li>
    <li> Works great, my husband really likes it</li>
    <li> It kind of just tugs and pulls without really cutting the hairs sometimes. The trimmer is pretty good though</li>
    <li> excellent money to quality and performance value.</li>
    <li> the blades stayed sharp for a while, but not as long as I feel they should have, but it gets worse. I bought replacement blades and block and they were very noisey. The replacement blades were dull within a few weeks. The replacement blades were a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers for years and this is the best one yet.  This model shaves close, a charge lasts well over a week and it&#x27;s very quiet.  It&#x27;s a bit larger than previous models I&#x27;ve used, but not really an issue.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Cunbersome, too heavy, poorly designed, especially when compared to its predessessor razor. There is almost nothing positive I can say about it. I am returning it and have asked for my money back. How can I get a new predessessor razor, even two? The older razor, also a Remington, is number MS2-390.</li>
    <li> This razor exceeded my expectations.  I have used an electric shaver for most of my adult life and I have a very tough beard which has gotten even tougher as it turned grey.  Up until 10 years ago I had used Remingtons but became displeased with the closeness of the shave and switched to Panasonic.  When it needed replacement the one I bought gave a very poor shave.  After reading reviews on a number of razors I decided to try the F5-5800.  I&#x27;ve had it a week and gotten better shaves than from the Panasonics, Braun, and Remingtons that preceded it.  I&#x27;ve had a problem with hair on my neck not being cut and growing long.  Not so with this razor.  I even find my beard feels shorter the next morning when I shave again.  The only thing I have noticed is that the razor is physically larger than many others and feels a bit bulky in my hand.  But for shaves this close with no irritation I can easily get used to that.  I&#x27;ve had trimmers on other razors that flip up from the back so that didn&#x27;t bother me like it did some other commenters.</li>
    <li> A great little shaver. Very pleased with the product and delivery by the people of amazon</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my grandson. He is very satisfied with my choice.</li>
    <li> My husband is really happy with this Shaver and it was cheaper online than in the store!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best recharegeable shavers I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve had Remingtons since 1964.  However, as good as it is, it doesn&#x27;t shave any better than the basic Microscreen 2 shaver I&#x27;ve had in both cord and rechargeable versions over the years.  I got this as a gift from my kids and didn&#x27;t want to tell them I didn&#x27;t need it, but like all rechargeables, it will die out and it will have to be thrown out or I spend $40 for batteries.  The all cord Remington Microscreen is still available on Amazon, the DA-57.  It will never die out, or will you have to wait hours for it to charge.  For me, as decent a shaver as the rechargeable is, I&#x27;m finding I prefer an electric shaver (no batteries) that is always able to run, quiet, and will never leave you without a shave.  If Remington made this shaver in cord only version, it would be a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Does as good job on my whiskers.  Head rinses clean with little effort, but you have to let it dry out before reassembly.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as well as my Norelco rotary.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and has an exceptionally long run-time between charges</li>
    <li> I originally gave this razor a poor review but found that it was operator error (stupidity) that was the problem. Thanks to good customer service at Remington the problem is resolved.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave and quiet too. Recharges quickly. A little difficult to remove the head for cleaning, but a minor problem.</li>
    <li> Worked great for well over a month then when it ran out of charge i went to plug it in and charge it and nothing happened.  Took me awhile to realize i was mistakenly using my old Philips Norelco charging cord from my last shaver (which looks exactly the same and fits the charge plug ...) - fyi - user error ...</li>
    <li> HUBBY USES THIS SHAVER EVERYDAY</li>
    <li> My husband said it worked fine, gave a good close shave.</li>
    <li> This battery-powered razor is faster than any I&#x27;ve used. It recharges quickly and can be used while plugged into the &amp;#34;wall wart&amp;#34; charger. It is wonderful. However, a set of replacement cutters is half the cost of the razor. It&#x27;s kind of like buying ink for your printer!</li>
    <li> Disappointed relative to the reviews. Does not give a close shave. Does not hold a charge well. Also where I grasp it to shave is where the on/off button resides. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I never used an electric before. It took me a while to get the hang of it. A nuisance to have to clean it every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jorge Potter</li>
    <li> Bought this when I needed new foil and blades for my Panasonic shaver of similar design.  This shaver was less than the cost of the replacement parts and has the  battery meter to show how much charge is left.</li>
    <li> I got this for my legs, as a I get older the silky smooth legs isn&#x27;t a priority!  But I get a good shave on my legs, it even catches those longer ones.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to a friend</li>
    <li> Great product. Long life on a charge, easy to clean and a close shave. The trimmer works great at trimming my goatee.</li>
    <li> I have had this model for the last few years. It does the best job having of any I Have ever had.</li>
    <li> I have use a electric razor for 60 years and they all have been the micro screen type.  The best thing I like about this one is it quiet to use.  I also like the LED bar that let you know the charge of the battery.  I have not obtain as close of shave as I have with my older Remington, but that may be me.</li>
    <li> My husband used the shaver &amp; he really likes it. Said it shave really close &amp; smoothly!!!</li>
    <li> 10/10 would use again... too bad its a one time use.</li>
    <li> The Remington gives me a close shave without irritating my skin.I also like the lights on it that let me know when to recharge it.</li>
    <li> Have only used it twice so far. Came to me fully charged but the included manual states to charge it for 24 hrs before the first use. Decent price and decent shave to this point. No travel case included.</li>
    <li> Outstanding electric &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; razor. The shave is fairly close and it is easy to manuever. In fact, I have another electric razor that I purchased for 3 times the price and it does not match this Remington. When you are in a hurry and need a quick shave without the cream and blade, this razor is quite effective!</li>
    <li> Great shave. Easy to hold. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. The old models do not cut longer hair. This F5-5800 has an extra cutter in the middle that cuts off longer hair.</li>
    <li> It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
    <li> First of all I will tell you that I am a manly man with a manly beard and I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for a long time so I know what makes for a good electric razor. This Remington model is a good razor. I&#x27;ve had it for a week and used it a few times with very good results. I actually let my beard grow out while I waited for the delivery so I would have a little bit of a challenge for the gadget. No problem. The clippers worked fine on the first pass and the shaver finished the job quickly and without any friction. The pivoting head is fine once you get used to it. The noise level is average (meaning you should shut the door while you&#x27;re shaving). The ability to rinse the cutting heads off is a nice but marginal feature.  On the down side, the build is cheap and it&#x27;s larger than the Remingtons and Brauns I&#x27;ve owned so it will take up more space than usual in my travel bag. The size issue is peculiar since the power converter is actually on the line cord. I would have expected a smaller body.  Anyway, I&#x27;m giving it a positive review for now. It worked very well right out of the box and it came at a good price ($41). I also bought a replacement screen and cutter kit for $19. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up.  Aug 19, 2016 update:  I&#x27;m still liking this razor. I&#x27;ve also grown fond of the rinse feature and I&#x27;m still using the original blades!</li>
    <li> Worst shaver I have ever owned. I wish I had returned this razor. Very loud and doesn&#x27;t cut close. Junk</li>
    <li> The company suggests that it shaves closer than a Braun razor.  I have used Braun razors, and I find that to be quite a stretch.  It does shave close, but it takes me twice as long than Braun, Panasonic, or Wahl razors I have used.  I do feel, based on its composition, that it may last longer than other models I have used, but I can only really recommend it on two levels.  First, it charges incredibly fast.  Second, it really does seem solidly constructed.</li>
    <li> Always liked Remington shavers, and have had a bunch, but this one is amazing.  The shave is not only very fast but very close, and it seems to hold a charge for a looooong time.  Should&#x27;ve bought one a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Received this shaver as a gift from our Son and I would give it 10 stars if I could. Absolutely the best shaver ever. With a couple passes it shaves as close as a blade. I can shave in 2 min. and holds a charge for a looog time. Easy to clean, just perfect all round shaver. I even shave my neck with it. Undoubtedly the best shaver. Would recommend it to everyone. ********** (10 Stars ) :-) Extremely Happy !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver for a few weeks, and not daily, but so far I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s large but comfortable in the hand. It&#x27;s powerful and evidently has a hefty battery, because it doesn&#x27;t require recharging every five or six uses.  My first few shaves produced minor razor burn and weren&#x27;t as close as those from a different-brand shaver. Perhaps because of my getting used to using this Remington, along with the shaver itself becoming broken in, my shaves are now close enough and without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the two blades hold up well and can eventually be replaced for less than the price of a new shaver, I will be even more pleased. In the meantime, I&#x27;m comfortable recommending the Remington F5-5800; it delivers excellent value money.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the excellent price versus comparable models and the amount of positive reviews given. After giving this razor two months, I must write a negative review.  Out of the box, the razor had a bad tendency to pull the hair before cutting it, making for a very difficult and painful shave.  I also have had difficulty getting a clean shave that lasts until the end of an eight hour day.  I know each person&#x27;s skin is going to be different and results may be subjective, but compared to older razors that I have, this one fails to meet the mark for me.  Power supply has been excellent, and cleanup has been relatively easy.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver to replace a very old Braun single foil shaver.  I was pleasantly surprised what a nice, smooth shave it gave. Being able to wash it out with water is a real plus. I didn&#x27;t have that with the old one. So far I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor is a good razor but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it should. Comparing it with previous razors my husband has had it doesn&#x27;t compare&lt;br /&gt;compare very well with the closeness. The trimmer does an excellent job and is easy to clean. Would recommend but would let the person know it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it could.</li>
    <li> Very close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had more than a few electric razor&#x27;s in my day and they all seemed to just eat my face off but this one has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Its taking me a little while to get use to the new shaver after having used a older model Remington single foil shaver.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> my husband likes it!!!</li>
    <li> Working great so far....lasts a long time on a charge.  Great shave.  The pop up mustache trimmer is OK, but as expected a bit clunky due to it being on the side of the unit.  I use a separate unit most times for trimming the &#x27;stache. It would be great if we could come back and rate stuff after a long term....I think that would be more helpful for shoppers.</li>
    <li> Used it three times then stopped working.  Used twice right after it arrived, then put away for several months (grew a beard).  Pulled it out 5 months later, charged it, used it once more.  Now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Doesn&#x27;t show battery charge level, won&#x27;t turn on ...nothing.  It should have worked more than 3 times.  Obviously don&#x27;t recommend, must be a battery issue.</li>
    <li> Good Razor.  It has performed well so far.  My previous Remington razor gave me 10 years of good service.  Hopefully this razor will do the same.</li>
    <li> Does the work perfectly.</li>
    <li> This shaver is so much better than those round three-head shavers. I cuts very close and does not bite.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift, and he loves it. It came pre-charged, and the initial charge lasted from Dec. 25th to like mid-February. He likes that it&#x27;s light weight and gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Phillips Norelco Arcitec shaver for several years and thought the shave was OK, but I always needed to shave again before I went out in the evening.  Phillips recommends replacing the heads every year, at a cost of approximately $60. I read  rave reviews of the Remington F5-5800 shaver on the Amazon web site and decided to give it a try at about $30.  Good decision.  this shaver shaves much closer and much quicker than the Arcitec at half the price of the Arcitec head alone.  I paid well over $100 for the Arcitec shaver several years ago.  I have been using the Remington for over a month and highly recommend it. As with any electric shaver, it takes about a week for your face to adjust to the Remington and realize the closest shaves.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my ailing Panasonic razor but my budget was slim. I&#x27;ve owned nothing but pricey Braun and Panasonic razors for over 20 years so buying a Remington for under 40 bucks was kind of scary but the reviews were good so I rolled the dice. Here are my impressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the largest razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, quite a bit bulkier than my others, and it definitemly has the largest shaving head. I am not very hairy and I have a small angular face so I don&#x27;t need a giant head. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker but it can make it a little difficult to get around my nostrils for those reclusive mustache hairs. It will also take up a lot more space in my travel kit. I like the fact that it can be used corded or cordless, although the quick charging option makes the need for corded use pretty slim. The motor is slower than what I&#x27;m used to. Faster motors are considered to generally be gentler on sensitive skin, which is definitely an issue for me. I have noticed that unless I use a very light touch I get pretty nasty razor burn on my neck. After some practice I&#x27;ve managed to get a perfectly comfortable shave. Thankfully, it has done the best job of any of my razors of getting the rogue hairs on my neck and under my jaw. I&#x27;m pretty shocked actually. Even with the light pressure I have to use I get a baby smooth shave. Well met, Remington. Well met. My other shavers have all had the long hair catcher between the foils like the F5 does but it seems to work the best. The sideburns trimmer is on par with any others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think that this razor is a fantastic value, offering a shave on par with far more expensive competitors, as long as you&#x27;re light handed with it to not compromise your skin comfort.</li>
    <li> Gave as gifts. Recipients respond that they are very happy with the closeness and quality of shaves provided</li>
    <li> Switched for Norelco, this is the closest shave I ever had.</li>
    <li> This is a nice close shave.  I love the center blades that catch the longer hairs that curl over.</li>
    <li> My husband said it works well</li>
    <li> This shaver did not shave as close as I wanted it to.  Immediately after it looked like I had not shaved at all.  I took it on a little trip and ended up having to shave every 2 hours to at least make it look like I tried.  A Lady-Bic disposable 2 bladed razor did a better job.</li>
    <li> pleased with purchase - Good product.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a month now. Works well and gives a smooth shave. I have not had a problem with irritation.</li>
    <li> For my personal shaving needs, I tend to prefer a trimmer rather than a rotary blade (or whatever the terminology is for this). But the last trimmer I owned--a Wahl model--lasted less than a year. The rechargeable battery gave out, so that it would run only about 15 seconds, and plugging it in won&#x27;t bypass the battery so it&#x27;s not usable, and to replace the battery I&#x27;d have to mail it in and pay more than I spent on the shaver initially. This shaver was, for me, a slight compromise, because it has only a small trimmer blade and mainly serves as the close shaver with the rotary blade. That said, the battery stays charged so long that I rarely need to plug it in, and if the battery did wear out, I&#x27;ll still be able to use it by plugging it in. The little trimmer blade works okay. The head and blades are amazingly easy to keep clean by rinsing. And, indeed, the rotary blades give a closer shave, handy on the rare occasions where a perfect shave is necessary to go with a rented tuxedo.</li>
    <li> I have used Remingtons for many years great success. My last one wore out and I got this model. A great choice. It is much more quiet than any Remington I&#x27;ve had before. We know what a problem those neck hairs are. This model has a cutting edge between the two foils that takes care of these difficult to cut hairs with ease. I highly recommend this Remington model.</li>
    <li> Excellent product  Does a great job of shaving</li>
    <li> Works well! Cuts my shaving time down to less than a minute, from about 15 minutes back when I used a straight edge.</li>
    <li> Quick, timely delivery!  Well packaged.  This model does not give as smooth and comfortable shave as older Remingtons.  It is a TWO head unit with an annoying cutter bar in the middle.  The older THREE head shavers are the best ever made.  However, they have been priced higher than imaginable.  This two head unit is both a price and a technological compromise.  It does charge fast, and the charge lasts longer.</li>
    <li> tHE RAZOR IS LOUDER(TO MUCH VIBERATION) THAN EXPECTED &amp;WHILE IT CUTS PRETTY CLOSE, i NOTICE SOME PULL ON WHISKERS INSTEAD OF A CLEAN CUT. ALSO, A CLEANING BRUSH CAME WITH IT BUT i FOUND NO WAY TO CLEAN INTERNALLY. I ran water over the head but never saw any hair al the time I used it, about five weeks. So I am back to using my norelco .</li>
    <li> Love it. It cuts really close, like a blade. I&#x27;m a barber and I use it at work. Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of electric razors and this one is the bomb - especially for the price. The pivoting head works well and it gets those areas of my neck that used to be such a pain to get with my other razors. The charge lasts long too. The one minor negative is that it is pretty big.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better at nearly the same price. Doesn&#x27;t do &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; very well, misses a lot of hairs, and randomly dumps hairs collected in the foil all over the place (and I clean after every shave).  If I were still in the return period, I would be sending this one back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Now it&#x27;s so easy every morning to shave, thanks!!</li>
    <li> With three days of growth I hade to use a trimmer first to get a close shave. It was good that it arrived fully charged and ready to use. The shaver isn&#x27;t easy to put on the charging base. In order to get a close shave I recommend using Electric shave. I will continue to use this shaver for one year and will replace it with another shaver after that.</li>
    <li> I have this product for 4-5 months now. Bought this at a price of 30$ and I totally love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly for shaving (dry) 2-3 times a week. Easy to maneuver on face, doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair, leaves a very smooth looking face without need for any shaving foam etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once charged, it can give you almost 5-6 shaves easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with the product till date.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a 10 year old Remington foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros--&lt;br /&gt;Much quieter than the old shaver ever was&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge a good long time&lt;br /&gt;Interceptor between the foils is very effective at cutting longer hairs.  Nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Shaver head with pivot feature is very bulky and hard to get used to.  Would prefer no pivot and smaller shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is OK at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a five star shaver in my opinion if the shaver head was not so bulky and unwieldy. Perhaps being built to a price point caused this compromise.  In any event, the shaver is a good value.</li>
    <li> I love the shaver, but I can&#x27;t seem to get the head off to clean it. Is there a trick to it? Otherwise it works great.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;My facial growth is almost but not quite that I can shave every other day. Usually shave every day, but if I skip a day, other shavers tended to miss hairs and patches left and right, and I&#x27;d have to use the trimmer a lot. Wasn&#x27;t so much the shavers, more what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interceptor middle blades are SO so much better than having to use the trimmer to get all the missed hairs when growth is longer. Or when changing / removing a mustache or beard or sideburns or whatever. I&#x27;d looked for ages for something like this. However it may not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say, as a recommendation, depends too much on what works for you, for any individual. This setup just happened to work great for what I needed. No great insight, different people feel comfortable with different types and models. Just really happy at finally finding a type that works well for me after years of searching and trying different shavers.</li>
    <li> Great item. My husbands old one finally broke after years of use so I made sure to buy him the exact same one he loves.</li>
    <li> This is by FAR the coolest, most comfortable, long lasting razor I&#x27;ve ever had! Excellent closeness, doesn&#x27;t cause &amp;#34;razor bumps&amp;#34;, and the flex head is awesome for the chin area. It washes easy and travels light. Kudos!!</li>
    <li> Very good buy that reach all the expectations</li>
    <li> Love the razor hate the cost of blades replacement</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a Remington MS390 that continues to do a very good job. I really like the F5-5800 that feels well built and fairly quiet for an electric razor. The MS390 is much louder. My facial hair is medium course and the shaver works great after 2 days growth. I dry shave without conditioners or cream and the shave results are smooth and without any facial irritation. Used only 4 times, I can&#x27;t comment on reliability but if it can last as long as the MS390 (3 years and still going) I will be more than satisfied with this under $40 shaver.</li>
    <li> Best electric I&#x27;ve owned. Been using electric razors for 40 years. Had top of the line Norelco, Low end Remmington and mid level Braun. None came close to this razor. It&#x27;s quiet, very little vibration and gives a great shave fast. One great feature is that there is a hair trimmer in between the two blades allowing you to use the razor for longer hair such as on the back of the neck between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use the trimmer first. No hassle buying experience.</li>
    <li> Read many of the posted reviews before making a decision.  I prefer a foil shaver.  Having had a Braun previously I checked their models out first.  Whoa Nellie, the prices!!!  No shaver should cost that much.  Then read the reviews that they are now made in China and I tabled the Braun.  Noticed the Remington 5800 at $54 so I read the reviews.  4.5 stars and great reviews by owners.  Regardless of what others find objectionable regarding size and build quality,  I found this to be an outstanding value and outstanding shave.  Yes, it&#x27;s larger than most razers and yes, it is plastic.  So what?  I found it comfortable in my hand and ergonomically well shaped.  So it&#x27;s plastic.  It&#x27;s a shaver not a hunting rifle.  Just don&#x27;t dribble it like a basketball and all will be fine.  It gives me a very close shave without having to press hard against my skin and it handles the upper lip and chin better than most.  I love the placement of the trimmer on the back of the razer as it allows me to get it in and around my ear to get rid of nasty ear hair.  I have a soft beard and sensitive skin following radiation treatments and this Remington gets them all and leaves my skin unscathed.  I&#x27;ve always used a moisturizer after shaving anyway.  Money well spent on this and if it gives me 2 or 3 years of service I got my money&#x27;s worth.  I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver; holds a charge for 3 weeks before another charge is needed and it is used 7 days every week.</li>
    <li> My last Remington worked for many years and would no longer hold a charge.  I&#x27;d bought a Braun (an expensive one) and it just didn&#x27;t shave as close, so I kept using the old Remington plugged in.  I finally got this one and have been very pleased.  Shaves very close, is easy to use and clean, andthe charge works for nearly 2 weeks of shaves.  I&#x27;ve had it a couple months, as I&#x27;ve waited to write the review until I was sure I liked it.  I know a shaver is an important and personal tool, and I can truly recommend this one.  The trimmer on the back isn&#x27;t as easy to use as my old Remington 5200, but it works well.  Only complaint is I have small hands and this shaver is a bit bulkier in the hand than the old one.  I&#x27;m hoping it works for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Razor gave me a shave as close as a razor blade. It took a few shaves to understand how to use it.</li>
    <li> This razor&#x27;s great. It holds a charge very well and has a long runtime. Close shave as well.</li>
    <li> If you have a heavy beard, this product isn&#x27;t for you.  Leaves you looking like you have a five o&#x27;clock shadow  A bit pricey for the performance.</li>
    <li> I have developed wet shaving as a hobby.  I really enjoy the different razors, soaps, brushes, and sundries. Wet shaving take rehearsed skill and is highly rewarding.  But like any hobby it takes time, and I don&#x27;t always have a lot of time. Being hasty with a straight razor will leave a gash.  This saver was purchased for those days went I am in a hurry and still need to look respectable.  I owned a Norelco rotary some years ago, and gave it away because it chewed up my face pretty badly. I was very nervous to try another electric shaver but had read that the foil is easier on your skin than the rotary.  Did a little research and when with this one.  It arrived a few days ago and I&#x27;ve used it twice.  I really like it so far.  It has not eaten my face up so that is a big plus!  It feels solid in my hand and the motor seems quite powerful. It is easy to clean. The razor head snaps on and off without difficulty (but attaches securely).  You can rinse it under the faucet and air dry or pat with a clean cloth. The quick charge feature will come in handy for those times I have not charged it but have to hurry.  Of course, it does not give a perfect baby-butt-smooth (bbs) shave, that is not its purpose, electrics provide convenience.  If you really want a perfect smooth shave then don&#x27;t look to electrics.  The expectation is simply not realistic, regardless of brand or model.  If you are trying to get really close shave from an electric you might try a rotary instead.  However, if you&#x27;ve tried a rotary and it ripped your face up, give this a try instead.  I give this shaver my hardy recommendation and yes I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> feels powerful, holds a charge well, but not a very good shave. doesnt get close, and really weak between neck and chin. my old Norelco is much better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been many years since I used an electric razor, so when I bought the Remington F5-5800 I read everything I could about it. I made the right choice for me, as it is excellent. I use it every day when I don&#x27;t shower. It&#x27;s not as good as a blade, but comes close.</li>
    <li> i dont know why i didnt try this shaver before. i was using one norelco rotary shaver for about 7 years and sometimes i didnt have enough time to shave so my beard hair could be too long and it was a pain with the norelco in this case. But with this one and the &amp;#34;Interceptor&amp;#34; now i feel like nothing is going through my face it doesnt hurt and it shaves much closer than the norelco rotary shaver i have</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the shave. It does a good job for being a quick close shave. The trimmer attachment is decent. Doesn&#x27;t really cut effectively, maybe because I have fairly thick hair, but I got the shave to shave not to trim so this product is a good buy.</li>
    <li> works OK.  regret that there seems to be no way for the owner to replace the shaving head blades which will get dull with usage.  How this is done and who do I have to pay , I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> After a dozen emails with Remington, the problem with the head is not resolved.  At one point they suggested I bring it to their office...no offer to pay for airfare, rental car and hotel to get there.  What a terrible company.</li>
    <li> The shaver shaves quickly in a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;The battery are long lasting for a couple of weeks after recharging the shaver.</li>
    <li> Shave is not as clean as some of other electric shavers i have used.</li>
    <li> The Remington F5-5800 was an excellent deal and I initially feared at the expense of quality.  Not the case.  It is am excellent razor that provides a very close shave.</li>
    <li> not a perfect, close shave, but good for a basic shave</li>
    <li> Works as well as much more expensive electric razors I purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> So far the best shaver I have ever purchased!  Can&#x27;t believe how long the charge last.  Wish I bought and extra one when it was on sale.</li>
    <li> works better than the Arc 3 I&#x27;ve been using. I get a much better shave but I do use the Remington powder shaving stick and used it with the Panasonic Arc 3. This definitely shaves better than the Panasonic I was using.</li>
    <li> I like it! It&#x27;s a lot better than the one I was using. :)</li>
    <li> Yes, yes, yes, I would rate and recommend this products to others. It is a very good day in Florida today.</li>
    <li> as usual - exceeds expectations</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in 50 years. The only one that sails thru 2 day old stubble with ease.</li>
    <li> holdsd a charge and get more shaves</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Replaced a 10-year old Norelco foil that just wasn&#x27;t geting the job done.  This thing cuts extremely smoothly and even had no trouble with 4-day growth!  Shaves are now extremely fast, comfortable and very close.  Shaves about as close as a razor.  Love the charge lights.  I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> An improvement over my last similar Remington Foil razor which lasted me 6 years.  Good product.</li>
    <li> So many shavers talk up that they are close as a blade. What I need is something that is as good as a blade a trimming longer hairs (I don&#x27;t even care as much if it&#x27;s as close) which this &amp;#34;interceptor&amp;#34; feature does. (In comparison, the Norelco/Philips rotary shaver was almost useless if I didn&#x27;t shave daily or more, especially once the blades got more than a few weeks old.)</li>
    <li> My husband who&#x27;s  in his 60&#x27;s pretty much gave up years ago trying to find a good electric razor for the amount of money he was willing to spend.&lt;br /&gt;He has a couple of different brands taking up space in the drawer because he doesn&#x27;t find that either one of them give him a close enough shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I presented him with the Remington F5-5800A Interceptor he was less than thrilled because he thought all electric razors were just about the same.  That was until he used it.  He likes the razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he likes about the razor:&lt;br /&gt;1. The shape and width of the handle feel ergonomically correct.&lt;br /&gt;2. The wide shaving head.  The shaving stage (3 stage) appears wider to him than any of his razors of the past,  and they work well.&lt;br /&gt;3. It keeps it&#x27;s charge longer than his other two razors.  So far he has never run out of batteries.  It keeps an outstanding charge.  The LED light display showing remaining battery power  is very slow to creep down.  He really likes this feature.&lt;br /&gt;4.  What he likes the most about the razor is that it works well on his neck,  unlike the rest of the razors he&#x27;s used where he&#x27;s had to finish his neck up with a blade.  When they say that it adjusts to your neck and jaw line, ..it really does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he doesn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing that he doesn&#x27;t like about the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Remington F5-5800A Rechargeable Foil Electric Razor  with Interceptor gives the closest shave by far  than any electric razor that he&#x27;s ever used.  He&#x27;s a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a recent comparison of 3 electrics -- this Remington foil shaver, another foil by Panasonic, and a rotary by Norelco, with my criteria being closeness, speed and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this one wins hands down and I highly recommend it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - all 3 about equal, no real differences there&lt;br /&gt;Speed - the foils are more efficient than the rotaries - both this and the Panasonic - covers more ground quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness - Remington was by far the best, nice close shave without a lot of back and forth at all different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, even the Remington does not quite match up to a razor / shaving cream for closeness, but if you prefer an electric for convenience, this is now my preferred one.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a blade shave and takes a while to get an acceptable shave</li>
    <li> Nice shaver with great feathers, but shave not quite as close as old replacement Remington shaver.</li>
    <li> Shaves almost as close as a razor. Easy to hold but a little heavy. Like the light indicators for battery consumption. Recharges quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best electric razor you can get, but you get what you pay for. There definitely are some hair left after shaving, but not so much that it bothers me. I use the razor multiple times a week (about 3-4) and I have yet to charge it. I have had it for seven months.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This product has given me no problems easy to use &amp; clean will tell all men to give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have used shavers from Norelco shavers for years and they are my personal preference, but those shavers costs anywhere from $150 to over $300 dollars.  In fact recently I bought a replacement blades and that cost about what this shaver cost so in that regard, this is not a bad shaver at all.  It doesn&#x27;t cut as quickly or as close as my other shaver but for a fraction of the cost, you can&#x27;t really compare them.  I personally would spend more for a closer shave, but that&#x27;s a decision that is reserved for each individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things about this specific unit that I liked, noticed, or didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ LED power gauge - always good to know how soon you need to recharge&lt;br /&gt;+ Rinse foil under watre - great cleanup option, as long as it holds up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Size - this shaver is significantly larger in my hands than many Norelcos and Panasonics I have&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Smooth Pivoting head - the head pivots easily during my tests with the shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Feels cheap - some of the matrerials used (specifically the piece holding the shaver foil in place) feels cheap and since there isn&#x27;t anything else but molded-in tabs that holds that piece onto the shaver, I don&#x27;t have confidence that this will last. If you shave and take the cover off every day to clean the shaver the little tabs will wear out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;- Pop-out trimmer is at a weird angle - the trimmer sticks out at 90° to the shaver body.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is solidly in place when you use it unlike other I have that are closer to 120° so when you use it, it holds it firmly in the open position.</li>
    <li> cheaper than the blades</li>
    <li> I hated electric razers until i used this. No irritation, long battery, easy to clean. But the trimmer is absolute garbage. It folds out and wont stay out.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old Norelco but it does OK. I have only used it 4 or 5 times so I will add to this review later. OK I have used it for several months now and it does not give a good shave. My old Norelco with worn blades shaves closer. Wished I had sent this back but I own it now. I have to use Lectric Shave or it just won&#x27;t shave at all.  Now I have had the razor for a while, it still isn&#x27;t that great. I get a much better shave with my old Norelco and will probably buy another Norelco and give this Remington to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver!  The battery life on this unit is excellent, and it gives a reasonably close shave for an electric shaver.  I especially like using this shaver when camping so that I don&#x27;t have to mess around with shaving cream and a razor.  My face doesn&#x27;t like being shaved often with a razor blade, so I use this in between razor shaves.  If you are patient and have your face completely dry, you can achieve a very close shave with this with no hair-pulling or razor burn.  For my usage, it does not require very frequent recharging.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced an older Remington that final;y broke. It is an EXCELLENT foil shaver and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a foil shaver. It can be rinsed under the faucet and it holds the charge considerably longer than the previous model that I owned. It is the best shaver that I own.</li>
    <li> I hate this razor.  I have only used Norelco products for many years, so I thought I would give this razor a try.  Big mistake.  This razor has a center head which has squared edges.  Those squared edges hurt a lot as they grab the skin..  Also, this razor&#x27;s motor makes a very annoying sound compared to Norelco products.  I waited too long to try the Remington razor.  Big mistake.  Don&#x27;t buy this Remington razor.</li>
    <li> Works very well, even with 3-4 days growth.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve owned in many years.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver for the price. I&#x27;ve used Braun products for years and this shaver matches the performance. I am 65 and have a very thick beard. No pinching, pulling, and a very close shave for less than the cost of the replacement parts for the Braun. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The CEO used to state &amp;#34;As close as a straight edge razor or your money back.&amp;#34;  I had bought a Remington many years ago, but wasn&#x27;t happy so I returned to the Norelco brand.  Well the last few years any Norelco I bought was krap.  Many of the models are well over $100.  Rediculous.  This Remington is just what the owner used to say.  I&#x27;m VERY happy with this razor.  It truly cuts close and doesn&#x27;t pull my whiskers out.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because as others have stated is it is loud compared to other brands, but you know I can live with that for a good razor that is well priced.  I strongly suggest this razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver has given  me the closest shave of any previous one that I have used. It has a cutter between the foils  that removes any stray long hairs that other shavers miss. The  battery charge indicator is convenient. All in all, a well designed and made product.</li>
    <li> This is the first Remington razor i have ever used.  My experiences have always been with the triple-head Norelco.  I will make some comparisons here, since if I were thinking about trying a the Remington, i’d probably want to know how it worked compared to my own razor.  It is definitely a different experience, however not altogether a bad one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver fits comfortably in my hand, which is probably a bit bigger than normal.  Everything about the design seems proper and efficient; the weight distribution, the angles, the charging mechanisms, etc.  But there are differences with the business end of it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor came with a full charge, and the easy-to-see LEDs light up indicating how much charge remains.  It never moved off full, so I cannot evaluate the battery life.  Cleaning is easy; just remove the cover around the cutters and blow or rinse it out.  No issue there.  I did not rinse the shaver to clean it, i just blew it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds different than the Norelco, probably a bit noisier, but not offensive.  It sounds more like barber’s cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually go 3-5 days between shaves.  I rarely shave everyday, so there is always a bit of stubble for the razor to handle.  A couple times during this review period i went longer, sometimes shorter.  I never shave every day, consistently, so I am reviewing the razor on how it behaved in my normal mode of operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 5 day shave, the first thing i noticed was that the Remington shaver has more &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; to it; that is, I experience some discomfort as I&#x27;m shaving with it.  The Norelco has no noticeable pulling after 5 days.  This is not a big deal for me, but it might be for some.  I shaved half my face with each machine.  The Norelco did a quicker job, with less discomfort.  I had to go over the areas with the Remington 2-3 times before it felt smooth.  It always seemed to me that the Remington screen system and it’s basically rectangular shaving contact area would be a better choice for areas like the neck.  But after using it, this does not seem to be the case.  The Norelco did a better and faster job all over, and just seemed to cut better than the Remington.  This was especially the case when i went a full week between shaves.  The Remington seemed to have problems handling the longer beard, and i had to retrace several times to get a smooth shave.  The Norelco, (with cutters over a year old, I just realized) handled the beard much better in my judgement.  The mistake I used to make was to push harder the longer the beard was, but i have since learned they all seem to cut better with very little pressure.  Even so, the Remington just didn’t cut as well; the Norelco cuts down my long beard very quickly, and leaves very little need for a second go-around.  It took noticeably longer to shave the 7-day beard with the Remington.  However, the overall result was still a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor handled a short, daily shave much better.  The times i shaved several days in a row, there was little or no difference between the machines.  It shaved very close, and did so on the first time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, if shaving time is not a concern for you, and you are not bothered by a noticeable “pull” on the long beard, or if you if you use the shaver like my father does—twice a day—you will probably have no issues with the Remington.ar shaving contact area would be a better choice for areas like the neck.  But after using it, this does not seem to be the case.  The Norelco did a better and faster job all over, and just seemed to cut better than the Remington.  This was especially the case when i went a full week between shaves.  The Remington seemed to have problems handling the longer beard, and i had to retrace several times to get a smooth shave.

    <li> I bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day and he absolutely loves it.  no problems thus far.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job, as good as my last one which was probably 3x more expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quiet and easy to clean. It cuts well but takes a bit more time to give you a clean shave</li>
    <li> It worked well while it worked. I&#x27;ve had it 1 year and 5 days exactly and it stopped charging. Uggh</li>
    <li> This foil replaced my Norelco rotary.&lt;br /&gt;The closeness and time of shave are about the same, but I just like the feel of a foil razor.</li>
    <li> Well this is a little hard to review, because I am a wet D/E shaver. And I love to shave with my D/E razors. My first electric razor was a Remington corded in 1957. There I gave away my age. I am 74. I am stumbling along thinking where to start.I am using a Razor Rock Stealth Slant for my #1 razor. I use many razors known &amp; and unknown. Anyway what I will tell you now some people may think I am not very smart. I got the razor as advertised &amp; reviewed. What caught my eye was the fact that you could wash it with water from the faucet. They also say that you should not shave with this razor in the shower. That is because you can use this razor plugged into a electrical outlet. Here is the problem for Remington. They don&#x27;t want to electrocute yourself. I am not telling you to use it the way that I do. I&#x27;m just telling you how I use this razor.  I used this razor with a pre-shave lubricant when I got it. I was not impressed. @ this point I was going to send it back. I thought about it for a few days before I was going to send it back. Water washable head. That let me try it not plugged in to the wall. Plus This thing has a great battery. I prepared my face like I was going to shave with my D/E razor. I showered, CAME OUT OF THE SHOWER. Then I churned up some Proraso you could about use any soap Dove for one. Just in your hands with out a brush. The 5800 is not super aggressive so you almost have to use a clean up pass. I shave more in an up &amp; down motion all over my face. After that I wet my face a little &amp; re lather not to much. Now I use the circular motion like the rotary razors. My God this makes this machine my special shave day tool. I still use my D/E razors I still love them. Just to let you know I have used Philips, Panasonic, Shick electric, Ronson,Braun, Eltron &amp; probably 3 more that most people don&#x27;t know of. I have used Titanium, the Remington Diamond cutters &amp; screens. I know that Remington has Titanium cutters that fit the 5800 system. I didn&#x27;t like the reviews on those. But I may try them. I may think out of the box, but all I can say is that if this tool is used correctly it will reward you. Between my Razor Rock Stealth &amp; the 5800, I can shave to any level of BBS.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading advice somewhere to buy a men&#x27;s electric shaver instead of a women&#x27;s electric shaver because of the quality.  I wanted to trade in my Venus Divine razor because buying refill cartridges for it is so expensive, and because it sounded like it would be a lot more fun then shaving in the shower.  Well, I was wrong.  I&#x27;m still buying refill cartridges for my Venus divine. The Remington doesn&#x27;t make my legs feel smooth at all.  I tried a friends Braun Series 5 on one of my legs,  and that was so much smoother and closer of a shave.  I don&#x27;t know if shaving your face with it is good or not. But for legs 👎This is garbo ladies.  Save your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Have only had this shaver for a week, but I love it. I have used a rotary shaver for the last 35 years, but will not go back after using this foil shaver. It really does provide a better shave. Glad I made the switch and bought the Remington F5-5800!</li>
    <li> Ever since a traffic accident left me rather gun-shy about using razor blades on my face, I&#x27;ve been an electric shaver user.  I still have my old Norelco (the thing is almost 40 years old!) and would probably still be using that but they don&#x27;t make replacement heads for it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I transitioned to the foil shavers and found them to be mediocre, but useful enough to keep the undergrowth trimmed back until the gardeners could come in once a week and do a proper job (AKA using a razor only once a week instead of every day).  And for a couple of decades, this was my usual routine.  The foil shavers never lasted more than a year or two before the foil heads wore through and often times, finding replacement heads was impossible.  I have a drawer of perfectly good, if worn, foil shavers hoping one day I&#x27;ll be able to find a screen or cutter for them.  And because of their lack of longevity, I&#x27;ve rarely spent very much on them (which, admittedly, might have something to do with why they&#x27;re not lasting very long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my last foil shaver wore through (always an exciting feeling to have one&#x27;s skin abraded away in an instant and foofing the cat&#x27;s tail by suddenly howling in pain), and I couldn&#x27;t find any replacement screens or cutters for it, I was getting annoyed and decided to go a bit higher end.  Most of the shavers I got before were in the 15-20 dollar range. I figured I&#x27;d go about double and see if there was something worthy of abrading my face in the (hopefully more distant than usual) future.  (Note: I got this under Amazon Prime at the time at a lower price than it&#x27;s listed now and would likely not have spent the money to get it at the price showing for it as of January 27, 2015)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I&#x27;ve found it to be a pretty good shaver.  It has most of the cutting power of a razor without the drawbacks of a conventional foil shaver.  Most foil shavers I&#x27;ve used leave a few hairs uncut which, after a few days, get too long to ever cut with a foil head.  That&#x27;s why I occasionally used a blade - to get the last hairs standing.  But this shaver has a little lawn trimmer built into the head between the foils that trims down these standers to a level where the foil head can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means, for a foil head, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Blades will get closer, but not by a lot.  And I haven&#x27;t had to USE a blade since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for allowing me to put away the twin blades of death, this little (or not so little) shaver has earned my respect as a credible, front-line, handle-it-all shaver on par with my trusty Norelco.  My only concern is its longevity, which might take a star off if it isn&#x27;t at least as durable as the cheaper models.  The cost/benefit ratio of buying another one of these, and buying more razors will factor into whether or not I get replacement heads for it (something I checked to see if they had before buying) or go back to something cheaper and buy cheap razors for the standing hairs again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my five star rating is on the assumption that the foils will last at least as long as they do in the cheaper models (and hopefully longer!) because otherwise it gives an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually gush over my five star ratings, and I&#x27;d be doing it over this, but I don&#x27;t know about longevity.  The current price would make me hesitate about getting another one if the foil doesn&#x27;t last substantially longer than the less expensive ones and/or if the price of head replacements has gone up as well.  I&#x27;m always cost-conscious (I&#x27;m a cheap SOB), so value to me means excellent performance for the value.  The performance IS excellent.  The value remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if the price comes down to about double the legal drinking age, get it if you need one.  At that price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.t with a foil head.  That&#x27;s why I occasionally used a blade - to get the last hairs standing.

    <li> Much better and cheaper than my Norelco 3d  could buy 3 shavers for the replacement cost of the Norelco heads.</li>
    <li> By far the best electric razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave and no hair in the sink!</li>
    <li> I think I will purchase Remington now over Norelco. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Agree 100% with previous review by hgfase and would add that the \\&quot;long hair trimmer\\&quot;, between the two shaving heads, works much better than the Panasonic this Remington replaced...at 1/2 the price!&lt;br /&gt;Followng up on initial comments: One design deficiency worth mentioning, discovered subsequent to travel, is that the on-off switch does not incorporate a locking mechanism. The switch apparently was bumped while in my suitcase and the shaver had run out of power. Fortunately, the quick charge feature came to the rescue and I (hopefully) solved the problem by finding a properly sized tupperware container for future travel use. Still LOVE this shaver and just ordered another one as a gift for my grandson.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, the women&#x27;s electric razors have always been fragile and fail after a short time of use.  Took someone else suggestion to buy a man&#x27;s electric razor due to their durability and longer lasting charge.  So far so good, my wife likes my substitute and the results it gives.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver..Purchased on Black Friday so got a very good deal. It is heavier then my last razor. but does do a good job shaving.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item as a gift. I would recommend it to others as well.  Liked the fast service as well</li>
    <li> This is my second favorite shaver. I had a Braun which lasted for years but finally just gave up; either the battery or the motor. After reading reviews of the newest Braun I decided to try the Remington instead and I am very please so far. I it last as long as my Braun it&#x27;ll have become my favorite shaver.</li>
    <li> After doing an extensive research, I decided to buy this Remington. I work in the hospitality business and I must be clean shave everyday I work. This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m happy with it. It gives me a clean shave with no irritation. I have a goatee and this shaver does the work around it without damaging it.I found the machine a bit noisy but again, this is my first electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the product (I can still use the shaver while its charging) and it is easy to clean. Remember: you still have to have the classic blade available as backup or to shave any &#x27;corners&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father. I ended up returning it because he couldn&#x27;t use it.  He said it was not &#x27;user-friendly&#x27;.  I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t be more specific.  I didn&#x27;t have the heart to give it less than 4 stars, but cannot give it 5 simply because daddy was not a happy camper. ;)</li>
    <li> I had to go to an electric after surgery on my dominate hand. I have not liked them in the past because of the poor shave quality, skin irritation and noise. While this Remington is still noisy it&#x27;s not as bad as I remember. And the shave is really pretty good w/minimal skin burn.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with shaving performance.  The head guard is next to impossible to remove from the razor.  When it is removed one of the cutters pops off the razor.  This happens consistently.  Sorry I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good razor, no problems and holds a charge for a long time. I have tried others but always go back to Remington</li>
    <li> It works as advertised and gives a decent shave. I bought this to replace my old electric shaver that was having charging issues, and it does just as well if not better. Good value for price.</li>
    <li> Good razor, trouble at times though getting a clean shave</li>
    <li> The reciepient of the gift said that the shaver is very good and he is satisfied.  I have used a similar shaver for years and am completely satisfies with the shave.</li>
    <li> This was given to my son as a Christmas gift.  He said it worked very well and gave a close, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> My Husband needed a new razor and he loves this one.  He got a great shave!!  He used to complain about his old razor but now he is happy.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about the shave and the cost of the razor.  It is reasonable in price and the shave is amazing.  I would recommend this to anybody without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This Remington is as good as my old Norelco.  A little bit loud.  IF this one breaks,  I may go Braun.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my last Remington died. This one was less expensive than the one I had, but it works great and is much quiter. I had no idea it would be so quiet. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a 15 year old Remington that I was using. The battery life on this is great...lasts for weeks on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;Sure you can get a &amp;#34;closer&amp;#34; shave with razors, but this one works great for me.</li>
    <li> It does not shave as fast as my older Remington and somehow I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of small nicks on my face - apparently from the center part of the head.  It gets the job done and I guess that&#x27;s just what a razor should do.</li>
    <li> Seams to hold a charge for along time and shaves well!  Would by again!</li>
    <li> It works very well.  I have sensitive skin and it did a good job without leaving razor burn.  I did notice that it did not get super close in my neck area and I had to go over it many times.  One thing I did not realize is that this is not a wet/dry razor - this is not a drawback of this model as it was only designed as a dry razor - I just wish I had paid closer attention and gotten the wet/dry version.</li>
    <li> Shave is much closer than the razor it replaced.</li>
    <li> The razor works well, but does not shave as close as I expected.  However, I will continue to use it versus a non-electric shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent closest shave I have had in years after years of triple head shavers. I have a very sensitive neck and always had a burning sensation after shaving. First shave close and comfortable and no burning neck. Highly recommended, made my day!!</li>
    <li> I have very coarse facial hair. I&#x27;ve tried a few electric razors that would not shave all of my hair away(when i let it grow for a few days). This one while it takes a bit of time, clears it all away. I&#x27;d say for a full shave after a week of not shaving it&#x27;ll take 5-7 minutes to get it all. Great little razor. As others have said it is a bit loud, but it&#x27;s an electric razor, what do they expect? The sideburn trimmer is a bit scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product i would recommend.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older model when replacement heads did not fit correctly.  This is the best electric razor I have ever owned and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far the charging has remained good.  The head is larger than I thought it would be, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it takes less time to shave.  I&#x27;ve found out it takes longer because I can&#x27;t get as close to some spots as I did before</li>
    <li> Excellent, fast &amp; as described, i really like it...</li>
    <li> A very good electric shaver, particularly for those of us more prone to razor irritation. Needs to charge more frequently than other electric TRIMMERS I&#x27;ve had, though it&#x27;s not really a nuisance and probably a bit of a nitpick. Really depends on how thorough you plan on being with its use. Works well for a quick trim or a more detailed taper.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this razor from the day it arrived it gives you a close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Shaves great. Foil won&#x27;t last long as a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap price keeps me coming back for more.</li>
    <li> Good bang for the buck&lt;br /&gt;Charges quickly</li>
    <li> Have had this razor for a while now. It works ok for the price. I don&#x27;t like where the on and off switch is located, in the middle of the handle. It is easy to accidentally turn the razor off while shaving. Holds a charge very well. I replaced an older Remington with this one. The older model gave a better shave but this one is fairly decent.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor on the basis of customer reviews. It is very easy on the skin. I get no irritation with it. I do not get as close a shave as I do with a blade razor. I do like the fact that it will shave off longer hairs, as I skip shaving some days.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Remington F5-5800A Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology&amp;#34; is a more moderately priced dry shaver that many men may like. It charges fully in less than two hours; when the shaver is on and immediately after it is turned off, a digital indicator shows the percentage of charge remaining. The compact charger and shaver itself make the &amp;#34;Remington F5-5800A Rechargeable&amp;#34; very nice for traveling. It is quiet, but does weigh 8 oz.  The grip is not a non-slip, nor is it an ergonomic design; this shaver is not as well balanced as some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the real test for a shaver is its actual shaving ability. I based this portion of my review on my spouse&#x27;s evaluation. As a long-time user of Panasonic Wet and Dry shavers, his using the &amp;#34;Remington F5-5800A Rechargeable&amp;#34; should provide a good comparison with respect to this dry shaver&#x27;s actual shaving ability. This shaver was easy to maneuver over the Adam&#x27;s Apple area; the rectangular shape of the head made shaving the upper lip area easily. The trimmer worked well. The &amp;#34;Remington F5-5800A Rechargeable&amp;#34; did not irritate his skin.  This shaver did not closely; &amp;#34;beard growth&amp;#34; - and my tester does not have heavy facial hair - after 24 hours was equivalent to a 1 1/2 day growth.  This shaver and its shave were acceptable, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This portion of the review is based on my own experience; gentlemen, you may not want your significant other reading this portion of the review.  The &amp;#34;Remington F5-5800A Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology&amp;#34; does an outstanding job shaving a woman&#x27;s legs and underarms. It shaved cleanly and did not pull or irritate my skin. Further, there was no irritation when it was used on the underarm area. Had this been a lady&#x27;s shaver, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have only used an electric shaver a couple of times to any extent in my life. I was a little skeptical as to whether I could get a close enough shave to continue using instead of the triple blade razor I was using. I followed the recommendations in that I gave it about 3 weeks to allow skin to &amp;#34;adjust to the new shaving system&amp;#34;. Whether it was an adjustment in my skin or a break in of the razor, there was definitely a difference in the closeness and feel of the shave after the three week period. The shave now is so close to the 3-blade razor I was using as to be negligible. The razor is easy enough to clean, especially since it&#x27;s safe to clean under running water. Plugging in and charging overnight works perfectly for a full charge. I&#x27;m happy to be using the Remington Electric Razor instead of spending big bucks on blades!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Really close shave. Just barely less than a standard razor. Battery seems to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone looking for a solid electric razor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend who is African. He also has very sensitive skin when it comes to shaving so I bought this product based on the reviews of not causing bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this for him! Not only does he have the closest shave with this, but I can actually style his goatee with it. I love the precision of this shaver. I recommend using it in circles and against the way the hair grows. He only gets bumps if the shaver is pushed too hard against his skin, so be careful with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shaver keeps a great charge so you don&#x27;t need to worry about charging it each time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have used. Does not pull or bite. Able to get almost complete shave with this razor (disposable razor is best for neck).</li>
    <li> Beats Panasonic. I&#x27;ve been an electric shaver user for 60 years and the Remington is the best I&#x27;ve had for a long time.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Great power, I&#x27;m pretty sure I could sand my deck with it.  It has trimmer between the two screens, a unique setup that can handle a 3-day growth.  This is my second, the first one lasted a year before wearing a hole in its screen.  So the only possible downside is longevity, but at this price it&#x27;s a fair trade-off.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he said it was better than the previous three-headed shave he had used.</li>
    <li> Best Remington I have ever used and I have been using Remington&#x27;s for over 50 years.</li>
    <li> I use this razor for one thing only, and it works beautifully and that is back-of-the-neck trimming.  My barber recommended it.  Every 3 days does the trick, and as long as your hair doesn&#x27;t get too long, this Remington Foil electric is a great buy.  Highly recommended for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Cuts amazing, love the trimmer/shaver foil all in one. The trimmer is legit, battery lasts a long time about 2 weeks give or take and that is me using it everyday. I prefer shaving dry to conserve the shaver. All in all I am very impressed with this shaver and it is very affordable!</li>
    <li> It cuts well, but I would not rate it as a smooth operating shaver. I&#x27;d rate it the industrial approach to shaving as it&#x27;s definitely higher decibel &amp; you frequently feel the cutter &amp;#34;plucking&amp;#34; wiskers which may be unacceptable to some. It is a good value for the money, but definitely not a smooth shaver especially for the more sensitive face. It&#x27;s back to the NORELCO rotary blade / head for this guy!</li>
    <li> it works with a bunch of pass&#x27;s but it&#x27;s acceptable for my first electric razor</li>
    <li> I actually liked this shaver quite a bit, until the head assembly broke when I tried to remove it for cleaning. Had that not been the case, I would given this shaver a higher rating. Based on my experience, however, my recommendation would be to be extremely careful when you remove the head assembly because, at least in my case, it was fragile and broke very easily. I do plan to order another one in hopes that it won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as expected</li>
    <li> Much of life is on the uneventful side; but to balance out the chaos we have these extraordinary simple moments that are beautiful and fleeting, like shaving with a Remington F5-5800 or hitting the baseball to the gap and running like the wind or turning a double play – all memories that we can’t make stay fresh in our minds.  That’s why we have websites on which to review our razors – to remind us why a Remington F5- 5800 is such a blessed thing.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver from Remington. Well balanced to hold and quiet considering it seems very strong.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is also very good and glides well over the skin, with no feeling of being hard on your skin.</li>
    <li> Decided not to cheap out this time when it came to another electric shaver in my life. Wow! I really like this one. Battery life lasts a VERY long time and the battery life indicator it very helpful. Charging is extremely quick.&lt;br /&gt;Not a big fan of the flip out straight edge shaver on the back, I find myself using it sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver shaves great, no need to flipping over to the straight edge and then flipping back over to the main shaver like i would have to do with my old Black Friday bought all-in-one skinny shaver.</li>
    <li> Seems like every year I&#x27;m buying a new razor. Well I hope this one last me awhile, because I can never remember a razor I liked better. The middle blades get all those annoying long hairs that seem to get missed. Smooth shave, good battery, Great product</li>
    <li> its ok , not the shave I thought it would be. went back to my old Norelco 3 head .</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  His face feels like he shaved with a razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he raves about it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver!  He was always jealous of my electric shaver, so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.  It is like no other shaver that either of us have used or seen.  It gives a really close shave and doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty rough stubble.  The pivoting head makes it comfortable and easier to use.  The wet dry feature is great.  I love the way that you can rinse it after every use to maintain a clean shaver.  The recharge feature is super convenient and makes it completely portable.  Perfect for travel.  The only small negative is that there is no stand.  You just lay it down and plug it in with the cord.  That just makes it easy to knock around and hard to keep out of the way.  Other than that, it is a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> My old electric razor was worn out and this Remington was listed in consumer reports so I ordered it. It is the best electric razor  that I have ever had. My son was visiting over Christmas complaining that he could not find a decent electric razor. He tried mine and said it was great so I bought one for him. I have a 101 year old friend who mentioned he needed a new electric razor so I ordered him one and he said it was great.</li>
    <li> Quiet motor, smooth shave, takes a little longer than my old Remington but I guess it is newer technology. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My 92 yr old Father is very happy this this shaver &amp; its hard to please him most of the time.</li>
    <li> Rough shave, always irritates my skin.  Going back to the old Norelco.  I wish I could return this, but my 30 days has passed.  I cannot recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son and he said it works great.</li>
    <li> Incredible for keeping that close shave on he head</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  It is his only tool for shaving.  He said the trim bar is awkward to use.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a reasonable cost.It gives a fine shave,almost as for as a regular razor.</li>
    <li> As a woman who has superfluous facial hair, this is absolutely the best electric shaver on the market.  Remington was always the best, now this is the best of the best.  Dust with a little talcum powder before shaving and the results cannot be beat.  Smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> Remington is the first shaver I am using. I had always used blade, Gillette,  to shave by face, but shaver is a new world!. It&#x27;s super easy and the quality of the product is really good. The only difference between shaver and blade is that I must shave my beard everyday; blade kept my beard under skin for couple of days!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Purchase for my father and he looks great. The item arrived on time in good condition.</li>
    <li> Received it a week ago.  I wanted an electric shaver to use during this summer&#x27;s water rationing.  It&#x27;s doing a decent job so far.  It&#x27;s the newer version of the only sub $100 shaver Consumer Reports liked in its last round of testing.  I have a heavy beard.  I can get an acceptable shave in 3 or 4 minutes and a close to shaving against the grain with a blade shave in a couple of more minutes.  I&#x27;ve been using slightly diluted rubbing alcohol as a pre-shave.  Looked at the ingredients in the ones at the store and found that they were alcohol with scents.  I hate the scents.  The alcohol evaporates.  One caveat.  Remington apparently decided that, in order to pluck the masculinity string, the shaver had to be big.  It&#x27;s not so big that it&#x27;s hard to control but it&#x27;s clearly larger than it needs to be. There are smaller tasers.  Think of it as a shaver with tail fins.</li>
    <li> I love when my husband uses this! It is faster, so he takes a lot less time in the bathroom. That means more bathroom time for me. If we are running late he can take it with us in the car.&lt;br /&gt;It works well. He took a few days to get used to using it but now it is great! I love it!</li>
    <li> has a good feel in the hand and gives a perfect smooth shafe.  Money wise it is as good if not better than the more expensive&lt;br /&gt;Brauns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few electric shavers over the years, as well as spending a number of years using a blade.  This is perhaps the worst electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  Before this I had a Norelco rotary shaver.  I got rid of it because the heads wore out too quickly, and if you didn&#x27;t shave for a couple of days you&#x27;d have a heck of a time getting it to work at all.  I&#x27;d had a Remington shaver a number of years ago, this shaver had great reviews, and thought I&#x27;d give them another try.  Big mistake.  It does cut the hairs when they&#x27;re slightly longer than normal, but that&#x27;s just about the only think it does well.  It seems to be physically impossible to get anything approaching a close shave with this shaver.  I know you aren&#x27;t going to get as close as a blade with any electric, but this won&#x27;t get you much closer than the five o&#x27;clock shadow stage.  It won&#x27;t allow you to get the hairs under your nose without a great deal of maneuvering, and if you press the head down at all around your lips you end up cutting yourself.  While delivering the worse shave of any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, it also manages to be more irritating to my face than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, and takes longer to use than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  I know that it can take a while to get used to a new shaver, since they all work slightly differently, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and it still doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> My husband says: It is taking some time to learn to get a close shave. The angle or blades is different than my old one. I have a little harder time shaving my upper lip for some reason than my older one. Not that bad...would buy it again but can&#x27;t quite give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I would definetly not purchase this razor again. It gets the job done but takes longer than I would like</li>
    <li> It would be an understatement for me to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by this razor. I consider it to be one of the best personal purchases I have made in my lifetime of 70+ years. It is solidly built and easy to use, with the flexible shaving head, that moves when you shave the different areas of your face and neck, so the resulting shave is closer.&lt;br /&gt;  I have one incredibly tough beard, so I need to shave twice a day -  in the morning when I get up, and again in the very late afternoon.&lt;br /&gt; I am in no way embellishing my remarks by saying that the Remington F5-5800A shaves as closely and as cleanly as my standard Gillette razor does, using the Gillette &amp;#34;Mach 2&amp;#34; blades  with shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt; It is  no very nice to be able to get a good close shave without all the soap and water, and then all the rinsing and some kind of after shave lotion to soothe the skin of your face after a close shave, and sometimes the Neosporin, if you &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; yourself. Just to push the button and it goes on!!! The handle of the razor also neatly fits into the palm of your hand. And last, but not least, after you initially charge the razor, the first time from an electrical outlet, it recharges very quickly, and only after every 3-4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt; Another important factor, from my point of view , is that it is so easy to clean every day after you do shave. The top of the razor lifts off very easily, and you just blow off the beard particles. Likewise the lower part of the razor where the cutting blades are - you just blow that clean too. So everyday cleaning just takes literally just a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt; I am one frugal person at my age with a reduced fixed income. If you are interested in buying this razor, get it through an Amazon purchase. Do not buy it through a retailer, including Walmart. The price for this razor, at Walmart, was $90!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I have taken some time writing this rating, because I am so pleased with it. I have a feeling you will be too!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Best wishes to all. Philip, Northfield, NH.e too!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Best wishes to all. Philip, Northfield, NH.</li>
    <li> Instructions say replace cutters every 6 months, which is an awful lot.&lt;br /&gt;Also doesn&#x27;t shave very close. Okay for the money, I guess.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver just before Christmas 2013 as my old 2 screen shaver died.  What makes the shaver the best yet, is the unique horizontal blade that is nested between the two screens, to clip of any whiskers that are too long.  This approach eliminates the stray long hairs that can slip through when shaving one&#x27;s neck, or cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver keeps a charge for almost 2 weeks, and recharges very quickly. And it is very easy to clean the head with soap and water...just follow the included directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this shaver comes with a power supply which is rated 110-240v, 50/60Hz, 200mA, so it is very travelable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great shaver</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few shavers to find that this one is what works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is excellent, it lasts me 5 shaves at least without charging.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very smooth/pain free (my face is rather uneven so shaving is always a painful battle).&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on the back is excellent for getting at your hair/beard once it has grown too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, stop searching and settle with this!</li>
    <li> Product is fine, exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Overall very satisfying. Trimmer is OK, a separate one, slightly bigger, does come handy. I do have one, by Remington, on battery. The routine cleaning, after each shave, under the running faucet is not perfect. Using the little brush, each time, may not be the best idea. Overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives a close shave and holds a charge for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Dad for Christmas.  Lasted 3 months then stopped dead..  I wonder if these are refurbs  based on&lt;br /&gt;the other reviews..  When it worked he liked it.  I have had my Norelco for 3 years....... Remington should be&lt;br /&gt;ashamed or this seller should be up front with what these units really are.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, awesome shave, almost as close as shaving with a razor blade- better than Braun and 3 times cheaper!!!</li>
    <li> This razor was disappointing because it is very loud, vibrates a lot, and doesn&#x27;t shave closely.  I returned it because of these characteristics.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I am not impressed with its performance. It doent deliver a close shave.</li>
    <li> I greatly prefer a foil shaver - they cut a heavy beard much better.  I have used other Remington models in the past and just plan to replace them every couple years.  This was less expensive than the model that I have been using, but seems to do a better job.  This may sound strange but it is a plus to be able to use while plugged in.  The other models were not to be plugged in when used - therefore when the battery was weak or would no longer take a charge, you had to throw the shaver away.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this razor. It shaves as close as a blade, is quiet and the battery last a long time on a full charge. I like that it is easy to clean and can be cleaned with a brush or with water. I recommend using a light oil on the blades every other week.</li>
    <li> Gee! It actually shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military so I have to keep my face groomed and shaved almost everyday of the week.(minus weekends) The battery on this thing is really good. I rarely have to charge it throughout the week and its a great shaver. Just make sure you clean it once since it will get clogged up after multiple uses. Thats with all shavers. I don&#x27;t know if the battery meter doesn&#x27;t work on mine but I never had the shaver go lower than green. It has always stayed 100 on the meter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t shave as well as the the triple head it replaced, but the trimmer was handier</li>
    <li> Bought for my 93 year old Dad!  He has always preferred Remington.  He is very happy with this purchase!  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product very good quality is what I expected when I decided to purchase this product I recommend very useful</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband. It had been a while since he owned a Remington and wanted to try this one. He likes the longer handle because it is easier to hold. The fast recharge was another selling point. Note: The first charge takes a few hours, but after that it does charge quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy (at $30) and would purchase it again</li>
    <li> My son haves a sensitive skin and stubborn beard. When it comes to the chin area it Knicks him, causing him pain.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my b day. The only issue is a screw kept coming out when i would shave. Finally it fell out, i called remington and they shipped me a new one that i received in less than a week. I gave the product 5 stars because the machine gives me the best shave i have ever had out of the 3 i have owned. My barber uses a cheaper one and told me i have a very good one. I appreciate the customer service from remington and that alone should make anyone happy. Mistakes happen, but as long as theres a correction behind it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this razor. My most recent Remington razor just didn&#x27;t work as well as the previous one, because I bought a triple foil version thinking it would be better than dual. Wrong. It never worked as well, and I regretted it for a couple of years. Fast forward to this dual foil razor with the center bar for trimming long hairs.... this thing is fantastic! Light years better than my triple foil, and better than I remember my trusty old dual foil razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had another Remington electric for almost 15 years. Even with new replacement blades, the old razor didn&#x27;t hold a candle to the performance from this new razor.  Yes, it gets longer hairs (after not shaving for 2-3 days). I find that I might have to pinch my skin a little in order to get the longer hairs to stand up, but I couldn&#x27;t even get my longer hairs with my older Remington razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge on this new razor doesn&#x27;t last as long as my older one, but my shaves are significantly quicker with this razor, so I do get as many days out of the charge, considering it doesn&#x27;t take me as long to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret this purchase - at all.  Lead On, Remington!!!</li>
    <li> These speakers are great! The bass is deep, and the sound output is enough to fill up my entire house and be heard from the road in front of my house. I am very impressed with these and recommend them to those who are looking for a new set of computer speakers.</li>
    <li> The shave is impressive with a new razor, with little pulling and a reasonably close shave.  Battery life is excellent.  The look and feel are favorable.  Cleaning with a brush seems awkward but doable.  The recommendation to wash with water every six months indicates the buildup of whiskers can be an issue, but the fact that water can be introduced into the collection chamber indicates a pretty &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; structure.  Overall, the first few weeks have been quite positive.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well, and gives you a good shave.  My only criticism is... the shape and smoothness of the shaver&#x27;s plastic body makes it hard to hold on to, and the slick smoothness makes it easily slip out of your hands!!!</li>
    <li> Works well. Make sure to do a complete charge the 1st time. It will not give you a razor close shave but it&#x27;s quick and you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself</li>
    <li> For fifty dollars i expected a product that would not break in the first week but the pop up trimmer did just that. After the first use the trimmer then completely stopped moving and after multiple disassembles, cleanings, soakings and oilings, the blades continued to not move. I got to the point of placing a hair in between the blades to see if it would cut a singular hair and it did not. Do not waste your money on this poorly manufactured product.</li>
    <li> I like to razor itself but within three weeks.The shaver head broke off so one side is leaning up inside the razor blade itself</li>
    <li> Never been a fan of electric razors.  I needed one though after I was injured in a ball game and had to surgery that made it difficult to shave and shower.  Tried this one during the weeks after surgery and was surprised at how well it performed.  Still use it every day and would recommend it.  Holds a charge for weeks!</li>
    <li> Fabulous shaver, better than Braun and Panasonic</li>
    <li> good close shave your face needs to adjust to the shaver, a little bit slippery to hold but shaves good.</li>
    <li> looks and works like it should!(what  I ordered)</li>
    <li> As described. Works excellent!</li>
    <li> Great razor! Works for me and makes my life easier and gives me a good clean, quick shave!</li>
    <li> Finally, a shaver that actually shaves, and close, too!  Great product at a fine price.  Shaves close, good trimmer, easy to clean, easy to handle, and it holds a full day&#x27;s charge through 2 or 3 shaves before needing any recharging (holds a 7 day power suppy when fully charged).&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold and the flex head conforms to chin and jaw lines very nicely.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This product does not cut properly</li>
    <li> I bought this on May 27 2015.  after 3 months , I am tossing it in the trash. It pull more hair than cuts and does not cut close.  My old remmington that is over 10 years old did a lot better job than this .</li>
    <li> Great electric shaver.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Works great! The best saver I have used in the 55 years I have been shaving.</li>
    <li> This is probably the third Remington electric razor I have owned.  It is no better or worse than the older two.  It&#x27;s OK for a lower priced razor.  My old razor was still working but needed new blades and foils.  The cost was about $24.00 to replace this.  I owned this razor for at least 20 years.  It was a bit noisy but still worked fine.  I decided to buy a new one (F5-5800) instead of replacing the parts on my existing Remington.  What I&#x27;m saying is, if I had kept my old razor and put in the new replacement parts, it would have shaved me equally as well as the brand new one.  One thing I don&#x27;t like about the F5-5800 is the placement of the on/off switch.  If you are not careful, your hand/fingers can touch the switch and the razor will shut off in the middle of shaving.  Would I buy this product again.  Maybe.  There is nothing really negative about it but I am not thrilled about it either.</li>
    <li> I like Remington as you feel it was made by people who plan to use it themselves. My old one finally gave out and I approached a new purchase with some reservations. But this newer model has a lot of promise and seems to be well-designed. The trimmer pops up at any time and does not nick. The charge will hold up for trips over a week if you forget and leave the charger home. Reputedly it will work outside the US (remains to be seen). And it seems lighter than the older model. So far I am a fan.</li>
    <li> This razor resolves a few issues with the MS-390 by Remington.  For one, it is quieter.  Second, it does better with neck hair.  Third, it has a better battery technology and a charge indicator.  Only downside is a lack of a travel case.  Have used it for several weeks, so cannot comment on blade life.  For my face this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  Strangely it is also the cheapest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too big on electric razors because my stubble does not do well with using one everyday.  I like to use one in between razor shaves.  For this purpose I find this Remington model to work just as well as the Braun 7k series for which I am replacing.  I especially like that I can clean it by running water over it and that seems to remove those micro bits of hair that always seems to remain despite brushing it.  Also, I don&#x27;t need to be buying the cleaning cartridges as I do with the Braun machine.  I&#x27;m not, however, as pleased with the trimmer on this model.  It pops outward away from the shaver and it just seems too awkward in handling it around my sideburns.  This is where the Braun razors are far better.  The Remington does fit well in my hand and charges quickly.  As I said, for the price it is a good purchase; now I will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I started shaving my beard with a Remington razor in 1970.  I used a Remington shaver for at least two decades and then switched to Braun.  I’ve been with Braun since the switch.  This is the first time in 30 years that I tried a Remington razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor F5-5800A is a monster; the sheer bulk of the razor had me wondering about the noise and ease of use.  But nothing could get me ready for the landing strip lighting on the battery charger LED light display.  I had to cover the display as it lit up my entire bathroom on a regular beat to the pulse charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very tough beard to cut with thick gray hairs mixed with thick black hairs.  I have several spots that are extremely difficult to do and require several passes with any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let’s get to the pros and cons of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Noise level is a little louder than the Braun, but acceptable&lt;br /&gt;2)  The shave is close, but not quite as close as my Braun Series 3.&lt;br /&gt;3)  The shaving surface is large (this is also a negative) which may save on some individual’s cutting time.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Even as large as it is, the razor handles very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;5)  It is priced very inexpensively in this market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Due to the large cutting surface area of the razor, it is difficult to not miss places  that are uneven (jaw, Adam’s apple, etc) without going over and over it.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The pop out trimmer is very difficult to use - due to the way it sticks straight out.&lt;br /&gt;3)  One battery charge can only accomplish five shaves for me, while the Braun can do seven.&lt;br /&gt;4)  I cut my lip on consecutive days with the middle cutting blades (designed to cut longer hairs) because they have larger than necessary openings.  This I have never done with the Braun.  I also cut several other areas due to this same issue.&lt;br /&gt;5)  The overall shaving experience is uncomfortable to me as the cutting block/foil is rougher to the skin than the Braun and leaves me with little sensitive “burned” areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think that Remington has produced a very nice razor, it is not in the same category as the Braun that I currently use.  There is a major price difference between the two units – nearly $50 difference.  However, I will use a razor for several years before buying another.  My last Braun (505) lasted nearly five years without even trading out the cutting block and foil.  I am willing to pay the extra money for the Braun due to the longevity of the device and close shave without razor burn.  The money is not as important to me as the comfort and closeness of the shaves when the life of the razor is five years or more.  It’s not that I don’t have issues with the Braun (the foil is not as effective as the older model that I used to use), but overall the Remington is one star different in ratings for me.ves me with little sensitive “burned” areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think that Remington has produced a very nice razor, it is not in the same category as the Braun that I currently use.

    <li> I have had Remington Foil shavers all of my adult life and this is the best yet.</li>
    <li> Not a good shave. I&#x27;ll stick with Braun next time.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver, is pretty big and shaves pretty well,  it charge quite fast and the charge last long enough.  and consider it&#x27;s price is a great buy for anyone.  I have own quite a few electric shaver, and considering it&#x27;s price and performance I&#x27;ll have to say this one is one of the better one out there,  Oh it&#x27;s larger then it appears to be, but work well.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product I don&#x27;t think you will not like it,  It&#x27;s a bit  noisier them the other electric shavers, but it does the job well.</li>
    <li> It gives a close shave but takes numerous passes to get that.</li>
    <li> Just what my son wanted.</li>
    <li> I used to prefer rotary head shavers exclusively, but then I tried this one with foil and I can do the job faster. This shaver is washable, but should never be submerged in water. It works worldwide, as it automatically adjusts power between 110-220V.The booklet provides tips to use, such as wait 15 after waking up to ensure your face is free of puffiness that may be present from sleeping, and do not press hard against your skin and damage the foil heads. The 2 hour charge time for 1 hour of shaving time is far better than most rotary heads I used - and this includes a 5 minute quick-charge when in a hurry. Replacement parts for this shaver (SPF300) can be found here on Amazon for about $25. Great shaver -  almost as good as an old fashioned blade. Although it handles skin irritation well, I still recommend using an after-shave after each use.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! The two foils get everything without pinching or anything! The &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; in the center gets the longer hair too so the foils can get them when they&#x27;re shorter.</li>
    <li> Bought it because surgery left a neck scar that safety razor nicked; checked Consumers Reports for ratings before choosing. Doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as safety razor, cleaning foil head and blades somewhat more problem than rinsing safety razor.  Shaves my more-or-less bald scalp more closely than electric clipper, and none of the nicks on my uneven scalp from safety razor! All in all, OK first few weeks.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Remington model with this one and while it does an OK job for an electric razor, I&#x27;m finding myself going over my face more times to get most of the hair than I did with my older model.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for the money.  It does just as well as my $300 Braun.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVER FOR THE MONEY, LONG BATTERY LIFE IF CYCLED FULLY.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to shave with this razor. A close shave is hard to get.</li>
    <li> Nicely designed razor which gives a nice close shave. Happy with it and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to hold the charge well also.</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington shaver I&#x27;ve had.  The first one lasted nearly ten years before it just died on me.  I&#x27;m hoping this one will last just as long.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and cuts close.</li>
    <li> This shaver does everything you would want at a very good price. Why spend over $100 on certain shavers, that have expensive replacement parts, when this one does the job? It gets my husbands face just about as good as a razor(if he takes his time) and he loves it. Spending more doesn&#x27;t always mean you will get more, and this is a perfect example. My husband appreciates the simplicity and hated the fuss that came with a rechargeable shaver.</li>
    <li> I have only had about a week, but so far I like this razor. It gives me a closer shave than my Braun.</li>
    <li> The foil on mine broke after just a couple weeks, and I can&#x27;t use it without a new foil, which is awfully expensive.  I was pretty happy with it up until then.  Edit: I&#x27;m getting a replacement item, so will adjust my review based on what I see with the new one. :)</li>
    <li> After the first use,it was clear it was twice as noisy as the Philips Norelco Shaver it replace.  This was expected as foils are always noisier.  No big deal here. The initial shave was not at all impressive.  I&#x27;m thinking this is only, maybe, a three star device.  Then I played around with it and found that I really could get a good shave if I just changed by technique a bit.  Ok, maybe this can get to be a four or even five star device.  Then I tried the trimmer and almost whacked half my moustache off.  The trimmer is a major league design flaw.  Because the trimmer is placed down and behind the HUGE foil head, it&#x27;s almost invisible.  This makes the trimmer not just useless but as I discovered very dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this only if you never plan to use the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very good. Holds a charge well. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my son .He loves it.</li>
    <li> This replaces an older model Remington Electric razor that worked well for 10 or more years before the battery failed to charge. This model charges quickly and shaves closer than the older model. The charge indicator is a great idea and works well.</li>
    <li> As a Black man with facial hairs that start curling inward almost as soon as they peek out of my skin, shaving will always be a challenge for me.  I alternate between shaving powder one day and an electric razor the next; although razor blades gave me the best/closest shave, I would afterwards get bumps on top of bumps.  Although I still have to go in and pull out a few in-grown hairs the Remington F5-5800 is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, giving me the closest and most thorough shave with the fewest ingrown hairs.  Does a great job on my head too; people think I use a razor.</li>
    <li> I have used a three blade foil remington in the past, this two blade is ever bit a good. My only complaint  is the trimmer. Its absolutely worthless.</li>
    <li> Received in a mutilated box&lt;br /&gt;Raiser does not shave close</li>
    <li> MY RAZORS (NORELCO ROTERY) OF 10 AND 12 YEARS GIVE ME A BETTER SHAVE WHEN IT COMES TO CLOSENESS AND LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE I HAVE TO SHAVE AGAIN. I HAVE TO GO OVER AREAS FOUR OR FIVE TIMES TO GET A HALF WAY DESCENT SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE REVIEW I READ MUST HAVE COME FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAS &amp;#34;PEACH FUZZ&amp;#34; FOR A BEARD</li>
    <li> I have several scars along my chin and jawline that make blade shaving something to dread. I finally decided to try an electric, and was pleasantly surprised by how well it shaves. No, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, despite what that guy in their commercials said, but it shaves close enough. What a pleasure it now is to get through the morning ritual without bits of tp stuck to my face. Even if I skip a day or two this shaver plows right through the stubble without tugging due to its center cutting bar. It even gets nearly blade close, on my notoriously difficult to shave chin without missing a whisker.</li>
    <li> Guess I am to used to razor shaves. Seems to take a lot of shaving to get it very close. probably me.</li>
    <li> holds charge well - dual power option a big plus especially later if the battery ever fails. Great dual foil shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice; rather quieter than my previous razor.</li>
    <li> Have yet to have a decent shave</li>
    <li> Great product. No complaints for those who need to shave on the run.</li>
    <li> I like the way it can be rinsed with water. I also like cord or cordless feature. The pivot head is terrible. The old Remington D A 757 was a better shaver.</li>
    <li> I didnt know what to expect I read the reviews so took the plunge,it is really well built and gives me a great shave.I think the best way to use it is to just go steady no sweeping up and down and then waiting a minute and restarting to shave.So all in all it&#x27;s a Spot on shaver very well made.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this Remington Shaver for my legs Specifically.  After getting a terrible shaver burns that turn to an itch with shaving cream, I  stopped using a wet shaver.  Not bad for a dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find mens shavers good with thick coarse hairs on me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you already sneak your spouses shaver for your legs ;)</li>
    <li> best electric shaver ive ever owned i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got a cheaper shaver for Christmas and used it for a month before flipping my nut and going back to Remington. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to make an electric shaver that actually gives a close cut, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that can do it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I almost spent over a hundred bucks on a deluxe model from another brand.  This thing is a fantastic value.  I get lots of shaves before it runs out and I never get any marks on my face like I did with my old norelco with 3 spinning blades.  It takes longer to get it done but it powers through thick stubble so It makes up for the hit you take to contact area coming from the other style of shaver that conforms to you face.  This one gets the hair to the perfect length without chewing up your skin.  Now that I&#x27;m better at shaving with it I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Shaves fine. No Problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been grinding Braun shavers across my face for years (ok, decades) and thought that was as good as it got.  I mean, come on, it&#x27;s a German company and precision engineered and all that, right?  But then I bought this shaver and holy cow it&#x27;s impressive.  I&#x27;ve got coarse, stiff hair that lives in a massive swirl on my chin, and it&#x27;s a daily battle to cut it back down.  My old Braun used to moan and whine and whir and I&#x27;d have to go back over the same spot 3-4 times until all the bits were gone.  When I first fired up the Remington, I was hooked.  It sounded like a small power tool ready to kick some face, and it delivered in spades - just 1-2 passes and I&#x27;m done and on to the morning chores.  Wait, that&#x27;s not so great.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!  Best Remington (or Braun) I&#x27;ve ever had!!!!!</li>
    <li> Does an acceptable job. I hate manual shaving every morning so this shaver takes a lot of the annoyance away.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor. I checked a lot of reviews and this seemed like the best of the bunch. I&#x27;m soooo glad I bought it. I can&#x27;t believe I put up with a &amp;#34;ladies razor&amp;#34; for so long. This is MUCH better! I use it for legs and underarms almost daily. I still use my bladed razor in the shower for the easier areas of legs but I use this electric for clean up and for around the knees/shins which are a major pain to get with a blade. I almost never bother to use a blade under my arms anymore because this is so much easier.  I also will use the electric for touch-ups on days when I don&#x27;t need to shower. This is a major timesaver! The shave is really close and clean up is easy. If it ever breaks I am buying the exact same model again. But so far no issues.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for the money! It holds a charge forever and cuts long and short whiskers well. It charges in a short time. I like the tilting head  feature. So long, Braun!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a long camping trip since there was going to be no wash facility or hot water.  I&#x27;m not normally a fan of an electric razor but the reviews seemed decent and cold/dry shaving wasn&#x27;t a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These weren&#x27;t very comfortable on my face (though I&#x27;m a blade guy normally) and had a hard time getting everything without serious effort (though I have very thick facial hair).  If you missed a day this only made things worse.</li>
    <li> excellent, charge lasts long time, haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet. might not be suitable for very heavy beards, but for the rest of us,a great buy.</li>
    <li> It takes forever to shave with this shaver.  It does not get many of the hairs on the first pass, and if you have anything longer than stubble it does not cut those well.</li>
    <li> Nice, low cost option for an electric shaver. Having tried both I like this foil opposed to the rotary electric shavers</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll do for now. Didn&#x27;t cost a lot. Close shave.</li>
    <li> Nice Shaver for the price.  If you have a heavy beard this might not be the one to buy.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this product. If what you want is a razor close shave then this is the product for you, but if you like me want to leave a shadow, then a different electric razor might be a better option.</li>
    <li> This is what exactly looking for, it gives very clean and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> In the quest for a better shave I picked this product up a couple weeks ago.  It gives a very close shave - as good as going against the grain with a blade, but its VERY finicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It routinely misses hairs no matter how many angles I try to get them (literally 1 hair will remain with all the others gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the best thing to do is go against the grain right from the get-go, but my beard grows in a million different directions so its kind of cumbersome to do.  I do have a extremely full and thick beard, so I have to trim it down with clippers if I let it go for about a week before using an electric or blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I get a fantastic, super smooth shave with no irritation, but the downside is that it takes about twice as long as a blade, and I usually use a blade to touch up the tight areas where the large head doesn&#x27;t quite fit (around the mouth, Adam&#x27;s apple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I say its pretty good, especially for the price.  I was really pleased it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation especially since I shaved with a completely dry face.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Remington MS-200 shaver and it did a good job. But then the battery died so I got a Panasonic that cost at least twice as much and it didn&#x27;t shave as well unless I shaved wet. This Remington F5-5800A shaves very well and I swear I get more shaves on a single charge. It shaves close but without irritation. The thing that initially clinched it for me was being able to use the cord or the battery. What I really like, though - and another reviewer mentioned this, is how well it shaves longer stubble. I hate shaving. I often go several days between shaves and I used to have to get the hair clippers out to trim my beard before using the Panasonic or the old Remington. The 5800 does really well with longer stubble without pulling or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can use cord or battery.&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves close without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves longer stubble really well without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Faster shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lost a screw. Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I mostly use this to shave my head and works great</li>
    <li> Considerable improvement over previous models.  Very quiet.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy - works well</li>
    <li> The Remington F5-5800 shaver work great, a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> Fairly good razor , but i expected a closer shave.</li>
    <li> It is very good overall.  The battery is holding charge alright.  It feels solid holding in my hand.  My only issue is it does not seem to cut as clean as I wanted it to be.  May be I didn&#x27;t press it too hard against my skin to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price.  It comes with an easy on - easy off guard when not in use.  The foils and pivoting head make it really comfortable and gets a close shave.  The unit itself is rather light and easy to wield.</li>
    <li> I seldom write reviews but took the time for this product. I used it right out of the box (for some reason, it was fully charged) and, in 5 minutes had the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric razor, let alone one that sells in the $ 35 - $ 40 range. Was actually less expensive than new foils and blades for my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;  Grip is comfortable and shaving is quick, even without an application of pre-shave. Design is pleasing and LEDS are cool. A real bargain.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor. It&#x27;s cordless, runs about 60 minutes on a charge. It also has a quick 5 minute charge which is great if you&#x27;re low on battery and need to charge it quickly. It&#x27;s basic but works well. Has a 3 stage cutting system and a pop up trimmer too. The price is very good for a cordless electric and the razor is too.</li>
    <li> Over the yeas, I&#x27;ve owned a variety of different kinds of electric razors. Up until now, I was using a [[ASIN:B004FDZMAQ Remington DA-307]] that I bought here at Amazon last summer. I&#x27;m guessing that is why Amazon me offered this Remington model F-5800 to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new razor is a bit of a step up from the one I was using. It has two separate sets of cutting blades  instead of the one dual-head. Plus, it has a scissor action piece that runs down between the two foil cutters. The head of the razor also pivots which makes for a wider range of control. I didn&#x27;t like that at first (the constant swiveling), but having used the razor for a month now I think it&#x27;s growing on me. Overall the shave I&#x27;m getting from the razor is very satisfactory. It even feels like it&#x27;s taking less time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there is a \\&quot;fuel gauge\\&quot; showing you the level of the charge left. Makes it easy to know when it&#x27;s time to charge the shaver. Charging is a bit different too. Instead of a direct connect cord feeding the razor 110v AC, it&#x27;s charged using a power transformer along the lines of what most electronics use today. I would have to say the 60 minute charge time is correct - my experience is pretty similar. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to take long to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emptying &amp; cleaning the shaver head couldn&#x27;t be easier. You simply pull the cover off and dump out the debris and then you can run water from the faucet to rinse it out. You also get a little brush to clean out the razor too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made this my main shaver and have since taken my other one to the office to use as a backup. Happily recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, well-constructed razor. It has a slight curve to it, which makes the razor easier to handle. There is a light indicator, so you know when to recharge it. A charge lasts for a good two weeks of shaving. It takes a couple hours to recharge. If, however, the razor is not charged and you need to shave right away, it has a quick-charge option. The razor can be charged for just 5 minutes, and then you can shave. It comes with a nice stiff brush to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor cleans easily by lifting the top off and emptying out the stubble, and then brushing it. You can clean it under running water after scrubbing the cutter, etc., with a drop of soap. The shaver heads can be taken off to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give you a close shave, if you hold it properly so that the screens both touch your face. I was not able shave in a short, rotating motion like the instructions say, because the rectangular razor head made it awkward. It comes with a limited 2-year warranty. There are also instructions, so that you can remove the batteries for disposal when the razor reaches its end of life. Overall this is a quality razor that would suit most anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband has only used the rotary type shavers before where there are three rotating heads.  He likes the convenience of electric razors, but doesn&#x27;t think they shave as close as a traditional blade razor.  This was a pleasant surprise.  When he uses it, it looks just as clean and smooth as if he used his blade razor.  Impressed.</li>
    <li> The razor is quiet, smooth and easy to handle.  Battery charge is incredibly long at almost a month between charges. The shave is 99% as close as a blade razor.  Follow the enclosed product instructions and this razor will work well for anyone!</li>
    <li> Effortless. The center piece between the foils makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> The Remington 5800 shaves closer and faster with less irritation than my Phillips/Norelco rotary ever did. I did a lot of online research to find a better shaver at a decent price and don&#x27;t regret buying it at all.  I shaved yesterday afternoon when it arrived USPS just to check it out and was impressed. My beard is kind of patchy with some thick and thin hairs and doesn&#x27;t grow too fast so I usually only need to shave every 3 days. Anyway, I had a dentist appointment this morning and thought I&#x27;d give it another try even though I really didn&#x27;t need it. It was cool hearing the thing shave off off hair you could barely see. Good combination of motor speed and foil technology I suppose. I was impressed enough to write this, my 1st review ever. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price!</li>
    <li> Unit was fully charged upon receipt. Easy to operate. Shaves closely over entire face , chin and neck. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I get a shaver, I use it till it falls apart. This has functioned well so far. The shave is good and I&#x27;ve been impressed with how long the rechargeable battery lasts between charging.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very nice. On time. Great.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Remington MS2-390 foil shaver that I had over five years.  The old shaver was rated second at the time by Consumer Reports Magazine, only slightly behind a Norelco foil shaver that cost five times as much.  Since I have a beard, I hate to spend that much on a shaver that I only use to shave around the edges and a little on my neck.  Also the batteries seem to die after a few years no matter how much use it gets and they can&#x27;t be replaced.  My main complaint with the old one was how loud it was.  This new one is a lot quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the foil shavers I have owned in the past have had one problem.  If you don&#x27;t shave every day, they have trouble getting a couple days growth.  The Remington F5-5800 was too new to be rated in Consumer Reports, however, I saw that this one has a special middle cutter that would handle a little growth, which some reviewers commented how great it worked, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, it does exactly what it says it will with a couple days growth.  In addition, it still leaves the longer beard whiskers untouched, even when brushing right up against the sides of the foil head, just like I want it to do.  It has a nice charge indicator that seems to work well; it has cord or cordless capability; it gives a quieter shave; and it had a great price.  Oh and did I mention, I get a really smooth shave too.  I seems that I bought just the right saver for me!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The shave is good and close.  Clean up is super easy with a quick rinse under the faucet.</li>
    <li> Really it&#x27;s a good electric razor.</li>
    <li> I like everything about the shaver, but I am disappointed with the shave, it is not as close as I had hoped . I still have to go over my face with a blade after I use the shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m female and I actually ordered this beautiful little device for myself. The swivel head, while meant for the chin and neck, really is a great feature to have when shaving your unmentionable region. It gives a smooth shave, is easy to clean and isn&#x27;t loud and obnoxious like other electric razors I have used. Definitely happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remingtons since the 1960&#x27;s, even worked at the factory for 7 years. This is the best Remington ever, even though it&#x27;s probably produced overseas now. Highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who is just learning to shave. I have a Braun Series 3 (a 390CC actually) and love the features, so the Remington was a good match for a better price.  These razors are very similar with 2 exceptions (there is no recharging/cleaning station and the Remington&#x27;s head pivots).  The initial quality is on par with the Braun, although a bit thicker in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good product, at least initially.  It remains to be see how long the quality will hold up, but it&#x27;s good fir right now.</li>
    <li> Strong blade. It&#x27;s like a lawn mower. Cuts everything but it hurts little bit.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap shaver that works great, I&#x27;m glad I did not buy the $150 model.</li>
    <li> Maybe it will take me a while to get the hang of using an electric shaver but this does not shave as close as I would like.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband and he loves it. Says it&#x27;s the best shaver he has ever had.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product. Nice people. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> now this thing is really good, would be nice if everything had a battery like it does</li>
    <li> For what I paid I saved some money on buying new heads for my razor. I bought this one because of the other reviews and that Remington got me through boot camp in the.......well, a long time ago. I also ordered the powder stick. The fragrance took me right back and the sound and power of the Remington did also. You can hear when it is cutting and it does cut close. The amazing thing is the lack of irritation. I shave first, then shower.I need to use swimmer ear drops after showering and I usually feel the alcohol on my cheek. Not with this razor!! It shaves as close if not closer than the rotary I was using. The charge was fast and lasts about two weeks. Hmmm...the razor I did use was about seven times the price of this one. Let&#x27;s see how long the sharpness lasts before replacing is needed. My other razor can now be my travel razor. Good job Remington and thanks Amazon for the low price.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this razor. I have owned two much more expensive electric razors from Panasonic. This razor shaves every bit as well as those more expensive razors at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Cheap portable shaver. Not as good as the expensive shaver but it&#x27;s good enough for traveler.</li>
    <li> Works great for shaving my head!</li>
    <li> The foil covering the blades keeps on popping off. It&#x27;s really annoying... Should have returned it as soon as I got it  EDIT:  Contacted customer service and they sent a replacement head right away. The new one works as expected and I&#x27;m happy with the machine.</li>
    <li> Good stuff good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this item. It was much less expensive than my previous Remington Titanium shaver, which had a broken trimmer mechanism and switch cap and became basically unuseable.</li>
    <li> Shaves close.  Holds a charge well and doesn&#x27;t yank your beard hairs out by the roots as some shavers are prone to do.  In my opinion, this type of shaver gives you a closer shave than the rotary shavers do and does so more comfortably.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very low price for a two-cutter razor.  Excellent for the money, but I prefer the three-cutter model</li>
    <li> Gives a close shave. Motor noise is acceptable. Battery goes a long way without recharging.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very good. Fits good in hands and charges good. Would have liked a travel case with it.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Great for sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and always used caution when using new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I like how it had a LED to tell you how much battery is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve been a rotary shave for years but wanted to try something new. I love how the replacement heads are alot cheaper capered to my  SensoTouch 3D which costs me $47.00 dollars and now the price went up to $81.00 The Foil Shaver will cost me $25.00 to replace the heads which is a huge plus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut on your upper lip hair or sideburns. When I place it on my skin it closes. Not sure if its a defect or how its suppose to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Its a little on the bulky side but not to heavy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as a three head shaver. Also doesn&#x27;t hold charge long. The older three head models were much better.</li>
    <li> great remington product.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A FINE PRICE PERFOMER !</li>
    <li> Good product although I sometimes get a bit of razor burn with it.  This is my second one, first one is working fine, but I like a back up.  It kind of looks and feels  cheap (like heavier like Panasonic or Braun), and the only major gripe I have is the big head is hard to get in just below your nose (above your top lip).  It is not the easiest thing to clean either, but with a decent tiny brush, you can clean it without major problems.  I like it better than my Braun, and the only negatives  I have read are the durability issue.  So far, my first one has  lasted 6 months, seems fine.</li>
    <li> This shaver works really well. The clipper head in the middle of the foils is excellent at getting the hairs that other foil shavers would miss. Its charge has also lasted very well so far. I would definitely make this purchase again based on my experience to date. I haven&#x27;t had this shaver long enough to comment on how durable it is.</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to. But it doesn&#x27;t do it well. Almost like any other cheap razor but it leaves a big mess everywhere. The blade in between the two razors drops hair all over. I&#x27;m constantly cleaning up around the sink after I shave because of the mess it leaves. The clipper on the back is also hard to clean out. Tapping it usually cleans it out better than using a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are the battery that lasts a long time between shaving and the price.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! I received the wrong product! The label on the box clearly says a trimmer, but somebody put another smaller label that says shaver over top of that label.</li>
    <li> Screens on top kept on popping off after a few seconds of use. Tried it to fix screens several times and then sent it back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I BUT IT ,it look is better use</li>
    <li> Works really well, doesn&#x27;t pull or cause the same sort of razor burn that I get with the Mach 3. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to get the hair close to my nostrils. I haven&#x27;t used the tri-head style either so I can&#x27;t compare to that.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I don&#x27;t know why it has had some bad reviews. I would recommend this product. NIce price too.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend is very pleased with product. Very close and easy shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonics and blown big money on Brauns . This Remington is by far the best. Very close shave and seems to get areas that others miss or won&#x27;t cut close. Great value.</li>
    <li> I believe the shaver was quite a bargain for $29.99. I&#x27;ve switched from my razor to the shaver. The Remington shaves close for an electric shaver, but if I&#x27;m going to a late evening event, I switch back to the razor which does shave a bit closer. After many years of using a number of electric shavers, I find the Remington to be the best.</li>
    <li> Zip zop, all the little tiny hairs come right off my face.  I used to use a blade and shave cream, but the slicing and dicing was extreme.  Everyday I&#x27;d cut myself to shreds..  And at $4.99 a quart, blood transfusions (type A-) were bankrupting me.  All I ever wanted anyway was a clean shave, not a self-sacrifice.  Now I have it.  Buy this electric shaver.  It will pay for itself in just one week.  No more tourniquets or astringent compresses.  Ahhhh!</li>
    <li> If you read the instruction manual,  this can seriously hurt you if you use it other than whats told. You can get shocked if its wet, it says monitor it as its charges. Performance,  its not spectacular.  I still have to follow up with a blade because it misses a lot of spots.  Update. Its a piece of junk. Doesnt give you a good shave, it leaves lots of hair behind. And the battery doesnt last long.</li>
    <li> Very good shave, even on the neck. No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my husband for his B - Day . He is very satisfied and happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of electric shavers.  I kind of collect them.  The shaver I was previously using, a pricey self-cleaning Braun, was my current favorite.  I was pretty happy with it, so I thought I&#x27;d give this Remington a couple of tries and then go back to my Braun.  But this thing took me by surprise with how well it works.  What a fast shave!  A lot of shavers tend to miss hairs, and you have to go back over the same area several times to get them all.  But this Remington really has \\&quot;bite.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s like a lawnmower with a freshly honed blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because it gets more hairs in fewer passes, the irritation level is virtually non-existent.  This took me by surprise even more.  A close and fast shave with no irritation?  Count me in!  My feature-laden Braun has been sitting idle ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just a couple of drawbacks to this Remington.  One is that it is noticeably louder than my Braun, which is unusually quiet.  But it&#x27;s no noisier than you usually find with an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real drawback is that the screens on this shaver, like every Remington I&#x27;ve ever tried, subtly blacken your skin.  Haven&#x27;t noticed it?  Run a cotton ball soaked in toner (or a Stridex pad...hey, they&#x27;re great even for adult skin) over your beard area after shaving, and you&#x27;ll see that the cotton ball has become distinctly gray.  And this effect is worse in the summer, when your skin is likely to be moister due to humidity or heat.  Don&#x27;t even THINK of using a Remington fresh out of the shower.  And as the screen gets older, it leaves even more residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottom line for me is that shaving is really boring, so I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time doing it, and I don&#x27;t want patches of red, irritated skin.  This Remington has me covered on both counts, better than any shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> take the head off  and see how flimsy this thing is.  You might want to by some face cream for the burns.. I don&#x27;t like it or the  shave.  Remington  dropped the ball.  . I would not recommend this shaver the ..FOIL is, when you buy it</li>
    <li> My husband likes the shaver but not to the extent of saying that he loves it. It does the job and sure beats his old worn out razor.</li>
    <li> A MUST buy. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Cleanest shave I ever got with a razor. I would prefer it if it had stubble settings, but I suppose I will just have to settle with the trimmer for now.</li>
    <li> this is a great shaver I&#x27;ve had many brauns the last a 3 series that i replaced and this is a far better shaver the pivot the price its a great deal</li>
    <li> I would have to say so far so good it does a nice job. My favorite feature is the cover for the foil cutter.</li>
    <li> Horrible shaving performacce.  For over 10 years I used Cheap Norelco triple rotary blade models, each lasting 5 years. This one does a lousey job shaving even after going over the same areas over and over. Gave it a fair trial over 4 months. Throwing this away and returning to a triple rotary blade model.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric shaver for over 20 years now and following other amazon reviews and a special offer on the day, I  decidedto take the plunge and purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves well and does not rough up my skin in the process.  Charges well and is easy to clean uner running water.</li>
    <li> From a man with big-time razor bump problems, this is a very comfortable shaver.  Cleans easily with water and the provided brush and shaves quickly.  I look forward to keeping my beard short when I know there are no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it got 4 stars was because the trimmer is awkward and very hard to use.  I have a trimmer already so this is not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Used this thing once a week for the last couple months and it is still at 90% battery.  Cuts very well and works much better than the 8 year old Remington it replaced.  Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I like Remington products...and I liked this shaver too, until it stopped working.  This is the first Remington I have purchased where the motor just gave out.  Usually its the battery that goes bad after a few years of charging and using...or if it does not have a battery it usually just keeps on going until I decide I want a new model.  But this time the motor went out after about 9 months of use.  Don&#x27;t know if it is just this model shaver or if quality control is dropping with Remington overall.  Maybe I just got a bad one...don&#x27;t know.  I plan to buy another one...same model....and we will see.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! So far it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Dollar for dollar the best shaver out there.  No irritation, does well under the chin, and cutting heads are washable. Can take down a couple of days growth.  Battery life is good but charge times are long.  Trimmer is decent. Even the pivoting head works which is more than I can say for more expensive shavers I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
    <li> Shaves great.  Holds a charge for several shaves.</li>
    <li> Good product. Gives a shave good enough to go to work in the morning. I bought one for me and my dad.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used! I shave my legs with it, and it gets VERY close to a clean shave (as it would be if I used a safety razor). Really, my legs are totally smooth with this. I find it helps to hold the skin taut, and shave in circles so the same area gets covered a few times. My boyfriend keeps borrowing it to shave his face, as it&#x27;s such a clean, easy shave that holds a charge well. The heads are easy to clean, as well, though be aware that the two rotary blades do pop off their holders, so don&#x27;t open it to clean over an open drain. Or do, and be ready to remove the trap. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway....it&#x27;s a great shaver, for face and legs, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far it is just like the box says shaves better than a Braun.  Very content with all the features sure I would recommend it to a friend.  Very good buy.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver for the price. Gives a good shave but not the closest..</li>
    <li> Never used an electric razor before and decided to give this model a try based on positive reviews. I&#x27;m very impressed at how close it shaves. Had this for a week and the charge is still holding up. Tossing my razors away, happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t give me the shave that I expected. Am using it at this time, Staying with the blades.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work well, luckily I have a a trimmer already. Otherwise it does the job for an inexpensive shaver.</li>
    <li> This was a bang for the buck read the</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned many of theml</li>
    <li> Great new product. Remington has re-done their popular razor. I like it better than their previous product.</li>
    <li> Okay not great for a really clean shave. Have to work at it.</li>
    <li> Gave me a much closer shave than my rotary shaver that was more than twice the price. I was hesitant to buy because of the low cost and thinking I would get what I pay for... but decided to give it a shot. Very happy with my purchase. I will say the side cutter isn&#x27;t the greatest, but the front makes up for it.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Hubby says it&#x27;s better than more expensive models he&#x27;s had.  Very easy to use.  Would re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, he was really impressed with this item</li>
    <li> Super nice razor and it does give you a close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to use, it will be much better once my face gets use to it. Only had it a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> My son asked me to write this review:  Quite good at the face and the trimmer works well on side burns. Not very effective at shaving the neck, I still have to use my safety razor for that.</li>
    <li> What a surprise.  I have owned many electric shavers over the years but this one by far has been the best.  Father time decided that I shouldn&#x27;t have hair any more so I started shaving my head.  Don&#x27;t care for the bozo the clown look.  I did have a norelco and no matter how many times I would go over the same area, I just could not get a close shave.  The first time I used this one, I felt the difference.  I still have to go over the same area several times but when I&#x27;m done, it&#x27;s almost as smooth as a blade shave.  Remington, you get 5 stars on this one.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> good for the price.  Works well as advertised</li>
    <li> Have used Remington electric razors for years and have always been very pleased with their products. While this unit does it&#x27;s job of providing a,close shave very admirably, it does have, at least in my mind a glaring deficiency. I have a mustache/goatee that requires trimming twice weekly. While the trimmer on this unit does quite well it is located on the razor in a manner that prevents the user from seeing what they are trimming!  It should have been located higher on the body of the razor so as to afford the operator clear line-of-sight.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> It takes me a good 13 to 14 minutes to get an overall satisfactory shave.  If it did it in 5 or 6 minutes I would have given it a 5 star rating. Perhaps when the foil gets thinner with wear it will take less time for a close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband and he loves it. Perfect shave every time. Great shaver  and the price was within my price range.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a very old cheap triple foil Remington I&#x27;ve had forever which still works great but the battery is going. This model is well build, solid, and quiet. It mows through my tough beard without issue. Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the triple foil. If you don&#x27;t have a tough beard this should work awesome for you. Personally, I&#x27;m returning it and getting the FR-750 which is a triple foil. I still think Remingtons are the best value.</li>
    <li> Does a fairly good job of delivering a close shave.  I&#x27;d rate my beard as medium/average.  It does take quite a few passes to achieve real closeness.  For day-to-day basic use, this shaver does the job.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the money</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this Remington F5-5800 Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology. I&#x27;ve been getting a very close shave with this razor. The batter is much stronger than my previous rechargeable, which would lose most of its power after three or at best four shaves. After following the instructions and letting it charge for 24 hours before starting to use it, I&#x27;ve yet to need to recharge and I&#x27;m now on about my 10th or 12th shave. The power drop-off has been negligible, and there is a indicator meter which shows you exactly how much charge you have remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a good close shave. I would&#x27;ve probably been willing to pay a little more than the $29.95 I paid for this (not including the $10 shipping) but with the reviews for this razor being overwhelmingly favorable, I went ahead and made the purchase. The razor is just as good as earlier reviews had indicated. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the closeness of the shave, the length of the battery charge, the relatively quiet sound of the razor. It&#x27;s also very quick to remove the foil and clean up after you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this shaver to anyone with light to moderate facial hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving marvel just before going on a 15 day trip.  Besides the delivery hiccup, (3rd party service lost my package), I&#x27;m quite happy with the shaver.  I charged it before leaving for the trip and it&#x27;s still going.  Admitedly, it takes me 2 days to get a perceivable amount of face fur, (I&#x27;m not a sasquatch by any stretch of the imagination), but it got the job done.  I love the fact that you only need to rince the darn thing in order to get rid of the hair.  I still fear that one day, a sizable Chihuahua will crawl out of my shaver and bite me on the chin, but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;The only slight complaint I have with this device is its size.  It&#x27;s slightly smaller than the first brick-like cell phones.  Mind you, it is smaller than the new smart phones coming out, so as you can see, it&#x27;s not really a complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Its size is probably due to the large battery.  All in all, a good purchase and it was indeed a great traveling companion.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever bought. Battery life is phenomenal</li>
    <li> After a little more than 10 years, my old Braun shaver finally bit the dust suddenly. I immediately started shopping around, and price was a big consideration. After much research, and reading many product reviwes, I settled on this Remington. So far, after just a little over a week of daily usage, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. A very smooth, comfortable, close shave each and every time. It arrived with a good charge, and just today I plugged it in to charge for the first time after 9-10 initial uses. I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking to not spend a whole lot of money for something that will work as well, or better, than a far more expensive product.</li>
    <li> I have had the Remington before.  It is an excellent razor.  I would use no other.</li>
    <li> This is worth a buy. Works perfect with shaving. I shave on my drive to work every morning.</li>
    <li> Bought many Remington electric razors over the years.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves close for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Screen/ cutter a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Great service, low price, best razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Love it! Really gets everything and it can leave perfect lines. 😃👍👍</li>
    <li> Holds a nice long charge and feels good in my hand but takes a long time to cut the whiskers down. Maybe it&#x27;s my beard?</li>
    <li> Very nice and sturdy. Shaves without any problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it on a bald head, and it&#x27;s not working as well as I expected. Thinking about returning it as this is the only thing I needed it for. Still, it seems like a quality razor, and I&#x27;m sure it would work well on my face, but I have a beard.</li>
    <li> Had to keep going over to cut I don&#x27;t think I know how to use it?</li>
    <li> Great shave at a great price.</li>
    <li> So, I guess I&#x27;m an unusual customer? I will post anyway in case some one gets the same idea. Okay long story short, traumatic brain injury, brain surgery, coma, like a cross between a cave woman and a wooly mammoth body hair wise... So the female body hair remover didn&#x27;t work for me ( that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s now my vibrator) So I bought this product based on the ratings, read the directions, and it says not to use this on your head or body, it&#x27;s only made for the face. Well, I didn&#x27;t know that when I bought it and if I DID know, oh I wouldn&#x27;t have cared. I used it on my leg first, and I&#x27;m sure if I was more thorough, I would have got a closer shave, but I was doing my whole body, so I got about a two day hair length after using it.  I also had a Venus razor in my shower I would use that afterwards. So I am pleased :)</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a woman who bought and uses this.  A senior citizen woman.  But I really like this shaver!  Mine holds a charge for a long time.  I use it maybe twice a month.  It just seemed better made than most ladies shavers on the market.  I think it is!  It looks and feels like a great quality shaver and it&#x27;s a pleasure to own and use.</li>
    <li> Noisy  but shaves better than Norelco. Not as kind to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Turned out to be a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> I almost always use Braun razors, but my last one let me down.  I&#x27;m still getting used to this Remington, but after two months, I&#x27;m happy that I chose this one.</li>
    <li> have had about a doz shaves... so far...so good.&lt;br /&gt;shaves great</li>
    <li> It has the features I was looking for;it will actually be a &amp;#34;travel backup&amp;#34; as my other razor is self cleaning &amp; has too much apparatus to carry along.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. I&#x27;ve used it for about 8 months, shaving every weekday, and it continues to work great. Battery life is excellent. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it about 5 times. I have relatively soft facial hair. This style of shaver really works best if you use it daily. Longer scruff takes a bit of work.</li>
    <li> Works fine. As expected.</li>
    <li> F5 shaver works better than I thought it would.https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WQbMWZVWL._SS300_.jpghttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WQbMWZVWL._SS300_.jpg</li>
    <li> Received this today.  I was surprised that it was fully charged right out of the box!  Took it in the bathroom and gave my bald head a good shave.  Much closer shave than my rotary Norelco can do!  Other good features is that this can be powered by the cord if the batteries are dead (you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge) and it charges fully in 2 hours (which gives 1 hour of run time!!)</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price. Cuts right through the minimal facial hair I am actually able to grow (21yo Male).&lt;br /&gt;One step closer to being a man.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The first one needed new blades. The cost of new blades was only a few dollars less than the whole new razor so I bought the whole thing. Gives a very good shave. I don&#x27;t want an extremely close shave, and this razor gives me a good balance between quick shave and good skin.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVER EVER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To any reading this I am an African-American male getting ready to depart for basic training on Jan 13th (todays date of this review is Oct 12th) I have always had problems with the usage of regular razors and getting razor bumps.  However, being clean shaven is part of the requirements and with the pay and duty requirements for regular enlisted I knew I wouldnt be able to go to the barber every other day to stay smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched literally for a week before deciding on which particular shaver to buy.  I looked at the top expensive models from Braun and Panasonic but couldnt quite bite the bullet cuz of the price tag.  After I figured out that I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than 100 bucks I started looking at features of each specific razor.  Keep reading:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that caught my eye about this is the Interceptor Shaving Technology.  Basically it has a built in trimmer in between the two foils that will cut hair longer than stubble to stubble length.  Every other foil shaver and even rotary shaver I looked at did not have this feature.  And even my barber told me that with electric shavers you really have to not let the hair get longer than stubble or else they wont work.  This appealed to me as more of a preventative and unique measure but still very beneficial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally received this razor on Sept 24th and I have been using it for about 2 and a half weeks and have been using it without fail ever since.  In my case a couple weeks before I received it I stopped shaving because I had to let my face heal from trying to use a regular razor so I had about a solid 1/16th inch of hair covering my face. I unboxed it, read the instructions, and it took about 8-10 mins but the result was like I had shaven with a razor.  I had no whiskers or stray hairs anywhere and my skin felt baby smooth and not irritated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it ever since without fail and still NO RAZOR BUMPS only baby smooth skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cordless so all you have to do is make sure it&#x27;s charged before you use it.  Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Don&#x27;t use alot of pressure when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2)DO NOT go in circles or fast.  Use deliberate kind of slow straight back-forth up/down side to side motions.  This thing has a pivot head that adjusts to the contours of your jawline and neck. After using for a little bit you will notice a sound difference when it is actually cutting vs going over smooth hair free skin&lt;br /&gt;3)Make sure your skin is clean and completely dry and not oily&lt;br /&gt;4)Make sure you clean after every use.  This helps to keep the razors under the foil able to cut like a regular razor&lt;br /&gt;5)For supreme results use day and night.  I personally, use it at night only but my friend who I recommended this to has facial hair that grows extremely fast so he has to use it more but is still baby smooth and bump free like me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to ALL of my friends and think I will purchase another one just in case it ever breaks or whatever.  It is that good.  LOVE IT!!!!!!/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cordless so all you have to do is make sure it&#x27;s charged before you use it.

    <li> I purchased this shaver so I can shave my spouse who is in a nursing home. I have to go over his beard a few times to get a closer shave  By doing so he has gotten shaver burn even though I use a pre electric shave lotion on his face. When he was well and could shave himself he never got shaver burn, with another rechargeable shaver.It also was a Remington.&lt;br /&gt;The battery needs recharged after about 5 shaves and it has only been used about 2 months. ( I followed the directions on charging before use).&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that the head can be rinsed.  The shaver is easy for me to handle. I purchased this shaver after reading a few reviews both for and against. I took my chances as it seemed to be what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor and I am in love. I just switched from using regular old disposable razors for years and I wish I had made the switch years ago. This took me from a painful and annoying routine that I disliked, to a quick less than a minute shave. I can&#x27;t compare this razor to any others, but I can tell you that it gives me a smooth shave with no cuts. I don&#x27;t even think you could cut yourself with this thing. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> razor is good for every day shave&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used probably a dozen electric razors in the past fifty years.  This one does the job better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Ok as a travel shaver but not for every day use if you want a close shave .Would I buy it again. no blades are a lot better</li>
    <li> I am a minister, so I try to keep clean shaven as best as I can.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of razor and shaving product under the sun (disposable razors, safety razors, straight razors).  I have sensitive skin, and shaving with anything other than an electric razor every day wreaks havoc on my skin.  I have been using electric razors for about 10 years now. I have had 2 Remingtons, 2 Norelcos, and 1 Panasonic.  1 Norelco and the Panasonic were high-end razors, the others were mid to low level razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair is pretty thick and grows quickly.  Know that electric razors do not shave as close as a manual razor (which is ok with most people) and so you will have to shave everyday if you want to stay smooth.  The only reason I purchased this razor was because I accidentally dropped and broke a piece of my Panasonic that was irreplaceable.  On to the razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AESTHETICS: This razor is fairly nice looking.  Not as sleek as some high end models, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter.  It&#x27;s pretty heavy and feels sturdy.  It&#x27;s a lot wider than most of the other razors I&#x27;ve ever handled but I actually like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POWER: This is the biggest strength of the razor to me.  Man it will cut through any thickness of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE: It is noisier than other razors I&#x27;ve had, but that may not be an issue for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPEED: Due to it&#x27;s power, it shaves very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMFORT/SHAVE QUALITY: This is where I was disappointed.  After using this razor, my face was severely irritated for the next few hours.  To make things worse, the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as what I was used to with my Panasonic ES8243.  After all of the positive reviews, I was kind of disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU READ ANY OF THIS REVIEW, PLEASE READ THIS!  The reason I titled this &amp;#34;know what you&#x27;re buying&amp;#34; is because this is a GREAT razor if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You have thin, smooth facial hair&lt;br /&gt;- Can get away with shaving less often&lt;br /&gt;- Are on a budget&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of those apply to you, this is the razor to get! I do honestly believe for the money it is a good razor.  If you are used to higher end models though, you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick, coarse, fast growing facial hair (and sensitive skin), I&#x27;d go ahead and spend the extra money and get a nicer razor because this one is pretty rough on your skin (and I know because I&#x27;ve had other models that leave no irritation).  I ended up returning this razor and opted for another Panasonic after debating between it and the Braun Series 7.br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of those apply to you, this is the razor to get! I do honestly believe for the money it is a good razor.  If you are used to higher end models though, you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick, coarse, fast growing facial hair (and sensitive skin), I&#x27;d go ahead and spend the extra money and get a nicer razor because this one is pretty rough on your skin (and I know because I&#x27;ve had other models that leave no irritation).  I ended up returning this razor and opted for another Panasonic after debating between it and the Braun Series 7.</li>
    <li> This is my first Remington and I am very pleasantly surprised with both the price and the with how well the shaver shaves my face.  Yes, you have to adjust your hand a little to not accidently turn off the shaver.  Yes, I have to slow down the speed of my shaving for a better and closer shave..  Yes, the long hair cutter sometimes gently knicks me if I angle the shaver too much.  But I get the best shave I have ever gotten with an electric shaver!  And the price was $29.00 when I bought it!?!  I own a Panasonic ES8019 shaver that I used for over 15 years (the battery just died) and a Norelco Arcitec rotary shaver. I always used both of these shavers daily to get a close shave.  I paid the better part of $100.00 for each of those shavers and the shave is better with this Remington!  Very happy with my purchase.  I just hope this shaver lasts as long as the Panasonic lasted...  As usual, the product was received in 2 days in very good packaging.</li>
    <li> My husband said it&#x27;s the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had. I&#x27;ve purchased Braun and other more expensive brands and  he said this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> I have had a Remington shaver in the past that I was not happy with.  I switched to Panasonic and have been very satisfied.  I decided to try Remington based on the reviews.  It is bulky and heavy.  But it does a very good job of shaving and the battery seems to last longer than the Panasonic razors.</li>
    <li> Gives a reasonably close shave. In my opinion, these type of foil shavers work better than the rotary style. I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between rotary and foil several times with mixed results but I think maybe this particular design has finally got it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed on one of the reviews that someone complained about it being unreliable and the blades were loose after a blade replacement. I suspect that they lost the small spring that is underneath each blade which is what keeps the blade engaged with the foil.</li>
    <li> Working great and holding charge more than 2 weeks which covers most vacations.  I&#x27;m concerned about the inference I may have to buy expensive new screens every 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin and takes many passes to shave correctly.</li>
    <li> Not worth a star 3rd time plugged in SPARKS AND THAT WAS it. Don&#x27;t want to send my time with returning. So in my mind this one NO</li>
    <li> peice of  sh it  broke in 32 days. a screw holding the foil head came off and now i cant even return it</li>
    <li> I finally had to replace my ten year old MS2 razor so this one looked like a winner from the reviews I read.  It took about a week for my face to adapt to the new shaver but after that I am very pleased with the quality of the shave I get.  It does take a bit longer to shave than the MS2 probably due to the heads being a little less wide but the end result it very good.  This is likely the best shaver in it&#x27;s price range and is highly recommended by this reviewer.</li>
    <li> I was VERY pleased with the shipping first of all, purchased it thursday, said to be at my house saturday and I got it friday afternoon, so very happy with that. I just got too try this bad boy out for my first time tonight and this razor is soooo much better than what i expected it too be. The foil shaving system feels almost natural on your face, like there&#x27;s barely any pulling or anything. I had an older electric razor similar too this one but a different brand  and I enjoyed it very much until i dropped it on the floor and it broke. So now I can personally say that just after one shaving this razor put a smile on my baby smooth face. I also like the pop-up trimmer it has for your sideburns, very helpful. The battery indicator was another plus that my old razor didn&#x27;t have, i love knowing how much life it has left for when it&#x27;s time to shave again and if it does or doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. Recommend 100% to anyone who likes/loves electric razors or who would like to try one! This was only my second ever electric and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Exceeds my expectations!</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Remington razor guy for 20 years but NO MORE!  This is the 2nd Remington razor that has failed in the first six months in the past two years.  Same issue, the motor starts stuttering for a day or two then it just completely freezes for good.  This is despite it being fully charged.  Guess I could return it, possibly under warranty but I imagine I would pay for shipping and would get an equally crappy Remington to replace it.  The last two that failed seemed very lightweight and flimsy compared to a eight year old Remington that I still have and still works.</li>
    <li> works great - i really like the power meter on the front - cutter head is a little big as compared to some, but great razor for the price</li>
    <li> My best electric razor to date arrived quickly and really works well. Before, I had to use the trimmer to get rid of hairs that did not get cut. Now they all get cut!</li>
    <li> Great touch and clean shave. It&#x27;s a smooth shave probably because of the flexibility. Battery lasts only about 7 daily uses of 2-3 minutes average. I fully charged mine as instructed before initial use and subsequent charging takes about two hours to fully charge. Noise level is acceptable but not deafly quiet.  It&#x27;s a very good quality shaver.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of these  for my bro, but this one is the best by far. I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shaver is remarkable! I have used the cheaper brand of Remington portables but the foil kept becoming unattached. This shaver is solid and gives a really great shave.</li>
    <li> It works very well and the sideburn trimmer works great!</li>
    <li> Gift for my dad. He was happy</li>
    <li> For the price you simply aren&#x27;t going to get an electric razor as good as this. Of course the shave is not quite as close as you get with a straight razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected, and the shave is still pretty close. Batteries last a long time. Easy to clean.  Able to target those hard to reach spots on your face. A good, solid buy.</li>
    <li> excellet, I use it very well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t press so hard and it&#x27;ll cut.  But it makes a mess of the shavings; all over your shirt.  The razor doesn&#x27;t really hold them well at all.  But it cuts well, and its inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Really like this razor. Good battery life. My only real coping is it&#x27;s bit tricky under the nose and around the lips but gives a nice shave. Probably the best electric value out there for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave but makes a bit of a mess which is the only draw back I see.  Charge and discharge times are good.</li>
    <li> Quite noisy and my rotary gives a closer more comfortable shave and costs less</li>
    <li> This razor has been owned from Oct - March.  It died.  That&#x27;s about 5 months.  I&#x27;ve had other electric razors that last years.  For this reason it&#x27;s only 2 stars.  Towards the end it got jammed and clearing it was done with the pop up trimmer, allowing it to move again.  That was a few weeks before it died completely.&lt;br /&gt;While working I might have given it 3-4 stars, it pulled at hairs more than I&#x27;m used to, but did a decent job of shaving otherwise.  It was great it getting longer hairs due to the middle clipper part.</li>
    <li> This Remington F5-5800 works as expected, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have owned a number of  Remington shavers over a 60 year period.  This model F5-5800 gives a very close shave and is easy to use and clean. It is definately a good buy!</li>
    <li> A mixed review.  It cut just fine But after 5 months 3 cutting disks on one cutter and 5 on the other are loose.  It is like eating corn on the cob missing some teeth.  For the warranty you must register the item which I did not.  Going on their website, I found you cannot buy parts for this item.  That makes it a throwaway razor.  They have a good product and I will never buy another.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Been one month.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  I usually shave with a throw-away while in the shower.  However, this razor completes the shaving process as it gets whatever the throw-away misses.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> Performs as described in the company&#x27;s description</li>
    <li> charge last very long, gets the job done fits nicely in my travel bag with other items</li>
    <li> I do not get a close shave with it. It came without a case. It is supposed to follow the contours of the face but I don&#x27;t think it does that very well.</li>
    <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t do the job for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is \\&quot;operator error\\&quot; but I can&#x27;t get this thing to give me a reasonable shave.  I have tried it every which way and followed the instructions on how to use it and I still can&#x27;t get it to give me anything approaching a close shave.  Others have reviewed it highly, so maybe it is me.  It has a 60 day money back guarantee, and I am returning it.</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver, delivers a great shave and a good value.</li>
    <li> best elect shaver I have ever used,quick close shave,quick to recharge.i am very happy with this shaver</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver. Nice shave, easy to clean and seems very well made.  Two reasons I don&#x27;t give it 4-5 stars. The shaver is bulky, but the main reason is, when I shave with the $10.00 Remington battery operated MSC-140 after shaving with the F5, I can hear the MSC-140 cutting stubble. So apparently the F5 is not getting as close.  The reason I bought the F5 is that the foil on MSC-140 kept detaching from the head.</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric shaver I have owned.  The pivot head ensures that I do not receive a close shave.  I have tried to hold the pivot head still, but I cannot.  It keeps moving away from my skin so as not to touch my skin. I&#x27;m thinking of using some duct tape to secure the top so it cannot move (with every curve of my face, chin, etc.).  I have to use this twice a day, and still have hair stubble.  I do not have a thick beard.  Perhaps this is the razor that the male models and stars use to look like they cannot afford to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, this razor is designed for someone with skin as tight as a snare drum head and few angular curves of the skull and jaw bone.  I&#x27;m giving up on this one.  Instead, I&#x27;m going to look for a stationary head (non-pivoting) razor, or back to the old soap and blade.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor.  Works very well and economically priced for a good quality electric razor.</li>
    <li> I bought one when I needed to shave one handed for a while due to shoulder.  Filled that requirement. But doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> It is not like the MS-390. The trimmer is flimsy and on the wrong side.  Hard to take the cover off for cleaning!</li>
    <li> my father in law loves this!</li>
    <li> It is a little large but does the job well.  Easy to clean</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Bought one for me and one for my grandson.  We&#x27;re both pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Remington electric razor since the mid 50&#x27;s.  This is a replacement for my previous rechargeable razor which I had been using for over 5 years.  This one is the best one so far.</li>
    <li> Very nice, easy to clean, charge ladts a long time. Gives a pretty close shave, overall very satisfied with shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have owned since my Ronson razor from a company no longer in existence.  It gives me a close and very smooth shave.  It takes care of long hairs and is quiet.  What a bargain too. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy a Braun when you can get this one from a company headquartered in the U.S. for less.  Buy this razor it is great!</li>
    <li> Great shaver at a great price. I&#x27;ve had lots of Remingtons and this is by far the best one yet! Exceptionally easy to clean, too.</li>
    <li> This model is very quiet, well made and very gentle on the skin. . Only reason why its not a 5 star rating is that I find it a  touch underpowered, which I&#x27;ve noticed ever since Remington introduced the pivoting heads for its shavers. another plus for this model is that the head can be washed. for thirty bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric razor indeed. I have used competitive electric \razors, but nothing compares to the Remington. Nothing!</li>
    <li> The only problem I have Is lining up the head after cleaning it. It is very frustrating at times to it back together</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even take hair off my neck</li>
    <li> Shave is not close enough. I went back to the conventional  razor.</li>
    <li> Works great, long lasting charge.  I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare with except &amp;#34;bag of disposable razors.&amp;#34;  I would prefer the disposables if I could still find single-blade disposables in the drug stores, but the twin and triple blades sent me here, and overall, this is quite satisfactory.  The shave is not quite as smooth as really carefully done fresh-blade shave (not what I was used to), but it is amazing what can be accomplished in a fraction of the time and trouble with the Remington, and how much better the jungle can be kept up with day in, day out.  I&#x27;m about two bags of razors in, so it might be a little soon to evaluate at roughly 15% of the modest purchase price of the Remington, but a smaller model someone else in my household has is still going strong two years after purchase.  I was afraid the Remington wouldn&#x27;t have enough power or it wouldn&#x27;t shave and so far, neither of these concerns show up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Remington&#x27;s for 30 years now and NEVER had a serious problem with any of them. I usually  buy the best and still have the MS-280, MS2-370 &amp; F7790 all working fine except battery on MSs. I tried the Braun 7 series and it was great but cmon at $170 its a ripoff and the pivoting head will not last. This shaver still gives me a close shave but I admit the Braun was about 5% closer but for $170 its not worth it. I see lots of people having problems with the foils here and YOU NEED TO LIGHTEN UP ON THE PRESSURE since it wears out the foil prematurely. Cutters can easily saw through the foil with to much pressure. My first foil wore through in 30 days cause I pushed way to hard on the F7790 but Remington sent me a new one for free. And please these are rock solid units even better than the old ones in some ways. Cmon all four of MY shavers are perfect so whats the problem besides an occasional lemon? I have to admit the Older MS shavers were slightly closer because they had NO Floating Foil which seems to cut LESS CLOSE and the pivoting head is just a gimmick like the competition. Also the Trimmer is hard to position but I rarely use it. Change your foils when it gets bad for a simple $25 at Walmart. And I&#x27;ve got a miserable beard that curls all over so I&#x27;m a tough shave. Still the old razor and soap is still the closest but I&#x27;m not doing that anymore for 10% more.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave, don&#x27;t buy this razor.  I have a normal beard and if we plan to go out&lt;br /&gt;for the evening, I have to shave before we go out.  In my estimation this is a poor product from Remington&lt;br /&gt;Company</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. Works very well and the battery lasts at least for 12 shaves. Easy to clean. I will definitively recommend this product if you prefer electric shavers over regular razor blades.</li>
    <li> Its feels flimsy and the first shave wasn&#x27;t close.</li>
    <li> Solid electric razor, I like it better than the last few Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned and it&#x27;s less complicated to maintain. Holds a charge a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent machine, cuts very fast and super smooth.. I recommended this to my Father, he got it as well and was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Gets a closer shave than I expected, easy to use, long battery life.</li>
    <li> This great..i got clean shave this morning in less than 2 min. It came already fully-charged.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor since my teen years in the late 1950&#x27;s.  Because I needed to be on blood thinners for a few months I switched to this shaver. After a few initial bad shaves during the transition (I remember the same issue from long ago), I have been completely satisfied with my Remington.  I&#x27;m thinking of staying with it even after the initial reason passes. This one is easy to lean and has an excellent trimmer.</li>
    <li> Husband likes the new Remington Razor. He wore the old one completely out.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver, at least for me. Just some history, I have been shaving with electric shavers for 40 years. When I tried using a blade, I would end up with little spots of blood all over my neck and jaw. If I go without shaving for several days, then I might be able to get away with using a blade without too much of a problem. So, I began using an electric and have been happy with most of them. My last electric shaver was a Braun model 5614, dual foil with a center cutter for longer hairs. I have been using it for the last 17 years and have been mostly happy with it but, it is getting old, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as it used to and it will be just a matter of time before I can&#x27;t get blades for it. What I need from an electric shaver is to be able to use it with or without a cord. That way if the battery fails, I can still shave with it. The F5 seems to be the only Remington model with this feature. With the Braun, as soon as the battery charge ran out, I could just plug it in and finish my shave, then leave it plugged in until fully charged. It also need to give a relatively quick and comfortable shave and be reasonably priced. However, when shopping around for another razor, I decided I might want to try another brand. I looked at Brauns but the reviews didn&#x27;t seem to be as good as I would have expected considering the good experience I have had with mine. It seems todays razors don&#x27;t match up to the quality and performance of the older ones. Then, I saw the Remington F5-5800 and saw that it had fairly good reviews and decided to give it a try. So now the review.......    I have been using the Remington for about 6 weeks now. Comparing the Remington to the Braun, I immediately noticed it was a little bigger than the Braun overall and the shaving head was also a little bigger but it still felt comfortable in my hand and I could maneuver it without any problems. The shaver came partially charged but I still followed the instructions and charged it for 24 hours before using it. Using it, it seems to have a pretty powerful motor. If I tried to shave with the braun with 3 days growth, the motor would bog down a little but not with the Remington. It stays at the same rpm&#x27;s no matter what. As with all electric razors I have used, I still have to go over the same area multiple times to get it as close as I can get it, especially around the neck area. It seems that much hasn&#x27;t changed about electric razors over the years. As with any new razor, it takes time for your face to adjust to it. However, after 6 weeks, my face still gets a little sore using this razor. If you look at the attached photos, you can see that the foil head protrudes more and there is more space between the foils and the center cutter than on the Braun. My only conclusion was that since the center cutter was more exposed to the face, it may be scraping the skin more so than the Braun did. The Remington did do a very good job shaving, though and am happy with the results.    I probably got about a dozen shaves, shaving every other day on average before I had to recharge it. It did run out while I was shaving, so I just plugged it in and finished my shave.The Braun would give me maybe 4-5 shaves before the battery went dead. But, after 17 years, I would expect that. The one thing I did notice on the Remington was that it still seemed to run at full rpm right up until the battery went dead. The motor on the braun would slowly fade away until it would finally stop. The Remington only took a few hours to fully charge it. I like the battery indicator lights showing the level of the charge, but noticed it would still give me like 5-6 more shaves even after the bottom red light would be on. The one feature I cannot review is the pop up trimmer. I did not use the trimmer and really have no need for a it since I don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache and I just use a regular blade to trim my sideburns. Cleaning is easy. Just grab the front and back of the shaver foil head where the ridges are with your thumb and forefinger and give a solid pull and it will pop right off. You can either run it under water or use the included brush to clean it. Place the foil head back in place and snap it in and you&#x27;re done.    I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn&#x27;t as comfortable of a shave as my Braun but was acceptable and the shave wasn&#x27;t as quick as I had hoped for but it did a better overall job. If it wasn&#x27;t for those two issues, I would have given it 5 stars. I cannot comment on how long the cutters and foil last but after 6 weeks and probably 17-18 shaves, the shaver still seems to cut as close as it did when it was new, as I would expect it to.    This is just my opinion and results may vary but I can recommend it.    ****EDITED 1/4/15****    After about another month of shaving with this razor, I decided to return it. Having sensitive skin, it was more rough on my skin than my Braun, and I wasn&#x27;t willing to deal with that. Also, a couple of times because the center cutter is more exposed, I could feel it \\&quot;nipping\\&quot; at the edge of my lip. It didn&#x27;t cut the lip but it made me more cautious while shaving around that area. Another thing was with the charge indicator lights. It seems after only a few shaves once the shaver has been fully charged, the indicator lights start to move rather quickly to the last red light, so I was never completely sure how much of a charge it still had. The closeness of the shave was still good, however, and the price is certainly reasonable so I leave the star rating at 4. If Remington can redesign the cutting head so the foils are closer to the center cutter and tweaks the indicator lights so it shows a more accurate indication as to the battery level, I may try this shaver again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and it is easy to use and clena</li>
    <li> No razor burn and very close shave. Better that the Braun and the price is amazing. I have had it a week now and used it every other day and the battery came fully charged and is still running on the same charge. I want to use the charger but cant complain.</li>
    <li> Good use, cheap, I do not know will not affect the warranty.</li>
    <li> This product is every thing that could be asked for. It gives a very good shave not as close as the safety razor that I have been using but very close. The purpose is to assist on reducing water and does as real hot water to clean a razor is not required.</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves it! He likes the straight shaver much better than any other style since he&#x27;s tired of getting his face chewed up, and this was the perfect one.</li>
    <li> Over the past several years, I have used a variety of different foil shavers. One was a Norelco and the rest have been Braun. Therefore, when I was presented with the opportunity to try the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY, I was eager to see how it would work. I have used the razor for over three weeks now and am very pleased with how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver gives a very nice, close shave. I used one Braun shaver for several years, but it never got as close as I would like and I always had to go back over parts of my face (around the chin area) with a regular dry safety razor. I have not had to do that with this Remington electric shaver; it gives me a very clean and smooth shave. I think the reason for this is the way the head of the razor is designed (it has much more bend than other foil razors I have used); there is a great amount of flexibility to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first couple of uses of using a Braun electric razor, my skin was irritated. That was not the case when I first used the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY. There has been no irritation of my skin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is also very easy to clean and requires very little maintenance which is a blessing for me because I often find myself in a rush during the mornings and don’t always have time to clean out the razor properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been very pleased with the REMINGTON F5-5800A RECHARGEABLE FOIL WITH INTERCEPTOR SHAVING TECHNOLOGY. It has been a very good electric razor to use and has now become my go to razor. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a rotary shaver that always felt like it was ripping my face off. Figuring that was probably the norm for rotary shavers I decided to go back to a foil type shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with foil shavers in the past since, historically, they&#x27;ve been completely unable to trim any hair that isn&#x27;t short stubble. This foil shaver is different though. It&#x27;s got a small trimmer between the two foil segments, and much to my surprise and delight, it actually works. Really well, in fact. Longer hair that&#x27;s missed by the first foil trimmer is clipped by the middle blade, and then caught by the second foil trimmer. That one tiny little addition perfectly solved my main complaint against foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the shave itself, it&#x27;s very close. Probably not as close as an actual blade, but still, very close for an electric shaver. For uneven parts of your face such as your jawline you may have to run it over twice to catch all of the hair, but that&#x27;s pretty standard for electric shavers and not a huge inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, unlike my old rotary shaver it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s ripping off my skin every time I shave, even with longer hair, which is always nice. It&#x27;s also got good battery life and a nice LED battery status indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real annoyance with this is the pop up trimmer which sits at a 90 degree angle to the base. That&#x27;s not really a feature I use though, since I have a dedicated clipper. Still, it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.</li>
    <li> After shaving with this unit for the last month--I find it to be O K but not as close shave as my old Remington that I just Retired---so I just give it an O K rating</li>
    <li> This works very well on sensitive skin. No pulling or scraping or anything. And by sensitive I mean &amp;#34;normally&amp;#34; sensitive as well as for someone with psoriasis. It gives a close and smooth shave and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It works. I had not used an electric shaver for many years, so I thought it was time to give it a try. I also did not want to spend much money. The  Remington has served me well and I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Received this item promptly and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Razor already had a charge on it, which was very convenient.  It shaves my face smooth as glass.&lt;br /&gt;The wife tried it out on various locations and stated it worked as well as her razor but was faster than the whole bath/shower and soap routine.&lt;br /&gt;I is easy to open and clean.  I am please and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, the product is excellent</li>
    <li> The little train that could...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a high-and Phillips electric razor, that costs $300 or so, for some time. Inexplicably, Phillips decided to relegate the production out to China, which we all know produces just such wonderful stuff; communism/socialism at its best! Which is why I guess our current \\&quot;president.\\&quot; who according to the leftist media is the Second Coming, seems to like communism and socialism so much, because it has been shown to work so well! Anyway, Phillips razors have been going downhill for many years, like our country under a socialist president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have psoriasis and need to use an electric razor. I have been using Phillips my whole life. Their replacement heads for the $300 models, and even more, are now useless. They made us pay many hundreds of dollars for the razors, put the production out to a low-life communist nation, which we are turning into ourselves, and now the razor is only good for throwing at batting practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this Remington razor is an amazing surprise. I am getting a better shape with this razor that I ever did with any Phillips razor I ever had, including the $300 model, even before the absurd change of the heads by Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stress only enough that you invest 50 bucks or so and get this razor; I assure you, you will not be disappointed! It takes just a tad of getting used to, but, once you do, it will give you the fastest best shave you&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the strongest reviews I&#x27;ve ever written out of the many hundreds I have. (Check i f you wish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy this razor because I had to save money. It is not hubris. I am merely speaking the truth. I have the funds, and am blessed to have them. I bought it because there was no other choice. I thought I was in for a low-ride. Well, that is not the case. I will never go back to Phillips, and this new razor is my buddy, and unless Remington makes something better, me and my buddy shall stay together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, buy it. And stop watching CNN; they&#x27;re not telling the news anymore; they&#x27;re indoctrinating your brain that un-Godly liberalism and socialism and communism, all the same, are some sort of cure-all for everything, when in fact, have produced nothing but anarchy, mass-bloodshed, and hell-on-earth wherever it has been implemented.t.

    <li> I bought this shaver to replace my 6-year old Remington MicroScreen MS2-280, but this review could apply to all MicroScreen 2 models: MS2-90, MS2-100, MS2-200, MS2-300, and MS2-400 series. If you own any of these models, just throw it out and buy one of these! I&#x27;ll give you 12 reasons why I like this F5 so much:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). The long hair interceptor blade is floating, is located between the 2 foils, and runs full time. It is far better for trimming your beard short enough for the foils to finish the job easily. The MicroScreen long hair cutter is far away from the foils, has to be extended to work, and does a lousy job.&lt;br /&gt;2). The interceptor, cutters, foils, and head are all replaced at the same time. It&#x27;s much easier to replace, and is not that much more expensive than the MicroScreen SP-69 foil &amp; cutter option which is a real pain to change - but you already know that.&lt;br /&gt;3). The battery lasts far longer than any earlier Remington shavers, and I have been using Remington shavers for 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;4). There is a battery fuel gauge which easily shows you how much charge you have left in 20% increments. Previous Remingtons would often become unusable in the middle of a shave, and would need to be recharged to even continue running - I couldn&#x27;t just plug it in and finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;5). The F5 uses a NiMH battery and it is big. The MicroScreen had a small NiCd battery I believe which developed a memory effect quickly, resulting in shorter recharges every month.&lt;br /&gt;6). The handle shape is easy to grip, unlike the MicroScreen which I could only hold with 3-4 fingers like you might hold a wallet.&lt;br /&gt;7). The blade cover snaps on firmly, and is made of flexible black plastic. The MicroScreen cover simply falls off when it touches anything in your suitcase, and is made of hard clear plastic which cracks easily like all previous Remington covers making them useless unless you tape them on.&lt;br /&gt;8). The shaver head pivots forward and backward about 30-40 degrees to keep the cutters square on your face. I didn&#x27;t think this was very important until I used it. Now a big fan of the design.&lt;br /&gt;9). The shaver is about half as noisy as previous shavers. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;10). You can rinse out the clippings by simply pulling the foil holder off and holding the cutter area under the faucet. I prefer however to just tap the shaver on the side of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;11). The shaver can be recharged in 2 hours instead of overnight. Much more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;12). The charger wall wort is 12 volts instead of the 4.5 volts used with the MicroScreens. I&#x27;m not sure if that means the motor is more than twice as powerful, but it seems like it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a hint for a great shave, don&#x27;t use the stinky pre-shaves that cost so much at the grocery store. Go to the 99 cent store and buy a big container of baby powder. The main ingredient is talc which many pre-shave sticks use. Put it on as thick as you want and shave it off. I&#x27;ll bet your single bottle will last for years like mine does, and your wife will love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well but does not give as good a shave as a blade, although it is very close. Also, it takes longer to shave with this than a blade. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my husband. His quit working.</li>
    <li> Good for my elderly dad who didn&#x27;t understand how to use newer electric razors which have circular heads that you need to shave in a circular motion. This is more &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;. Use it up and down like a regular manual razor.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave and the battery line indicators helps a lot.  It auto-shut off when you are charging and already in full bar.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave and a pleasure to use. This is a vast improvement from their older models, which I felt was a very good shaver. I was pleasantly surprised. The lights showing the amount of charge left is an excellent feature. It also charges more rapidly than noted in the instruction book.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  However, the foil cracked and I have an unusable shaver in under 2 months.  I can&#x27;t find a foil replacement without all the blades.  So I have to pay 2/3 the price of a new razor for a new foil.  I can&#x27;t afford to buy on of these every 2 months.</li>
    <li> For less than half the price this razor gives me a better shave than either the Braun or Norelco or Panasonic shavers that I own.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, is minor; it is a bit loud.  The Norelco rotary is almost silent by comparison, but it also gives the worse shave.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave!  The shaver is a little heavy but that would be the only negative.</li>
    <li> cuts &amp; keeps my face clean &amp; happy. I have always used Remington &amp; it is still my favorite shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor for the price.  I bought this for my dad so I don&#x27;t personally use it, but it works great for him.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean. Easy to hold and use, but it is a little bulky. Not a real close shave. My norelco triple foil shaves much closer.</li>
    <li> Oh man. I have only owned 1 off brand shaver. It has been okay, small half inch wide foil and detachable heads. This thing has blown that out of the water. This will power through 3-4 day stubble and I grow hair back fast. Feels great and leaves a smooth shave like I would have with a razor but no cuts or irritation. I have very sensitive skin so this was an incredible purchase.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver, it came into new package. You gotta press against the face to make a perfect cut. Check user maintenance guide</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because its price was about the same as buying new shaving heads for my rotary razor by a well-know manufacturer and because it had a 60 days no questions asked return.  My initial impression was to return it because the shaver is larger than the rotary razor and it did not fit my small hands well.  However, after using it I changed my mind.  Why?  Because it gave such wonderfully close shaves, closer than my previous rotary razor.  The trimmer also works better than those on much more expensive rotary razors that I have used.  I have now discovered a way to hold the razor comfortably.  Since the main purpose of a razor is to shave, I gave it five stars.  One disadvantage in addition to size when compared to rotary shavers is that it takes longer to recharge.</li>
    <li> Do not like this razor as much as my older one..</li>
    <li> My husband is extremely pleased with this shaver. Gives a great shave and charges extremely well. Easy to use. Great product and price was right.</li>
    <li> As electric razors go it&#x27;s pretty good. I have tried other brands and even thought this isn&#x27;t quite as good as a blade it&#x27;s an excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. it is better than any Braun or norelco I&#x27;ve ever had. very powerful and great battery life.</li>
    <li> Good but not perfect, it is much too big to me.</li>
    <li> Have tried several electric razors.  I love this one.  Good cut, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> The head case lost a screw in the 1st week. It started to wobble. Flimsy built.</li>
    <li> It could be I just don&#x27;t like electric razors.  If I were to do it again I&#x27;d try the rotary kind.</li>
    <li> It is much quieter than any previous Remington&#x27;s that I have previously owned, and I have owned several.  I do find that I have to shave twice during the day, although the original shave feels as close as any previous shavers I have used.  Hard to explain&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Very capable shaver. Close, comfortable shave! Priced fairly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larger and heavier than I expected. Holds a charge very well. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It is one of few that works well on African American beards that have a few gray hairs in them. It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery life is long!</li>
    <li> I had been using the same general design of Remmington Shaver for about 20 years. I finally changed the model when I realized that the old one was obsolete. I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I had an older MS-380 (I think) that used to be my fave. But this one is a lot cheaper than it, is noticeably quieter, and gives a closer shave. It does especially well around my adam&#x27;s apple, a problem area with just about every other razor I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the sideburn trimmer. The old model had it pop up near the blades. The way this one pops out makes it very hard to see and line up your sideburns. It&#x27;s not a reason to not get this razor though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts me more than a week (I shave every other day, I&#x27;m lazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other previous razor was a Braun - I&#x27;ve tried Braun twice and didn&#x27;t like it either time. It just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
    <li> Did not last very long.  It was easy to clean, recharged quickly and held a charge fine; but f&#x3D;after tree months it just stopped working.</li>
    <li> my two Braun shavers quit working efficiently so I decided to go inexpensive. this shaver is fast, close and non-irritating. The Brauns never performed this well. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard and have tried electric razors a few times over the years, but have always gone back to wet shaving due to poor performance and leaving my face sore.  I decided to give this a try to see if it could handle my beard.  It advertised that it could handle 3 day&#x27;s growth without problems and that is how I first tried it.  It performed very well.  It left me with a good close shave and my skin did not show any irritation.  I was impressed with how well it did and and now willing to shave with an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean-up was also very simple.  I simply popped off the screen, brushed out the majority of the stubble from the blades, and then rinsed the screen and blades in water.  It was very quick and painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest shaving feel I have ever felt, but on the other hand it doesn&#x27;t cut close.  So what I mean is that it feels like I&#x27;m rubbing plastic over my face, not blades.  But at the end I still feel stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad travel shaver for pleasure trips!  Not to be relied upon for business use!</li>
    <li> I ordered it from Uncle Fuzzy&#x27;s Electronics through Amazon. The box that arrived said F5-5800XLP. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the difference from F5-5800A, extra charging stand? It came fully charged and with a charging stand and I thought there wouldn&#x27;t be one from reading others&#x27; reviews and answers. The short instructions pamphlet was printed for multiple models and showed a different model picture. The cleaning instructions weren&#x27;t that great and referenced a wrong diagram. I wish there was a travel pouch but can&#x27;t beat this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is bigger and runs much quieter than my 10-year old Braun foil shaver. I had purchased and returned a Norelco AT810 rotary. While the AT810 was quieter and usable in the shower (this one can be rinsed clean), it did not shave as well as this product, not even close. This Remington gave a very close shave in only seconds. I have thick strands of hair and I suspect the openings on the AT810 screen couldn&#x27;t pick them up. This does and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have owned every Remington electric shaver since they began making them and this one is the best.  I, particularly, like the greater width of the cutter area, the pivoting feature, the improved pop-up trimmer and the fuel battery fuel gauge.  The price makes it a great value.</li>
    <li> I already have the Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, which is essentially the same as the Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, just with the cleaning system, so I&#x27;m not new to this type of electric razor. I&#x27;m a woman and I suffer from razor burn if I use an actual razor in some areas of my body, so a couple of years ago, my husband bought me the ES8109S to use in my bikini area and my arm pits. So, I was excited to get this one and that it was washable. I would never buy one that couldn&#x27;t be rinsed clean. So, with that being said, this is a great razor, especially at this price point. It is a fraction of the cost of the Panasonic, but functions just as well(minus the waterproof function). The handle is slightly bulkier, but not enough to make it uncomfortable to hold. I had to charge it for a day initially, which is standard with most rechargeable devices, so that was no big deal. After the initial charge, it charges extremely fast, so if you let it die, you can use it plugged in or you can charge it rather quickly without it ruining your morning. The pivot head is great for all of the angles your body or face has. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t use it in the shower, it&#x27;s not a big deal and it isn&#x27;t marketed to be used in the shower, so I&#x27;m not taking off stars for that. This shaves just as close, if not closer than my Panasonic, so I&#x27;ve been using it non-stop since getting it. This is a great little razor and worth trying out.</li>
    <li> This Remington Shaver provides a close and adequate shave.  It has a long battery life.  It seems like I have gotten more than the advertised 60 minutes of battery life.  I have been using it almost every morning since receiving it six weeks ago, and I have yet to need to recharge it.  Lights beside numbers printed on the plastic housing show the battery life remaining.  The pop up trimmer works fine to trim sideburns.  It compares favorably with my more expensive Panasonic ES1803 Wet/Dry Shaver.  This Remington shaves just as well.  On the con side, the Remington is bulkier and heavier; I would not prefer it for travel.  But for a rechargeable shaver to use at home, this is a quality and economical choice.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a new razor that....get this...actually cuts hair. I have bought and returned three shavers over the past two weeks. This shaver is awesome. This item has a great form factor, solid build, feels good in the hand, and cuts great. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this shaver. It has greatly exceeded all expectations. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a really good electric shaver. Provides a very smooth shave, and is quite easy to clean. Outstanding product!</li>
    <li> I tried this shaver and it just plain doesn&#x27;t work well.  I had to go over and over the same area.  Worse shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I thought Remington&#x27;s were supposed to be good?</li>
    <li> Having bought many shavers over the years, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this shaver for the price.  I have an older Braun that I really like and still use when I travel so I know the quality of an expensive electric razor and this razor fits that category.</li>
    <li> At the beginning it used to leave me nice an clean. After using it about 10 times, it takes a lot longer to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! Husband loves it! Fast shipping!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Has done a surprisingly good job for significant other - who had never ever used an electric.  He now shaves daily without complaint.</li>
    <li> Works well, but takes multiple passes to get a clean shave. I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric razors though, maybe this is normal?</li>
    <li> Solid performance. Easy clean. No bells or whistles electric shaver. Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Very good shave (so far).  It does scape at places, but it&#x27;s still very good.</li>
    <li> Smooth cut, works very well and am overall satisfied. My only complaint is the on/off button. It is positioned exactly where I hold it with my thumb right over the button, so I am constantly turning it off during mid shave. This should be &#x27;engineered&#x27; better.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver in 20+ years so I can&#x27;t fairly compare it to other shavers. But heres what I know so far.... it seems well-built, it charges quickly, its shaves close (after several multi-directional passes), its easy to clean, and its comfortable to use. Only time will tell on the reliability but so far after about 4 shaves, I&#x27;m satisfied. I like it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it so much that he uses it everyday. He hates all electric shavers. He is so blown away at how close this gets. His favorite gift I&#x27;ve ever gotten him.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Remington after noting Consumer Reports glowing review of an earlier model as an appropriate holiday gift and have been pleased with it. This model improves on my original to such a degree that I reordered three more. It is quieter, cuts better, has eliminated a rubber on/off switch which had a tendency to crumble and fall off (I managed to repair the original somewhat), and is easier to hold. Obviously, I am very pleased with my purchase--this would make a great holiday gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 and have been using Remingtons since I was 15.  This one is the best yet. Actual shave is on par with all the other microscreen Remingtons with the best improvement being the center sicle-bar type cutter.  This cutter makes sure that you get all those &amp;#34;stragglers&amp;#34; that tend to grow out over half an inch before you see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about buying a rechargeable because I have had them before and they just never held a charge for more than a couple days but this this is like &amp;#34;WOOOOOW&amp;#34;!!!  I charged it once and it was 3 weeks before the last green light went out and the red one came on.  Then it was nearly 2 full weeks before it actually quit running and needed to be recharged. That&#x27;s nearly 6 weeks on one charge!  Granted I have a goate&#x27; and don&#x27;t shave my entire face, but I am also fairly bald headed and use it to clip those front side stragglers too.  All I had to do then is plug in the charger and it immediately started running with plenty power to finish the shave.  Oh and another thing...You won&#x27;t see any drop in power or performance over the entire discharge cycle.  It runs just as fast and powerful on the last day as on the first day you charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Thumbs up on this one!</li>
    <li> Handy and easy to use and clean.  Would recommend use with Williams Lectric Shave or similar lotion.  Much easier to clean than Norelco shaver which alway seems difficult to put back shaving heads and plastic clamp.</li>
    <li> I been using Remington razors since I&#x27;ve been shaving and I replaced my older one with this one although the older one was still working perfectly.  Since I sold the order one I didn&#x27;t have to pay much for the upgrade.  I is a much better razor due to the center cutter for longer hairs a the led meter and some of the other features.  This is a great price even though it&#x27;s five dollar more than the Black Friday price which I paid but it&#x27;s about half the price of any place else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave all the way to the skin often, most of the time I use a trimmer and that&#x27;s good enough.  But when I do need a real shave this works GREAT!  BABY&#x27;S butt smooth, and no razor burn.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over a year now.  If you read my other reviews you will see I have experience with many shaving items. I go back and forth with different shaving devices. This electric shaver has made it&#x27;s was to my top echelon of shaving implements. This shaver is a really nice quality piece of equipment, and for the price Amazon has it selling for now, it&#x27;s a no brainer. Please consider it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is large and the motor is very powerful. The quality of the shave is fantastic.  I have found over the years that the use of a preshave with an electric really enhances the quality of the electric shave. I&#x27;ve used Remington Facesaver and it works great, but you really have to clean your razor afterwards.  I&#x27;ve also used Afta Pre-electric and its a super product.  I&#x27;ve actually found a wonderful way to enhance the shave of this Remington. I take Williams Lectric Shave, pour it in a pump bottle. And spray it on my face. Let it dry and then use this Remington F5 shaver and get a superior shave for very little money.  I have a higher end Norelco which I still like, but even with new blades it does not shave as close as this Remington.  This shaver just mows down the beard once you learn how to run it across your beard in accordance with how your beard grows.  The Remington F-5 and Williams Lectric shave is an inexpensive way to get a super nice shave.</li>
    <li> I am a female that bought this item to shave my lady parts. Have always used electric razors in the past. This is by far the best for the price. I will never buy a women&#x27;s shaver again. Have used the Panasonic ES2216PC most recently before this, which didn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and would start to pull &#x27;ouch&#x27;!! Love that this one shows the battery charge is easy to clean, quickly recharges, and can be used plugged in if needed. Works even if there is extra stubble. No it doesn&#x27;t make you as smooth as razor shaving but I never get ingrown hairs or razor burn with this or nick myself. Have also used the Remington women&#x27;s version of this, didn&#x27;t like it as it would not pick up longer hairs (a couple days worth of stubble)- supper annoying! Read tons of reviews and wanted to purchase a higher end model glad I didn&#x27;t. Besides a lot of the pricy models don&#x27;t have an interceptor shaver which I am assuming would make it harder to shave longer stubble. Bet men would like this too!</li>
    <li> First razor for my teenage son. Easy for him to use, and easy for him to clean.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband due to his sensitive skin. It works great and has helped with his ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> A long time ago, I had a Panasonic foil shaver which I quite liked.  After the foil wore our, I used a Norelco shaver and shaver with blades.  I was not as happy with the other shavers as I was with the foil one, so I started looking for one on Amazon.  I settled on the Remington F5-5800 and hoped I would be happy with it.  After first using it, I was very pleased, even more so than the old Panasonic.  I have had it for a few months now and continue to be pleased with it.  The shave is close and the moving head allows me to get everywhere I want very easily.  I also like the fact that it has a battery, because I don&#x27;t have to bother with a cord getting in the way and it charges quickly enough for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect--just what he wanted!</li>
    <li> My face always likes remmington</li>
    <li> I love this low cost alternative to my old Norelco. A great value.</li>
    <li> Not as close a shave as their older models, but better than my Braun</li>
    <li> A strong tougher motor. Holds a good charge with indicator lights. Mows through a 2 day growth no problem. Great Price!</li>
    <li> Good unit, holds a charge good</li>
    <li> Works great!  Got it for my husband for CHristmas and he LOVES it!  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> i have been a remington user for 60 years, this one is the best yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for less than 3 months and it stopped holding a charge out of the blue. Nothing. Can&#x27;t get it to work. The shave screen also was damaged right out of the box. Pulled on my whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it was just a bad product or a refurb that wasn&#x27;t marked as such.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Remington which was at least 10 years old. I liked that one. I like this one better. It shaves more closely and more quickly,</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave that well at all.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m satisfied with this razor but I don&#x27;t feel it shaves quite as closely as my current Remington Microscreen 3 which is no longer being manufactured.</li>
    <li> Only worked a couple of times, pulled the cover to clean it out and it broke and fell apart</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old one</li>
    <li> close shave, fast re-charge too.</li>
    <li> Do a good job it is perfect for me</li>
    <li> does not give a close shave not happy with product</li>
    <li> Great razor. Trims close.</li>
    <li> Great shaver just should be quieter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it since I unpacked it and it works well enough for the price. I think the head is hard to remove for cleaning. Don&#x27;t know how long that will last. I preferred the older models which used a push latch to release the head.</li>
    <li> Thanks, just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that this is most likely one of the best electric shavers I have used. it is also at a good price which is also affordable to most people.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was very skeptical of getting this electric shaver. Thankfully, a buddy of mine owned an exact same type. I asked him how it performed and how easy it was to use. After a while, I ordered this beast of a shaver to try and see if what he said was true. I was not disappointed by the results.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver comes with the shaver itself, a brush to clean the shaver with, a charger to charge the shaver and a nice little manual. I expected this shaver to come with just the charger and the shaver itself. However, getting the brush to clean it also made it much easier.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy a good shaver, look no further. Just buy it and try it for yourself. You will most likely be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten my monies worth and then-some. Clean close shave with no irritation. I had folliculitis on my neck that never cleared up because it was so irritated by my electric razor (more so shaving with a regular razor). Once I received this it cleared up in just a week. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s. I really didn&#x27;t expect much and thought I would end up returning it. I was surprised with how well this shaves, how smooth, and how fast it does it. This in now my daily shaver, and I save the safety razor ritual for the weekend.</li>
    <li> A must have!! Never knew an electronic razor could get this close. Quick, easy and convenient.</li>
    <li> my 93 year old father uses it with ease. cuts very close!</li>
    <li> AFTER 2-3 TIMES OF SHAVING, THE CUTTER WOULD NOT STAY ON TIGHT !! IT MADE A LAUD NOISE AND YOU WERE &#x27;&#x27; NOT &#x27;&#x27; ABLE TO SHAVE!!!  BOUGHT 2 OF THEM, SAME THING HAPPENS !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is an updated model to the Remington MS2-390 shaver. I have to say it is not much of an update. This shaver does a very good job of getting a close shave. Perhaps the same results as the expensive Braun Series 7 but at a fraction of the cost. However, the only drawback I see in this newer model is with the interceptor or what I will call the middle trimmer. The MS2-390 had a pop up trimmer that was the same length of the foils. Instead of having a trimmer in the middle of the two foils like this model, it would pop up to one of the sides of the foil. This design made it perfect for edging up side burns and trimming longer facial hairs. This model attempts the same concept, that the trimmer in the middle of the foils (interceptor) does the same thing. The difference is when the trimmer was on the side, you could adjust the angle of your razor and comb up those longer hairs to be shaved by the trimmer. With the way this feature is now, you have to always keep your razor at a 90 degree angle so that the interceptor can make contact with your face. With no way to adjust the angle of the interceptor because of the two foils, it misses patches of neck hair.     Regardless of this personal flaw for me. The razor does perform very well. I own a Braun Series 7 and aside from missing the cleaning station, this razor is on par with that razor. So if you are debating about getting a new shaver, try this one first before you lay down some hard earned cash on a Braun Series 7. Just beware if you have facial hair that grows in all directions, you may want to get a fine beard trimmer for those few missing hairs this razor now leaves behind.</li>
    <li> Was really impressed with the performance of this razor. Works great!</li>
    <li> good shaver, solid battery life, GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> Wow this shaver is amazing!! This is the first time I&#x27;m using an electric shaver and I must say this is the absolute best. The hair on my arms and legs is really thin so it easily cuts. But I&#x27;m amazed at how it close of a shave I got even on my girl parts. I highly recommend using the pop up trimmer first because it doesn&#x27;t cut longer hairs. But overall this product has amazed me. Every woman and man should have this.</li>
    <li> Well built, good price, good battery charge life between shaves, decent shaving ability for the price.</li>
    <li> It cuts very well, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my hand as well as my rotary shaver did, &amp; its noisier than my rotary, but I  would get it again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product. My husband love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> My son loves this razor! He was using a much more expensive one that didn&#x27;t work well for him. I bought this after reading&lt;br /&gt;the positive reviews. He loves it. It gives him a very close, clean shave. The price is right for it as well.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco triple header give a much better shave</li>
    <li> Love my new razor so far. I use it if I am in a hurry and need a quick shave before I leave home</li>
    <li> works well, holds a charge and is easy to clean</li>
    <li> pretty good value,easy to clean,battery lasts about a week before recharging is needed,I ordered this because replacement parts are available (Foils,cutters,etc) and not as expensive as norelco parts</li>
    <li> My husband used to have a Remington which he used for many years until the rechargeable battery finally died. This new Remington gives an excellent shave each morning, but he feels the battery does not last as long per charge as on the old model. Our guess is it&#x27;s because this model is smaller and lighter, so it probably holds a smaller battery compared to the old model. Also, the razor inside the F5-5800A seems quite powerful. It gives a pleasant shaving experience, but probably draws a little more power each time. It&#x27;s not really a big deal, so we still feel this is a 5-star electric shaver. The hold is ergonomic and the foils feel smooth and safe. My husband has not got a cut using this shaver, which says something because he&#x27;s a really clumsy guy and he always wakes up too late for a leisurely shave. What else is there to say? This is a high-quality shaver and the shaver head can be rinsed easily.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this razor and bought it to try something other than my old rotary shavers. This shaver leaves me pretty smooth and clean for the day, I do use it with lectric shave and have to say it is an important piece to have in your daily shave routine. I have been using this shaver for about two years and hasnt failed me yet.</li>
    <li> The Remington F5-5800A Rechargeable Shaver offers a good shave and battery life.  I&#x27;ve used prior Remington razors, as well as Braun, Panasonic, and others.  The F5-5800A rates among the top Remington shavers that I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It offers a good shave, but like any shaver I have to go slow and take my time, especially with a tough beard.  Like any shaver or when switching between manual razors and an electric shaver, it&#x27;s always a good idea to give your beard time to adjust.  So while a 60 minute battery life might last some people a long time, it generally lasts me a week or just shy of it.  Still, that&#x27;s good battery life.  The shaver itself is a bit large for my liking and a little awkward to hold in the hand, but you get used to it.  The noise level is on par with most shavers out there, meaning it&#x27;s not really that quiet but it is tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the F5-5800A packs a punch where it matters most:  it offers a good, clean shave.  It&#x27;s not fancy, but it gets the job done in a decent, well rounded package.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  I love the little popout trimmer as I am lazy and don&#x27;t shave often.  I can just pop it out, trim quickly down to stubble, then finish it off easily.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> still new but appears to be everything promised.</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement for my husband&#x27;s old shaver. He loves this one. Close shave without breaking him out and holds a charge for a long time. Great buy, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Gives a close smooth shave for an electric, just let it glide over your face instead of forcing it, don&#x27;t push hard.</li>
    <li> Good: powerful and fast, reasonably close shave, &amp;#34;very long&amp;#34; run time between charges( when the indicator light got down to 1 LED remaining I was able to keep shaving for 15 more times). Good price.&lt;br /&gt;Not so good: bulky, heavy, and a little noisy, not smooth overall. Not easy to get in tight spots.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my brother whom had been shaving with razors his whole life. He loves it.</li>
    <li> have used for about 6 months now --- a good product that does it&#x27;s advertised job.  you will need to get replacement blades/foils though if you use it a lot -- probably at least once per year -- and you need to clean it at least twice a week.  changed to 4 stars --- now 2 1/2 years of use, am now on my 3rd charger -- shaver (after replacing blades) still does a good job but having to replace charger at up to $17 per is a POS and a PITA....</li>
    <li> took a while to get used to it.....face doesn&#x27;t feel as if Ive shaved fully like jsing a blade.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this is a very high and quality product.  When seeing it in person, you&#x27;d expect this to cost 80+ dollars.  The build is strong and durable and doesn&#x27;t have any aspect to it that really feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we all know, when you switch shaving styles, your skin/hair tend not to do well after the first shave with a new style.  However, I did not get this feeling at all.  After years shaving with a razor, when I used this it was smooth and felt even better than shaving with a razor!  No odd bumps or hair pulling that I used to get with a rotary razor back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I did not like is how there&#x27;s a picture of this product sitting on a charging base.  Yet, that is NOT included or mentioned anywhere on the manuals even for a separate purchase.</li>
    <li> I only had this razor for not even one month, and I had been cleaning it every single day to keep it in tip-top working order. Today I noticed it had been running much louder than it had before (like a tiny airplane motor, I&#x27;d compare it to), and I found that strange but did not concern myself too much over it.... that is until I went to clean it out like I normally do. When I removed the case-part of the head to clean the blades, I noticed that the little round blade parts of the blades had three of them loose on them and it was that which was causing the razor to make such a noise. Also, these blade parts had caused me to get terrible cuts when using the razor... which until I noticed the loose (broken?) blades I had chalked up to sensitive skin. Now I know this is the razor&#x27;s doing, and honestly I cannot believe that this device could be so fragile as to have the blades loosen like this after not even that much use (I only even use the thing on three parts of my body at all, and its&#x27; minor stuff to shave)... a razor is supposed to be sturdy and last a long time before anything even similar to this happens. I had an older Remington razor that lasted me ten years (it was a basic two foil razor with no cutter in the middle and one blade section underneath) before one of the round blade parts of the blade loosened... I cannot imagine this new one lasting even one year let alone ten. Very shoddy, I must say! Looks like I&#x27;ll be looking for a new razor. *Sigh*</li>
    <li> Figured this was the best shaver on Amazon for an affordable price due to the good reviews. Unfortunately, this is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. Terrible razor burn, had to go over each area 3-4 times. Awful</li>
    <li> This is the fifth Remington razor I&#x27;ve bought.  Two were atrocious, two models were very good and this model is excellent.  It cuts my beard close to the skin and lifts up beard hairs so the cutters can do their job.  While not a regular razor used with shaving cream this is the next best thing.  It is quiet and efficient.  I tried a lower cost Remington and it was noisy and did not shave close.  I tried a Remington rotary and it was a dismal failure.  The other two twin head razors I had used were very good, but not as good as this one.  I do not experience razor burn and I use gentle pressure with a couple passes to cut my beard.  At its price it is an outstanding value.</li>
    <li> does a good job. Wish I could open it up after rinsing with water and clean the unit.</li>
    <li> the razor arrived as expected and was properly packaged for shipment. It has performed far better than my rotary razor.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Remington F5-5800  on May 20, 2015. Today is July 6, 2015. I removed the product from the charrger, and it will not run at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to purchase  another unit so I will have the box and address to send this 45 day wonder back to Remington. Oh! I will be polite when I tell them what to do with it. As a long time member purchaser from Amazon, this is my first time to have chased a dud.&lt;br /&gt;Cliff</li>
    <li> The Remington F5-5800A features a three stage cutting system – a trimmer sandwiched between two foils.  Each flexes independently.  The neck that supports them also pivots freely.  The razor can be used cordlessly or corded.  Fully charging the battery takes about 120 minutes and it should supply about 60 minutes of power (it’s also supposed to have a 5-minute quick charge capability).  The front of the shaver has the power button and features an LED battery gauge.  The back of the shaver features a pop-up trimmer.  It also comes with a plastic snap-on cover to prevent damage to the foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My prior electric shaver was rotary style.  For some reason, I had an innate fear that foil shavers would pull and be painful.  Happily the Remington F5-5800A has proven that fear was unfounded.  Experimenting with single and multiple days’ growth, I have yet to experience any pulling.  The foil system has also been less irritating to the sensitive areas of my skin.  The closeness of the shave seems average to me.  The results are comparable to all other electric shavers I’ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is well-designed.  It feels substantial yet comfortable in the grip.  It features a broad cutting surface.  The power button and pop-up trimmer are well-positioned for intuitive access.  Cleaning is easy and the removable head can be rinsed off.  I can’t find any fault with the shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy to go from a blade to electric.  I&#x27;m still missing the close shave of a blade, but the doctors say better stay away from sharp blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m have very little facial hair, however enough as to need a daily shave. I bought it to replace the cheap razors I had to buy and were a little tedious for me to use (I was used to shave once every week or so and now I have to do it daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery given the short time it takes for me to shave lasts for a week or more every charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side trimmer works wonders too. Just remember not to share it with anyone and clean it very well after use if you use it for manscaping. I won&#x27;t confirm not deny I&#x27;ve used it for that too. But I heard from a friend it works great there too.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t have to go back over the same surface as many times as many other brands.&lt;br /&gt;-Holds a good charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Pivot and flex technology really does seem to give you a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;-Good price for the quality product you get.&lt;br /&gt;-The pop-up trimmer is one of the best I&#x27;ve used yet.&lt;br /&gt;-Washable design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Seems to get a bit messy very quickly.  Even if its perfectly clean before using, I feel I end up with more stubble on my counter than I have with previous electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;-As with my electric shavers, it will pull hair if you let it get too long.  It just seems like to me this tends to pull a little sooner than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  That may be due to the fact this gives you a closer shave though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had the ability, I would have definitely given this 4.5 stars.  But its not quite perfect, so I have to give it a 4.</li>
    <li> Recommend this razor for snyone! Excellent shave and affordable.</li>
    <li> This replaces an older model Remington MS2-390 I&#x27;ve been using for five years.  The old one had gotten to the point where the battery only held a charge for about two days.  This F5-5800A still uses a NiMH battery, but it seems like it holds a charge for longer (and doesn&#x27;t drain as much idle) than the MS2-390 did.  The battery display is handy for knowing exactly how much power you have left, which I like, because the other one died pretty suddenly when it was low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the foils on this shaver is the &amp;#34;Intercept&amp;#34; central shaver, which actually does improve the shave.  I&#x27;ve had times where you miss a hair one or two days and suddenly it&#x27;s too long for the foil to pick up, this central blade shortens those nicely so the foils can grab them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one part I don&#x27;t like is the detail trimmer.  It seems like most manufacturers like using these flip-up style ones.  You can only use them in one direction otherwise the friction of moving the shaver causes the flipout to close.  The other model MS2-390 had a far superior mechanism - it popped up vertically and was rigid no matter which way you applied it to your face.  That&#x27;s the one thing I miss from the other model.</li>
    <li> It gives a smooth close shave and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product for man todays.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay. mybeard has to be pretty short for it to even cut. looks like it it has a harder time cutting thicker beards.</li>
    <li> Functions as described and as one would expect from an electric razor. Remington is a good brand and the pivot head ensures a more effective shave.</li>
    <li> it does the job but some of their other shavers are better</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned. I used a blade for 35 years and I thought I would try an electric and I&#x27;m so glad I did. No more shaving cream and water. This razor glides so smooth over your face and leaves complete smooth skin. I bought It 2 months ago and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet and the light is still on full chrage. You just run it under the water to clean it and its ready for next time. Trust me this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give me the results I was hoping for.  I bought this to use mostly on my head and thought it would be much closer.  I&#x27;ll more than likely go back to using my Fusion or Hydro 3 for this area.  However, for my face and underneath my neck, it did a fairly good job.</li>
    <li> best shave I&#x27;ve had out of an electric razor...</li>
    <li> I FOUND THE RAZOR EVERYTHING I EXPECTED WHICH WAS EXCELLENT.  GOOD RAZOR THAT DOES A FINE JOB AS IT IS USED CORRECTLY.</li>
    <li> Feels gold while using it thanks!</li>
    <li> UPDATED VERY WELL SINCE MY NOW VERY OLD ONE.SMOOTH SHAVE WITH THE HELP OF THE MOVING HEADS.  ONE TROUBLE. TRIMMER FOR SIDE BURNS IS EXTREMELY SHARP ON THE EDGES AND COULD EASILY CUT YOU IF NOT CAREFUL, ALSO REALLY DOES NOT CUT SIDEBURNS AT ALL. DID ANYONE ACTUALLY TEST IT BEFORE PUTTING IT ON SALE.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT IT FOR MY WIFE. IT&#x27;S A MZNS RAZOR. SENT IT BACK.</li>
    <li> It takes long time to shave and get the job done!</li>
    <li> Have had two of these since last June. Both just died in the middle of a shave. The second one is on it&#x27;s way back to Remington now. They shave well when they are working, but I don&#x27;t think I could recommend these.</li>
    <li> Very happy so far, 10 days, I think its a closer shave than my old Norelco. Easier to clean than the rotary shaver. After 10 days the charge is at 80% so it looks like it will hold a charge for a couple of weeks of daily use. The large shaving head makes for a quick shave and I would say about twice as fast as the rotary it replaced. I have used Norelco since 1969 and this is my first Remington shaver. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to Norelco again unless some thing changes with this one.</li>
    <li> Great product.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband and he LOVES it!  It gives him a perfect shave.</li>
    <li> Great shave for a reasonably priced electric shaver. Great value!</li>
    <li> Works very well and gets the job done</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy with this product.  It does what he wants it to do, which is to give him a clean shave around his beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> Nice razor for the price. It gives a quick close shave and charges up quickly, I would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Good Price for a Good Item &amp; prompt delivery time.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price!!</li>
    <li> Nice but not close enough save.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have coarse hair.  It works better as a daily shaver than when you wait to long.  The charge lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for about 3 weeks.  It takes that long for my beard to adjust to a new shaver.  This is a no-frills shaver and I have been very happy with the results!  The battery life is not quite as long as a Braun that I was replacing, but I still get 7-10 days out of a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $30 for this on Amazon.  That is less than just getting the battery in my overpriced Braun replaced.  This same shaver with a &amp;#34;charging base&amp;#34; was over $120 at a discount department store.  I don&#x27;t want a shaving base sitting on the vanity all the time anyway.  The charging cord only is all that I need.  Everybody&#x27;s face and beard are different, but this was a great buy for me at $30.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the battery life was a little longer, but as I said, it&#x27;s still very respectable.</li>
    <li> only used regular schick razors, first foil and I won&#x27;t go back, works great, use it everyday</li>
    <li> Checked all of the other reviews before buying , and can say that I&#x27;m extremely happy with my new shaver.For the price, features, and overall design I would definitely recommend it as a smart  purchase.!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great electric razor.  Holds its charge and shaves close.  Easy to use.  N\However, there is no place for the brush to attach to razor.</li>
    <li> Given as a Christmas present.  No issues - just as expected.  Wife enjoyed  the shaving quality when I use it.</li>
    <li> So far, I have been thrilled with this Remington.  I bought this one to replace another as it seemed more cost effective to purchase a new one versus buying a new head for my older one.  I love the shave I receive, as well as the charge that lasts close to a week.  The indicator on the front of the razor is a good gauge for when you need to recharge.</li>
    <li> Great shaver according to my husband</li>
    <li> Using this shaver for ~ 2 months. Top pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It shaves very well  if use it 2-3 times a week. Interceptor in the middle of the head removes even long bristle&lt;br /&gt;2. Very affordable. I bought it for 34 at Walmart  but now it&#x27;s 28$ at amazon. Can&#x27;t believe there is a price for such a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;3. easy to clean. I spend half a minute to clean it with a small brush and water. No complex accessories which raise a price&lt;br /&gt;4. I didn&#x27;t buy the replacement parts yet, but previously owned Remington for 3 year. Replacements were cheap&lt;br /&gt;5. shaves very gentle. I used it for genitals and it works well&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Close shave is hard to achieve on my under neck , the rest is ok. I fill my skin is not ideally smooth when shaving not carefully.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great shaver and even greeted price. Outstanding.</li>
    <li> Great performance, especially for the price.  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because my husband has a circular head shaver prior to this one, and preferred it for ease of use and comfort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to make it short and sweet.  I have never had this type electric razor but I must say it gives a really close shave. The battery is great too it lasts a long time. I was eying this and a way more expensive but went for the better deal one and I&#x27;m happy I did. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Its a good shaver, the precision buzzer is a little awkward to use, but once you get used to it, it makes sense. Seriously though, the buzzer is a little weird, I may not have bought this if I understood how it strangely horizontally pops out of the shaver to work.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because it was $55 when I bought it and now it&#x27;s going for $40, but it&#x27;s a good razor nonetheless.  After the initial charge I charged it for the first time just yesterday, more than a month later.  It shaves close, doesn&#x27;t make too much noise, and serves its purpose.  I recommend it.  I haven&#x27;t owned this one for too long, but my last Remington lasted for at least five years and was still working when I decided to replace it (the battery was shot and the blades were dull).</li>
    <li> Works and gets the job done. My honey uses it a lot and keeps him smooth.</li>
    <li> It does a much better job than my old Norelco triple head and at a reasonable price. It&#x27;s kind of big in the hand but is still capable of precision trimming.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and didn&#x27;t have the irritation issue I read from some of the reviews.  It gives me a clean and close shave and I like that you can clean them after use by using the sink to rinse everything off; great feature.  The price was reasonable and thinking about purchasing one for my father as well.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this product. I mean, there&#x27;s a lot TO like: the heft is good, the feel in the hand is good, the power charge indicator is good, the integrated cover is rather brilliant, and the simplicity in cleaning the unit is good. See? Lots of good.  But...the shaving effectiveness is just okay, the bulk makes it difficult to see where the auxiliary trimmer is going to trim, and -- worst of all -- the main shaver doesn&#x27;t catch the shaved hairs very well. That is, it WILL dump the shaved hairs on your shirt (or chest), so be forewarned.  And the instruction booklet (yes, I read it) advises moving the shaver in a circular motion. Right. Like this very linear shaving head has any inclination of moving in a circle. Did the writer even use the product??  Bottom line: it&#x27;s okay, but when it&#x27;s time to replace this, I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere.  ---  Update 21 July: Dropping from 3 to 2 stars. Dropping hairs everywhere for just an okay shave got to be pretty frustrating. On top of that, the darned thing now makes a bunch of clicking sounds while shaving. I ended up getting a Philips Norelco 1150X/46 (how they heck do these marketing people come up with these names??), and am FAR happier with that. A better, quieter shave, with very few dropped hairs. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> If youre like me and have sensitive skin, this is the way to go. I changed from a Phillips Norelco and would never go back. The Remington shaves faster and with less irritation.</li>
    <li> This is what electric shaving should be like - simple, no unnecessary docking stations, just a shaver and a cord. the rechargeable battery inside is a bonus to me, I was just looking for a shaver that didn&#x27;t need a docking station. It shaves well, and has for the past half year (roughly), and gives a nice close cut.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle.  Excellent value for the price. I would purchase it again or give one to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I love it! I use it every day and it only needs charged every month or so. BUY ONE NOW!</li>
    <li> I have been needing a new shaver for awhile,&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I waited to purchase this one!&lt;br /&gt;It give a great close shave.</li>
    <li> This razor is louder and didn&#x27;t do quite as close a shave as I hoped for .  But is is a good value for the money.  I think in the future I will stick with razors that have a rotating blade. They are probably quieter but I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of different razors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to see if it was an improvement over my rotary razor which I had been using for at least 10 years . It gave a reasonably good but noisy shave but unfortunately it tore a piece of skin off my lower lip . Since I am a trumpet player this was an immediate deal breaker and have ordered a Norelco 2D rotary shaver which will not have the same issues . I will not use it again .Hopefully I will find a family member who will want it  but if not it will go to Good Will .</li>
    <li> Product is great on my face and is doing a wonderful job so far. I would recommend the Remington to an man who loves a great shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these, one for my son for Christmas 2013 and one for my husband for his birthday in May 2014. Both men really enjoy this shaver and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Actually my husband loves it.  He bought this model on the recommendation of Remington to replace his broken shaver.  Liked it so much we bought another one for travel.</li>
    <li> Much noisier then most other electric razors I have owned.  Being new I would have expected it to shave closer than it did.  Will keep it but will seek other options next time around.</li>
    <li> Good razor. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I had hoped, but other than that I am happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used rotary razors for years, figuring the price differencial of the foil heads would not be worth what I assumed was only a marginally better shave.  When I was ready for a new razor I saw the good reviews for this one and the very reasonable price, so I decided to try a foil just to see if it was better.  I&#x27;m glad I did, and I will never go back to rotary.  I had assumed (again wrongly) that electric razors just couldn&#x27;t ever get as close as a blade.  The F5 doesn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t 100% perfect, but it is close enough to a blade for just about everything but weddings and job interviews.  Easy to clean, too.  This is my new standard from now on.</li>
    <li> The best mid-priced shaver to date for me.  Trimmers work well and easy to use.  &amp;#34;Stubble&amp;#34; blade seems to get the 3-day growth ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably just too old to accept change but was forced to get an electric because I was having some surgery.  Well I&#x27;m back with my traditional razor now and the closeness of the shave was simply not comparable. Of the electric was adequate under the circumstances, but barely. Will keep it around for emergencies.</li>
    <li> Unit broke after three shaves, just simply stopped and would not charge.  Wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the feel of the shaver, or shave when it did work.</li>
    <li> perfect shavor for beards close and neck too.im barber I use  it every day on costumers.it works realy good and cleans close to skin</li>
    <li> This shaver is comfortable and shaves very close.  Doesn&#x27;t leave that scratchy feeling that rotary shavers leave.  Very reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNE3KQ to test and compare. They both have basically identical features. IE: waterproof, battery indicator, popup trimmer, middle blade for longer hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic irritates my skin and misses spots around the jaw and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington doesn&#x27;t irritate, doesn&#x27;t miss any spots, and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun that is 10 years old and still going strong. I bought this to keep in my bag while travelling but it never left my bathroom. Terrible quality.</li>
    <li> Remington razors have joined the endless list of products that &amp;#34;used to be&amp;#34;......  The new models are made of cheap plastic components, the blades are smaller (surprisingly, they match the blade systems of the lousy Panasonic razors) and, bottom line, the performance is poor to fair compared to the durable and well designed models of the past. This, in either dry or wet mode.  I would not recommend Remington razors to anyone......And I used them for over twenty five years!  Is there any wonder that the older models, when the occasional one is available for sale, sell for HUNDREDS of dollars!</li>
    <li> it pulled his hairs-painful</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. It replaced an older Remington model that lasted for years, and I imagine this one will be around for a while too.</li>
    <li> Very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a couple of electric razors and these are by far the best.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my father who is in his 80&#x27;s and his old Remington had broken. After using it once he called to tell me how much he loved it. He said it works a lot better than his old one. He loves that he can see how much charge is left in the razor. He is very happy with the purchase, and it arrived sooner than it was estimated to arrive.</li>
    <li> My handsome other half loves this razor.</li>
    <li> am loving this hand held shaving machine,runs smooth low noise and get the job done am impressed and say go get yours guys.</li>
    <li> Should be standard issued military equiptment</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very close shave and no razor burn what so ever. Love the battery gauge letting you know how much time you have left. Cleaning it is a breeze. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby and its exactly what he wanted. Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a second shaver after I use a regular razor as more of a cleanup and smoothing.  It has done well.  It is very powerful.  It still is a bit rough on my neck, so I have to take it easy when cleaning up my neck.  Otherwise, I have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the first razor of this style I ever purchased for my husband...hes always used the Multi head ones in the past. He really prefers this one and says the shave is closer. This has been his favorite one yet. Hopefully it lasts.</li>
    <li> Unit worked well for me (relatively light whiskers) for two uses thus far .  Have to make several passes and from multiple directions (similar to disposal razor), but is quicker than with shaving creme and razor and nick-free.  Unit will work with charger connected (a positive).</li>
    <li> For the first time since I have been growing a beard, and or facial hair, (age 13+) my tough as nails beard et al, has finally met its match! My skin has never felt this smooth after shaving, High Props for the Remington F5-5800 Rechargeable! Very Pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> The razor is doing very well.  It is better than the Panasonic  I have.  The replacement  screen and cutter head was more than I paid for the Remington.  I had a Remington once before and it was good also.  Like the Remington the best.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for decades.  With my wife&#x27;s encouragement, and the reviews I read here, I got this one.  Very pleased. Far better than the electrics of the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.  Still not as close and smooth as a blade, but certainly passable for being out in public.  Trimmer worked great for straight-lining my sideburns.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> So far so good ordered as a gift for my sone he seems to really like it and I believe it is working well for him!</li>
    <li> Best electric razor that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> No misrepresentation of product.  I am shaving my husband as a care giver I did not realize what I needed to be able to do the job easily.  It does not do well in close quarters upper lip and below the nose area.  A.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever used in 50 years!  Way better than Norelco Rotary.</li>
    <li> Perfect razor until just a few weeks of use and it no longer holds a charge. Of course, it is past the 30 day return so...</li>
    <li> its ok but not that great</li>
    <li> Terrific bang for the buck item.&lt;br /&gt;Quality : 4-5 stars, imo&lt;br /&gt;Price - excellent.</li>
    <li> Razor blades too expensive, need secondary method</li>
    <li> This is the second exact shaver I&#x27;ve bought for two different teenagers not wanting to use a blade.  Both are happy with the unit, but they don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to but a blade.  When I need to buy replacement cutters and screens they will work in both units...</li>
    <li> Long battery life, close shave, (for an electric).</li>
    <li> holds a long charge and can be run with the supplied electrical cord. like every other electric razor I have used it takes too many passes to get a really close shave. it is capable, however, of achieving a close shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shaver for a month now, shaving approximately every 2-3 days. I only charged it for a single 24-hour period when I bought it and it is still at 100% light charge, so it seems to last quite a bit. The shaver is easy to use and easy to clean. I say it is a great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR SHAVES SO CLOSE AND SO FAST AND IS NOT VERY NOISY. IT RUNS A LONG TIME  BETWEEN CHARGES . THE PRICE SO SO REASONABLE.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, gets the job done. This shaver is still not comparable to the original Remington Microscreen in regards to closeness and quickness of shave (not having to go over same area many times).</li>
    <li> big disappointment. HAVE A 15 YEAR OLD REMINGTON THAT GIVES A TTER SHAVE</li>
    <li> The shaver does a decent job but it feels like the edges on the ends of the foil are keeping the shave from getting closer. I have to go over the same area several times.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean. Very gentle on my neck. May need to trim down longer hairs first. neck is always trouble. My face is so smooth!</li>
    <li> Great value and fast shipping. Didn&#x27;t want to think about the day when my baby needed to start shaving, but this eased the transition because it is so user friendly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father and he is very happy with it.  He said it gives a great shave and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this shaver is that the flip out trimmer is very clumsy and tries to fold back in when you use it.  Forget about using it to shave the hairs on the back of your neck because it folds up.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He really likes it. He gets a fast, close shave and that&#x27;s why we bought it!</li>
    <li> Satisfied by it&#x27;s performance, long battery life. Impressed by how close the shave was and I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver...must learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> Foils keep popping out, ordered a replacement and hope the new one works</li>
    <li> Works well.  I&#x27;m a rotary guy at heart, and while this shaves well, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get used to the clatter.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, he loves it.  Says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  He says it&#x27;s one of the best razors he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby since he has use of only one hand.  He is very happy with it which of course makes me happy as well.</li>
    <li> I initially switched to a classic safety razor and brush after hearing it raved over on the Internet. However, I found myself taking 15-20 minutes to get a decent shave. With this, I turn it on and within 90 seconds I have the shave I want. Definitely worth the money. Seriously, this makes my life incredibly easier.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try a switch from my rotary Norelco. Price was good. Cons are very loud operation and not all that close of a shave.</li>
    <li> It was great until my husband needed to order new internal, replacement foil/ blades. It was no longer sharp so he thought he would reorder to get it back to par. The cost for replacement foil/blades was more than the initial cost of the razor. Save your money on this one. He went to Walmart bought a basic razor for less than half the cost.</li>
    <li> My kids first shaver, well worth the price. He is extremely happy with it as his first electric shaver!</li>
    <li> Plenty of power to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Works well on stubborn beards.</li>
    <li> I needed a electric razor due to me taking blood thinners due to a heart condition. I could not afford a regular safety razor that I used for past 50 plus years due to possibility of bleeding in case of nicks. I shave everyday and the charge on this holds up to 5 shaves before I notice a power loss. It takes about 1 hr to recharge but I leave it on the charger all the time anyway. It performs for me so can&#x27;t complain at all. Their are better ones but this does what I want and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tis an electric shaver what more can ya say except works reasonably well. I preferred my older Remington shaver but the foils needed changing and are expensive enough to justify a new shaver. Tis the old story of making your money off the blades rather than the shaver except Amazon makes it more and more attractive to just but a &amp;#34;new shaver.&amp;#34;  Only three stars because I can not shave as close to my mustache as I would like and the unit has a proprietary external power supply / battery charger. If the charger dies out goes the shaver.</li>
    <li> Great shaver &amp; economical replacement for my old Remington 310 that is no longer made</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave.  My husband likes the close shave he gets.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well! I use it on my legs and underarms, and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave! Not as close as a regular razor would be, but I don&#x27;t mind because it also doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Appreciate the other reviews in helping me decide on this razor. Only used it twice and very impressed. It even came fully-charged! Gives a shave that brands twice as pricey can&#x27;t deliver. Don&#x27;t waste your money on bells, whistles, and false claims. I have a tough beard and it shaves wonderfully. I really lucked out in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving over 40 years, used rotary and foil electrics as well as safety razors and this is easily the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I bought it 6 months ago and still love it, as a mater of fact I&#x27;m getting another one to give my Dad for Father&#x27;s Day (he borrowed mine and also said it the best he&#x27;s ever used).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as i would like,  Otherwise OK</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver better than my last one because it does a really good job and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot a million times. Two minor shortcomings is that it is very loud and does not collect much of the hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a little over a month now and am most pleased with its performance.  Ergonomically it fits comfortably in your hand.  The motor is quiet and the shave is almost as close to a blade as can be.  I have used both and have a medium coarse beard.  I find no irritation at all, even in the sensitive neck areas.  I even use alcohol as an aftershave and have no burn from it.  It shaves quickly and smoothly with no pulling.  The shaver holds its charge very well and recharges quickly.  I clean it after every shave and alternate between washing the blades under running water, and just brushing it out with the enclosed brush.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to find something to criticize I would say that the pop up trimmer may feel a bit flimsy, but if you hold your finger gently over it as it pops up, you will be just fine.  The trimmer works well and is easy to get used to even though it is on the back side of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I have had Remingtons before and always found them to be quality products.  I would most definitely recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington Foil Shavers over the past 20 years and I typically buy a new Remington model every 3 years or so.  Out of all the Remington shavers I have used to date, this F5-5800 model in particular has given me the best overall shave and in the shortest amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is even better than some of the more expensive Remington foil shavers I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a very long time and I have the confidence to bring this shaver with me on a week long vacation without even bringing the charging plug.  Also the clean up is very easy.  Definitely a great shaver for the price point, in fact I would have been willing to pay a little more for this model now that I know how well it performs!</li>
    <li> The previous 3 head model was better. They took out the middle foil head and replaced it with a cutter bar for longer stray hairs. It works for that purpose, however that bar catches on the lips and chin and can hurt somewhat. Rapid re-charge. Overall a good shaver but you have to be very careful in shaving around your mouth and chin. I hope they bring back the 3 head.</li>
    <li> The razor has a limited 2 yr warranty. I&#x27;ve had many Remington razors, all gave very good shaves. The biggest problem with any of them was short foil life. Over the years it seemed like battery life kept diminishing but was still fairly good with my last razor. With all previous razors the batteries were the first thing to fail after a few years and then I just bought a new razor. That was until I got the new F-5800 with black diamond head. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a year, it gave a great shave. I charged it and maintained it exactly as the instructions said but after only a few months the battery started holding less of a charge until, recently, it wouldn&#x27;t even get through one shave without going dead. The razor still works well when plugged in and running off of AC but the batteries are dead. I expect batteries to last at least several years not less than one. I would have given it a rating of 1 star BUT it still works well on AC so gave it 2 stars. Is it worth trying to get a replacement from Remington for a $50 razor, maybe not.</li>
    <li> At the time I purchased this, I was looking for a blade and cutter replacement for my F4900 model. When I saw this and did the math,&lt;br /&gt;I not only got  new blades and cutter but a new razor with desirable new features for an additional $19. As for the razor, I prefer it over my $180 Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Smooth cutting but is loud. Also thought from the picture that this had cordless charging but no, I still have to plug it in.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s old shaver wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job at all.  This one is fantastic!  He doesn&#x27;t have to re-shave with a razor to get a really close shave.</li>
    <li> Have the razor for about a month. Seems to work as advertised. Holds its charge. Took me nearly 5 weeks to get the razor. Amazon outsourced the order to the manufacturer and hence the long delivery time with no ownership by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this razor would work for me. I have sensitive skin and have tried numerous razors in search of something that doesn&#x27;t leave me broken out. I tried using this razor for nearly a month before I finally gave up. I even watched tutorials on how to use it properly. Unfortunately, it still left me with a razor burn. I&#x27;ve settled for shaving with my beard trimmer for now.</li>
    <li> This is the second one we have bought for use in our vacation home. Love it.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> Got it for my father, he loves it.</li>
    <li> Not good. Does not shave. As well as my last two Remington shavers</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive neck skin and when i use a conventional 3-5 bladed shaver my neck always gets razor bumps no matter what i do.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has answer my prayers and allows me to shave daily or every other day without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem i have with it is the fact that one of the two screws that holds the pivot head to the handle apparently became loose and has been lost down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone else experienced this issue?&lt;br /&gt;And if so, where did you get a replacement screw?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have looked everywhere and cannot find one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this shaver exceeded my expectation and i would definitely purchase again, and i may need to shortly if i cannot find somewhere that sells the replacement pivot head screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best shavers i have seen for the price.</li>
    <li> Husband very pleased with shaver. Had been looking for quite awhile before we found this one. Great shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last that long as the screens on top got holes in them and then the screen costs are practically the cost of a new shaver.  Lasted the elast amount of time ever for a shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my son before Christmas as they had a great price on it.  He really likes it and it works great!  A lot better than the other shavers I bought for him.  So I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to tell anyone to go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> A great replacement for my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Remington !!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 17 y/o son. He likes it and now keeps his face smooth.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Consistent and comfortable shave .</li>
    <li> I am a female with sensitive skin and I bought this about a month ago. I&#x27;ve been using it as a body shaver and I absolutely love it. Where have you been all my life. The stubble is low and you won&#x27;t get the perfectly smooth feeling. But I still like it and I don&#x27;t know why I subjected myself to shaving and waxing for so many years.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly.  I am still getting used to shaving with a foil instead of my old rotary, but the shave is very comfortable and closer than my rotary.</li>
    <li> Pretty meh/almost terrible shave. Does ok at cheeks and chin, but it struggles under the neck or if you have a beard that likes to lie real flat. Maybe some electric shave would help, but I tried all the tricks in the book and still went back to my old electric razor. Also the stubble it left felt really rough even by stubble standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it failed the girlfriend test.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever had. This is my first foil type and I love it. I have always used the three head type and based on the reviews thought I would give this a try. Glad I did.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Purchased for myself(lady) because of reviews. Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Got this for my legs because I&#x27;m having back surgery.  Love that it has charge indicator lights!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use &amp; clean!</li>
    <li> Got it for me, but husband confiscated it a loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s handy, a little bulky for  a hand-held device and doesn&#x27;t shave very closely. All in all it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
    <li> I like it but I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it&#x27;s doing what I want and saving me a little time</li>
    <li> poor product, Not a good shave</li>
    <li> I was using an old razor and about to have to buy blades and this one reduced in price and I had a gift certificate so I got it for very little out-of-pocket. I love it. I feel it gives me a clean shave, it is kind of large and light so it is easy to grip and hold on to and use. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Takes a week or two to get to learn to use this correctly and then see how nice it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I bought this.  A great step up from the last Remington I bought (which I was also very happy with).</li>
    <li> Good razor, I use it mostly to touch up after shaving with a razor and it works well for this purpose. Holds a charge extremely well, I&#x27;ve had it for months and only charged it once or twice. I don&#x27;t use it daily, but I find this to be a big positive.</li>
    <li> It does not provide a very close shave as it states.  I have used the Remington F5790 for the past couple years and it provides an excellent shave.  I guess I will stick with my current shaver until it breaks.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and razor irritation is a great issue for me. I bought this electric razor with the hope that it would help alleviate the irritation and bumps that I receive when shaving with a regular razor. My skin has definitely improved from using this shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave. I am not  impressed with the shaving quality, but it is a good value for the price. Just don&#x27;t expect to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought an electric shaver because I don&#x27;t like the consumable model of the blade razors....and I don&#x27;t like the mess.  However, I&#x27;ve come to understand that I need to expect that there is an expensive consumable in replacing the foils on this type of shaver.  After only 6 months, I need to replace the foil at the cost of about $20, or half the price of the shaver.  When I wrote to Remington to ask if the foil was covered under the warranty, they explained that it was not, however, offered to send me a one-time COMPLEMENTARY replacement foil.  They responded on the very next business day and continued to respond to my email questions that same day.  I am very impressed with their customer service!&lt;br /&gt;I believe my next shaver will be a rotary blade shaver, but this one works very well for now.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR FOR THE MONEY</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like electric razors, But I have cancer in the jaw and the stick razors hurt. So for the price it&#x27;s pretty good as electrics&lt;br /&gt;go.</li>
    <li> Very impressive over my old foil shaver.</li>
    <li> I have owned numerous electric shavers in the past. Usually they cannot come close to the shave you get with a safety razor. Knowing I would be without access to water or a mirror for several weeks I purchased this electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for two weeks straight and the battery is still fully charged. The shave is as close if not closer than what you can achieve with a bic disposable without the discomfort of cutting yourself. The build quality is exceptional and cleaning the shaver is very simple. I expect to use this shaver for several years without issue.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price.  Charges quick and gives me a good shave.</li>
    <li> Bought the shaver for my husband.  Shaver was fine, but foil and cutter lasted only 38 days, 8 days too late for a satisfaction refund, and foil and cutter is not covered under 2 year warranty.  Cost of new foil and cutter that is supposed to last 6 months is more than half the cost of the shaver!  Guess I&#x27;ll be looking for another shaver.</li>
    <li> I am just buying a second one. The first one I had lasted me over two years of continuous use. Amazing razor, hard to believe it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
    <li> Works just fine  Second of this model I&#x27;ve had and am pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Ok, for when my beard&#x27;s too long for a real razor, but no substitute for blade shaving.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves his new shaver. It gives a nice clean shave. The only negative is the location of the trimmer. But he rarely uses that feature.</li>
    <li> The shaver aspect is fine, but comparatively noisy.  The trimmer is close to useless.  If you need to trim a mustache, beard or sideburns, forget this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver, and can go more than a week before I need to recharge it.  The only thing I would quibble about is that the sideburns trimmer should be wider.</li>
    <li> Works great for my husband as a quick and efficient shaver.</li>
    <li> Unlike other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried, this actually gives me a shave. I have a nasty beard. For a quick touch-up on the face this is perfect. I also shave my head and this can even do that. True, not like a blade, but still darn good. The charge lasts a long time too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The shaver is every thin I expect and more, it shave me close and quick click. Cleaning the shaver is easier than the instruction said just by tapping the it on the sick all the clipping fol of.</li>
    <li> Does not give a close shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance, low maintenance, legendary Remington quality. Do it!</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have owned. Been shaving for 40 yrs and always use a Remington, and this one is way better than the last Remington MS3-390 which costs 5x more money.  Shaves close, fast, battery lasts me more than a week.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this outstanding shaver!!!</li>
    <li> Does feel a little on the cheap side, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Can&#x27;t imagine that the much more expensive shavers are worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> This shaver falls timber. . I really enjoy it..</li>
    <li> Great price! Great battery life. Great performance!</li>
    <li> Gets a close shave with no pulling or nicking, The battery on this device is amazing. Easy to clean, everything as described 5 star&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! It&#x27;s filling in for my Braun 790CC, which is under repair with Braun. The Braun truly has not worn well, and is quite pricey just to keep it in good shape. The Remington gives me a closer shave and seems to be better made than my pricey Braun! I&#x27;ll be purchasing replacement blades from you in another few months! The moral of this case is that there is not a direct relation between the money spent and the overall quality of the product! Congrats to Remington!</li>
    <li> This razor replaced an electric razor I had for 10 years. I feel this razor does a better job, but that may not be a fair comparison due to my other razors performance surely having degraded over the years. I can however say this razor doesn&#x27;t have the same build quality and I doubt I will get 10 years of use from this, but it was much cheaper in price. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering buying razors as much as 5x as much and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. This works really well for me and I&#x27;m sure I would have been less thrilled with something that I paid much more for that only gave me a slightly better shave.</li>
    <li> This Remington holds a charge longer than the last model I had. It gives a reasonably close shave if I use Lectric Shave bit not as close without. If the blades and screens last as long as the previous model I will give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Its worth of money I paid.</li>
    <li> After having owned my last electric razor for nearly two-thirds of a decade before the rechargeable battery was completely unable to hold a charge, I caved in and bought this as a replacement, having no real previous experience with the brand (I got it because it was on sale). I&#x27;m extremely glad I did. It came fully charged and is still at 90% charge after over a week of daily usage. It gives me a much nicer, cleaner shave than my old razor and feels much smoother and nicer against my skin, to the point that I just use it dry. (Not recommended for everyone, your results may vary.) I&#x27;m honestly no expert on these, as I&#x27;ve owned a grand total of four so far, but this is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve owned of the four, to the point that I&#x27;ll strongly consider the brand again when it comes time to replace it.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a birthday gift to my husband and he is very pleased with it.  True it isn&#x27;t as close of shave his regular method, but close enough to keep him a happy camper and using it every day.</li>
    <li> Best foil shaver yet. I&#x27;ve tried Braun and Panasonic for the past few years and with both, before it&#x27;s even time for new blades I&#x27;m ready to try a new razor. This Remington cuts closer, faster, with very little irritation (especially with shave stick) and holds a great charge. I like that it can be used in the shower, or while plugged in if need be. The only negative I can think of is that the top of the razor is rather bulky, although it still fits in my hand fine. Since I don&#x27;t like taking a chance on a real pricy razor I was thrilled to find one this good at 1/4 of the price!</li>
    <li> Pretty good electric shaver for the price. I own two other electric shavers that I have not been completely happy. with. One is a very cheap Remington that I bought after forgetting mine while on vacation. The other is an expensive Braun. Both are only a couple of years old. This one I bought recently shaves closer than either of the other two. The Braun I have shaves pretty close, but has problems with longer whiskers and takes about 3 times as long to shave with because of the weak motor. The cheap Remington shaves faster, but tends to miss whiskers under the jaw line and other curved areas. This new one is fast, and normally doesn&#x27;t miss any whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons: It&#x27;s pretty large, which is good but also makes it more difficult to use on smaller areas than need to be shaved such as the mustache area (I don&#x27;t have a mustache). Plus, it&#x27;s VERY rough on the mustache area, I mean to the point of being uncomfortable and almost hurting. While this shaver is also much better at cutting whiskers if you have a couple of days of beard growth, if you have more than that it tends to pull them instead of cut them which hurts quite a bit. I had about 4 days growth and after trying to use this one I wound up using a cheap trimmer to cut my whiskers closer to the face, and then was able to use this one with little discomfort. But as I said, it shaves extremely close for an electric razor. It still leaves me wondering though if I&#x27;ve found the best combination yet of low price and quality.</li>
    <li> For the first time I shaved every whisker on my face with an electric razor!  I&#x27;ve used every overpriced Braun and Remington with every gimmick you can imagine.  Not only were they all broken within a year or two, but they did not get the job done.  Thi razor even shaves my neck, and I think I am ready to fully transition away from using a blade.  My beard is pretty thick, and my whiskers are medium thick if that helps you, but for the price, I am thinking to order another as a backup!  Thanks Remington for this game changer!</li>
    <li> ok shave, not close shave like my old one.</li>
    <li> I was wavering between this model and the panasonic in the same price range, after reading Philip&#x27;s review of his January 4, 2014 purchase of this model, sealed the deal for me. Everything Philip said is true and i agree with what he said, now that i&#x27;ve had this shaver over a few weeks. Also wanted to add that i use this very shaver on my head where i still grow some hair, closest shave so far! Would i recommend this shaver? Yes, no doubt.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a Norelco Triple Header I&#x27;d had for many years. It&#x27;s motor seems much more powerful and it&#x27;s battery charge lasts a long time and the charge remaining is indicated with lights on the handle. It comes apart for cleaning easily enough but the exposed cutters seem so delicate compared to the Norelco that I&#x27;ll only clean it with canned air duster. The one time I tried the recommended monthly cleaning with a drop of liquid soap it didn&#x27;t turn out well. And it can&#x27;t be run out of the wall.  The shave, which should have worked itself out by now, isn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d expected and it takes a much longer time to get done than I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s now 10 weeks on this shaver and the shave isn&#x27;t close enough. Also, keeping both cutters on my face is an ergonomic problem. So, I ordered the $29.95 Phillips-Norelco and got it yesterday and charged it last night. It blew this Remington away.</li>
    <li> great shaver,  gives me a close shave and easy to clean, no problems</li>
    <li> Other buyers reviews were sole reason for purchase. Pleased with this shaver so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor and the price is a definite plus. It shaves close enough to leave your skin smooth but not so close that it  will cause hairs to become ingrown which is normally a huge problem for me around the neck region. The addition of the center trimmer for longer hairs was a smart upgrade from the last model being that foil razors usually come up short when it comes to shaving anything older than 2 day growth. This model only really suffers from one flaw and that&#x27;s the pivoting head. It&#x27;s large and bulky and only &amp;#34;pivots&amp;#34; when you grasp it with your hand and forcefully move it back and forth. It doesn&#x27;t come close at all to pivoting on my face. If remington were to go back to the non pivoting head like the older M series that would make them more compact, practical and lets face it......less goofy looking.</li>
    <li> Based on the plethora of positive reviews, I was excited to give the F5 foil razor a twirl. I noticed right away that the razor came in &amp;#34;frustration-free&amp;#34; packaging, so you would not have to cut open the plastic that contained the razor. I didn&#x27;t give this a second thought until I went to plug in the razor as per the Use and Care Guide that accompanied the razor instructed me to do so for a full 24 hours. I plugged it in and started to shave away at my 2 day patchy stubble. I noticed I had to go over my face multiple times for the razor to pick up my fine, thin facial hair. I thought I&#x27;d just keep going and move on to the neck region where my hair is thickest (damn you genetics). I did exactly as the user guide instructed, stretching out the skin and moving the razor in small circles, as it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out how to use a foil razor. 30 minutes went by of me passing over and over again with minimal hair being removed. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, and looked down to see if the razor just needed to be full charged before using, and sure enough the razor had already been fully charged and had been from the git-go. It suddenly dawned on me that I had been using a razor that somebody else had already used and returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the reviews of the product again, to see if anybody else had had this problem and noticed a trend: newer reviews were almost all 1 star and had something wrong with the product. I&#x27;m pretty sure I got one of those disgruntled customer&#x27;s used razor and I hope when I return this that none of you get the identical product I am returning. This product does not deserve the 1 star I obliged to give.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Says it does a wonderful job of catching the stray hairs that some how avoided his old shaver.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about purchasing this device but I have been pleased with this purchase and would buy another one from Remington.</li>
    <li> Great. Gives  close shave without pulling the hair or causing razor burns. It used to be that if I didn&#x27;t shave for a day, using a shaver would surely result in razor burns on my neck (and painful pulling). This razor creates a very smooth shave even when I&#x27;ve had a couple of days of growth without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem is that it doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair it cuts, so you will end up with some stubble on the sink when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> Great value for a shaver.  Have been happy with Remington products for many years.</li>
    <li> It works great. I needed one (shaver) for a sensitive skin AND for someone on Heavy Coumadin this shaver is perfect , so far ...</li>
    <li> really a bad not good shaver...</li>
    <li> Very good product, great for the money !!</li>
    <li> This is the best Remington electric shaver I have used, and I&#x27;ve had several for over 40 years now.  It cuts very well and quickly regardless of one or multiple day growth being cut, recharges quickly, and cleans easily. I hope my next (when this eventually wears out) does as well.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have to say I got a lot more from this razor than I had expected. The shave is close. Easy to clean. Holds a charge for a couple weeks and longer. I really like this razor. Cuts like a way more expensive one does. I am glad I bought it. Cannot go wrong with Remington!</li>
    <li> This has been a great razor for me. Smooth shave every time, great replacement for my previous razor.</li>
    <li> my husband says this was a great gift and they work very nice.</li>
    <li> My son bought this and LOVES it!</li>
    <li> The cleaning &amp; charging instructions are very weak. They both need more detail. Remington F5-5800Rechargeable Foil with Interceptor Shaving Technology.</li>
    <li> In all my 50 years of shaving with everything from a single straight razor honed on a leather strop to the 5 blade, extraordinarily expensive cartridges and numerous electric shavers..I will HONESTLY and UNEQUIVOCALLY state that this is by far THE BEST shave I have ever gotten in my entire life. I am not going into the specifications of this Remington Shaver...read them elsewhere...but if you want the most comfort, close shave BUY THIS shaver and rejoice in the money you saved.  My wife says that she has NEVER felt my face smoother and there is NO IRRITATION.&lt;br /&gt;Guys...No baloney... I actually look forward to my morning shave now.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, an incredible device that went far beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and if I could...I would give this Remington Shaver an additional 5 starts for being one of my life&#x27;s rewards.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this for my husband&#x27;s Christmas gift. It works great and he loves it! There&#x27;s nothing sexier than a well groomed beard!</li>
