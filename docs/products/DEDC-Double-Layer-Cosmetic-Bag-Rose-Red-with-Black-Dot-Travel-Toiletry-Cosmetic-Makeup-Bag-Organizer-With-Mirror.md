    <li> Slightly larger in size than a standard paperback book, this small case can hold a lot. :-) Keeps things organized very well. I&#x27;m using this for stage makeup, but am considering another as a travel case for my everyday items, toothbrush, etc for overnight trips.</li>
    <li> The zipper on top keeps getting stuck, but other than that I&#x27;m loving my bag.</li>
    <li> I DIDN&#x27;T SEE THE SIZE OF THIS ITEM.  I THOUGHT IT WAS LARGER</li>
    <li> Got for my daughter who is 1u. She loved. I have too much make up but definable worth the small amount! Very cute</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Got it today!! Love it and tons of room for the size!! Will order again from thou this company!!</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought it would be but it&#x27;s pretty cool</li>
    <li> love this item.  it was big enough to hold my makeup that i apply on daily basis. the bottom holds my foundation and powder while the top hold everything else.  there are holders to hold your pencils or eyeliner or mascara</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture provided. It looks a little bit smaller than the picture and the pink color isn&#x27;t as bright it&#x27;s more like a dark hot magenta. For what you pay it&#x27;s really a great little bag. My husband is a truck driver and we pretty much live over the road and this little bag holds a lot more than you would think. I think the bottom compartment is about 4 inches tall and the top compartment is about 3 inches tall. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it, fits everything I use weekly.</li>
    <li> I actually am using this as a knitting bag. It works great!! It hold all my DPN&#x27;s, scissors, yarn needles, stitch counters, tape measure, etc.... I can even fit a small project in the bottom section, like a sock project with yarn or a small stuffed animal.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had thought of this a lot sooner, hehe.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very cute! And it fits all my makeup in it comfortably</li>
    <li> I bought this for my makeup and when I received it it was small so I put my makeup in there and the sides collapsed i think This would be good for a little girl and her play makeup or something that is light weight.</li>
    <li> i gave it 4 stars because i haven&#x27;t used it yet-i&#x27;m going to use it for camping in our RV.  it looked very small but popped open much bigger and i think it will hold everything i need.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, and I expected it to be a little big bigger, but it&#x27;s really cute and comes in handy. It even comes with a little mirror inside.</li>
    <li> Perfect for holding just what I need for my morning rush!</li>
    <li> Fantastic! As other reviewers are saying it&#x27;s small, has soft sides. But who cares! For the price it&#x27;s a great little cosmetic bag with enough room for my brushes being separate. I love it! Good packaging, easy open, no smell, true to picture. Thanks!</li>
