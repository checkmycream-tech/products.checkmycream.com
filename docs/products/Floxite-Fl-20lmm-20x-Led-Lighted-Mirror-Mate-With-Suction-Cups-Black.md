### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I found out where to buy another Floxite mirror at a great price !</li>
      <li>By contrast, the Zadro LED15X LED Lighted Spot Makeup Mirror 15X is superb.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for those ultra close up views.</li>
      <li>it works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>BUT THIS IS PERFECT FOR FINDING WHAT IS AILING YOUR EYE.</li>
      <li>I thought would be perfect.</li>
      <li>This mirror is great!  </li>
      <li>wheather if not in my country we don&#x27;t have it, so is very good</li>
      <li>This is a great mirror.</li>
      <li>My wife is happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>THIS MIRROR IS GREAT.  </li>
      <li>EXCELENT MIRROR VERY NICE LIGHTED.  </li>
      <li>This was a good product for the money.</li>
      <li>This is a good one.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a mirror that I could use in applying make-up while traveling and thought the suction cups would allow me to secure the mirror in the best lit area.  </li>
      <li>A good quality mirror finish</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m glad to have a product which helps me do it!</li>
      <li>Mirror is ok............</li>
      <li>I purchased it so i can see better when applying my makeup.</li>
      <li>I have to also look more closely at my skin</li>
      <li>im still glad i bought</li>
      <li>Also bought 15x for sons girlfriend, well satisfied with both.</li>
      <li>I HAD A PIECE OF LINT EASILY SEEN WITH THIS MIRROR</li>
      <li>Too strong to pluck your eyebrows with.  </li>
      <li>This item is unusable, but it was described accurately so I did not return it.</li>
      <li>Floxite produces an image that&#x27;s unclear and upside-down until the mirror is 2 1/2 inches from your face, and the light&#x27;s button falls off.  </li>
      <li>Gives a very distorted reflection so it kind of defeats the purpose for the magnification.  </li>
      <li>Though I don&#x27;t think it quite fair that as I am getting far sighted</li>
      <li>I was excited to find it being a 20x</li>
      <li>My real eyes work better than this.</li>
      <li>This mirror has too much magnification for most purposes.  </li>
      <li>I bought the mirror previously and it worked great until I sat on the mirror portion.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent mirror - it&#x27;s very hard to find a mirror with such high magnification AND a bright light</li>
      <li>the light burned out too fast as well..</li>
      <li>the degree of magnification is terrific and the small light gives a perfect amount of illumination.  </li>
      <li>RIGHT</li>
      <li>The lighted part is fine but the only way it works is to have it on the bottom (as the photo shows) which means the light shines right into your eyes.  </li>
      <li>Because my first one worked so well</li>
      <li>and it magnifies too much to use it for that purpose -- although they advertise it for that use!  </li>
      <li>Love the little light</li>
      <li>I usually put it on a bright  private window and that gives me the light I need.</li>
      <li>It would be great for seeing a dirt speck in your eye or such use but not for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Encounters\\&quot; I was told there is no such product available</li>
      <li>THAT I WAS ABLE TO REMOVE CAREFULLY WITH TWEEZERS.</li>
      <li>and you cannot see much of your face at one time.....</li>
      <li>it also arrived in a reasonable amout of time.</li>
      <li>I get a very blurred image</li>
      <li>You have to be very close to it for focus.  </li>
      <li>It is a little small, but perfect for travel</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT AND EXCELENT SELLER.  </li>
      <li>little guy filled the bill well.  </li>
      <li>I wear glasses but even with my glasses on the mirror has to be held about 1\\&quot; from my face to see clearly.  </li>
      <li>Too bad it&#x27;s a good size.</li>

<li> Too bad it&#x27;s a good size.</li>
<li> however really too small</li>
<li> The light is useful though a little hard to press for long periods as my finger gets tired.</li>
<li> I ordered a 20x mirror with light and received a VERY small 10x no light mirror.  </li>

<li> so it was a waste of money and effort to order this.</li>
<li> wasted money for this.</li>
<li> Though this mirror is truely a 20X, I was disappointed in the diameter of it.  </li>

<li> This mirror is NOT good for putting in your contacts.</li>

<li> Sadly this one is so tough to focus</li>

    <li> I bought the mirror previously and it worked great until I sat on the mirror portion.  Unfortunately, my excessive \\&quot;junk\\&quot; broke it..hurray Amazon comes through for me AGAIN. I found out where to buy another Floxite mirror at a great price !</li>
    <li> This was a good product for the money. It is a little small, but perfect for travel</li>
    <li> This mirror is NOT good for putting in your contacts. You have to get WAAAAY too close (about 2 1/2\\&quot;)  and it magnifies too much to use it for that purpose -- although they advertise it for that use!  A simple LIE on their part!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because I can&#x27;t see as well as I thought I would, maybe because it&#x27;s so small, I don&#x27;t know.  I was excited to find it being a 20x I thought would be perfect. I have a 10x mirror on stand that have had for years so as my eye site decreases I needed something stronger. Also bought 15x for sons girlfriend, well satisfied with both.</li>
    <li> I need all the help I can get, tracking down stray eyebrow hairs!  This mirror is great!  It sticks firmly to my bathroom mirror the degree of magnification is terrific and the small light gives a perfect amount of illumination.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying this to remove eyebrow or other hair, don&#x27;t bother. You&#x27;ll drive yourself crazy trying to see a thing. My real eyes work better than this.</li>
    <li> Mirror is ok............ however really too small and you cannot see much of your face at one time.....the light burned out too fast as well..</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product.  I ordered a 20x mirror with light and received a VERY small 10x no light mirror.  Upon calling the company \\&quot;Beauty Encounters\\&quot; I was told there is no such product available and I could have the one I did receive at a discount or mail it back.  The time and inconvenience involved in dealing with this company is extremely disappointing.  Hardly an apology was made.</li>
    <li> This mirror is too small to work for me.  I was looking for a mirror that I could use in applying make-up while traveling and thought the suction cups would allow me to secure the mirror in the best lit area.  Description by Amazon or the manufacturer that would include the actual size would be helpful.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.  Although this item has 20X magnification, the viewing area is so small, it is hard to focus at all!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mirror - it&#x27;s very hard to find a mirror with such high magnification AND a bright light so you can see what you&#x27;re looking at!</li>
    <li> This mirror has too much magnification for most purposes.  You have to be very close to it for focus.  It would be great for seeing a dirt speck in your eye or such use but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. I purchased it so i can see better when applying my makeup. However; its too close up which makes it hard to see, but im still glad i bought it will use it for other reasons.</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROR IS ACTUALLY TINY.  UNABLE TO USE SINCE YOU NEED TO HOLD IT TWO INCHES FROM YOUR FACE.  I AM SHOCKED AMAZON CARRIES THIS...I COULD HAVE (&amp; HAVE SEEN) THIS ITEM FOR $4.99 ON DRUGSTORE SHELVES.  I FEEL TOTALLY RIPPED-OFF AND IT MAKES ME WARY ABOUT BELIEVING/PURCHASING AMAZON AGAIN.</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROR IS GREAT.  AT TIMES I GET SOMETHING IN MY EYE AND CANNOT SEE WHAT IT IS.  WITH THIS MIRROR I CAN SUCTION IT ON TO MY BATHROOM MIRROR AND GET A BIRDS EYE VIEW AND ALWAYS CAN FIND WHAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM IN MY EYE -  AN EYELASH AND ONE TIME I HAD A PIECE OF LINT EASILY SEEN WITH THIS MIRROR THAT I WAS ABLE TO REMOVE CAREFULLY WITH TWEEZERS. COULD NOT HAVE EVEN ATTEMPTED TO DO THAT WITHOUT THE MAGNIFICATION OF THIS MIRROR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I WILL NOT BE WITHOUT THIS MIRROR. THIS IS A MUST.  MY HUSBAND LOVES TO USE IT ALSO IF HE GETS SOMETHING IN HIS EYE . I DO NOT USE IT FOR APPLYING MAKEUP-  I ALREADY HAVE A 10X LIGHTED FOR THAT - BUT THIS IS PERFECT FOR FINDING WHAT IS AILING YOUR EYE.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace one I left behind in my hotel room in NYC.  Sadly this one is so tough to focus it&#x27;s almost unusable.  I wear glasses but even with my glasses on the mirror has to be held about 1\\&quot; from my face to see clearly.  The lighted part is fine but the only way it works is to have it on the bottom (as the photo shows) which means the light shines right into your eyes.  Because my first one worked so well (a different brand) I was terribly disappointed at the poor quality of this one, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> looking the mirror one day and the mirror popped out. wasted money for this. can&#x27;t recommend this at all no way</li>
    <li> A good quality mirror finish but the suction cups are a little weak for the weight of the product.  It has fallen off the wall mirror twice and has now cracked.</li>
    <li> My wife is happy with the purchase. it works perfectly.  it is as expected.  it also arrived in a reasonable amout of time.</li>
    <li> Gives a very distorted reflection so it kind of defeats the purpose for the magnification.  I get a very blurred image so it was a waste of money and effort to order this.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for those ultra close up views. Though I don&#x27;t think it quite fair that as I am getting far sighted I have to also look more closely at my skin, I&#x27;m glad to have a product which helps me do it! This is a good one. I don&#x27;t leave it attached to the other mirror after I use it as the suction cups at some point will give way and send it crashing to the floor. The light is useful though a little hard to press for long periods as my finger gets tired. I usually put it on a bright  private window and that gives me the light I need.</li>
    <li> EXCELENT MIRROR VERY NICE LIGHTED.  I CAN SEE THINGS THAT I DO NOT WANT TO SEE.  I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT AND EXCELENT SELLER.  RIGHT ON TIME.</li>
    <li> This item is unusable, but it was described accurately so I did not return it.</li>
    <li> Had to figure out how to pull eyelashes that grow inward due to an eyelid injury.&lt;br /&gt;This little guy filled the bill well.  Love the little light</li>
    <li> This mirror is terrible! You can only focus at one location in the mirror and that space is not very big.</li>
    <li> Floxite produces an image that&#x27;s unclear and upside-down until the mirror is 2 1/2 inches from your face, and the light&#x27;s button falls off.  By contrast, the Zadro LED15X LED Lighted Spot Makeup Mirror 15X is superb.</li>
    <li> Can not use it for the reason I bought it for.  Too strong to pluck your eyebrows with.  Too bad it&#x27;s a good size.</li>
    <li> Though this mirror is truely a 20X, I was disappointed in the diameter of it.  The description didn&#x27;t give the diameter, but because of the price, I thought it would be larger.  I purchased it for my mother, as her vision is getting very bad.  She can see in it without her glasses, but only one eye at a time.</li>
    <li> I think It&#x27;s expensive considered the qualify because it&#x60;s better the jerdon. wheather if not in my country we don&#x27;t have it, so is very good</li>
