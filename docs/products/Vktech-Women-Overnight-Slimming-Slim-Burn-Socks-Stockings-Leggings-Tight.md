### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My legs feel great after a 10-12 hour day!</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>These have good quality appearance but the XL wouldn&#x27;t even fit my size 4 friend that I ended up giving them to.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and they were very nice and made it right.</li>
      <li>They hurt at the top of the foot.</li>
      <li>They appear to be able to withhold many machine washing cycles :))</li>
      <li>Without stretching the top, the part your thigh should fit in, you could slip a pop can in and it would fit nicely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s supposed to fit most - but my M-L size didn&#x27;t work with these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a size 4/6 pants (depending on the fit)</li>
      <li>Shipping was great but the one size fits all, only if you are slim.  </li>
      <li>OK these are for already very skinny people!</li>
      <li>As a good point though - they were shipped very quickly - especially considering they came from Asia.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased overall.</li>
      <li>The first time that was all I could do.</li>
      <li>and it would not go any higher.</li>
      <li>the positive side, they are a very pretty color, are soft, ...</li>
      <li>THIS SOCKS ARE MADE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY SLENDER LEGS --- IT STATES ONE SIZE</li>
      <li>And I really wanted them.</li>
      <li>They fit more like a small, but roles down and fits more like knee highs vs thigh high like in the picture.</li>
      <li>The color is cool, but I&#x27;m overall unimpressed.</li>
      <li>I have normal size legs</li>
      <li>Waaaay too tight to fit a real woman</li>
      <li>I have prey small legs and this being a one size fits most product</li>
      <li>I would recommend this merchant but they need to be a little more specific about their product.</li>
      <li>I really wanted something with color especially since it&#x27;s summer</li>
      <li>I could not pull them up all the way, they dug into my legs so much that I had to remove them from above the knee, they work week as circulation type socks, which is why I purchased them to begin with, but having that added bit was what sold me on them.</li>
      <li>There is not enough elasticity in them to stretch much in  ANY direction.  </li>
      <li>I do however have to roll them down to below the knee to keep them from rolling down on their own when I have them pulled up to my thighs.</li>
      <li>The description said this would be uncomfortable the first time you wear it - but it would get better with time.</li>
      <li>they roll down at the top - thereby making a tight constricting ring on your leg.  </li>
      <li>But basically, if you are small enough to fit into these, you don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;slimming&amp;#34; anything to begin with.</li>
      <li>First of all, they roll down</li>
      <li>not long enough</li>

<li> These were made for girls with long, skinny legs.</li>
<li> I work long hours and am always on my feet!</li>
<li> So small my 3 year old couldn&#x27;t even get up her legs.</li>
<li> Size was not as expected. .</li>
<li> There&#x27;s also not a whole lot of compression despite the tight fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I managed to get half up my calf</li>
<li> Much smaller than expected, I&#x27;m unable to use these at all.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this torture device.</li>
<li> They could not fit my legs as all.</li>
<li> Not sure why, but a waste of money.</li>
<li> I hate the normal compression socks because they look like they&#x27;re for old people (no offense, but I&#x27;m early 20s with bad fashion sense as it is).</li>
<li> I tried, just for giggles, to put one on my arm, I got just past my elbow.  </li>
<li> So if you are a size small or tinner go for them for the mediums</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> too small ...</li>
<li> I tried to get past the knee - but it hurt like crazy and then just rolled back down to the knee.</li>
<li> They were hard to get on.</li>
<li> They also don&#x27;t seem that horribly durable, which considering that they are meant for overnight and not regular wear, I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
<li> Extremely tight; it is impossible to wear them; you have to be bones no muscle.</li>
<li> I did that a couple times and then managed to pull it up to my calf before the pain was too bad.</li>
<li> Then I managed to get them up to my knees - but the pain from them at my knee was too bad to continue.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m slightly disappointed.</li>
<li> very disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
<li> Very disappointed!  </li>

    <li> Much smaller than expected, I&#x27;m unable to use these at all. very disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have prey small legs and this being a one size fits most product I could not pull them up all the way, they dug into my legs so much that I had to remove them from above the knee, they work week as circulation type socks, which is why I purchased them to begin with, but having that added bit was what sold me on them. I&#x27;m slightly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Save your money unless you&#x27;re in Jr hi. These have good quality appearance but the XL wouldn&#x27;t even fit my size 4 friend that I ended up giving them to. And I really wanted them. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I HAVE INFORMED THE SELLER THAT THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT FOR ME AND I WANT A REFUND.  THIS SOCKS ARE MADE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY SLENDER LEGS --- IT STATES ONE SIZE FITSALL AND I question this.  They could not fit my legs as all.</li>
    <li> So small my 3 year old couldn&#x27;t even get up her legs. I&#x27;m not a big girl at all I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and weigh 124lbs</li>
    <li> I couldnt even get them over my ancle</li>
    <li> Hurt my foot.  Not sure why, but a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Shipping was great but the one size fits all, only if you are slim.  I would recommend this merchant but they need to be a little more specific about their product.</li>
    <li> The description said this would be uncomfortable the first time you wear it - but it would get better with time. It&#x27;s supposed to fit most - but my M-L size didn&#x27;t work with these. It hurt when it was just on my feet. The first time that was all I could do. I did that a couple times and then managed to pull it up to my calf before the pain was too bad. Then I managed to get them up to my knees - but the pain from them at my knee was too bad to continue. I tried to get past the knee - but it hurt like crazy and then just rolled back down to the knee. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this torture device. As a good point though - they were shipped very quickly - especially considering they came from Asia.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased overall. I do however have to roll them down to below the knee to keep them from rolling down on their own when I have them pulled up to my thighs. I work long hours and am always on my feet! My legs feel great after a 10-12 hour day!</li>
    <li> OK these are for already very skinny people! Not for a slimming purpose at all. I have normal size legs I wear a medium. These will not go on at all.I managed to get half up my calf and it would not go any higher. Very disappointed!  So if you are a size small or tinner go for them for the mediums are up don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Waaaay too tight to fit a real woman</li>
    <li> do not buy these for the &amp;#34;slimming&amp;#34; factor, if you can get them on you already have skinny legs !!!  If you want them just to wear under a dress, skirt, etc, go for it.  There is not enough elasticity in them to stretch much in  ANY direction.  Without stretching the top, the part your thigh should fit in, you could slip a pop can in and it would fit nicely.  I tried, just for giggles, to put one on my arm, I got just past my elbow.  I wanted these to hopefully help with the edema,swelling, in my lower legs and feet.  On some days they look like Hobbitt feet, except they aren&#x27;t hairy. These are definitely not the answer to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, they are a very pretty color, are soft, ...</li>
    <li> Eh. I hate the normal compression socks because they look like they&#x27;re for old people (no offense, but I&#x27;m early 20s with bad fashion sense as it is). I really wanted something with color especially since it&#x27;s summer and I wear shorts. The color is cool, but I&#x27;m overall unimpressed. First of all, they roll down so I basically just gave up and folded them so that they only go up to the bottom of my knee. I&#x27;m a size 4/6 pants (depending on the fit) so make of that what you will. These were made for girls with long, skinny legs. They also don&#x27;t seem that horribly durable, which considering that they are meant for overnight and not regular wear, I&#x27;m not surprised. There&#x27;s also not a whole lot of compression despite the tight fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, only buy these if your legs are sticks and if you only plan on wearing them at night.But basically, if you are small enough to fit into these, you don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;slimming&amp;#34; anything to begin with.</li>
    <li> too small ... I contacted the company and they were very nice and made it right. I recommend this company.</li>
    <li> Size was not as expected. .</li>
    <li> they roll down at the top - thereby making a tight constricting ring on your leg.  It was like sleeping with a rubber band on my thigh!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get them on, even with help.</li>
    <li> Made for someone with slim legs. Struggled to get up to my knees.</li>
    <li> They are not one size fits all</li>
    <li> not long enough and I am 5&#x27;2.</li>
    <li> Love them! The have Durable and quality fabric. They appear to be able to withhold many machine washing cycles :))</li>
    <li> I could of swore they came in a one size. They fit more like a small, but roles down and fits more like knee highs vs thigh high like in the picture.</li>
    <li> Extremely tight; it is impossible to wear them; you have to be bones no muscle.</li>
    <li> They were hard to get on. They hurt at the top of the foot.</li>
