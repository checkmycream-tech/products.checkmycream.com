### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Proud of amazon!</li>
      <li>The brush arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>Great choice!</li>
      <li>What a great product!  </li>
      <li>She was delighted and has been very happy to have it.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>brush is easy to use, outlines (and if I want, fills in) perfectly, which is what I want in a lip brush.  </li>
      <li>My mom loved it and still loves it.</li>
      <li>The stuff bristles of the brush allow a good application.</li>
      <li>It would give me better control than I have with my finest sable brushes!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The retractable feature makes it perfect for traveling or carrying it in your purse for any touch-ups, or just if you don&#x27;t want to take up space with a huge, full sized brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush is WONDERFUL for apply lipstick in a smooth, sharp, perfect shape.</li>
      <li>I would have liked it more if I could have bought the lip brush and cleaner in one pkg.</li>
      <li>An unexpected great buy!</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best lipstick brush I ever had!  </li>
      <li>it is cheaply made, but will be good until I find a better one.</li>
      <li>This is more of a lip liner brush.</li>
      <li>I love Elf cosmetic brushes.</li>
      <li>They work for more than just outlining, btw.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find this one.</li>
      <li>When my retractable lip brush vanished, after many years of service, I had to find another one.  </li>
      <li>I love using this with any of the ELF HD blushes, applying them as lipstains.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is the goal of most looking for a lip brush, but in my case, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t too sure how it worked</li>
      <li>I never use it now and use a cheap one I got in a set way more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as great (maybe better) as higher end brushes, it&#x27;s compact, and it&#x27;s very newbie friendly too!</li>
      <li>but it was easy to figure out</li>
      <li>This one will suit me just fine.</li>
      <li>It has great quality, nice thickness, and it comes out and retracts easily, but holds firmly in place.</li>
      <li>This little lipstick brush has the perfect tip for eyeliner shadow applications.</li>
      <li>Still it was cheap.</li>
      <li>Unless you need it to apply a precise line, go with another.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Not only does the cap protect this brush from smudging product on all the things you may have in your purse, but the tip is simply great, I like that this is a firmer brush which means that you can use it both to line your lips and to fill them in with full control.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re economical and like to get to every bit of lipstick in the tube, this is the brush for you!</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit tapered and ever so slightly bendy which makes it great for gliding across the curves of your lips for an easy application.</li>
      <li>Not expensive and easy to use</li>
      <li>Lip brushes are a necessity for bold or bright lipsticks, but I&#x27;m a cheapo and don&#x27;t like buying expensive things when a cheaper (and just as good) option is available.</li>
      <li>First of all, it&#x27;s available at Amazon where none are carried by CVS or Walgreens or any grocery store</li>
      <li>I found this black model, which is very nice, indeed.  </li>
      <li>great, small design for sticking in your makeup bag.</li>
      <li>In other words, all of you reading this -- you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>It broke the second time I tried to use it -- a cheap piece of junk!</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five star treatment is that the brush is so smooth, firm and springy, that I would love it in my portrait painting studio!  </li>
      <li>Brush head is much to thin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is very convenient</li>
      <li>This should never happen with a brush that costs this much.  </li>
      <li>I really like this lip brush.</li>
      <li>like a much fuller brush for my lips.</li>
      <li>Hesitant about the &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; feature at first, but it&#x27;s pretty convenient, especially for something to keep in a purse or for travel.</li>
      <li>Decent brush for the price.</li>
      <li>I love this retractable lip brush because i can drop it in my purse w/o any mess getting inside my makeup bag or purse</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I find myself making many little strokes instead of a continuous line.  </li>
      <li>I would like it to be a little fuller and to spread lipstick better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a few of them recently and have been completely satisfied with each one.</li>
      <li>It was very inexpensive and I can&#x27;t imagine what more the expensive ones do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s both soft and sturdy at the same time!  </li>
      <li>The top is so thin</li>
      <li>The brush does not stay out while using and it isn&#x27;t as high of quality as I expected.</li>
      <li>The brush is very firm, holds the right amount of lipstick and the bristles don&#x27;t gradually fall out like others I have.  </li>

<li> Apparently (as one reviewer noted) the bristles are hard, but she says that&#x27;s what she expects in a lip brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this retractable lip brush because i can drop it in my purse w/o any mess getting inside my makeup bag or purse</li>
    <li> I say, go tot the store and buy one if your looking at this brush. after Shipping it was not worth the price. it is cheaply made, but will be good until I find a better one. i will probably give it to my niece to play with.</li>
    <li> wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to return it.  very hard to figure out.</li>
    <li> It did not spread well.  Not sure I would get another one.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my Granddaughter.  She already had a lipstick brush, but no a retractable one.  She was delighted and has been very happy to have it.  It is well made and does the job well.  The brush arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  Would do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> After a short time when I pushed the brush up, it no longer held to hold it in place while lipstick applied.  Still it was cheap.</li>
    <li> I apply eyeliner with a pencil then cover it with powdered shadow of a similar color. This little lipstick brush has the perfect tip for eyeliner shadow applications. Because it is retractable, thus protecting its brush, I can carry it in my purse without a problem.</li>
    <li> The brush is poorly constructed and broke after a week of usage. I will not buy E.L.F products again.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best lipstick brush I ever had!  I use it to get deep down when my lipstick wears down in the tube where I can&#x27;t get to it.  The brush is very firm, holds the right amount of lipstick and the bristles don&#x27;t gradually fall out like others I have.  It&#x27;s both soft and sturdy at the same time!  If you&#x27;re economical and like to get to every bit of lipstick in the tube, this is the brush for you!</li>
    <li> Brush head is much to thin!&lt;br /&gt;I like a much fuller brush for my lips. The top is so thin, it&#x27;s hard t get any lip gloss on it.</li>
    <li> Every time you throw away a lipstick tube without using a lip brush, you&#x27;re throwing away about 1/3 of the usual lipstick you see above the tube. So, for every 3 tubes you buy, you save the cost of the 4th one. I was glad to find this one.</li>
    <li> When my retractable lip brush vanished, after many years of service, I had to find another one.  The places I would usually encounter them didn&#x27;t have any, so I went to the web.  I found this black model, which is very nice, indeed.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five star treatment is that the brush is so smooth, firm and springy, that I would love it in my portrait painting studio!

My slightly worn-out lip brush had developed a softer edge, so that I could use it to soften the edges of my lips.  This one is so controlled that it is harder to &amp;#34;feather out&amp;#34; an edge.  In other words, all of you reading this -- you&#x27;ll love it!</li>

It&#x27;s just as great (maybe better) as higher end brushes, it&#x27;s compact, and it&#x27;s very newbie friendly too!</li>
    <li> I give 4 stars because I want bigger paint hair brush.</li>
    <li> This lip brush is everything I want in a lipstick brush.  First of all, it&#x27;s available at Amazon where none are carried by CVS or Walgreens or any grocery store I&#x27;ve been to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is easy to use, outlines (and if I want, fills in) perfectly, which is what I want in a lip brush.

    <li> I have been looking for a retractable brush ever since I lost my Mary Kay one. Once I saw this one, I wanted to give it a try because it looked solid and well made. I was not disappointed. It has great quality, nice thickness, and it comes out and retracts easily, but holds firmly in place. Great choice!</li>
    <li> i wish it extended a little further, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker. great, small design for sticking in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> The brush does not stay out while using and it isn&#x27;t as high of quality as I expected.</li>
    <li> I like it. It is very convenient</li>
    <li> The brush is way too firm.  Unless you need it to apply a precise line, go with another.  I never use it now and use a cheap one I got in a set way more</li>
    <li> I used this brush daily but after 6 weeks, it stopped retracting.  I contacted the seller who refused to offer credit or at least an exchange saying it past the 30 day timeframe.  I know this is an inexpensive item but it should work longer than 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product. Had it for two weeks now and no problems. Bristles are tight and don&#x27;t fall out, which is always helpful!</li>
    <li> I had lost my very trusty lip brush and I was doubtful about selecting another one online. This one will suit me just fine.</li>
    <li> Not expensive and easy to use</li>
    <li> My mom loved it and still loves it. Proud of amazon!</li>
    <li> Bristles are a little bit short and stiff to give the gentle, sweeping lining action I prefer.  I find myself making many little strokes instead of a continuous line.  It does the job, but slowly.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use it that often, but needed one, so this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> When I got this brush I was amazed at how well it outlined the lips.  Then, the brush would not pop out so I had to contort my fingers to hold the brush out.  This should never happen with a brush that costs this much.  Save your money and buy a lipliner that works.  This gadget is useless now.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these for my wife - one for her purse, one for home. She loves them. Easy to clean. Apparently (as one reviewer noted) the bristles are hard, but she says that&#x27;s what she expects in a lip brush. They work for more than just outlining, btw.</li>
    <li> Its too thin.  I would like it to be a little fuller and to spread lipstick better.  This is more of a lip liner brush.</li>
