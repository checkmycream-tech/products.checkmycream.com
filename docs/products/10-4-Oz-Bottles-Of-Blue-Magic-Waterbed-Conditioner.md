      <li>This was a good buy.</li>
      <li>Have used this product before so I knew it was good.  </li>
      <li>This product has done the job and at a really good price.  </li>
      <li>Going with the multi pack is a good way to $ave.    </li>
      <li>Delivery was very quick and I am happy with the product</li>
      <li>Great to purchase products no longer available in my area.  </li>
      <li>was very glad to get it as no one in my town sells waterbed products any more.</li>
      <li>if there was a problem im sure i would have heard about it</li>
      <li>Softens water and keeps water bed nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Product came in safe.</li>
      <li>We still have an old-school bladder waterbed and love it.  </li>
      <li>I just purchased more of the product for Fiber Water Beds from Amazon.com.      </li>
      <li>So glad we found this product since so many stores stop carrying it.</li>
      <li>love them.</li>
      <li>Product was received super quick and exactly as stated at a great price!  </li>
      <li>It was an extraordinary value if you own a waterbed and plan to keep it for a while.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and good price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so important to treat your water with chemicals.</li>
      <li>Poured it in, filled the bed, got the air out</li>
      <li>We filled it according to directions and put a bottle of the chemical in.</li>
      <li>these small bottles are perfect.  </li>
      <li>They create the bubbles you routinely have to purge from the bed -- if you don&#x27;t regularly treat the water with a chemical which impedes those creatures&#x27; lives, they make many more bubbles and can eventually ruin the inside of your waterbed bag.</li>
      <li>I searched high and low for this deal and this is a great deal for what you get for the price.</li>
      <li>10 bottles of liquid in a box without any supporting material is a risky proposition!</li>
      <li>Thanks for keeping this product available.</li>
      <li>I hope this gets to the right person who in charge of answering questions.   </li>
      <li>just the right amount for the bed.  </li>
      <li>We just replaced our first king sized mattress after 35 years.</li>
      <li>We have been using Blue magic in our water beds since 1979.</li>
      <li>I received exactly what I ordered in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon and Blue Magic.</li>
      <li>I reccomend this prodoct to anyone with a large water bed.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I do change the water in my wayerbed about every 5 years just to get the old chemicals out and start fresh again.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>HOW MUCH TO USE FOR A KING SIZE BED VS.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping from the vendor although they might want to work on their packaging.  </li>
      <li>I went online and saw a recommendation that it could be that the bacteria build up was too much and should think of replacing the waterbed.</li>
      <li>and my OLDER bottle says</li>
      <li>My older bottle, which I purchased at a waterbed</li>
      <li>This is the same brand I used starting in 1972 in my first waterbed, the same we sold at the waterbed store where I worked in the 1970s, and so it seems friendly and familiar.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for preserving the life of your bed.</li>
      <li>Also my older bottle says \\&quot;fulll motion and fiber-fill\\&quot; and the new bottle says time released water bed protection.</li>
      <li>I have used Blue Magic waterbed conditioner for as long as I have had my waterbed which is 30 years now.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not on the NEW bottle.</li>
      <li>We just ordered  brand new one with fiber in it.</li>
      <li>PG01127006 is the number on the new bottle and says Wasserbett Conditioner and states for Fiberbeds to repeat application every 4 to 6 months .      </li>
      <li>My household has two waterbeds currently, so it&#x27;s nice to buy ten bottles at a time, so we&#x27;re covered for a few years.</li>
      <li>It has been three days now and the new bed is beginning to smell like our old one did!</li>
      <li>The NEW one ,from Amazon also has a serial number on it and the old does not.  </li>
      <li>So after a tedious draining, we are back in business with beautiful clear water with a little Blue Magic.  </li>
      <li>For all of us old waterbed users, thanks for supplying us with the necessary chemicals.  </li>
      <li>will order them again when needed; no mess, no fuss.  </li>
      <li>these will last us ten years for our water bed, nice to be suppled for a long time hope the water bed last as long as the conditioner</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that you might get more than you&#x27;ll actually use, if you get a different bed down the road.</li>
      <li>and so far the bed has been quiet.  </li>
      <li>Good value, getting harder to locate water bed items locally, all the small stores closed, and Wally World stopped carrying a lot of items like this.</li>
      <li>The only purpose for \\&quot;waterbed conditioner\\&quot; is to keep in check the organisms which naturally live and multiply in the water inside your waterbed.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Sapphire collection bottles and poured a bottle in our old waterbed as it hadn&#x27;t had chemicals in a long while.</li>
      <li>The additive keeps bacteria from growing &amp; the mattress material soft for a long time.  </li>

<li> It smells like hot mustard or horseradish only worse.</li>
<li> Just empty entire contents of bottle in the mattress per manufacturers instructions and throw away the empty bottle.</li>
<li> A SINGLE BED?     </li>

<li> It gets harder and harder to find brick &amp; mortar stores that sell waterbed conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not pretty.</li>
<li> used to have four waterbeds, but now that I&#x27;m down to one--I still buy the 10-pack as I worry that some day I won&#x27;t find conditioner for sale ANYWHERE!</li>
<li> Gave me a few yrs supply.</li>
<li> and I had a real mess.  </li>
<li> I spent days trying to find what smelled so bad in my room, and finally figured out it was the waterbed conditioner!</li>
<li> It is hard to get the chemicals, however.  </li>
<li> This is quite confusing and I would like you as the manufacturer to CLEARIFY THE INFORMATION.</li>
<li> Within a week the mattress began to give off a very bad odor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Softens water and keeps water bed nice and smooth. Would recommend if changing water in the bed. Works as it should</li>
    <li> Product was received super quick and exactly as stated at a great price!  Would definitely recommend vendor.</li>
    <li> We still have an old-school bladder waterbed and love it.  It is hard to get the chemicals, however.  This order was as expected and arrived according to indications by seller.</li>
    <li> Poured it in, filled the bed, got the air out and so far the bed has been quiet.  The big deal is that this is half the price of some other offerings.  And my waterbed dealer told me that this is what he pays, wholesale, for conditioner.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before so I knew it was good.  Fast shipping from the vendor although they might want to work on their packaging.  10 bottles of liquid in a box without any supporting material is a risky proposition!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 years now, and recommend it fully. The only purpose for \\&quot;waterbed conditioner\\&quot; is to keep in check the organisms which naturally live and multiply in the water inside your waterbed. They create the bubbles you routinely have to purge from the bed -- if you don&#x27;t regularly treat the water with a chemical which impedes those creatures&#x27; lives, they make many more bubbles and can eventually ruin the inside of your waterbed bag. You only need to use 4 ounces every 6 months, or 8 ounces once a year. I have slept on a waterbed for 40 of my 60 years, so I have enough experience in the matter.   You will know when it&#x27;s time to purge the air from the bag and add conditioner, because the noise of the bubbles in the bag will begin to bother you and keep you awake. That&#x27;s the time to purge the bubbles, and add 4 or 8 ounces of conditioner -- the size of the bed does not matter, just add a 4-ounce bottle every 6 months.</li>
    <li> Product came in safe. Great to purchase products no longer available in my area.  Gave me a few yrs supply.</li>
    <li> The product was satisfactory, especially the amount of product for the dollars spent. The only thing that was missing was how much to use for what size waterbed. I figured it out but it would be helpful to have that information.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years on our current water bed.  Highly recommend it for preserving the life of your bed.</li>
    <li> Great Product Great Price !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I hope this gets to the right person who in charge of answering questions.   I&#x27;ve used this before and hopefully it&#x27;s doing a good job. I just purchased more of the product for Fiber Water Beds from Amazon.com.      My question is the DIRECTIONS DO NOT INCLUDE WHAT SIZE WATERBED THE PRODUCT IS BEING USED IN. HOW MUCH TO USE FOR A KING SIZE BED VS. A SINGLE BED?     The Blue Sapphire liquid comes in 4 oz and 8 oz bottles. and my OLDER bottle says Multi purpose Plus and it&#x27;s not on the NEW bottle. Also my older bottle says \\&quot;fulll motion and fiber-fill\\&quot; and the new bottle says time released water bed protection. The NEW one ,from Amazon also has a serial number on it and the old does not.  PG01127006 is the number on the new bottle and says Wasserbett Conditioner and states for Fiberbeds to repeat application every 4 to 6 months .      My older bottle, which I purchased at a waterbed store(which is now closed and there are none near me0, says REVITALISANT Pour lit D&#x27;eau and says repeat application every 8 to 12 months.  This is quite confusing and I would like you as the manufacturer to CLEARIFY THE INFORMATION.</li>
    <li> Going with the multi pack is a good way to $ave.    We will see how it works out. No hurry since no exp. date to worry about on this product.</li>
    <li> This product has done the job and at a really good price.  Taking into consideration it was delivered to my door rather than wasting gas on picking up a similar product was also a plus.</li>
    <li> We have been using Blue magic in our water beds since 1979. The additive keeps bacteria from growing &amp; the mattress material soft for a long time.  We just replaced our first king sized mattress after 35 years.</li>
    <li> I have used Blue Magic waterbed conditioner for as long as I have had my waterbed which is 30 years now. It is the gold standard of conditioners.  I do change the water in my wayerbed about every 5 years just to get the old chemicals out and start fresh again.</li>
    <li> It gets harder and harder to find brick &amp; mortar stores that sell waterbed conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have four waterbeds, but now that I&#x27;m down to one--I still buy the 10-pack as I worry that some day I won&#x27;t find conditioner for sale ANYWHERE!</li>
    <li> great and cant get any easier to use. and only two times a year, mark your calender and your are done. it even made the room smell good for awhile!</li>
    <li> If you got a waterbed, you gotta have algaecide. This is the same brand I used starting in 1972 in my first waterbed, the same we sold at the waterbed store where I worked in the 1970s, and so it seems friendly and familiar. My household has two waterbeds currently, so it&#x27;s nice to buy ten bottles at a time, so we&#x27;re covered for a few years. I put a bottle in whenever I move and have to refill the beds, and also about once a year. Have never had any algae problems.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find waterbed conditioner in the area where I live, so I have to shop on the internet for it.  This was a good buy. Thanks</li>
    <li> So glad we found this product since so many stores stop carrying it.</li>
    <li> You can get this stuff from practically from anyone/anywhere, even make it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Mattress Covers offered the best quantity for the best over all price.&lt;br /&gt;It is a five year supply, but we are keeping this water bed Long Term.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> What is there to say about waterbed conditioner?  It does its job.</li>
    <li> i have not comments on this, i bought it for my dad because he needed it. if there was a problem im sure i would have heard about it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had waterbeds and been buying waterbed products since 1979. I searched high and low for this deal and this is a great deal for what you get for the price. It&#x27;s so important to treat your water with chemicals. I&#x27;ve seen what happens if you don&#x27;t and it&#x27;s not pretty. Thanks Amazon and Blue Magic. I will use you again whenever I need something.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this conditioner, works well and a good idea to buy in bulk.  Delivery was very quick and I am happy with the product</li>
    <li> these small bottles are perfect.  just the right amount for the bed.  will order them again when needed; no mess, no fuss.  love them.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good price. Would order from this seller again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sapphire collection bottles and poured a bottle in our old waterbed as it hadn&#x27;t had chemicals in a long while. Within a week the mattress began to give off a very bad odor. I went online and saw a recommendation that it could be that the bacteria build up was too much and should think of replacing the waterbed. So we did. We just ordered  brand new one with fiber in it. We filled it according to directions and put a bottle of the chemical in. It has been three days now and the new bed is beginning to smell like our old one did! It smells like hot mustard or horseradish only worse. Please help! Has anyone had this happen and if so, is the chemicals and what can we do? I don&#x27;t want to purchase another bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stumped</li>
    <li> I used this product before. It works very well. I reccomend this prodoct to anyone with a large water bed.</li>
    <li> Good value, getting harder to locate water bed items locally, all the small stores closed, and Wally World stopped carrying a lot of items like this.</li>
    <li> The waterbed conditioner is very good at eliminating bubbles that build up in the bed.  The conditioner needs to be added on a regular basis.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> these will last us ten years for our water bed, nice to be suppled for a long time hope the water bed last as long as the conditioner</li>
    <li> They smell like rotten bananas!  I spent days trying to find what smelled so bad in my room, and finally figured out it was the waterbed conditioner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an item that i need for my water bed and it was a good price.Also it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered in a timely manner. I like the size of the bottles.  No measuring required.  Just empty entire contents of bottle in the mattress per manufacturers instructions and throw away the empty bottle. &amp;#34;Done&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It was an extraordinary value if you own a waterbed and plan to keep it for a while. The only drawback is that you might get more than you&#x27;ll actually use, if you get a different bed down the road.</li>
    <li> For all of us old waterbed users, thanks for supplying us with the necessary chemicals.  I confess I had not put anything in it for ages and I had a real mess.  So after a tedious draining, we are back in business with beautiful clear water with a little Blue Magic.  Thanks for keeping this product available.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this waterbed conditioner since we got our bed 10 mos ago and have had no problems with it.  We have a 95% waveless fiber mattress so we add a 4 oz bottle every 4 mos because we were told that&#x27;s the best way to do a fiberfill water mattress.</li>
    <li> received my order promptly . was very glad to get it as no one in my town sells waterbed products any more.</li>
