    <li> Too expensive for the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this powder - so hard to find now but still the wonderful powder from my childhood.  Silky and fragrant, but not too much.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I had used this product many years ago and rediscovered it recently.  It is just as pleasant smelling as I remember from years ago.  The powder is soft and smooth.  Dries area being covered with the powder.  Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Thank. You</li>
    <li> Seriously, this smells like urine - or better yet a port-a-potty at an aAugust state fair with unprecedented attendance and equally hot temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;Returning immediately!</li>

What a shame another wonderful product is going by the wayside !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 86yr old Mom.  She has used it for years and loves it.  You can&#x27;t find it in stores, so she was thrilled whrn I found it online.</li>
    <li> it is a flash from the past!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for more than 50 years. Through Amazon, is now the only way that I am able purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this from the company that makes it but it was backordered 6 to 8 weeks. So I cancelled that order and looked on Amazon. I was able to buy it and received in a few days for my wife. She just loves the smell of the powder.</li>
    <li> This is my Mother&#x27;s favorite powder.  I purchased it for a Christmas gift for her.</li>
    <li> Lacks the aroma of lavender which is the reason I purchased it. On the positive side, the powder is very fine quality and not gritty or grainy. However, I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend and she was pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> This powder used to be sold in several stores, and at a reasonable price.  Don&#x27;t know why it has become a luxury item.  Maybe fewer of us use talcum powder....  In any event, I was happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27; ve misses all these yes.</li>
    <li> good product....delivered on time...</li>
    <li> This item was ordered with two other products.  Apparently all came from different sources.  Two were received but this one was marked as in-transit for two weeks.  I finally decided to email the company about my missing body powder and they just said they would refund my money.  My complaint is would they have refunded my money without my contact email?  I will not order from this supplier again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product one star simply because I had to enter something.</li>
    <li> I live in a very hot climate.  I like to use this product instead of heavy perfume.  The scent is light and pleasant smelling.  Great item for hot climates.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really like the fragrance of this - so much so that, although it works well, I seldom use it</li>
