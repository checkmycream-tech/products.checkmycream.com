      <li>I will be buying more of this brand.</li>
      <li>use top coat</li>
      <li>Was very excited for this product to get to me..</li>
      <li>i type all day long and my polish holds up awesome</li>
      <li>It was delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>Its a beautiful blue.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>gorgeous color still,but mega thin and streaky.not a good formula if youre in a rush,but if you have the time,its a mood booster for sure!</li>
      <li>Perfect mint/neon green</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, goes on well,</li>
      <li>Then I seen the gorgeous Leyla Milani (whose hair company color is Tiffany Blue) post a picture of her wearing this color and immediately rushed to purchase</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this new polish!</li>
      <li>It dries quick and there is no streaking.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color.</li>
      <li>color club is a great polish, goes on smooth, dries well and very little chipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very durable, goes on easily and is quite forgiving.</li>
      <li>I was so excited for this color because it is absolutely gorgeous, but the formula is so watery and separates so easily that I can hardly paint my nail with it.</li>
      <li>Looks amazing next to any skin tone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly mesmerizing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very rare color and stands out especially in direct sunlight.</li>
      <li>I jumped right on this polish.  </li>
      <li>; It looks very pretty on the toes, and is very flattering.</li>
      <li>The color of this polish in the bottle is a stunning robin&#x27;s egg blue.</li>
      <li>It also was the exact color shown.</li>
      <li>I actually like it better than &amp;#34;For Audrey.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>, I will be purchasing this again and again in the future as it is so lovely.</li>
      <li>This color is pretty.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t exactly the color</li>
      <li>Blue-Ming is more of a blue green whereas &#x27;Mint Candy Apple&#x27; is more of a baby blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
      <li>I really like this color.</li>
      <li>Would Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It arrived fast through the mail</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy color club but after recieving this polish, color club is my new favorite nail polish brand!</li>
      <li>This polish is better in person than in the pictures, it reminds me of China Glaze&#x27;s &amp;#34;For Audrey,&amp;#34; except that it is a little brighter, with a little more mint to it.</li>
      <li>Blue-Ming is my first and I am completely satisfied, it is seriously like nothing in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I had the exact same problem with separating</li>
      <li>they look nearly identical and on the nail</li>
      <li>The color does dry slightly darker than in the bottle but that is OK with me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Disappointed because I had heard such great things!</li>
      <li>you really want Blue Ming though there is a Dupe by Essie called Mint Candy Apple  which is identical especially on the nail.</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t tell a difference, well besides the Color Club one being extremely streaky ;-).</li>
      <li>Very streaky and the color is definitely not as vibrant as it looks on here</li>
      <li>The only difference is that My new Color Club brand of Blue Ming goes on so much more smother and thick!</li>
      <li>so I have concluded it&#x27;s just Color Club in general.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure why this happens....</li>
<li> I thought it was just Factory Girl, but Blue Ming is just as bad</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t be buying another Color Club polish and it&#x27;s sad because their color range is gorgeous.&lt;br</li>
<li> Very thin and patchy.</li>
<li> However it is terrible formula.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe how horrible the quality of this polish is!!</li>

    <li> I love this color its gorges and it has a nice formula 💖</li>
    <li> This color is pretty. I got a lot of compliments on it but it wasn&#x27;t exactly the color I thought it was when I saw it in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this nail polish! My favorite color, will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish brand (I have tried many brands) and when I was looking for a cute mint color I jumped right on this polish.  I love it.

    <li> Love love love this color and get loads of compliments on it but I&#x27;ve broke two bottles trying to get the cap off. I&#x27;m not sure why this happens....just be careful and don&#x27;t let them sit up at all.</li>
    <li> Most favorite color yet! &amp; I get tons of complements on it!</li>
    <li> Very streaky and the color is definitely not as vibrant as it looks on here</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this color.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy color club but after recieving this polish, color club is my new favorite nail polish brand! It stayed on longer than my gel nails that I got done! Very pretty color.</li>
    <li> color club is a great polish, goes on smooth, dries well and very little chipping. use top coat and you shouldnt have chipping. i type all day long and my polish holds up awesome</li>
    <li> Love the color! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how horrible the quality of this polish is!! I was so excited for this color because it is absolutely gorgeous, but the formula is so watery and separates so easily that I can hardly paint my nail with it. I had also ordered Factory Girl by Color Club and I had the exact same problem with separating and it not being opaque even after 4 coats!! I thought it was just Factory Girl, but Blue Ming is just as bad so I have concluded it&#x27;s just Color Club in general. Save your money as these polishes aren&#x27;t as cheap as some other brands and they have a terrible formula to boot. I won&#x27;t be buying another Color Club polish and it&#x27;s sad because their color range is gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want Blue Ming though there is a Dupe by Essie called Mint Candy Apple  which is identical especially on the nail. I own them both and side by side they look nearly identical and on the nail you can&#x27;t tell a difference, well besides the Color Club one being extremely streaky ;-).</li>
    <li> absolutly love this color!  great for spring/summer collection.Def recommend it !</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a Tiffany Blue/Robbins Egg Blue nail polish for what seems like 80 million years. No luck. Then I seen the gorgeous Leyla Milani (whose hair company color is Tiffany Blue) post a picture of her wearing this color and immediately rushed to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is similar to China Glaze&#x27;s &#x27;Aquadelic&#x27; however &#x27;Aquadelic&#x27; is more of a dusty blue green. Blue-Ming is much more brighter. I seen a review of how it is a dupe for Essie&#x27;s &#x27;Mint Candy Apple.&#x27; This could not be further from the truth. Blue-Ming is more of a blue green whereas &#x27;Mint Candy Apple&#x27; is more of a baby blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue-Ming was not streaky at all on me, the formula was opaque in two coats. Anyone complaining about the formula and the streakiness probably does not know how to apply nail polish correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have over 200 nail polishes and have never owned a Color Club. Blue-Ming is my first and I am completely satisfied, it is seriously like nothing in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very rare color and stands out especially in direct sunlight. All you need is Seche Vite top coat and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
    <li> It was delivered very quickly. It also was the exact color shown. I really like this color.</li>
    <li> Awesome but the bottle isn&#x27;t the same as in the picture..?</li>
    <li> Was very excited for this product to get to me.. However it is terrible formula. Very thin and patchy. Disappointed because I had heard such great things!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this new polish! I have a china glaze polish that is a similar color. The only difference is that My new Color Club brand of Blue Ming goes on so much more smother and thick! It dries quick and there is no streaking. I will be buying more of this brand. Its a beautiful blue. I&#x27;ve got plenty of complements on my nails. I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
    <li> The color of this polish in the bottle is a stunning robin&#x27;s egg blue. It&#x27;s truly mesmerizing. Don&#x27;t let that fool you. In order to get this color you&#x27;ll need like 6 coats. It&#x27;s a watery mess.</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous!  Perfect mint/neon green, I will be purchasing this again and again in the future as it is so lovely.</li>
    <li> gorgeous color still,but mega thin and streaky.not a good formula if youre in a rush,but if you have the time,its a mood booster for sure!</li>
    <li> Love this color blue-Ming by color club perfect mint color.. goes perfect for spring/summer time or whenever.  It arrived fast through the mail</li>
