    <li> I‘ve been using Bright Crystal for five years and this one doesn&#x27;t smell the same as those I&#x27;ve used. The strong alcohol smell is so overwhelming that it really shocked me when I first tried it. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fake......</li>
    <li> Ships quickly and smells lovely!</li>
    <li> this fragrance is also great! my daughter couldn&#x27;t believe how much I paid for this perfume.</li>
    <li> Got this for a girl she loves it. It smells good and seems to be authentic bought from Amazon</li>

    <li> My gf loves the gift.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my first bottle...still love it and won&#x27;t use any other kind</li>
    <li> A lot less expensive than department store prices.  Smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> C &#x27;mon a hit for sure. A million senses bottled up :-)</li>
    <li> the perfume came within 2 days probably and this is truly a great bargain! The size of the perfume and lotion for this price is fabulous!at Macy&#x27;s the gif set was smaller as in the ounces of perfume AND A EXTRA $50 !!!! fragrance lasts all day and I am constantly getting compliments....  It is one of a kind but its a Versace so what do you expect!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect- exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Great  deal with the body lotion</li>
    <li> Love it!!! great fragrance</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume after smelling a sample in Vogue, and I was not disaappointed! This smells wonderful and arrived in a timely manner. The bottle is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Bough this as a christmas gift. My friend loved it, infact she loved the scent so much that it wasted in about two months because she allowed others to use it. This is a great gift set for a birthday, christmas or even for yourself</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Versace Bright Crystal for years. It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance. I was worried about ordering from Amazon due to some questionable sellers. I was very happy with my purchase. This came from amazon and it&#x27;s the same perfume I&#x27;ve always bought from Sephora except this set is half the cost. It comes with a 3 ounce perfume and a 3.4 ounce lotion. The lotion is a little runny but it smells exactly like the perfume. I always get complimented when I wear this fragrance. It smells very fresh and summery. It&#x27;s not too flowery and very clean smelling. It&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance. I have purchased twice from Amazon. I will continue to buy from this seller because of the savings.</li>
    <li> My most favorite perfume in the world my friends all love how it smells on me too</li>
    <li> Love it! Came on time and smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for years from Macy&#x27;s and paying full price for this set which is about $100. I compared this one to the full-priced item and it is the exact same thing. I will admit I was skeptical to try this due to authenticity issues and other reviews, but im glad I did. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It came on time... only two days!! The size of both is fabulous and fragrance lasts all day!! Really a good bargain. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Such a lovely fragrance. I bought this set after a friend gave Bright Crystal body wash to me.</li>
    <li> This is great! Smells incredible, half the price on amazon with the lotion. Very classy smell but still great to hit the nightlife!</li>
    <li> Smells great, I love it.</li>
    <li> Good buy. Light clean and a very yummy. Loved it. The packaging was great - Completely  sealed do I knew no one had opened it before. I just placed a comment on 5 ml Versace that I bought to see if I like it. I thought  I was placing a review for this item. 5 ml one was not sealed with plastic, but was new and I was happy with it as well.&lt;br /&gt; thank you amazon</li>
    <li> Exactly as posted - was sealed in original packaging. This is the real thing.</li>
    <li> If you buy this for your wife .......you&#x27;ll want to marry her every night!!!</li>
    <li> loove this perfume been using this for 3 years from macys,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy i took the shot for such a grate price, 100 % REAL!</li>
    <li> The lotion tube was damaged when arrived, it had hole in it, so the lotion was everywhere when I opened the box. At least I can use the parfume, even though paid for the lotion as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy! My wife loved it</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter &amp; she loves it</li>
    <li> Perfume was of good quality, and arrived on time. Would recommend others to buy. Gave it to my girlfriend and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely but doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my wife for chistmas present and she love it its the real. And original product and affordable price</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! The bottle is huge! My mom bought the same perfume in Ulta for the same price but  much smaller bottle</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume ever! Great Price!</li>
    <li> Another one my favorite perfumes. Great price compared to upscale stoers</li>
    <li> My sis-in-law asked for it and was really happy to receive it and said I got a great deal on it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!! this is one of my favorite perfumes I usually get it at Macy&#x27;s for $100 but this was one of the best buys I have ever done online not only was it full size it also came with the lotion and smells as wonderful as I remember it to be! Plus this was half the price as in store and shipment was speedy!</li>
    <li> This item came damaged...But this is not to rate the shipping experience,it is to rate the product and since this is a favorite for my girl i decided to buy online since i was outa town. The perfume is excellent,i highly recommend it. Amazon customer service was nice, and professional. I got her something else. lol</li>
    <li> Expections are not reaching...i mean remaining shops and here buying smell is too different...i didnt like it</li>
    <li> Good price compared to macy&#x27;s and nordstrom.  the later two charges around 80.00 dollars a piece. I paid 60 bucks for this set..</li>
    <li> This is my day-to-day scent. Love it. Clean, fresh, light.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the scent and it arrived on time for a last minute gift.  Would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a perfume that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My wife was very happy with the perfume. The lotion was a bonus and she loved it just as much as the perfume.</li>
    <li> Amazing simply amazing. Smells great thank you</li>
    <li> Great price for lotion and a big bottle!</li>
    <li> excelente lo recomiendo ampliamente, el pedido se recibio en tiempo record en perfectas condiciones, es confiable y seguro muy bueno</li>
    <li> Awesome! As Expected. It&#x27;s a great perfume and my wife loves it. The product delivered is as described at a great price.</li>
    <li> My new go to fragrance! Great price and shipping. I get compliments all the time when I wear it.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, smells amazing. The smells lasts all day! I carry the lotion in my purse and dab just a tad on my wrists.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Versace Bright Crystal! It is an elegant yet soft scent. Usually high end perfume comes across very strong,  but this is subtle. I get lots of compliments about this fragrance.</li>
    <li> My sister liked it! Nice fragrance, big size of perfume bottle. The extra as a body lotion makes a great addition to gift set. I&#x27;m not a lady to tell how good this product, but lady gave it high score.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, arrived in 2 days! Smells great, just one spray and it literally lasts the whole day.</li>
    <li> I love my Versace bright.. Thank you</li>
    <li> Quite a disappointment...doesn&#x27;t last all day like my others in the line.</li>
    <li> I went off some reviews on here and other sites and picked this out for a friend as a gift. She loves floral scents and this was no different. I am glad I made this choice and she is very happy with this gift. It kinda reminds me of a coach perfume she also has but this one has a better smell. Buy with confidence :)</li>
    <li> Scent fades much quicker than those that I have bought in department stores.  I have questioned whether this might be a counterfeit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very very happy exactly what I wanted and I was surprised to see that it was A 3 ounce perfume...</li>
    <li> The scent didn&#x27;t stay on as long as the bottle I bought from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good size and price but the smell fades too quick&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
</ol>
