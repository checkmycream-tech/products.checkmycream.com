      <li>Very cheap quality, would return if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap to buy.</li>
      <li>Tangles easily..</li>
      <li>Very very nice only thing is I thought it would&#x27; have been more thicker</li>
      <li>( I have fine hair to my butt)</li>
      <li>they are long and beautiful..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s long , shiney , &amp; beautiful.</li>
      <li>They are sleek and long and beautiful.</li>
      <li>They came in two weeks early!!!!!!</li>
      <li>The can get matted easily, but if you take care of them, they should last for a good while.</li>
      <li>(: definitely will buy again &amp;&amp; for an amazing price.!</li>
      <li>Takes forever and a day to get here, but it was so so worth it!</li>
      <li>Love it all the way to the butt, it&#x27;s almost to much hair</li>
      <li>In picture it looks full......</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.  </li>
      <li>Not a  bad deal over all.</li>
      <li>, mine was super full.</li>
      <li>Cmon people, for 7$ these are great, ive had other extensions 100</li>
      <li>Good for people who never have straight natural hair.</li>
      <li>Its nice but not as long as the reviews say so yet is a good long.</li>
      <li>They are gorgeous and nothing bad about them yet anyways lol, but i would definitely Order 2 for more thicker fuller look!</li>
      <li>Does tangle a bit and color is more brown than red as pictured.  </li>
      <li>like I said, if taken care of, it probably would have lasted a while, and really, for the price, it is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Blends pretty well with hair to add volume.  </li>
      <li>Nice but too dark for me.</li>
      <li>Gave to my sister and she really likes it.</li>
      <li>Im very upset, I bought this to wear at a wedding.  </li>
      <li>But I am very upset.  </li>
      <li>Well it really took forever to get here</li>
      <li>I find that they blend very well with my hair.</li>
      <li>and once I got it is a whoooole different color nothing like the light brown they&#x27;re showing here.</li>
      <li>But yeah  would definitely need two of these to look more natural.  </li>
      <li>its thick and attaches good to your hair.</li>
      <li>I got so many compliments on how long and natural they look</li>
      <li>Highly recommend looks real</li>
      <li>But not bad to create ombre or low lights.  </li>
      <li>I only wear mine on special occasions &amp; they add so much body to my natural hair!</li>
      <li>I have really long hair, but this makes it look really full.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have time to order new ones before the wedding I have to go to.</li>
      <li>Dark blonde more closely resembles brunette than the picture represents.  </li>
      <li>The piece actually looks like real hair, though it has the texture of a doll&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The light brown is NOT light brown, its medium brown.  </li>
      <li>Thin but nice.</li>
      <li>With the right care, I&#x27;m sure it would have held up through multiple wears, but this was cared for (or NOT cared for), by a third grader, and it quickly became impossibly tangled.  </li>
      <li>On the down side I get headaches when I wear them but even then I think they are worth it.</li>
      <li>If you can curl your hair before you put them in then they&#x27;re great, as long as you can fiddle enough to make it not look fake.  </li>

<li> They are thin!!!</li>
<li> Extremely disappointed!</li>
<li> Awful!</li>

    <li> I love these extensions.! I got so many compliments on how long and natural they look (: definitely will buy again &amp;&amp; for an amazing price.!</li>
    <li> Nice but too dark for me. Gave to my sister and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> Cmon people, for 7$ these are great, ive had other extensions 100$ that sucked.</li>
    <li> Very very nice only thing is I thought it would&#x27; have been more thicker but it was not. Thin but nice. You&#x27;d have to buy 2-3 for thicker hair.  In picture it looks full......</li>
    <li> These go to the top of my butt, so I&#x27;m actually considering cutting them!  I have really long hair, but this makes it look really full.  If you can curl your hair before you put them in then they&#x27;re great, as long as you can fiddle enough to make it not look fake.  Good for people who never have straight natural hair.</li>
    <li> Love it all the way to the butt, it&#x27;s almost to much hair ( I have fine hair to my butt) wore it out today and got a lot of omg love your hair, will for sure buy again, great price, awesome product, 5 star for sure.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality, it doesn&#x27;t look natural. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time buying this.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! Takes forever and a day to get here, but it was so so worth it! They are sleek and long and beautiful. Oh, and I really only needed one set, mine was super full.</li>
    <li> AMAZING !!!!!!! Will buy again !!!!!</li>
    <li> Tangles easily.. when brushed it hets frizzy</li>
    <li> Perfect! They came in two weeks early!!!!!! I was soooooo happy to check my mailbox and to see that they had arrived early! They are gorgeous and nothing bad about them yet anyways lol, but i would definitely Order 2 for more thicker fuller look! They are thin!!! Most of all i do recommend them:)</li>
    <li> not that quality and it does not match the picture</li>
    <li> for the price they&#x27;re the best</li>
    <li> Happy to have this hair..</li>
    <li> When I first tried them on I thought they looked awfully fake since they were too long. I decided to cut off a good chunk and they suddenly looked beautiful. My hair looks a lot longer and fuller. I find that they blend very well with my hair. On the down side I get headaches when I wear them but even then I think they are worth it.</li>
    <li> Awful! Looks totally fake and it&#x27;s super heavy!! My head hurts just two hours after putting it on. Extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> Im very upset, I bought this to wear at a wedding.  The light brown is NOT light brown, its medium brown.  It does NOT match my hair at all.  I love the curls though.  But yeah  would definitely need two of these to look more natural.  But I am very upset.  I don&#x27;t have time to order new ones before the wedding I have to go to.</li>
    <li> I am giving this hair piece a five-star rating based on the value for the price paid.  My daughter actually purchased this herself to use in playing dress up.  The piece actually looks like real hair, though it has the texture of a doll&#x27;s.  With the right care, I&#x27;m sure it would have held up through multiple wears, but this was cared for (or NOT cared for), by a third grader, and it quickly became impossibly tangled.  It has long since been tossed in the garbage, but like I said, if taken care of, it probably would have lasted a while, and really, for the price, it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Well it really took forever to get here and once I got it is a whoooole different color nothing like the light brown they&#x27;re showing here. Its nice but not as long as the reviews say so yet is a good long. Wish it was at least some what of a bendable color if I can return it for my color or a color I can blend it would be great</li>
    <li> they shipped very fast and the color is perfect. they tangle and frizz somewhat easily but as long as you know how to maintain them - theyre perfect</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous for the price! Does tangle a bit and color is more brown than red as pictured.  Would def recommend!</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely matter.  The only thing was there was no instructions in how to use in the package.  The color and style was great</li>
    <li> Really happy with it! it&#x27;s long , shiney , &amp; beautiful. Super pleased !✌️</li>
    <li> These are great for the price! The can get matted easily, but if you take care of them, they should last for a good while. I only wear mine on special occasions &amp; they add so much body to my natural hair! Love them!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend looks real</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality, would return if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap to buy.</li>
    <li> Liked it but color was darker, ordered light brown when it came it was a darker brown.</li>
    <li> i ordered two of these...they are long and beautiful..i love them...id def recommend these..they are great and easy to clip in</li>
    <li> its thick and attaches good to your hair. a bit shinny though.</li>
    <li> For the money? Amazing.</li>
    <li> Extensions are pretty and the clips manage to give a snug hold without pulling too hard on roots.  Not bad for the price.  Dark blonde more closely resembles brunette than the picture represents.  But not bad to create ombre or low lights.  Blends pretty well with hair to add volume.  Not a  bad deal over all.</li>
