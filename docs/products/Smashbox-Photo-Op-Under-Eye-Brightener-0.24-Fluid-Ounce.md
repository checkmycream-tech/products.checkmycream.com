      <li>They make wrinkles more pronounced and they always look heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>someone else will more than likely be providing the makeup and the excellent lighting.  </li>
      <li>I use this mostly under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a brightener than concealer.</li>
      <li>I love Smashbox Photo</li>
      <li>Smashbox needs to do better.  </li>
      <li>It brightens my eyes &amp; the under eye darkness &amp; makes me look more refreshed.</li>
      <li>Maybe this works as a nice effect if you&#x27;re doing a photo shoot but face it if we&#x27;re worthy of a photo shoot</li>
      <li>The best deal that works for me is vitE oil and a lighter cheap foundation for under eye use only.</li>
      <li>This had great reviews and Smashbox usually has great products, but not this one.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to use as it has a brush inside the cap.  </li>
      <li>Refracts light.</li>
      <li>I apply it lightly</li>
      <li>Great for getting ready in the early morning!</li>
      <li>This is my husbands&#x27; account, he&#x27;s so sweet to get me stuff on amazon, he&#x27;s sweeter for letting me write reviews on his account.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well, but I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, so I&#x27;ve stopped using it for the most part.  </li>
      <li>however they look great on other people.</li>
      <li>I usually try to get the best deal, but I was willing to splurge on this product.</li>
      <li>It was a first time buy for me, I am hooked for life!</li>
      <li>So in certain light, you can see the shimmer.  </li>
      <li>It adds a light shimmer and that&#x27;s about it, and doesn&#x27;t even last more than a couple hours.</li>
      <li>(maybe 2 brushes worth) and tap under my eye.</li>
      <li>but there are many other eye brightners that work much better.</li>
      <li>I have been using the under eye brightener for about 2 years now, and no other product I&#x27;ve used has given me the same great results.</li>
      <li>Yes I agree with others, it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side but the look I get when I apply under my eyes is flawless.</li>
      <li>Nothing better or different imo.</li>
      <li>I put it over my regular concealer and it works ok.</li>
      <li>My first tube lasted a while...</li>
      <li>I like my Maybelline Instant age rewind neutralizer better.</li>
      <li>One bottle lasted me nearly 9 months, so totally worth the price!</li>
      <li>but if you have any sort of dark circles to hide this item will NOT cover them up, it will only give them a nice shimmer in the right light.  </li>
      <li>I love me some shimmer, thus the 3 star rating, but in all honesty I wouldn&#x27;t go out my way to buy this again especially when Revlon has a similar \\&quot;light</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t really tell it covered at all.  </li>
      <li>It really doea make me look refreshed and not tired.  </li>
      <li>You really have to massage it in</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product &amp; finally have something to help</li>
      <li>I really had high hopes for this brightener, but I just suck at putting this type of eye brightener on.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was the Touche Eclat until a friend, her hairdresser, and my sister had the same problem with the same product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for under cover on the eyes.</li>
      <li>It is a nice little tube that is easy to carry around, and it&#x27;s easy to apply, but for my under eye circles, I got the Bare Escentuals concealer in Summer Bisque and I wear Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Brightening powder (I think it&#x27;s called?)</li>
      <li>I found a Loreal new product that works at Walgreens.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try a new product for concealing under my eyes.</li>
      <li>The product has a built-in little brush on the cap for easy appilcation.  </li>
      <li>but, it works to reflect light, making my dark under-eye circles nearly disappear.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Felt like really soft lotion with no color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to stay in line with it to have the kind of effect I am looking for.</li>
      <li>effect\\&quot; product on the market for a whole heck of a lot less cash.  </li>
      <li>While it does brighten the area under your eye, it is not a concealer and won&#x27;t really cover dark circles so if you have the same issue as me, put the Photo Op over a concealer for maximum effect.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a little shimmer in the Summer Bisque, but the brightening powder covers it and my under eye area looks much brighter without the shimmer.</li>

    <li> This works awesome! It brightens my eyes &amp; the under eye darkness &amp; makes me look more refreshed. You can also dab it above your eye brows and between to highlight your face.  Great for getting ready in the early morning! One bottle lasted me nearly 9 months, so totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> Sucked as well as the other product I bought from Smashbox.  Felt like really soft lotion with no color this was not the goal of the product. It is suppose to be an under eye brightner. Still waiting for a refund as well on this one.</li>
    <li> This had great reviews and Smashbox usually has great products, but not this one. Didn&#x27;t do a thing - didn&#x27;t brighten, cover up, conceal - nothing. Felt good, light weight but there are many other eye brightners that work much better.</li>
    <li> Smashbox is a great company that practices the cruelty-free ethic which is what mostly made me buy this product.  I have had dark circles under my eyes from a very young age as the result of an iron deficiency and hoped that Photo Op might help.  While it does brighten the area under your eye, it is not a concealer and won&#x27;t really cover dark circles so if you have the same issue as me, put the Photo Op over a concealer for maximum effect.  All that said, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It was a first time buy for me, I am hooked for life!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Macy&#x27;s for $20.00  I am not impressed! I like my Maybelline Instant age rewind neutralizer better. Even e.l.f. is just as good as this one and it is two sided a wand for under eye concealer and another for a hi-lighter. Or Benefit&#x27;s Ooh la lift eye brightener.  Nothing better or different imo. Just another under eye brightener that is 6 times more expensive than e,l,f&#x27;s at $3.00!  Save your $.</li>
    <li> I love me some shimmer, thus the 3 star rating, but in all honesty I wouldn&#x27;t go out my way to buy this again especially when Revlon has a similar \\&quot;light effect\\&quot; product on the market for a whole heck of a lot less cash.  This is suppose to go under the eye to brighten things up but if you have any sort of dark circles to hide this item will NOT cover them up, it will only give them a nice shimmer in the right light.  Maybe this works as a nice effect if you&#x27;re doing a photo shoot but face it if we&#x27;re worthy of a photo shoot someone else will more than likely be providing the makeup and the excellent lighting.  I don&#x27;t like throwing things away and prefer to use this on my brow bone or in the center of my lid for a little pop of shimmer.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty useless product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. It&#x27;s barely noticeable. It adds a light shimmer and that&#x27;s about it, and doesn&#x27;t even last more than a couple hours. Not worth the money at all. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product - really brightens things up! I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would be thicker and it is very thin and a tad to much liquid for me....wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
    <li> I used this entire bottle and plan to use again.  The product is easy to use as it has a brush inside the cap.  Just brush in the areas you want to use it and press into the skin.  I use this mostly under my eyes.  I do not feel the product is too shiny or glittery.  I do generally use an additional concealer under my eyes if I have dark circles, otherwise the Photo Op alone is sufficient.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands&#x27; account, he&#x27;s so sweet to get me stuff on amazon, he&#x27;s sweeter for letting me write reviews on his account. Anyways  &gt;This eye brightener is excellent!  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy under my eyes and it blends well with my skin color.  It really doea make me look refreshed and not tired.  THis product is a bit watery though. The product has a built-in little brush on the cap for easy appilcation.  &gt;This works great with the Smashbox photofinish primer.  &gt;Standard shipping for this product is about 1-7 days, my shipment of this took 5 days.  This product is great for photographs, weddings, partys, etc.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this had shimmer in it until someone was like \\&quot;do you have glitter on your face?\\&quot;  So in certain light, you can see the shimmer.  It works pretty well, but I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, so I&#x27;ve stopped using it for the most part.  It is a nice little tube that is easy to carry around, and it&#x27;s easy to apply, but for my under eye circles, I got the Bare Escentuals concealer in Summer Bisque and I wear Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Brightening powder (I think it&#x27;s called?) over it.  There&#x27;s a little shimmer in the Summer Bisque, but the brightening powder covers it and my under eye area looks much brighter without the shimmer.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, color and good coverage. Only took a little too long to get to my door. Higly recommendable, The cons: a bit too little content in package,</li>
    <li> this was a waste of my money.  Smashbox needs to do better.  This product was a joke.  It did not cover nicely under the eye. I found a Loreal new product that works at Walgreens.  Try that.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product &amp; finally have something to help w/the dark circles around my eyes, plus the added bonus of brightening. Unfortunately this is not the product I was looking for. It&#x27;s VERY sheer &amp; I feel like I have NO coverage at all when using this product, even the brightening effect is not impressive. This was truly a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brightener.  You really have to massage it in but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for this product.The great color and ever-so-slight shimmer work miracles. I apply it lightly and, I don&#x27;t notice the shimmer but, it works to reflect light, making my dark under-eye circles nearly disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other concealers I have tried use thick, heavy product to cover dark/problem areas. They make wrinkles more pronounced and they always look heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could only have 2 products in my makeup bag, this would definitely be one of them. Mascara would be the other.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see all the negative reviews of this product. I have been using the under eye brightener for about 2 years now, and no other product I&#x27;ve used has given me the same great results. It&#x27;s lightweight, and long-lasting. A lot of people complain about the shimmer--but this product is meant to go on before your foundation--not on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but you only need to use a tiny amount each application. Definitely will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This is not the maker&#x27;s fault. I really had high hopes for this brightener, but I just suck at putting this type of eye brightener on. It is difficult to stay in line with it to have the kind of effect I am looking for. I just end up making a big mess. I am better off with pencils.</li>
    <li> Really great. Camouflages under eye shadows. Put it only on half circle line not entire under eye area or under eye bag. Refracts light.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a brightener than concealer. I put it over my regular concealer and it works ok. You can see where it is though so don&#x27;t use too much. I put it on my finger (maybe 2 brushes worth) and tap under my eye.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really tell it covered at all.  Service was great but product wasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of items from Smashbox and they haven&#x27;t worked for me however they look great on other people.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this.I love Smashbox Photo Finish Lid Primer so I  thought I would like this product. I tried it and did not notice any difference. Disappointed with product but seller was fast with delivery.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I had to stop using YSL Touche Eclat because it gave me a rash on my eyelids (which was not a good thing). I wasn&#x27;t sure it was the Touche Eclat until a friend, her hairdresser, and my sister had the same problem with the same product. I have used Photo Op on my eyelids as my sole eyeshadow (I sometimes use a bit of Nars eyeshadow at night) for at least two years now. It&#x27;s a perfect product in my book and I&#x27;m a lifelong customer as long as it continues to agree with my otherwise-not-all-that-sensitive skin. Also? The price point is half what YSL&#x27;s Touche Eclat is. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it brightens up my face, love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Yes I agree with others, it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side but the look I get when I apply under my eyes is flawless. My first tube lasted a while... you only need a dab. It is slightly on the shiny side but I cover with a little touch of mineral veil and it&#x27;s perfection.  Highly recommend for under cover on the eyes.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a new product for concealing under my eyes. I usually try to get the best deal, but I was willing to splurge on this product. I am totally disappointed. The product didn&#x27;t do anything. I recommend Mary-kays under eye brightner. The best deal that works for me is vitE oil and a lighter cheap foundation for under eye use only. Buying more expensive makeup is overrated!</li>
