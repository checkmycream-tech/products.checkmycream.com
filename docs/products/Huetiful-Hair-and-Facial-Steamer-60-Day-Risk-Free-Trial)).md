      <li>While not on the top of the list is the fact that the hood is not adjustable, meaning you have to find the perfect table and chair combination to be adequately positioned under the unit.</li>
      <li>i want to say that i really needed this steamer!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the fact that I can steam at home now.  It&#x27;s super easy to set up and makes the de-tangling process a breeze after I&#x27;ve steamed.</li>
    <li> I receieved a Huetiful Steamer a few months ago as a gift.  I love it. I use it as an alternate from the hair salon. It help me through my natural hair transition. . less breakage and my hair  last longer.</li>
    <li> I have had my Huetiful Hair Steamer since September and I LOVE IT!!!  I use it once a week and my hair always says \\&quot;Thank YOU\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I just received this product from my mother!! I am so excited, because I used steamers when I was permed and now that I am natural I am 100% that I will love this product. Its a must have and a must buy!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this steamer as an early Christmas gift. Being excited to try it out, I set it up right away. Overall the steamer was OK. After using it a couple times, I cannot say that it was any better than sitting under my mom&#x27;s old-fashioned heating cap. A couple details about me: I have natural african-american hair 4b/c sometimes classified as (cNapp). My hair responds to moisture and conditioners- which seems like the perfect equation for this product.   Some obvious flaws are:   1) The steam hood is designed slightly inadequately, as the steam does not reach the bottom 1/3 or back of your hair (about 3-4 inches above your nape). To remedy this, I steamed about 10 minutes regularly, and then turned backwards in my seat, straddling cowboy style, having the front of the hood steam the back of my hair. This worked OK, but not the ultimate solution. For $125+, a problem like that should be addressed. Additionally, another method I use to get the most steam exposure is to band my hair at the top of my head with a headband. At least with this method, my ends get wet. Oh, and a sweatband is almost essential if you don&#x27;t want to continuously rid your face and neck of water.   2) The steam session is only estimated to last about 20 minutes, however, my steamer automatically shut off while there was an inch of water left in the basin (yes, I got out my ruler and measured). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, as a forgetful person I embrace automatic shut off, however, I don&#x27;t appreciate premature shut off. Anyway, with so much water left in the basin, and the coil being submersed in the water, one naturally worries about rust, right? Well taking off the basin is hard, and almost feels like you are going to break it. So I just loosened it and tilted the whole unit over the sink to pour out the excess water.   3) While not on the top of the list is the fact that the hood is not adjustable, meaning you have to find the perfect table and chair combination to be adequately positioned under the unit. I&#x27;m short, so I used my office chair that has height adjustment.   All in all, if steam works for you, then give it a go. But I honestly think their developers need to go back to the drawing board and redesign the hood to be more effective (and us early adapters should get a replacement part- but that&#x27;s not going to happen, I&#x27;m sure). I wanted this to be a drop-dead amazing product because it garnered rave reviews(in hindsight I wonder how genuine this is since part of their marketing scheme was to send free units to popular hair bloggers) but it landed at \\&quot;ehh\\&quot; (but do I tell that to the person who bought it for me?? whomp whomp).   Oh, and I cannot comment on the facial attachment as I haven&#x27;t received it yet.  Additional Note/Edit- I am really upset with Huetiful as I have found that the same machine design (features and all) minus the $3 \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; plastic hood is offered by another company at half the cost! I really feel that Huetiful is benefiting off of this machine at the expense of the African American community by repackaging the product and charging double! I posted on their Facebook page my concerns and they deleted my comment! That, to me, implied their guilt. I will not be supporting them.   Please see here for the product I am referencing- note that the only differences are 1) the colors (yes, seriously, the colors of the base and trim) and 2) the cheap hood. Id rather buy this machine and fabricate my own hood from supplies at my local hardware store. This product was introduced in 2008, which means it came first.  [[ASIN:B00178RONK Paragon Petite Table-Top Facial Steamer]]  Thanks to Atlanta_Reader, in the comments section of this review, found this product [[ASIN:B005M1M8YS Secura Hair and Facial Steamer with Ozone Technology]] which is identical- hood and all- to the huetiful for nearly half the price! If you&#x27;re going to buy a steamer, go for one of these and don&#x27;t support a company that is gouging and insulting its target audience.</li>
    <li> I initally saw this product on Facebook and was curious about it so I joined the page. It was a very good decision. I began to watch the review on YouTube and decided to place my name on the waiting list because the Steamers were out of stock at the time. Another very good decision. When I received the notification that the Huetiful Steamer was available for order, I bit the bullet and ordered one. The best decision I made in this journey. I have tightly spiraled hair that gets very dry and frizzy. This along with a really good conditioner had my hair beautifully smooth. I was totally amazed and pleased.[[ASIN:B003XTMRSS Huetiful Hair Steamer]]</li>
    <li> This steamer is fantastic!! To me it has so many different uses and benefits!! I have spent the last 8 months recovering from heat damage, by using no heat. Ive just started to use heat in moderation and have been afraid I would lose my curls again...But this steamer has given me peace of mind!! After I use it my curls are so tight and hydrated its crazy!!! I have middle back length hair after steaming its a all curly and drawn up tight!! I have 3a 3b hair type.. Just make sure after you close the cuticle after by washing the conditioner you&#x27;ve used out and final rinse in cold water with a little acv &#x3D; silky hydrated hair!! Ive seen others say it left their hair dry and hard, and I can see that happening IF you do not close the hair cuticle after. The steam is hot so the hair cuticle is open and absorbing all the conditioners you&#x27;ve put in. So if you don&#x27;t close them your hair WILL be rough!! Not only that if you have scalp issues this steamer is for you. Ive found it freshens and cleanses the scalp in a way Ive never felt, by removing all the buildup of dandruff and products on the hair and scalp. It is however very delicate! Meaning it appears that if not used carefully certain parts can break. Then there&#x27;s the facial feature!! Amazing!! I do believe the ozone feature they&#x27;ve used works. My son had terrible eczema on his face, neck, and arms, so I decided to use the facial attachment of the steamer on him with coconut oil. The dry cracked skin he HAD is healing and the  itching has subsided!! I know the product is not meant for that sort of treatment but it did wonders!! I believe the facial attachment could work great for the use with colds and congestion as well! Great investment! If it broke I would not hesitate buying it again!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to use my steamer. As soon as I received the package, I tried it out that evening. My hair felt wonderful. It was extremely soft. I look forward to using it again. Because I liked what it has done to my hair, I am disappointed that I did not receive the facial steamer attachment to give a full product review. Why didn&#x27;t I receive the facial attachment? Is the part discontinued?</li>
    <li> I love my hair steamer which has benefits for my once  dry hair the steamer has provided moisture and left my hair soft and silky. The greatest benefit is that the steamer  promotes long lasting hydration due to its ability to absorb water to help maintain moisture. I would  highly recommend this steamer for naturals, relaxed and transitioning hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this steamer about 2 months after I first chopped my hair off and I was amazed at the curl defining capabilities. When my hair is not hydrated my curls frizz so the steamer helped keep my hair nice and moist. I started off steaming twice a week and now i steam once a week or every 10 days when I use shampoo. It helps get my moisture back that I lose when I clarify.</li>
    <li> This steamer is excellent in locking in the necessary moisture for naturally curly hair types.  My ends are very dry and curly.  When I used the Huetiful steamer, my hair is soft, bouncy, and moisturized.  Detangling is easier, my scalp isnt as dry, and my ends do not knot.  Ive become lazy so I havent used my steamer, but as this weather is rapidly changing, my steamer will get ultimate use!</li>
    <li> I went natural June 5,2011 because I got a perm that took my long ARM pit length hair to my neck within a week. I begin trying to hide it with buns but it didn&#x27;t work so I had no choice bit to go natural because the breakage was choppy and looked horrible. Going natural, it didn&#x27;t matter what cobditioner I tried. It could be moisture conditioner or homemade for help with moisture. Nothing made my hair hydrated longer than an hour. So I ordered a Huetiful Hair Steamer when they had the sale on the refurbished ones. Once I got it it was simple to attach together. I first used the facial attachment. I like it. Then I washed my hair and put my deep conditioner in it. I put my band on I also ordered with the steamer to keep the hair secure. I used the steamer as instructed and Omg, I wish someone would just slap ne because my hair felt like silk. I could get my hair to do what I wanted, it shines, and it stays hydrated and I only use my steamer once a month. I am a sceptical person and I really don&#x27;t pay attention to reviews but this made me think twice. I was so happy I went to YouTube to see what others thought. I love it. I wish I has it at the beginning. My hair is not two inches anymore. It&#x27;s neck length. I&#x27;m on hairlista if you wanna see my steamer pictures. My name is Anne Hill. Try it, I&#x27;m a 3c 4a hair type. I love my steamer.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use this product because i had seen so many reviews across the web. I was truly hoping that i would b another consumer who had a marvelous experience with this product. However, i did not. I&#x27;m ok with this, not everything works for everybody. I am not entirely convinced that the product is worth the price as far as design is concerned. The facial steamer i think was great...but i dont want to keep this item just for that alone. I have requested a refund. I honestly think, you wont know unless you try it for yourself. it may be the best purchase YOU ever made, but not mine.</li>
    <li> the instructions are short, not indicating what to do w/ the facial attact.  It might be due to my furniture arrangement, that I was un able to achieve the steam to the fullest. to compensate I turned completely around.  there is a suggestion in the instructions: to keep the forehead from burning use wrapping paper which I will do.  maybe the I can mold my hair towards the center of my head w/ it; otherwise you&#x27;ll risk burning ur fingers trying to p/u ur hair off ur shoulders to put back under steamer.  one other thing: remove the styrofoam- I forgot to do that.</li>
    <li> Pros    The steam worked on my hair and made it soft.  Table top and easy for storage    Cons    Hood not adjustable  Hood is too shallow to cover all the parts of hair.Hood needs to be more deep    Thes Cons do not need a lot of engineering to be fixed.If the hood is adjsutable and if it covered the entire head with me not having to juggle around in the chair,I wud have kept the steamer back. I contacted the support they sent me UPS label for shipping it back.So shipped the steamer back.Lets see if the money comes back...</li>
    <li> My husband surprised me with this hair steamer after I had been talking about it for awhile. At first I could not figure out how to use it and I was frustrated that I did not see more detailed instructions on the website and did not see a customer service number, only an email. Twice, I had my head full of my deep conditioner, only to  rinse it out because I had to get on with my day. In the end, I had put the cup in the wrong place.  Once I worked this out and used my Huetiful, I loved it. It&#x27;s quick and easy now.  Yes, some hot water dripped onto my shoulders, but less than at the salon.  I just covered my shoulders with a towel.  My hair was extremely soft, even after rinsing and my curls looked really good for several days.  I am definitely going to use this weekly. I look forward to softer, more moisturized hair!</li>
    <li> So glad I made this purchase. If your natural, your hair will truly love this. Perfect solution for thirst hair. Also, it is ery easy to assemble and use this product.</li>
    <li> Used it with avocado oil, Elucence conditioner and Elucence protein treatment (to treat after Dominican blowout and flat iron i.e. bone straight, product laden hair) --     Pro -  1) Easy to set up   2) Lots of steam   3) Quiet  4) Automatic shut off when done  5) Velvety soft hair after applying knot today and kinky curly curling custard -- no ramen noodle curls!!!  6) Luscious, defined and uniformed CURLS!!! (I have no idea how it did this to my crazy mess)  7) Husband said \\&quot;ooo your hair looks touchable; yeah, feels good\\&quot;     Con  1) No instructions in my box (to be fair, maybe it comes in other people&#x27;s boxes?)  2) Not sure what to do with facial attachment  3) Height not adjustable  4) Removing the cup took some thought   5) Looks not so sturdy - so I am apprehensive about removing things  -- but seems okay so far  6) Cost!  7) I wrote this review after one use -- let&#x27;s see how it does when I go back to swimming when the ocean and pool warms up</li>
    <li> I have owned my Huetiful steamer for about 5 months now. And I must say that the health of my hair has greatly improved.I have very tightly curled natural hair... I used to deep condition under a hooded dryer, but the steamer makes my hair so much softer! The unit is small, so its easy to store, and easy to use right out of the box! The only thing I hate is that my nape(area in the back of my hair) doesnt get much steam...I have to turn around and sit backwards in order to hit that area. But I love it</li>
    <li> Received this product in the mail a few months back and I have one problem with it, the cup that holds the water does not want to stay on! Any little touch it falls off, it takes about 10 minutes to get the cup on for it to fall right off with the slightest touch. I am not happy about that at all. How does the product work? Yes it does leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized and I can tell the difference from just conditioning to conditioning and using the steamer.  I like it, and I would love it if the cup would stay on; I am very upset about that.  Also let me mention I am natural and it helps define my curl and less frizze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Review 12/2012.&lt;br /&gt;I did my first review of the Huetiful hair steamer back in July of 2011 and I&#x27;m back!!  I love this steamer it does what it is suppose too and that&#x27;s help add moisture to the ends of my hair.  I use it most in the winter it leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.  The cup not staying on was just a small problem and was easily fixed.  I did have a minor defect and I emailed customer services and let me just say the response I received from them and the short time it took was amazing!!  Their customer services is amazing, and I will continue to use this product.  The price $120 is not bad I do feel like you get what you pay for, do I expect it to last a life time because I paid a $100 for it , no.  Most important to me about this product is it does what it is suppose to and the little things that did happen I can look pass because they treated me with great customer service!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. My daughter loves the way her hair feels after a steam she says \\&quot;mommy it&#x27;s so soft\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> This steamer dryer has been working wonderfully.  I have been sharing it with family members.  The dryer arrived promptly.  This will decrease the visits to the salon.</li>
    <li> The Huetiful Steamer is wonderful!  It is a small, compact steamer that total moisturizes the hair. Easy to assemble, easy to put away. It was one of the best hair investments I have made.</li>
    <li> I received my Huetiful Hair Steamer a few months ago, as a treat to myself because I am transitioning and have been since February 2011. I loooooooooove my Huetiful Hair Steamer.  I use it at least once a week and the results are amazing.  I even use it with my Genie Locs.  It makes the conditioner penetrate your hair better and makes your hair sooooo soft. I even told my sister and all my friends about the Huetiful Hair steamer.  The facial attachment is great, too.  Keeps my skin hydrated and feeling soft.  You should treat yourself to a Huetiful Hair steamer.</li>
    <li> I received my product several weeks ago and I must say that I am satisfied with the Huetiful Hair Steamer. I am currently reverting from relaxed hair to natural. The hair steamer softens my roots and makes my hair easier to comb through. I want to thank my sister for introducing me to this product. [[ASIN:B003XTMRSS Huetiful Hair and Facial Steamer</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about what a steamer can do for me, but I have to admit that I like the results!!! I can tell that my hair is much softer after using the steamer.  I did not order the hair care products advertised with the steamer, but I will definitely be trying these out as well.  I am African-American and I wear natural hairstyles, so the steamer helps a lot with maintaining moisture in my usually dry hair!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair steamer after reading so many reviews both on amazon, web pages devoted to curly hair, and youtube. I don&#x27;t easily buy into hype so it took me about six months before I agreed to purchase it. I ordered it and it took about four days to get to me because I ordered right before the weekend. My but it was worth my anxious wait! It arrived this past Monday, I tried it that Tuesday morning. Set up was a breeze and the product is sturdy. My only issue is that I had to find a table and chair that allowed me to position it so I could sit comfortably under it.  If I could recommend an improvement it would be to change this from being a table top version to one that is on some sort of telescopic pole (allowing you to position it as low or high as you need). Anyway, back to the hair: my hair was so hydrated and moisturized I could see a difference in its manageability and shine for the next three days. I even co-washed it twice and it still looks and feels more hydrated than it&#x27;s ever looked and felt before (at least since I&#x27;ve been an adult). I am not saying that this steamer will work for everyone&#x27;s hair, but for my curls it definitely works. I will be adding it to my hair regimen and plan to use it on a weekly basis.</li>
    <li> After spending a $20 upgrade for steam treatments monthly at the salon, purchasing my own steamer was a no-brainer.  Not only does Huetiful provide great moisturizing for my curls, now I&#x27;m able to use it for my young daughters&#x27; weekly deep conditionings, too.  The steamer is lightweight and simple to put together and store.  I&#x27;ve found it easy to use, and we&#x27;ve even traveled with it.  Unlike our hood dryer, the Huetiful is very quiet, so the entire family can watch TV in the family room while each of us takes a turn under the steamer.  Like at the salon, you should keep a towel with you while steaming to catch any water that might otherwise drip onto you.  There&#x27;s also a vent at the top of the steamer, which allows you to control the temperature.  This is a well thought out version of the salon steamer that has more than paid for itself for my household.</li>
    <li> I am a big critic of products when it comes to my hair and I am so empressed with the Huetiful hair steamer. This works great for the true deep conditioning of my hair. My hair is super thick and natural and I absolutely love my new hair steamer. It is really worth each and every penny. The customer service is also #1 rated by me!!!!!  Do your self justice and buy this hidden beauty secret.  In my book the Huetiful is the best kept secret in hair care!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my steamer twice since I got it a couple weeks ago. I really like it. I am 5 months into my transition, from relaxed to natural hair. I was very worried about breakage at the line of demarcation so the steam treatments provide much needed moisture. I watched several positive youtube reviews before I made the purchase. I also have a good friend who has one and insisted that I get one too. I used to live in NYC and went to a Dominican shop to get my hair done. They had several steamers and when I could afford it, I would always opt for the steam treatments for my hair! Always left my hair feeling moisturized, soft and manageable. When I saw this tabletop version, I knew my hair would love it, relaxed, natural or transitioning.   A couple of minor things have given me pause. First, the cup that holds the water is difficult to remove/put back and the instructions said nothing about cleanup after the treatment. I have since figured out how to do it, but I still fear being too rough each time I try to empty the excess water. My only other concern is the premature shut-off I&#x27;ve experienced. The first time I used the steamer it took about 20 minutes. The last time I used it, it shut off after about 8 minutes. I added more water and re-started and this time it only steamed for 5 minutes. Oh... a sweatband is a must! Otherwise, this was a good Christmas purchase for myself!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Huetiful Steamer!  I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 5 years and I would get my hair steamed about once a month at the salon at the price of $15-$25 (depended on where I went).  Now that I own the Huetiful, I use it once a week.  While sitting under a regular hair dryer with conditioner and a shower cap would provide some level of softness, it is nothing compared to the steam opening my hair shaft and the product actually penetrating!  When my hair is feeling dry, the Huetiful never fails to deliver outstanding results - softness, shine and easier to detangle.  I am always recommending this product to all of my friends! If you have natural hair, the Huetiful steamer is a MUST in your arsenal of products/equipment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this steamer! I am an African American woman with natural hair. My hair is extremely thick and very coily curly. During the summer months, my hair has the tendency to get dry. Then I started to use the Huetiful steamer. The box states that it makes your conditioner 5x more effective and I have to believe that to be true. After 20 minutes under the steamer my hair feels so soft and moisturized. I have added steaming my hair into the weekly regimen and my hair has definitely benefited greatly from it. My only complaint that I have about the steamer is that it can be quite awkward sitting under it at times. The base is short and the hood is not very long so when I put it on the table I have to put books under it to prop it up to sit under comfortably. Despite this I still love the steamer and I will continue to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I have had my steamer for less than a year and I used it about a half dozen times.  I really like the results of my hair when I use the steamer and was looking forward to using it much more often.  However, recently when I took it out of the box, it looked like the hood was warped.  I totally cannot understand how this happened because after I use it, I always empty the water that collects in the hood and that is not the part that warped.  I&#x27;m trying to contact Huetiful to see what may have happened, so my advice is to be careful and look at it carefully each time you use it.</li>
    <li> I made this purchase 2 months ago and I have great results. It makes a difference on my hair.My hair is softer and shinier.  The steamer is easy to use and warms up very quickly. The only thing is my hair on the back does not receive enough steamer so I have to bend my head.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Huetiful Hair Steamer a few months ago with confidence after doing research on Amazon, YouTube, and various blog sites by fellow \\&quot;naturals\\&quot;.  I even convinced a co-worker to order hers at the same time because she was still on the fence about the purchase. After receiving my product within a few days, I used it that weekend and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT!  I fell in love with my steamer and use it religiously as part of my weekend hair routine. It&#x27;s easy to set up, easy to stash away after use, and the results are awesome! My hair feels and looks moisturized and healthier than ever! Any compliments I get on my hair from other \\&quot;naturals\\&quot; always leads me to share my hair journey, and ALWAYS ends in me recommending the Huetiful steamer!</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that I am NOT a blogger or have any affiliation with Amazon or Huetiful. And secondly, I paid the $127 for this steamer with my own money. Just thought I&#x27;d say that because I&#x27;m always skeptical of bias reviewers who sing a ton of praise about a product and pose like they&#x27;re the average consumer. This seamed like a good product so I wanted to leave my opinion. Now, on to the review:  I have used this steamer twice over the last two weeks and I really like it. The steamer seems to help infuse more moisture into my hair than using my plastic cap and heated bonnet. A little about my hair- I have African-American relaxed hair that is past my shoulders but not yet to my bra strap. I have a lot of hair that is very fine in texture but requires being relaxed every 10-14 weeks. At the time of this review, I am 8 weeks post relaxer (which is the time when my hair and new growth starts to scream for more moisture) and it is Fall so the air is getting drier. I&#x27;m really concentrating on deep conditioning my hair weekly, using henna every 6 weeks, and wearing protective styles to keep it healthy so that I increase my hairs&#x27; thickness and length. I work in a traditional corporate environment so it is imperative that my hair is well maintained and has a \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look.  Pros and Cons of the Huetiful Steamer:  Cost- It is a little pricey at $127. For the average person this is a lot of money to try out on something you may or may not like. You can purchase it for less on on auction sites but I opted to purchase it on Amazon because of the more flexible return policy which was 90-days no questions asked. I&#x27;m going to keep it but I didn&#x27;t want to risk not liking it or it breaking prematurely and not being able to return it.  Assembly- It came with instructions and had three pieces that were very easy to put together (less than 1 minute to assemble). My only complaint is that the materials seem a little flimsy. I have purchased other hair equipment (such as hooded dryers and caps) that seem much sturdier at a lower price. However, I disassemble it and store it in it&#x27;s original packaging so I think that it will be protected and last several years.  Height and size- It is very short and you cannot adjust it. You&#x27;ll have to experiment to find the right location height for you to use it. I sit it on top of a phone book on my kitchen bar counter while sitting on one of the counter bar stools.  Startup- It takes 1 and 1/3 cup of water before you reach the maximum water fill line. Luckily it doesn&#x27;t require distilled water so I use filtered tap water. My steamer takes exactly 4 minutes to begin steaming.  Usage- Once the steam starts, my machine will output 16 minutes of steam. Be aware that there is a vent at the top of the hood so make sure it is closed; otherwise, you&#x27;ll loose a lot of steam. After applying the conditioner to my hair, I loosely clip up my hair so that my ends get steamed. And, I wear a sweatband so water doesn&#x27;t run down my face while I&#x27;m under it. Because the dome is shallow, I steam my hair twice. The first time is so I can get the front and top of my hair. With the second steam, I straddle my chair (facing the machine) so that the back and nape of my hair is well steamed. I don&#x27;t think that the back gets steamed sufficiently using it the conventional way. You will have to empty the condensed water reservoir (there is a little plug on the dome) before using it again. If you don&#x27;t then condensed water will overflow and you&#x27;ll get wet. Although the water cup will still have water in it, you will also have to refill it with water and let it reheat. For some reason, I have to unplug it and then replug it so that it turns on again. This auto shutoff feature is probably so I won&#x27;t burn my house down :). To empty the water cup, I remove the hood, attachments and water plug, and then turn it upside down to let the water drain out. I tried to remove the actual cup but I think that you will eventually damage the heating element over time. Plus, getting the cup back into the unit is a pain.  That&#x27;s my experience with the Heutiful Steamer. I think that it&#x27;s a good product that I can easily incorporate into my weekly routine (I was actually sitting under it while typing up the review on my laptop). Is it a miracle hair product? No. But it does increase my deep conditioner&#x27;s ability to infuse moisture into my hair. This added moisture means that my hair will be softer, more manageable and have less breakage between relaxer service. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had bought a sturdy standing steamer about 16 months ago from a different maker and paid about three times as much. That was great until it broke all at once! Just stopped working. I thought maybe some water or steam may have gotten in the wrong place and waited one week so that it dries and I tried again. This time the wires started smoking and a rubber smell filled my room. So I junked it. But my hair thrives so much on these weekly deep conditioning steam baths, so I had to buy another steamer.I really thought much before buying the Huetiful, mainly my thinking was: should I replace the one I had with the same or similar brand/caliber since I was happy with it and risk having it break again a year later, or try something cheaper so that if it breaks I don&#x27;t feel as bad. Here is what helped me go with the Huetiful. The steaming operation and device is a simple one, it is no different than an electric tea-maker. Some coils to heat the water to boiling and tubes to channel the steam, and a cap to exit the steam over your head. All the other stuff they advertise is needless. I would get the results I wanted if I stood over a boiling pot at the stove top. So, I went with the Huetiful.&lt;br /&gt;The Huetiful has a light and flimsy feel to it but it is also what makes it so easy to move around. Also the old one I had would sometimes have so much condensation it would occasionally drip on my scalp. This one has a wonderful light steam that feels almost like walking in fog or sitting by a fog-maker, only it is warm. It does last only 20 minutes maximum, but I do not mind, I refill the cup and in two more minutes it is back to boiling. So altogether it works great, easy to store, looks prettier, and all good things. If it actually works like this past the one year warranty, I would say I got my money&#x27;s worth and I would even buy a second one. I would have paid a lot more in one year if I did that in a Salon. So far I have used it three times and I actually prefer how light and easily movable it is.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1)If you are looking at this because you are considering for the first time using a hair steamer, here is what I have to tell you: It is amazing the difference I feel in my hair when I don&#x27;t steam my hair regularly. It begins to really dry out and break and loses the bounce. Regardless of what you choose, do steam your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a good product for your hair steam baths. I use \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; mask once a week and Kerastase Oleo Intense once every 2 weeks. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I got this steamer many months ago, and was very pleased with how quickly it shipped and how easy it was to put together. I&#x27;m 5\\&quot;8 and have natural combo hair (wavy on top and nappy in the back). I deep condition with my steamer, faithfully, every week and absolutely love it. My treatments seem to last 20-30 minutes, the steam hits all areas of my hair and scalp, and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with my steamer. Initially, I wished it hit the nape a little better, but I&#x27;ve learned how to sit under the steamer so I&#x27;m getting the full effect. Even my boyfriend, who&#x27;s white, uses the steamer each week. And, we&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference in the elasticity and overall health of our hair. I just dread the day when my steamer unexpectedly dies and I will have to skip a treatment as I await the arrival of my new steamer. I will never, ever not use this is my weekly regimen. But, you have to use it (just like anything else) regularly over an extended period of time to really see a difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> I am always interested in trying new products especially in my hair.  I am black-Caribbean with thick and naturally curly/wavy hair (type 3C and/or 4A). I&#x27;ve been natural for 5 years now and still learning about my hair and products. I bought this product based on a few YouTube reviews.  Prior to that, I have never heard of this product.  I deep condition my hair every other week with a good conditioner and this steamer and I really like the result.  It does wonders for my hair and scalp; it makes my hair soft and manageable since it keeps the conditioner moist in my hair as it steams it. I also use it on my young daughter&#x27;s hair and her scalp looks very healthy. The only negative thing is that you cannot fit all of your hair under it especially if you have shoulder length hair or longer.  You have to be creative at this point to ensure that your mane gets steamed.  Would definitely recommend, especially to those females who enjoy doing their own hair at home as much as I do....</li>
    <li> This has to be the absolute worst company with the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my steamer from the website, and not from amazon, however, I wanted to make others aware of what you would have to deal with if you do decide to order a steamer from Huetiful.  I ordered my steamer on October 20, 2014.  I received the steamer on October 27, 2014.  I have used the steamer all of 6 times, and the measuring cup that holds the water melted and is now deformed.  For the past 3 weeks, i have tried to email, call, write, send smoke signals...whatever I have to do to get a replacement measuring cup.  I have gotten absolutely no response of a resolve from this company, and I am ready to send this piece of crap back to them.  I have written a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well since this company obviously can&#x27;t resolve complaints directly with their own customers (why not get a mediator involved).  They have an F rating with the BBB, if that tells you anything about their record.</li>
    <li> I had to give this product five stars!  It has really helped in keeping my naturally dry hair moisturized.  I use this product every time I deep condition my hair.  My hair is soft, moisturized and easier to detangle.  I have also noticed that my tightly coiled hair is more defined.  The steamer is also great to use when you want to use up the conditioners that have not worked for your hair before because the steamer maximizes the potential of ANY hair conditioner.  This steamer is the best!</li>
    <li> Please be advised you will fall in love with this steamer! I love the convenience of the product, the results it gives my, and the savings on my salon visits!     [...]</li>
    <li> I love this steamer.  It worths the investment.  Your hair will love you for it.  Delivery was fast and simple to assemble.  It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I wanted this steamer and I got it - HOWEVER, please be aware that the steam is allergic to the nape and lower half of your hair -- what?  Yes, the hood is designed in a way that only the top and middle section of your hair/head gets the benefits of steam. Your sides (by the ear) and nape do not get the benefits and as a curlie/coliy headed gal - those are the areas that I need the most moisture.  Sooo - I&#x27;m selling mine.  Thanks, but I perfer my Pibbs Kwik Dri over this!</li>
    <li> I received the, Huetiful Hair Steamer two week ago from my daughter. It was given to her by a customer at, her place of business for a ,Christmas gift in 2014. She never used the product. I am having issue with my hair and need, deep moisturizing treatments to combat dryness, etc. I was very happy to receive this gift. However, when I opened the box and began to assemble the unit the cup was not included. I immediately sent Heutiful, an e-mail,  after business hours. Early the next morning I received a rapid response, informing me that they would sent out the part immediately. I was pleasantly surprise about the response, apology and corrective action taken. I receive the cup in a few days. I placed the part on the unit and it works beautifully. I had no problems with screwing or unscrewing the cup. I followed all instructions and watched the video on YouTube.  I am giving this company and product a 5-Star rating for Outstanding Customer Service. Continue the good work that you are doing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone natural in Jan. 2011. I dealth with a lot of dryness, slow growth and my hair was always hard and lacked moisture.  After weeks/days of research on natural hair and the effects of steaming, I purchased a Huetiful Steamer.  Also I recalled in my relaxer days when I went to a dominican salon and they always put me under steamer for conditioning--and my hair flourished then. I have been very glad and grateful I purchased a steamer. My hair began to respond rapidly and improved in growth, thickness and it retains moisture now. Whenever I co-wash or deep condition I steam my hair and would not have it anyother way.  Steaming hair is a positive experience for me and the benefits are instant and lasting.  I love steaming and would never, ever not do so. Yes there are also improvements that could be made to the unit, because it does not get the back of the hair, but I turn around in my chair and make sure the back is steamed.  I&#x27;m sure improvements will be made eventually, but I still believe in steaming and with my Huetiful--the best thing I can do for my hair, &amp; money well spent.</li>
    <li> Relaxed hair + the Hawk can equal dry, lifeless strands.  I have relaxed hair and this steamer is awesome! It has made taking care of my Chicago winter abused tresses all the more easier. I use it, on average, once a week.  My hair is much easier to comb, always shiny, and maintains moisture much longer than my pre-Huetiful days.  I haven&#x27;t tried the facial attachment yet (the reason for the 4 stars) but based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to love it &#x3D;) I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product, especially to those that experience dry hair due to brutal Midwest winters.</li>
    <li> I purchased my steamer a couple of months ago. I have been using it faithfully ever since. My hair is really coarse, dry and brittle. I love the extra moisture after using the steamer. After each treatment I notice how manageable my hair is.  I purchased the steamer after watching the reviews on Youtube.com. It is a great product and worth every penny. Thanks Huetiful for such an amazing and wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after a similar product was used on my hair. I loved this results of that steamer, and many reviews recommended this product for me since it&#x27;s so similar. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this product will aid me on my natural journey!</li>
    <li> i want to say that i really needed this steamer!!!!! since transitioning, if  there is one thing i have learned that is my hair needs moisture.    i go to salons and they use the hydration hood but nothing beats sitting in the  comfort of your own home and being able to get the same effects. this steamer  was well worth the price. i have used it and my hair is super soft and  manageable. i have no problems detangeling or styling after using. when i  ordered it the company kept me informed about shipping and arrival time. when i  got it i had no expectations. i was ready to try it to see if my hair would  respond like it does in the salon. after looking a may utubers reviews i had no  problem with assembly. after the first use i could instantly feel  a difference  in my hair and its texture. soft and manageable. keep up the good work and thank  you for creating a product i will be able to use one day on my daughters hair. i also can&#x27;t wait to see  what other products you create!!</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas (it was on my Amazon wishlist) and after two uses, I can tell a difference in my coarse hair!!! I&#x27;m a natural 3B textured lady - with thick, color-treated, bra-length hair. I last conditioned my hair three days ago using my Huetiful and the softness and shine is really quite amazing. I&#x27;ve always taken great care of my hair and deep condition weekly. The first time I used it, twenty minutes didn&#x27;t seem long enough. But that&#x27;s just because I usually allow at least an hour using a heating cap to deep condition. But using my same conditioning treatment products, after 20 minutes, I could not believe the softness and shine when I rinsed my hair!  I don&#x27;t need as much styling product and I haven&#x27;t even had to apply (oil moisturizer or) anything else to my ends each night like I did before. NOT the norm, I&#x27;m telling you. ;D  I am VERY pleased with this item and recommend it to anyone with dry, dmamaged, or chemically treated hair. It will make a difference. It seems to have cumulative benefits, actually.  My daughter just called. She used my steamer during her Christmas visit and loved it, too.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, let me help you: GET IT!   Oh, yeah...I thought I would get the facial attachment, but I don&#x27;t mind buying it seperately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black woman living in the Las Vegas desert. When i first moved here 5 1/2 years ago every time I spoke to another black woman in Vegas we&#x27;d always end up on the subject of hair and how hard it is to keep our hair moisturized in this environment. Most either said that&#x27;s why they simply chopped it all off or were contemplating doing so. Since my face is much too round to do that, I was on a quest to come up with solutions on keeping my length (just past my shoulders) while simultaneously keeping my hair healthy. Carol&#x27;s Daughter products were a big help. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and continue using these products even today.   I have read many reviews and have seen many Youtube videos since October 2010. I asked my husband to get me a Huetiful Hair Steamer for Christmas. I&#x27;ve used it once a week ever since and love the results! I&#x27;ve used home relaxers faithfully every 6-8 weeks since the age of 14. I am now 40. I was suppose to give myself another relaxer mid-December, but I wanted to wait and receive my hair steamer before doing so. It&#x27;s now mid-January and I see no need to do so. With the combination of my Huetiful hair steamer and the Caruso steam curlers that I&#x27;ve been using since September 2010 my hair is shinier, bouncier, much healthier,holds curls much better and seems to grow faster than before using it. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with split ends since my teen years even after trimming the ends-I&#x27;m assuming because of the relaxers. Since my hair was growing so well I trimmed my hair a week ago and have never seen it be as healthy as it is now! There&#x27;s so much more life to my hair now, I love it and can&#x27;t wait to see how much more healthy it gets and how much my hair will grow as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT TWICE AND LOVE MY RESULTS!  I BROUGHT THE STEAMER TO ASSIST IN MY JOURNEY TO TRANSITION TO NATURAL HAIR AND TO GIVE MY HAIR MORE MOISTURE.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED STEAM TREATMENTS AT A DOMINICAN BEAUTY SALON AND ALWAYS HAD TO WAIT A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE STEAMER TO HEAT UP OR IT WOULD BE OUT OF ORDER.  I AM VERY PLEASED TO OWN MY OWN STEAMER AND TO TREAT MY HAIR WHENEVER I WANT, IN THE COMFORT OF MY HOME.  THE HUETIFUL STEAMER IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!  ALL YOU NEED IS A HIGH ENOUGH TABLETOP AND MAYBE AN ADJUSTABLE CHAIR OR REGULAR CHAIR FOR YOUR HEIGHT AND YOU WILL BE FINE! IT HEATS UP QUICKLY AND IS COMPACT ENOUGH TO PUT UNDER A BED OR IN A CLOSET.  I STORE MINE IN ITS ORIGINAL BOX, IN THE CLOSET. THANKS AGAIN TO AMAZON AND BEHUETIFUL FOR SELLING THIS WONDERFUL HAIR STEAMER! :D</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003XTMRSS Huetiful Hair Steamer]]    I purchased my steamer and it arrived relatively quick after being out of stock for awhile. I love my steamer and believe my hair is greatly benefited by the use of my hair care products with the Heuetiful steamer for my deep treatments. My hair always feel, soft and moisturized after each use. I give my hair a deep treatment every weekend with my steamer. The steamer has already paid itself off. A steame deep treatment in a slon ranges anywhere from $30 - $50 and more in some high-end salon. I believe the Heutiful steamer has been instrumental with my hair growth and health, by improving scalp circulation, cutting scalp dryness by helping conditioner and herbal products to really penetrate my hair shaft. A great product to find under the Christmas tree.</li>
    <li> I used the Huetiful steamer this pass weekend before getting my hair braided.  I received the product quick. The steamer comes with short and sweet directions. I was so surprise how light the steamer was to handle. I set my steamer up on a food tray that has legs. I set up under the steamer while watching TV. The hair steamer is not loud like a hairdryer you can actually carry on a conversation and watch TV without turning the volume up on the TV are talking loud.  I have very thick and course hair and it was very dry. Once the hair steamer buzz to tell me that it was finish I could feel that my hair was very soft.  After I rinse my hair with cool water my hair still felt soft and I thought that I still have deep conditioner and coconut oil in my hair, but it was just the affects of how the hair feels after you give it its own spa treatment. Now my hair is happy. I can&#x27;t wait to try the facial attachment.</li>
    <li> After giving Huetiful a scathing review about the problems with my order, I finally got the product and all is well! My first steam session left my hair uber soft and moisturized! I do wish that the height could be adjusted on the hood but besides that, I am a happy camper and it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last year after hearing about it on various natural hair care blogs. I have natural hair (4b/4c) that tends to be dry and needs moisture, so I thought this would be good for my hair. The hair steamer works fine, but unless you have an adjustable office chair at home - you will be squirming to find a comfortable sitting position when using the steam hood attachment. While using the steam hood - the steam reached most of my head/hair, except the nape of the neck area (the hood is just designed this way.) The steamer unit will shut off automatically after about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial attachment is great and I love using that twice weekly. My skin has responded well and I have not had the flaking and dryness I normally have during the winter months. One thing I wish the Huetiful company would do is to add instructions on how to use the facial steamer attachment - none came with my order. (I figured out how to use the attachment, but instructions are always nice.)</li>
    <li> This product is a great purchase for people who care a great deal about maintaining healthy hair, but are also mindful of spending. The Huetiful Hair Steamer is a great alternative to spending lots of $$$ at salons and spas to steam. My only issue was that I did not receive my facial attachment and I found that the directions on setup and care of the steamer could be more detailed.</li>
    <li> This steamer is a wonderful product and a Must have for Naturals. My hair has more shine and the softness of hair lasts longer now that I use the steamer once a week. Also I noticed a plus using the steamer,my hair doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry as before. The benefits to this steamer are MANY, Moisturized Hair, Preserving of hair on head longer because it&#x27;s moisturized longer.etc. My Hair Just Love This Special Treatment I Give It! I actually feel like I&#x27;m at the spa!</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with 2 young girls.  We are all natural and have coarse hair.  My girls have always been natural all their life and I am almost 2 years natural myself.  I am really loving this hair steamer.  I first learned about the steamer through my search of the youtube natural community and several naturals had commented positively about this product.  I have only good things to say about this product and find it very helpful in deep conditioner treatments for myself and my daughters.  I would recommend this product highly for any african american woman with natural hair as a stable in your regimen of hair care and growth.</li>
    <li> After reading all positive results for type 4C hair, I purchased the Huetiful Hair Steamer. The machine itself works wonderful and is very user friendly. Granted, I have only used my Huetiful Hair steamer 2x but I am not happy with the results for my hair. My hair does not absorb conditioners, oils or any other thing I used on it after using the steamer. All products just sit on the hair and do not penetrate. No matter how much product I put in my hair it stays feeling crunchy. My ends are kinkier than ever and stay tangled. It appeared to change the texture of my hair for the worse and I did not think that was possible!  I will be using it again with different conditioner. If it works with my hair I will gladly change this review; otherwise it is not for me!!! If anyone out there has any tips for me they will be gladly accepted. I would love to enjoy my steamer as much as a lot you did.</li>
    <li> This steamer is great, I am a black women with type 4c kinky tight curls and this steamer help put mositure back into my hair. You have to use it weekly with a deep conditioner and hot oil treatment. This will give you the results you want, but it wont happen over night! Get it!!!</li>
    <li> I searched on youtube for weeks trying to find something to help soften my hair as I was transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair. My hair was hard, brittle and I was about to turn back to a relaxer after my second try at going natural. I happen to see a review on youtube about this steamer for your hair. I watched several reviews and decided to give it a try. Wow!! I was so happy after my first treatment. My hair felt so much better. I am now all natural and my hair is so healthy after weekly treatments. I don&#x27;t even have to use the steamer every week like I did for the first couple of months. I am so glad I made this choice to give it a try!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a cool hair gadget, that I cannot live without, nor should you. It gives your hair additional oxygen that makes your hair more manageable, softer, moisturized, and full of life. I also bought the facial steamer, so I have a weekly beauty spa day every weekend. And, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t need any specific type of water is very convenient and cost effective. Both steamers feel so good that I want to go longer than the allotted time given (20 mins). I highly recommend this to anyone who wants their hair revived with life and moisture (especially, if you have dry hair), as well as their money and time saved (versus going to a beauty salon). I also recommend doing a hot oil treatment with the hair steamer (pre-shampoo) or, to sit under it with your conditioner (then rinse), and a facial masque (acceptable to the steam) with the facial steamer, either way you choose, you will ask yourself the question, \\&quot;Well, why have I waited so long to purchase this in the first place!\\&quot; It&#x27;s a must! My friends have bought it and agree with me!</li>
    <li> I JUST FINSIHED USING MY STEAMER AND I AM NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED-- A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED TO BE HONEST.  I HAVE SHORT NAUTRAL HAIR; KINKY TEXTURE.  I PURCHASED THE STEAMER BECAUSE OF THE MOISTURE NEEDS I DEAL WITH. AFTER USING IT FIVE MINUTES AGO, THE CROWN/TOP OF MY HEAD IS MOIST BUT THE SIDES AND DOWN TO THE NAPE OF MY NECK- BONE DRY! I RAN TWO CYCLES TO ENSURE I WAS DOING IT CORRECTLY. I HAD TO STRATTLE MY FOOT STOOL TO ATTEMPT TO ALLOW THE STEAM TO REACH THE BACK OF MY HEAD.  THE DESIGN MAY BE BETTER SUITED FOR LONG HAIR- AS IT CAN BE PULLED UP OR GATHERED TO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD- WHERE SEEMINGLY THE STEAM REACHES, BUT THAT IS NOT MY SITUATION.  ALL OF MY CHAIRS WITH A BACK WERE TOO HIGH, ALTHOUGH STANDARD IN SIZE, FOR ME TO SIT UNDER.  I FINALLY FOUND A FOOT STOOL LOW ENOUGH TO ACCOMODATE ME. AN ADJUSTABLE HOOD WOULD MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR THE PRODUCT. I HAVE HAD BETTER RESULTS USING MY HOODED DRYER AND ALTERNATING A DAMP WASH CLOTH AND PLASTIC CAP- RESPECTIVELY.  AT LEAST MYHOODED DRYER PROVIDES HEAT TO MY ENTIRE HEAD.  THE ASSEMBLY WAS EASY AND THE SYSTEM DOES PRODUCE A LOT OF STEAM.  I PURCHASED MY UNIT DIRECTLY FROM THE HUETIFUL WEBSITE- CHEAPER THAN AMAZON!! I LOVED THE FACIAL STEAMER- BUT WILL BE RETURNING MY UNIT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  SOMETIMES, THE OLD FASHIONED WAY IS BETTER. I WOULD BE WILLING TO RECONSIDER THE PRODUCT IF IT AS REVAMPED- BUT FOR THE PRICE POINT- I AM OUT OF STEAM. HAPPY STEAMING TO THOSE OF YOU FOR WHOM THE SYSTEM WORKS.  POSITIVES: EASY ASSEMBLY, LIGHT WEIGHT, PRODUCES A LOT OF STEAM, AND NICE SAFETY FEATURES. NOTE: PLEASE WRAP A TOWEL AROUND YOUR NECK TO AVOID HOT WATER SPUTTERING ONTO YOU- OUCH. MANY BLESSINGS</li>
    <li> I use this steamer on a  bi-weekly basis. This steamer kicks my deep conditioners up a few knotches. Detangling time is reduced. My hair holds onto moisture better. I am African American with 4B/C hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is both natural and processed. I love that I can deep condition and my hair does become noticeably soft with the right condition products of course. I use the Hair Cholesterol. The reason I give it a 4star is the assembling. Although it is easy, you have to find a table and chair in the right height for you to sit under. Also, I use regular tap water and it has caused calcium (white crust) build up in the measuring up. Also you have to be consistent in using it to see a change. Some see a change immediately after using. But I notice mine after the 2nd or 3rd time using it. I just one day ran my hand down my hair and said \\&quot;Man it&#x27;s soft\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t get that crunchy or dry feeling anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Huetiful Hair Steamer a little over a month ago after agonizing over the decision for 6 months. This steamer is pricey but I believe it&#x27;s worth every penny. I have been using the steamer weekly for the last 6 weeks and my hair is shiny, soft, and extremely moisturized! I also noticed less breakage. I highly recommend this steamer to anyone who desires to have healthy, shiny, moisturized hair and maximum length retention!</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair feels after I use it. I have been going threw chemo and I think it  has helped my remaining hair stay healthy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Huetiful Steamers for two months. I&#x27;ve recommended it to family members. My cousin loves her machine as much as I do.  I use it 1-2 a week and it&#x27;s made a big difference in the condition of my hair.  My hair is natural (big-chopped in November).  I was experiencing dryness, which was compounded by the dry winters in the Northeast. Steaming has allowed me to retain my length. My hair is moisturized and shiny, my ends seemed smoother. Setting up the machine is easy and it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with natural hair.  While watching the youtube videos I kept seeing ladies talk about this steamer.  I ordered one.  They shipped it out really fast. I have been using it for about 3 months consistently once a week.  During that time I see less breakage and my hair is so much softer and shinier.  I truly love my steamer.  My mother who is relaxed uses it too and her hair is so much more shiny and healthy.  We love it and are very happy with our purchase. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Huetiful steamer.  I was excited about it since everyone on youtube is raving about it.  However, I was extremely dissappointed.  I ordered weeks ago, used last night, and this morning emailed the company for a return label to ship back to them.  It&#x27;s due for upgrades already.  1. the unit is too small, not flexible and BURNS (the steam is definitely HOT), I would have liked it if gave me better results but I&#x27;m returning it.  The product is made from good sturdy materials, it&#x27;s not cheaply made AT ALL! The design isn&#x27;t good and it didn&#x27;t provide better results than sitting under a hair dryer (table top) w/a plastic bag and tons of water....same results.  I would wait for a newer version and hopefully they&#x27;ll upgrade the hood size, make it flexible, and lower the cost. Definitely NOT worth the money...at least from what the product is claiming to provide.  It works...just w/the part of your hair that fits in the steamer.  I don&#x27;t have the time nor patience to add more water and steam my hair in sections....tooooooo much work.</li>
    <li> I bought the steamer last year for $125 and i used it twice and on the third time it stopped working. Tried to reach company but they&#x27;re giving me the run around. Now i have a broken steamer in my closet. Very disapointed customer. It&#x27;s a shame that companies like Huetiful are ripping customers of their hard earned money.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product on you tube. I was skeptical about getting this steamer because of the cost. Not that it would work because I tried steaming my hair in the shower and I saw some results. Well after deciding to save I went ahead and invested in my hair. I am so glad that I did. I decided to purchase because after becoming natural I realize that moisture is a must. And I am the type of person that does whatever it takes to retain moisture in my hair. So, I purchased this product and I am very pleased. I have had this steamer for about 2 months. Steamer takes up a small amount of space and easy to assemble. Operates quietly. Plus I can hear the TV w/out having the turn the TV way up...lol.I have not had any issues. I recommend going to you tube and look at Huetiful&#x27;s assembly and troubleshooting videos before using. I did and I have not any issues yet and I doubt I will. The benefits that I have received are 1) my hair retains more moisture. 2) my hair is softer. 3) my hair is easier to detangle. 4) I used the same products, just less of it. 5) By using less product it extends hair product life 6)saves money from replacing hair products more frequently and I can get a great deep conditioner treatment at home without having to pay a stylist for it. 7)Great hair until next wash day! For me that&#x27;s 7-14 days! I have not use the facial attachment yet but I do plan too. I am sure I will see great skin results just like I have received great hair results. Get this steamer you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I used this product 3 times now. I definitely noticed that my hair was softer ,but the set up took forever  and I found it to be a little bit awkward. There&#x27;s not enough instructions detailing how to use the product so it&#x27;s trial and error. Make sure to not overfill the fill line even by a quarter of an inch or it simply won&#x27;t steam. It&#x27;s worth the money but there&#x27;s aggravation initially to get it going.</li>
    <li> I came across a review of this product on Youtube and I must say at first I was skeptical but it really does help my hair with moisture and shine! The only thing that I would change about the steamer would be to make the hood adjustable! Other than that, i would highly recommend all hair types to give it a try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I came across knowing of Huetiful from fab bloggers and I am so happy that I had ordered this steamer! I think that this steamer cuts down on time for steaming my hair vs. conditioning/shower cap alone, as well as sitting under a hooded dryer which is against my no heat regimen for my hair. This beauty supply is great! It def. conditions the hair and helps with manageability (oopsy if I spelled wrong). The costs may be high but it&#x27;s worth it plus you can use as a facial steamer (when attachment is purchased) which is what really sold me to buy this! Loves it! When I think of doing/using something healthy for my hair it makes me HAPPY!!!!!</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve done the shower cap with conditioner method when deep conditioning my hair. When I heard about this steamer that is 5X more effective, I knew I had to have it! All I can say is OMG!!! This is the best purchase you can make to enhance your hair care regimen. My hair cannot live without its weekly treatment.I also got the facial attachment which I love, love, love!!!  The Huetiful Steamer is easy to assemble and stores nicely in my small New York apartment.  When people ask me what do I do to my hair, I tell them, it&#x27;s my steamer :)</li>
    <li> The workmanship is cheap and it is not worth it. My steamer started releasing steam from the the plastic connected to the base The ozone light blinks on and off, the steam light does not come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had invested in an afforable and quality steamer. I wanted to believe that, but I&#x27;m so disappointed that my steamer only lasted 2 years and 3months to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame and waste of my money. I hope the minority owner really improves the quality so it will last past 2 years for customers that invest in the steamer for  certain reasons.</li>
    <li> I had heard so much about this product and when I decided to go natural and really learn how to nurture and care for my hair it was a no brainer!  I consider my time steaming as a treat to myself and my hair.  My hair has also had a hard week and deserves some pampering.  The product is easy to assemble and sooooo easy to use.  I refuse to pay for a  steam hydration treatment at a salon, I own a huetiful.  Have been nothing but excited since I received it and have been using it faithfully!  YOU HAVE GOT TO GET ONE for the sake of your hair.  Trust me.</li>
    <li> Being a salon owner I did not like this product. It drips water in the back. Maybe for the salon I need something more commercial. I only got this to compare this with the dryers when giving my clients a deeep conditioner and oil treatment. I did not see a big difference.</li>
    <li> I found out about the behuetiful steamer from watching Taren916 on YouTube.  I ordered one.  I tried it out the day I got it.  Being new to being natural, my hair didn&#x27;t seem to respond as well as I had hoped.  I applied an oil and sat under it for 20 minutes.  To me, no change.  I co-washed, applied a deep conditioner, and tried it again - same day.....no change!  I was a bit distraught.  Then... I decided to try something else!  Next week... I added a few drops of essential oils and sat under the steamer while my hair was DRY... NO OIL or CONDITIONER ADDED yet.  After the timer went off, I oiled my hair and sat under a heat cap for 15 minutes, then went to bed. I planned to wash my hair the next day.  Wow!!!!  Did I tame my hair!!!  My hair felt like cotton!!!  It waved for the first time!!!  It felt incredible.  I almost didn&#x27;t want to do anything else to it, afraid I would ruin the texture...LOL.  I co-washed and then deep conditioned, sitting under a hood dryer for 45 minutes.  After rinsing with cool water and applying a leave-in.  I felt like I had someone else&#x27;s head of hair!  It was so coily, and full of bounce.  It was behuetiful...and IT was MINE!!!!</li>
    <li> steam room works better and less messy</li>
    <li> The item worked well but the lack of response requesting a new cup because the one I had cracked, is ridiculous! I also stated I was willing to pay for the item and//or shipping. Don&#x27;t waste $ unless you like to be ignored by corporate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a naturalista and this is a must have staple product for all.  I&#x27;ve had my Huetiful for almost 2 years now and although it was pricey it&#x27;s still worth getting.  If you go to most salons to get your hair steamed you are paying $10 and up.  Steaming is great for the hair and what I love about this is you can use in the comfort of your home.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and the best part was one of my favorite bloggers CharyJay was on the box</li>
    <li> I have had this steamer for about a year and started using it frequently for only about the last 6 months and it has not held up well. Some pieces, though non-essential, have fallen off of it and it also sometimes seems to short electrically. It was great when it worked but now it sucks!</li>
    <li> The steamer gets really hot and I called customer service to express my concerns and get some pointers on how to use especially since I brought it use it on my hair and my 6 year old daughter.  Well, I called and called to only get their voicemail.  Then I finally someone emailed me and I responded to the email.  Never heard from them again.No resolution.  I will never purchase anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;off/on&#x27; button never worked.  Company representative was very rude and did not offer a replacement.  The rating was for the company.  The unit probably would have been fine if it could be turned on!  $129 down the drain.  Anyone like to buy a new, unused, nonworking Huetiful?  Huge disappointment!</li>
    <li> I purchased and received this product a week ago.  I will say that I was shocked at how quickly the product was received.  The steamer comes with directions that are simple and to the point.  The steamer is very light and easy to set up anywhere.  I steam my hair and my daughters&#x27; in my office while watching t.v.  Before the steamer, I was having a lot of problems with dry and coarse hair.  My texture is kinky, so nothing was working to keep my hair moisturized since the weather changed.  I must say that after my first use, I immediately noticed a change.  My hair was softer and more easy to manage.  I purchased the facial attachment also which I have not used yet.  I see they have also started a product line, which I may give a try.  If I buy the other products, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.  Definitely worth the money.

    <li> I have used my steamer twice and once on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I don&#x27;t know if I really can tell the difference in its benefits just yet. I&#x27;ve had several questions since using it that I&#x27;ve simply asked on their Facebook page and I&#x27;ve gotten fast responses. I will continue to use it. It definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt during these dry winter months.</li>
    <li> I purchased my steamer about a month ago and couldn&#x27;t believe how manageable my hair was after one use.  It&#x27;s really easy to put together and store. I&#x27;m going to get a few for my very close friends for Christmas.  Every woman with curly hair should have this product!</li>
    <li> I can see how the Huetiful works well for curly and kinky natural hair but I was skeptical about how it would work with my locs. I LOVE how so much softer they felt after only 20 minutes. I have been using the Huetiful religiously every 2 weeks or so for that reason. The facial attachment (although pretty difficult to figure out how to use as there are not any directions for it) is also a winner.</li>
    <li> This product is good for deep conditioning when used regularly. It heats up quickly, and the steaming process doesn&#x27;t take long at all. However, there are a few functionality issues that I&#x27;ve noticed:    1) Maybe I just have a big head, but the steamer doesn&#x27;t seem to reach all of my hair at once. My crown gets plenty of steam, but in order to reach the back, I sometimes sit under the unit backwards (face facing the machine).    2) I would like this product better if it was adjustable. I have to find the perfect setup in order to use it properly, which involves stacking boxes on top of one another because I don&#x27;t have a table/chair combination that seems to work. Oftentimes, I place it on its own box and sit on the floor with it.    3)Hot water has dripped from the top of the hood onto the top of my scalp, but this problem was remedied by adjusting the vent at the top. I opened it so the condensation wouldn&#x27;t collect as much. Also, get a headband or make sure you keep a towel handy.    Overall, this is a good product, but if I had to do it again, I would probably settle for a standard hooded dryer that I could use for deep conditioning in addition to creating styles that require using heat for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair steamer since October and I am in love with it! I use it every time I wash my hair on the weekend. I used to deep condition once a month because of the time it took to sit underneath a hair dryer. It was also uncomfortable sitting under the hair dryer, breaking my back to get in the right position; having the end result that not much of the hair received a \\&quot;deep condition\\&quot;. That all pretty much changed when I bought my hair steamer. I deep condition, as I said before, every weekend. It take 15/20 minutes to deep condition. Once I am done I simply style my hair, may it be twist or wearing a puff.    I have seen a drastic change in my hair since using the hair steamer. I see more shine to my hair, it feels softer and it has DEFINITELY grown since I have started using the hair steamer regularly. I have suggested that hair steamer t to every natural woman I see! I am a walking advertisement!  I would and have definitely recommended to others. My next purchase will be to get the face attach!</li>
    <li> After watching youtube reviewers on the Huetiful hair steamer, i decided to try it out for myself.  I did some research on why \\&quot;steaming\\&quot; your hair was so important and as i pondered on the reasons why, it made perfect sense.  My hair type is somewhere in the 4s (I don&#x27;t try to pinpoint the exact type, instead i just focus on working with what i have).  When i finally received my steamer i was anxious to use it!  My first usage was mediocre.  I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the results.  I was expecting EXTREME softness, which i didn&#x27;t really experience.  But i figured i&#x27;d give it a couple more tries before deciding if it were time to return it for a full refund. I am happy to say that my next usage(s) of the steamer met my expectations.  Now with that said, i honestly believe it depends on what type of conditioner you use on your hair that will penetrate when the steam hits it, so it&#x27;s still a trial and error thang.  All-in-all i feel that the Huetiful hair steamer is a great investment! Especially, for the wintertime because it&#x27;ll help your hair retain the moisture (if not go above and beyond) what your hair is used to receiving during the summer.  I would recommend to anyone that has a problem with dry, brittle, and coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my brand new Huetiful hair and facial steamer. I had read a ton of reviews by natural hair advocates I trust, so I knew what to expect. I knew that I&#x27;d have to set up my unit on a table, and looking at the pictures and videos on the web, I knew that I&#x27;d do best to smooth my hair toward the top of my head to maximize the moisture intake.    My results are fantastic. My 60&#x27;s throwback Afro is softer and much more moisturized than when I deep condition with a heat cap or with a plastic shower cap under my dryer.     And one other thing I wanted to share is my EXCELLENT customer service experience. When I first put the unit together, I didn&#x27;t understand that I had to screw the cup into the top of the unit. So when my Huetiful steamer didn&#x27;t work right away, I immediately sent an email to customer service. Within the hour, Mr. Ken Burkeen, President and Founder, Huetiful LLC had written me himself offering to help me, first with troubleshooting suggestions, and if that didn&#x27;t work, a direct contact with customer service. Well, the troubleshooting worked right away, as mentioned above, and I remain impressed by the fantastic level of customer service.     Treat yourself to soft, shiny hair. Trust me, you&#x27;ll have no regrets. Peace.</li>
    <li> I bought the Huetiful steamer based on reviews I saw from three of my favorite natural hair YouTubers. And yeah, I paid the steep the $127.00 price. Was the construction of the steamer worth $127? No, it is has a shoddy construction. The marketing campaign (using popular natural haired divas) to make the high price tag seem worthwhile is a brilliant strategy.  The steamer should only cost less than a third of its markup.     When I opened the box I was disappointed. The steamer&#x27;s detachable hood is constructed from a super cheap plastic. There are dollar store plastic soup bowls with a heavier construction than the Huetiful Steamer&#x27;s hood. Also the main part of the steamer reminds me of a measuring cup with a heating appliance inside it. They need to invest more in the parts themselves, so people get the most bang for their buck. If I pay $127 for something, I want it to last awhile, and not be afraid it will be damaged or ruined. I have a hoodie dryer that I paid $60 for that is better constructed than the Huetiful Hair Steamer.    Those criticisms of the construction aside, I have to say the steamer itself was extremely beneficial. It actually worked for my hair! To test the steamer, I  used a super cheap conditioner too (V05 conditioner), without my extras, to test the benefits of the Huetiful steamer. Although all of my hair didn&#x27;t fit into the steamer, the top 3/4 did. That portion was extremely moisturized the next morning (even after sleeping without my satin cap). And it&#x27;s very soft to the touch...and this was a surprise. Usually, even after putting in my leave ins, my hair feels moisturized..but not so soft to the touch.    So am I happy with the construction of the steamer? No. Did it work for my hair? Yes. Is it worth the $127 price tag? No.</li>
    <li> In order to get my entire head under this steamer, I sit the steamer on my ironing board and use a regular chair.  I can adjust the ironing board up or down as needed.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this steamer about 2x a month. I got it as a gift for her. Water leaks a little bit from the round plastic head cover during the steaming process, but she says this is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we&#x27;ve had this product for over a year. We even packaged it and moved across country. It still works like a charm. I hope to get a few more years out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;Huetiful had a defective plastic part that attached the water container that stores the liquid used for steaming. Huetiful exchanged this product within 2 weeks after emailing them about the defective part.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman, with natural hair. I purchased this product back in July, of 2010.  I admit that I hadn&#x27;t used it that often, until a month ago, when I colored my hair. Now, I use it every week, with much satisfaction. I also, use this on my 10-year old daughter, who has natural hair.    I am so impressed with the hair steamer, having gone to salons and paid the extra price, for moisture treatments. I am glad that I now have that service at home, readily available. I love the fact that it comes with an option to add ozone to your steaming experience, because, I know ozone is known to kill bacteria, that presents itself as dandruff, in the scalp. The only draw-back that we&#x27;ve had with this machine is, maybe its not ergonomically designed, because it can get a little uncomfortable, trying to make sure your whole head of hair receives the moisture that it deserves.      This saturday, marks the first time that I&#x27;ve acutally used the facial attachment, and I like the results as well. No more $40, facials, unless I just want someone else to do it for me.    Overall, I am glad that I bought this product</li>
    <li> I have natural 4A hair and this was the first summer I left my hair out instead of putting in tracks.  The DC heat &amp; humidity did a real job on my hair.  This steamer brought my hair back to life with the first use.  No product alone has ever made my hair so soft &amp; moisturized for more than a day.  This steamer makes even the cheapest conditioner work 100x better.  I use it once a week.  I use it with an instant conditioner 3x a month and once a month with a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> When I received the Huetiful Hair Steamer, let me just say I was so thrilled about using it because I had heard so much and watched all the video reviews on it. And just as I imagined; it did all of those things for me as others had spoke and blogged about. My hair is super curly and I wear it natural on a day to day basis, so that consists of me washing it every other day, and with that being said That dries my hair out. After I use the steamer it makes my hair feel like I have conditioner in it even after I wash the conditioner out, this makes my hair feel that soft and silky!.Once I&#x27;m done with that I&#x27;ll use a very light hair serum all over and let it air dry, and my curls are shining, silky, and, slamming!! I&#x27;m an avid user of new products that have anything to do with helping my hair maintain moisture,growth and staying healthy! The Huetiful hair steamer has done all the above I look for. And has been by far the best I have used in a long time. I still have yet to try the facial attachment, but I could only imagine the treatment I would get by that part due to the feeling my scalp and hair gets.    I highly recommend the Huetiful Hair steamer for those of you who have coiled curls like myself.       Thank you,    Lamil</li>
    <li> Okay, ladies this steamer is a hunk of junk! This product is geared towards African American women who would kill for moisture. Problem is, it does nothing. It is no better than a hooded dryer or steamed towels. It&#x27;s all over YouTube shown in reviews by women who have received it for free in exchange for a good review. This product is so uncomfortable to use, I had to spend about 20 minutes of my time just to figure out how to position myself underneath this non adjustable crap and had cramps in my back afterwards. The instructions for putting it together are horrible, rushed and very lazy. Luckily, there are not many pieces so you can put it together in about 5-10 minutes. The results are overrated and I saw none. Please don&#x27;t allow the sellout women of YouTube,longhaircareforum and hairlista to talk you in to buying this. They are getting paid to say its great but it is not. All of these products they recommend are very costly. Do what you&#x27;ve been doing, there are products for moisture that will not cost you 130 bucks. Save your money, research moisture products and stock up on them. It&#x27;s cheaper and less of a hassle. I am not throwing shade, I am just tired of listening to these women and spending tons of money on these expensive products that are overrated.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the steamer - about three months ago.  I am of Puerto Rican heritage, and wear my hair naturally curly.  As we all know, curly hair is extremely fragile and dry and needs to be conditioned constantly.  I use the steamer every time I wash my hair and have noticed a definite growth.  My son and daughter also have used the steamer and love it.  My father (who is 74) raved about the feel of his hair after using the steamer.  He said it was so silky he couldn&#x27;t do anything with it!      My only complaint about the steamer is that the hood does not steam the back of the hair.  I have used the steamer backwards to get the back of my hair, but felt that I shouldn&#x27;t have had to - not at $115.00.     Other than that, I am very happy that I purchased the steamer and plan to use it for a long time!!!!!</li>
    <li> I will no longer use a dryer to deep condition my hair. This steamer is the way to go. Apply conditioner to your hair and sit under this steamer...you hair will feel amazing!!! My hair felt like butter. I haven&#x27;t used the facial steamer yet but my hair looks and feels great!!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product. I used it right away. My daughters and I use it once a week with the essential oils. Thank you for such speedy delivery. It is great for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great for softening your hair and adding incredible shine.  I find my hair to need less after products (hair oil, etc.) and just beautiful.</li>
    <li> My is dry works wonderful hair Moisturized</li>
    <li> This steamer is the best. If you Natural girls are looking to purchase a steamer, this is it! I have had my steamer for three months&lt;br /&gt;And it is great. It is easy to set up and easy to use, my only pet peeve is that it only steams your hair for 15 mintues which I my hair needs longer, so what I do is allow it to cool down then steam my hair twice. With this item you can also steam your face, there is a facial attachment that is also easy to attach. Ladies if you are spending a lot of money at the beauty salon to steam or hydrate your hair then you are wasting your money, you can do it at home.</li>
    <li> Wow! After $125 the steamer has stopped working. I just went to go use it and the steam isn&#x27;t coming out of the hood. I read the reviews before purchasing, most were positive and there were a few that said they had problems. I figured those were isolated incidents. Welp! I guess I&#x27;m one of the isolated few. I used this product 5 or 6 times since I purchased in May. And to be honest I never seen what difference this product made in my hair, so yeah...I&#x27;m going to contact Amazon to see if I can get my money back. Horrible product. If something is going to cost this much it should work. I mean, sheesh, at least give me a solid year. This crap conked out after less than 2 months and 6 uses. Huetiful should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this steamer in May 2011, I usually wash my hair every week and I have used the steamer faithfully.  I love the results that steaming my hair.  Unfortunately, today 11/17/12, 1.5 year after purchasing this steamer, it literally began to melt while I was sitting under it and ultimately was bent completely over and fell.  I will be purchasing another steamer, just not this one. I took a picture of it, but I do not know how to add a pic to this review.</li>
    <li> Despite the glowing reviews, I found the Huetiful Hair Steamer to be inadequate for my needs. The hood is too shallow and does not allow steam to reach the nape area. The steam is not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t penetrate like professional steamers that are similarly priced. The steaming time is very short and I find it to be ridiculous that the cup is impossible to remove. This results in the user having to move the entire unit to the sink in order to dump the water out. It is also difficult to find the right fit under the steamer. Because the height is not adjustable, you have to adjust yourself instead. Lastly, the steamer is not easy to store. You either have to leave it sitting out or disassemble it to store it. All of the aforementioned reasons, on top of having to remove the hood to drain excess water, resulted in it just not being worth it to me to go through such a hassle for a weak 20-minute steaming session that was more like a mist than a powerful stream of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the unit was lightweight and easy to put together. I think it is great that the company has a liberal return policy. I returned the steamer after several uses and my money was promptly returned. I gave them 3 stars basically because of the return policy. If you want powerful steam, I suggest you check out LCL beauty and other sites that sell more powerful steamers. If you want a small steamer like this one, at least get one that is a much lower price like the [[ASIN:B005M1M8YS Secura S-192 Hair and Facial Steamer]]. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great steamer for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love my steamer.  It gives great moisture, especially in the winter.  The conditioner absorbs faster and you do not need to use a plastic cap.  What I love most is that it is portable and stores great without taking up a lot a space like the other models.  Would I recommend this product to others?  Yes.</li>
    <li> The Huetiful Hair Steamer is amazing!   I am so happy I discovered it. I have been using the steamer for a couple of months  now and already I see a huge difference in my texture and my growth factor.   After treating my 4c hair to a steam treatment, my hair in return feels extremely soft and  takes me no more than 5 to 7 minutes to detangle. The only sad part about the steamer  is that my hair is growing at such a fast pace, this tabletop steamer will not be able to  Accommodate my length in about a year. For all the newly naturals this is a perfect treat  It will definitely help your journey.  THANK YOU LADIES</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moQTK94TU4P1XN]]My first impression of after receiving my steamer...I use it once every two weeks for the summer with the huetiful hair masque but I have tried the SheaMoisture Deep Conditioning Hair Masque as well.  I am in love and so is my hair.  If you like this Review I have more at [...] come by!!  [[ASIN:B003XTMRSS Huetiful Hair and Facial Steamer]]</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in January and I must say I love it&amp;iexcl;K.I am newly natural and needed a way to really condition my hair. My cousin and few friends of mine told me about the Huetiful Hair Steamer, and I am so glad they did&amp;iexcl;KMy hair is soft and manageable and I love it. The bonus was the facial attachment which is also great&amp;iexcl;KThanks for an awesome product... :)</li>
    <li> I have had the Huetiful Hair Steamer for 4 months now and I must say that it is a great addition to my hair collection of tools. I am African American and I have natural 4A type hair. The steamer does exactly what it says and opens the shaft to allow the conditioner to penetrate the hair. After a steaming session, my hair is very soft and detangling is a breeze. My only reason for giving the Huetiful Steamer 4 stars is because of the materials used to make the steamer itself seem a little flimsy and not as sturdy as I had hoped. Other than that, the steamer is easy to assemble and gives great results. Thanks Huetiful for a great product!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I use it when I deep condition weekly as well as when I apply henna to my hair. Very easy to assemble and just an overall great experience. I usually drop a few essential oils in the water ie Tea Tree oil. Jojoba Oil, Argan Oil, Etc..I have seen a significant amount of improvement in how much moisture my hair holds after I use it (Dryness and breakage is my issue). Great investment!</li>
    <li> I purchased my HUETIFUL hair steamer  in October 2011. I was experiencing a lot of dryness and breakage this year. I discovered that my hair has low porosity. My cuticle is virtually shut down. This means that my hair does not accept moisture very easily. Heat opens the cuticle and allows moisture in. After discovering this I knew a hair steamer would be a necessity in my hair care regimen. I bought the Huetiful hair steamer after watching several other low porosity naturals on Youtube. I have not regretted my decision. My hair is so much happier now! I am finally able to deep condition and truly moisturize my hair! Its so much softer and manageable now. I use my steamer once a week on wash day. Sometimes I do two sessions back to back. The unit is super easy to set up and use. Its very quiet and relaxing. My hair is about 5 inches long so I can fit my hair under the hood with no problems. If you have low porosity hair try the Huetiful steamer!</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars if it weren&#x27;t for the lack of coverage this machine provides. For example, the middle and rear of your hear gets the full steaming while the top or front of your hair barely gets wet. I even attempted to sit on a chair backwards to get the full affect once. So sad. Besides that, not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Huetiful hair streamer in July 2012.From start i loved the experience and change in my hair.I kept my hair steamer after my free trial since i was impressed.But as luck would have it for me once my trial ended a few weeks later i experienced some defects in the product.I know your thinking well why not send it back or contact customer service oh trust me i have tried at first i got a contact telling me that i will receive a shipping label to send it back.I was not told it would be send through email so it was accidentally deleted on my part.Since then Ive been trying to contact the company(many emails and calls) to get a replacement or resent the same label do you think they have responded to me since. NO! so good luck on getting this product its a gamble.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item a little less than a year ago. I use it maybe once a month. Does a great job at conditioning the hair. However, the product is delicate. I kept mine in the original packaging was always kept it packed away unless i was using it. I went to plug it in today and nothing. I would definitely invest in a hair steamer, but there are others on the market that are similar and cheaper. Was not happy to invest over a 100 dollars in a product that didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from England and steamers are common in salons and beauty shops. I&#x27;m glad I came across this, but I which it was not table top. I for the life of me can&#x27;t find a good position to put this, I&#x27;m either on a foot stool stacked with books or in some other awkward spot to use it. I barely use it, which is a shame. I need to figure this out because it does leave my hair very soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I simply luv it, I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it being a natural girl. The only drawback is getting the back of your hair, but if you pull it up it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I really think I am going to do both a written and video review. I absolutely love this Huetiful Hair and Face Steamer. It been about few months now since I had it I use it once a week on my face and hair. Awesome. The hair steamer is the truth ladies and gents. The truth, my 4b - 4c hair has never felt so awesome soft and manageable before I started using the steamer. At first I thought that nothing would impress me. Boy was I wrong. I do used the streamer on my daughter 3c -4a hair she is 9 she loves it. Her curls look amazing and this streamer just makes both of our hairs feel great because you can tell the different it the softness, texture, and ability to be more manageable. Now two weeks ago we used the facial steamer for our mothers day spa day at home. just Lovely. I wish i had a mask to use after the steamer. However my facial was awesome!!! I was able to do a microdermabrasion after my facial stream and I never say my facial look so bright a clean before. I would recommend any person to purchase this product if you want soft, manageable, moisturized hair and great looking skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this item less than a year ago, I only used it twice at most three times, the product stopped working and I contacted the seller. There was a one year return policy that they had to honor, I have sent them several emails telling them that the product is not working, all I have gotten is the run around. Now they have stopped emailing me and ignore my emails. Total waste of money and time. I am sorry I spent all that money on this product.</li>
    <li> sucks.....flimsy, and didn&#x27;t last a year. threw it in the garbage because it stop working! still pissed</li>
    <li> I receivedmy steamer as a birthday gift in June 2013. I really thought that it did a pretty good job with the exception of the ill-created hood.  I had to pin the back of my hair up in the back,  so it would fit under the hood.  It was difficult sitting under the hood altogether because if I  sat up straight, the stream would burn my scalp,  so I had to slump down in the chair to avoid getting burned. Therefore,  i would pin up the sides, so they would fit under the hood. I&#x27;m speaking in the past tense because about three weeks ago, only a year and two months or so after receiving it, the steamer went out in the middle of a treatment. I contacted Huetiful, and I was told that because it has been over a year,  they cannot replace any part.  Basically,  the product is only good for a year.  Save your money! You would do better going to Walmart and buying a 15 plastic cap for less than $2 and going to the beauty supply store and purchasing a $30 Lazy Dazey hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had mine since 2000.</li>
    <li> I love this hair steamer. I felt it helps my hair retain more shine and luster after I use it with my deep conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;It also works as a great steamer for the face.</li>
    <li> This product is so expensive and it doesn&#x27;t steam my hair well at all.I wish I never bought it.Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! My daughter and I are reaping the benefits from this purchase. Purchasing this steamer at this price was equal to one treatment at local salons. I&#x27;m laughing all the way to the bank on this one!</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have use to help the thinning of my hair it has grow back very thick.</li>
    <li> Came starched, chipped &amp; cracked, and now makes this horrid scratching noise..... At first, I just noticed the hood was a little scratched which I just wrote off to shipping because I was so anxious to try it.  However the cup was cracked but still tried to use it only to have steam water burn me. So I contact Huetiful and they finally responded and said they would send a new cup which months later I still haven&#x27;t received.  In the meantime, I tapped the cup up thinking that was why it was spritzing hot water and wrapped the base with a towel... I know... I know.... But like I said I really wanted to try it out.... Anyway, that&#x27;s when I noticed that it was chipped and basically a piece of junk!!!!  Meant to return but with a death in the family, this was not a focus of mine... speed up &amp; pass that personal situation, I thought I would give it one last try but it makes this high pitched never-ending scratch!  Finally, it got throw... So disappointed!!!!!  I really really wanted this to be part of my routine but so sad, NOT!  Luckily there are other steamers AND cheaper ones too.... Still, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Parts were broken. Worked in theory, but dripped when it did work</li>
    <li> I have natural shoulder length hair. This product makes hair much more manageable. Definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but worth it</li>
    <li> I ordered the steamer after seeing all of the reviews on YouTube.  After a little more research I found reviews that said the steamer melted, it didn&#x27;t moisturize the back of your hair and it was a slow, arduous return process.  I cancelled my order the very same day.  I received an email that said I would get my refund (109.95) in 3-5 business days.  By the email&#x27;s estimate, I should have received my funds 11/19/2012.  It is now 11/28/2012 and not a word from the company.  Thank goodness I went through PayPal but they haven&#x27;t even responded to them!  I tried to contact management through Facebook and they deleted the comment.  I even tried to inbox the company president.  No answer.  They NEVER answer their phone (well, at least in the 10 times I have tried to call).  This is ridiculous. I didn&#x27;t buy it through Amazon, but I wanted to tell as many people as possible how horrible the customer service is.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  I use this product for myself and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  We love the hair steamer.  I will use this product for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Really good with deep conditioning or just adding moisture to your hair.  I&#x27;m relaxed and use my steamer maybe 3 times a month.  The steamer helps me maintain the moisture balance, especially in the winter months.  I wish that it could better accomodate the lower back part of my hair.  It takes some maneuvering to get complete coverage for the nape portion.  But overall it&#x27;s a good buy and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is easy to assemble for use and easy to store for later. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> So hair steaming is all the rage for naturals. I must say I used it every week when I put conditioner my hair but then I slowly started to use it less maybe every other week. It makes my hair real soft but there is maximum hair shrinkage afterward. Usually when I wash my hair i keep it stretch so it doesn&#x27;t tangle and when air dried it still hangs to some degree below my earlobe. But after is use the steamer my hair curls all the way up and i have an 4in fro. I have to put my hair in braids which combats most of the shrinkage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steamer has a \\&quot;steam\\&quot; on and off setting and a \\&quot;ozone\\&quot; on and off setting. I always turn on both. I&#x27;m not sure what the ozone is suppose to do, but i figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steamer also comes with a Facial attachment which is nice, but don&#x27;t leave it laying around because when I have guests over they think its a...... \\&quot;toy\\&quot;. Anyways, I only put distilled water in it like an iron or humidifier so it wont rust or grow microbes. I must say that it is easy to clean I put the head attachment in the dishwasher.  The unit is real compact so its easy to store and transport it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is expensive... but it definite works,  I will continue to use it, but I feel like its probably not necessary to have unless you have extremely dry hair. Otherwise using a conditioner cap or shower steam is adequate enough.</li>
