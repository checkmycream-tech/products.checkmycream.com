      <li>I&#x27;ve had this a year and the smell is just as strong as when I opened the bottle the day</li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s very soothing, it&#x27;s pure, and it&#x27;s great for many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell of lavender, a few drops of this oil goes a long way. I use this oil for my Shea butter mixes. It makes my mixes not smell so earthy.</li>
    <li> Lavender is one of my all time favorite fragrances and this oil definitely smells like pure, natural lavender. I use it with the Aura Cacia aromatherapy room diffuser and my room smells like fields of lavender. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a law student and also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. I take medications for my illness but my doctor told me I have to find \\&quot;other ways to cope with my anxiety.\\&quot; My friend suggested this oil. Now, when I&#x27;m studying, I always have a bit of the oil next to me on a cotton ball. The company uses quality lavender and is reasonably priced and I find myself calmer and looking forward to studytime.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several oils from this company and have been pleased every time.  Great products and well-packaged.  I love this oil.  It is great to relieve headaches and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the aura cacia products. I first found them at my favorite health food store. Essential oils can be very expensive, especially for the pure product. I have found these to be top of the line in quality and reasonably priced. My health food store does run specials once in a while, but now I can buy them through Amazon at a great price. They were also delivered in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of lavender. I carry a vial with me everywhere I go and inhale it often because it has a calming aroma. The very sweet aroma reminds me of mint tea. I am now experimenting with ways to use it to take advantage of its therapeutic qualities. So far I find it&#x27;s best used in an ultrasonic mister. I tried a few drops in a few tablespoons of jojoba oil and used it as a temple rub. I also place drops on my pillows before bed.    I really recommend this for people who want relief from stress and a little relief from anxiety and panic attacks (it&#x27;s like an emergency inhaler to me).</li>
    <li> While this is not the best (or even best deal) essential oil I have used, it certainly is worth its use. It&#x27;s a quality level of oil for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottle.  I have always struggled with Aura Cacia&#x27;s bottles.  One&#x27;s dropper simply did not work and the rest have funny-fitting lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, the bottles do work and the oil is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I read that lavender helps with relaxation &amp; inducing sleep. It really works! My cat even zonks out when I use it. It helps promote a deep, restorative sleep without the side effects of other sleep aids. Aside from that, it just smells amazing! A little goes a long way. I just use a dab on a cotton ball &amp; place it on my night stand. I have even put a small drop on a light bulb &amp; every time the lamp is lit, the gentle scent of lavender is released. I&#x27;ve found Aura Cacia to be the best brand &amp; the price on Amazon is awesome.</li>
    <li> High quality and nice glass spill-proof bottle.</li>
    <li> My favorite lavender blend. Great quality. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Aura Cacia brand.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for what I used it for, caution spills will be detected all day on you, a Woman in a resturaunt took a whiff and looked at me.</li>
    <li> Love love love!  I burn in my oil burners and my home has become a place of relaxation.  I added drops to water bottle and gently spray my sheets at night.  It helps me sleep better.</li>
    <li> The delightful aroma of lavender is a blessing to one&#x27;s nose.  It is very soothing and pleasant. In fact, I use lavender soap and, per Dr. Oz use it as a natural deodorizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fill a plain squirt jar with water.  Place a few drops of lavender oil in the bottle and spray desired area.  You have a natural deodorizer that leaves a pleasant aroma and is all natural.  I love the smell of lavender and even place a few drops in the toilet every few days and it is an excellent deodorizer. It&#x27;s ideal for a soothing bath - just pour half a capful into the tub; light a lavender scented candle and you are set to enjoy a very soothing bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is well known for its health properties in stress reduction and other reviewers have noted that you can mix lavender oil with jojba oil for a temple rub.  Many people put a few drops of lavender oil in strategic places like on a towel in the bathroom; on their bedding and on their clothing for a pleasant and gentle olfactory experience.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality and packaging.  The product container dispenses the oil perfectly, not too much and not to little.</li>
    <li> Received product exactly as described in a timely manner.  Not much to say, it is lavendaer oil and it is fantastic. Helps you sleep, helps calm you, etc.  In this hectic time of ours this is a natural relaxer.  Try it out.</li>
    <li> i mix this with water and baking soda in a spray bottle as a natural febreze. it is lovely and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is in a perfect \\&quot;one drop at a time\\&quot; bottle that I use nightly in my CPap water reservoir. Lavender is touted as inducing relaxation and sleep and this works perfectly. The aroma is natural, unlike some synthetic lavender products that are available.</li>
    <li> High praise for this lavender essential oil. Just one drop on a small bit of cotton placed on my person releases the calming fragrance.</li>
    <li> I use these oils to scent homemade cleaning products or for aromatherapy.  this was excellent quality for this purpose.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great anyway, but especially good in a diffuser used in a closed room to help induce sleep.  I highly recommend it to help relax.</li>
    <li> This essential oil smells wonderful, is high quality, and with Prime shipping, it&#x27;s a very good buy.  The bottle also has a built-in dropper top, which is very handy, since a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Use it with your humidifier or leave one or two drops in your bed linen. It will make sure you have a wonderful smell and peace in your house.</li>
    <li> We love this, lavender helps with relaxing to sleep and it sure does work. Rub a little on your forehead and inhale, works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I bought the 0.5 oz smallest bottles as Xmas gifts for my friends. I used a few bottles before, and it gets empty pretty fast. I now buy the bigger size of 2 oz. A lot more cost effective :). Overall, I like this brand very much. It helps me distress and sleep more soundly. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I always like to take a nice bath every night and this lavender oil smells so wonderful and it is so relaxing.</li>
    <li> I like it because you can use it just by itself or mix with other oils to  creat unique smells.  This brand makes many quality oils and I would buy from then again.</li>
    <li> Did not care for the high concentration of this Lavender oil.  Lavender is recommended for people with Epilepsy to smell the oil on a piece of cloth when about to have a seizure.  I was unable to use it in this manner due to the high concentration. Maybe for making colognes it would be better.</li>
    <li> I used it in a recipe I found online to make your own insect repellant that smells nice and is non-toxic (DEET) for my granddaughter and now we all love it.</li>
    <li> I work nights and go to school and raise kids and keep the house - so....... at the end of a long hard week, I enjoy putting a couple drops of Lavender in an epsom salt bath to find some rejuvenation w/ good old fashioned aromatherapy- Thanks for this product! I love it! - no Mama Guilt in taking some time out for meh! *MWAH! - signed, tired mama</li>
    <li> Strong, not diluted! I use this in baths mainly and its perfect. I&#x27;ve had this a year and the smell is just as strong as when I opened the bottle the day I got it.</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil!! It is great for relaxation, and aromatherapy . Great company its smells just like a bunch of fresh lavender pulled from the earth!! Very calming.</li>
    <li> Use on occasion for the past 6-7 years and finally ran out. Boo. Great aroma, not over powering, leaves an so pleasant lavender fragrance wafting in my digs. Big smile :-)  My local herb store is asking twice the price as Amazon. Hmmm</li>
    <li> We purchased this for use in homemade moisturizing oils, and the like. This is very good, and smells wonderfully of lavender. The only note of caution I would provide, though, is that it is very potent - some recipes you encounter will call for something like twenty drops of an essential oil such as this - with this product, unless you&#x27;re making a very large batch of something, just a few drops will suffice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice oil.  Took a little while to get here, but well worth the wait.  I personally don&#x27;t care for the smell of lavender, but the occupational therapist recommended it to calm my husband&#x27;s nightmares from PTSD.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few days. The seller sent it quickly and it arrived right on time. It has a very calming effect on the mind though I have yet to use it as a massage oil or lotion or in a bath. I mix water, tea tree oil, and a few drops of this in a spray bottle and I have a great smelling air freshener. I put a few drops of this on my lamp bulb and when I turn it on the wonderful smell permeates throughout the room. It is not overpowering but just lovely. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this for my cystic acne. I apply it twice a day and they melt away. It takes about three days before they are gone but, works better then chemical products I have tried before.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Came on time.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a different brand for a different oil and it was cheaper and larger... So I may look there for my next refill... But I expect this to last a while.</li>
    <li> This served the purpose I wanted it to!  I use about 10 drops in my cloth wipe solution and it smells wonderful!  I&#x27;ve also started dabbing it inside my toilet paper rolls in my bathroom to freshen things up with a lovely lavender smell!!!</li>
    <li> I started using a drop on my pillow case each night to help me go to sleep about a year ago.  Seems to help.  I&#x27;ve used this brand in a wide variety of essential oils for years for aroma therapy &amp; appreciate the consistency of quality control.</li>
    <li> I never really liked lavender scented products, because most products contain artificial smells.  I got aura cacia&#x27;s lavender oil as a gift and was told to use it for calming.  Work, deadlines, competition, and general city life takes a toll and I&#x27;ll try any product to alleviate the stress.  I dab a bit of this oil on my wrist and I find it to soothe my senses.  I still do not buy &#x27;lavender&#x27; products unless they are natural.  Pure lavender oil, Bach&#x27;s rescue spray, ginseng root tea, Solomon&#x27;s seal tea, and classical piano music are my go to&#x27;s for relaxation.  Also eliminate processed foods and get some exercise.  Sounds easy but in today&#x27;s world I have include these on my agenda.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my homemade salt hand scrub. The oil makes it smell so good I really like it.</li>
    <li> THIS BRAND OF LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OIL IS MY VERY FAVORITE EVEN THOUGH I BUY THIS OIL FROM A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS -----IT IS VERY TRUE TO WHAT GOOD LAVENDER OIL SHOULD SMELL LIKE ---I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY IT AND THUS DO PURCHASE IT OFTEN.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged. Just how lavender essential oil should be.</li>
    <li> at a shocking price here!!! I am so happy because I enjoy using it, but most importantly, there is a person in my household who has trouble with bad headaches from time to time and when they rub it on their head; headache is gone!</li>
    <li> Pretty strong. I like it.</li>
    <li> It smells great, got some to make some spider repellant for my baby&#x27;s room...hopefully it works. would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I found a little recipe on pinterest to mix with baking soda to freshen your mattress and carpets. It made my house smell so good. I&#x27;m also a nurse and use essential oils a lot for relaxing anxious elderly patients. So I&#x27;m a true believer that it really does have a relaxing side effect!</li>
    <li> I was completely happy with this product.  I have trouble sleeping and I find the lavender oil mixed in lotion is very soothing and helps me fall to sleep.</li>
    <li> I received this oil about a third gone for leaking and it made my hands and the whole box was covered in it. It did succeed in the job I bought it for I just wish I could have used it all</li>
    <li> I received the Aura Cacia Essential Oil Lavender within the time promised and in excellent condition. I pair it with Sweet Orange in a Jojoba oil base in a nightlight with a well at the top plugged into my bathroom outlet. This serves as a room deodorizer and aromatherapy at the same time. I often put a few drops on the inside of the cardboard cylinder of toilet tissue, too. I love the bright and calming smell. I have been doing this for years. I prefer it to chemical deodorizers on the market today. I recommend this product to people who rather use natural products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aura Cacia products for years.  This is one of the best brands of lavender essential oil that I have tried.  Smells amazing, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Typically, I like the scent of lavender but no matter how I dilute this product, the smell is not pleasing to me.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again or recommend it.  Everyone&#x27;s nose is different.  Other reviewers were raving about how much they liked it.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d add lavender to my cinnamon, peppermint, spearmint, tea tree, and eucalyptus collection. These smell great and add a nice natural smell to any room.</li>
    <li> Great Brand. Only one I use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to scent my laundry with so I was concerned about ordering such a little bottle, but this has a strong (pleasant) smell that goes a long way.  At the end of a dryer cycle I put the dryer on \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; (a no heat cycle) for few minutes and throw in a damp wash cloth with a couple of drops of this on it. Very nice.</li>
    <li> First let me tell you I have never before purchased an essential oil, so it may be deserving of 5 stars. I didnt realize the scent would evaporate as quickly as it did for me. Still enjoyed the product.</li>
    <li> Aura cacia is the best essential oil supplier -- I have ordered it before and bought it in stores. It&#x27;s perfect and keeps for a LONG time. Shipped really fast too.</li>
    <li> I have bought Aura Cacia before but never through the mail.  Will not order again.  I buy Plant Therapy and Edens Garden and never had any issues with their product.</li>
    <li> We did not receive this item in the bundled package delivery as promised. We received a aromatherapy dispenser (which we ordered from another seller) but not this bottle of oil. What gives? The order deliver notice claimed it was included in the same bundle, but it was not. I like your oil, but the aromatherapy dispenser is rather useless without the oil. If your company had anything to do with coordinating the bundling of these purchases, you need to find out why yours was not included in our order. I await some answers regarding this costly oversight. I will revise my review when there is some accountability shown. Until then, I would suggest that any customers buying this product from you be aware of it  being bundled with other purchases they make -- they may not receive what they paid for and ordered from you. Please correct this problem as expeditiously as possible.</li>
    <li> this lavender doesn&#x27;t smell right, ended up making my tummy ache instead of being relaxing, will not be using it</li>
    <li> I used it to smell for stress free and for toe fungus as recommended. Could have gotten a less expensive brand at Target.</li>
    <li> I grow several varieties of lavender in my garden and the variety with the best scent is hands down the English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia).  Many varieties have a camphor medicinal smell especially spike lavender, lavender officianalis.  Make sure you are getting the Angustifolia variety and you&#x27;ll get that \\&quot;classic\\&quot; lavender smell without the bad camphor note.  I&#x27;ve been happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> Lavender oil is the most widely used and popular essential oil.  It is the most used essential in my home as I like to clean with it as well as add to my cosmetics and perfume.  It&#x27;s a good all around scent that is both familiar and not offensive.  Works great on the skin too.</li>
    <li> I was told by someone at a nature store that lavender helps remove dark spots in your face and it worked! I&#x27;ve seen 2 dermatologist before this oil and it didn&#x27;t work so am loving the lavender oil.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this Aura Cacia Lavender EO, I cannot stop finding things to put it in. I&#x27;ve put this EO in my facewash, in my body soap, on my pillowcases, in my baths....everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, it&#x27;s very soothing, it&#x27;s pure, and it&#x27;s great for many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s truly a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Absolutely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Aura Cacia oils and this lavendar is no exception.  I have used it in a number of things and am very happy with it.  Would definitely recommend and I&#x27;m sure I will order again.</li>
    <li> A few drops into my humidifier and the room smells like lavender does last as long as I would like thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. otherwise it makes the room smells good and fresh. Buy and try it. I would recommend you try it and smell for your self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
    <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Aura Cacia Essential Oils.  They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived sticky.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it had leaked</li>
    <li> this is a  great smelling lavender oil.  I use it on my face before bed, I use it in the bath, on my body... it really smells nice. A drop is all you need.</li>
    <li> I have many uses for this. I put it in a spray bottle and add a little water. My sheets and pillow cases get sprayed every night. I annoint myself with it also. If the cats misbehave they get a quick mist of it also. It calms them.</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia tends to make good essential oils and this is no exception. I am using this as an additive to homemade facial and body oils. A few drops is enough to reap the benefits! The built-it drop tip controls outflow per drop when the bottle is upside down.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell fake or chemically at all. It actually smells really good too. when I run out, I&#x27;ll probably buy more of the same kind.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with a baking soda and borax mix I use for odor control in my cat&#x27;s litter box. It works very well but I always end up getting a head ache because the scent is so strong when I am mixing it. A little goes a long way which makes this small sized bottle a good deal.</li>
    <li> I dilute a drop or two of this with water and put it in a spray bottle for my dog. I can safely use it on her bedding to freshen it up and help relax her, and also on her coat to make her smell better and repel fleas. It doesn&#x27;t take much and it still smells great!</li>
