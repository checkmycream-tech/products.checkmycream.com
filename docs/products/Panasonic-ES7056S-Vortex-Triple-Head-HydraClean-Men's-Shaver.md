      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great electric at a bargain price</li>
      <li>I was hoping to be blown away by this product based on the great reviews it had received</li>
      <li>I know I am happy he is happy.  </li>
      <li>The smooth/floating head is great for all shapes and sizes.   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly great for shaving your head.   </li>
      <li>It feels great in your hand.  </li>

      <li>Still love the self-cleaning!!</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>A very nice razor, gives a very nice shave, however would probably not purchase again.</li>
      <li>The cleaning system is amazing!  </li>
      <li>I tried many ways to shave and found what works best for me.  </li>
      <li>I get a great against the grain shave, very smooth!</li>
      <li>I seem to think that just  rinsing it in the shower does just as good</li>
      <li>surprisingly, i did not get a rash from using this.  </li>
      <li>It is a problem because the battery life on this isn&#x27;t nearly as good as my Braun.  </li>
      <li>Good saver.</li>
      <li>Panasonic makes good products and this shaver is no exception.  </li>
      <li>But, my wife said that it could be good to change</li>
      <li>After two weeks I loved the Panasonic and ordered the ES7056S through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>He no longer cuts his head using a razor and his head is smooth and wonderful.</li>
      <li>Over all this is a good product, and will buy again when my wears out.</li>
      <li>I think the head would need to provide a good shave for three years minimum before I would consider this to be a good buy.    </li>
      <li>I loved Panasonic Shavers.</li>
      <li>This is a good shave</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t afford a $100+ model, this may be a good one to try.</li>
      <li>The shave compares to a a good shave with a razor.  </li>
      <li>The shave quality has been reasonably good, and the linear motor has been trouble-free.</li>
      <li>So I now have a beautiful (the design is lovely) shaver that doesn&#x27;t do me much good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.  </li>
      <li>The refills are affordable and do a great job cleaning and keeping the blades in top form.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s pleased &amp; so am I!</li>
      <li>What could be better than that!</li>
      <li>Because of that, though this may be good performance for the price, I don&#x27;t give it more than three stars.</li>
      <li>I had just always liked them.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the excellent product.</li>
      <li>Shaver works very well and provides an excellent shave.  </li>
      <li>I would honestly stick with a simpler model.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nice to not have to use a razor every day.</li>
      <li>and I liked the automatic cleaner that it had.</li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving in the shower is nice option</li>
      <li>He keeps telling me I just don&#x27;t know how nice it is to have to go over his face just once, with no \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; to try and get those rebellious whiskers.  </li>
      <li>Recently replaced this with a Braun Series 7 and am very happy, and got a great price for it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>He said this shaver gives a nice smooth shave and being able to use it in the shower is great.  </li>
      <li>I use this for weekend shaves, and apart from cleaning and new blades once a year, it&#x27;s the best shaver in its class.</li>
      <li>I would give it a very strong buy.</li>
      <li>This is Panasonic&#x27;s best so far.  </li>
      <li>Granted, the shaver it replaced was serveral years old, but he is very happy with this Panasonic ES7056S Vortex.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s tried others, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I first used it and it was the most amazing shave I have ever experienced with an electric razor.</li>
      <li>Exceptionally close and comfortable shave  </li>
      <li>having owned this shaver for a few months now I can happily report that is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, bar none.  </li>
      <li>Leaves him very smooth without the fear of ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>First let me say that this razor gives me a good shave, which is its primary purpose, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>You have to plug it in AND wait 30 min or so for the battery to fill before being able to shave.  </li>
      <li>To top it off when I called Panasoic they wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great electric at a bargain price (at 80, this is on the low end, price wise</li>
      <li>He said that they were on the market and that he would love to have one</li>
      <li>the vortex does seem to work better after a cleaning.</li>
      <li>Top Notch shaver.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been noticeably better since I started using the Panasonic.</li>
      <li>On the downside, you do have to pay more attention to your shaving technique with a foil shaver than with a rotary shaver.</li>
      <li>This razor is my personal best and would recommend to anybody.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed using an electric for my cheeks and mustache and chin, but anywhere below the neckline just got destroyed by the Norelco.</li>
      <li>At under $100 it represents an outstanding value for a quality product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the closeness of its shave.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Shaver works very well and provides an excellent shave.  The only surprise is that shaver needs to be plugged out while operating.  I wonder why?   But it works well as a cordless so alright with me.  Top Notch shaver.</li>
    <li> The razor cuts smooth, and close with no irritation.  This is my 3rd panasonic.  I am well pleased with the product.  I used to be a scrape shaver until I met panasonic.  The wash feature is a waste for me.  I just use the faucet to clean.</li>
    <li> recharges battery fast, the batteries has a great life time, the auto cleaning system works great, you can shave dry or wet, and do an perfect shaving... What could be better than that!</li>
    <li> This shaver has the new 30.000 strokes per min. linear motor, much more powerful than the standard motor and so much more faster, It will shave the heavy beards without a problem.. I love the way it smoothly removes the whiskers from my face..I have been using this shaver from the first time I saw it advertized with the Linear motor, the Linear motor is the secret to a fantastic shave,, I wouldn&#x27;t trade my panasonic shaver for a hundred of the other shavers on the market.. TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT....</li>
    <li> After having great results with Panasonic shavers in the past, I was ready to buy a newer model. Of course, buying just the foil and cutter block will be about half the price of the machine or about the same if your order direct from Panasonic. Therefore, new machine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wanted to buy this machine and give this a try. I saw this at Target actually. I started using the machine and noticed that it was very quiet but would shave ok. I usually shave everyday or about that and need a comfortable machine for such a task. There isn&#x27;t a special \\&quot;turbo cleaning option\\&quot; on this shaver so you will have to settle for the cleaning base and really, that is useless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Think about it guys. Why would you need a cleaning base if you can clean this puppy in 30 seconds by rinsing it under a tap and letting it dry? They claim that the blades will be as sharp using nanotechnology (a.k.a. keep buying our cleaning solution so we can make more money). It really hasn&#x27;t impacted the shaving efficiency noticeably. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also find that I have to shave over and over the same area because the shaver is just not using enough power? I can&#x27;t tell. I would honestly stick with a simpler model. I have to hand it to Panasonic. They usually make great products, but lately, the shavers have declined in quality. And making a cleaning base is just their way of competing with Braun. A stupid decision if you ask me and definitely something a shareholder would push for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item over a couple of years ago. The shave quality has been reasonably good, and the linear motor has been trouble-free. However, the overall quality of the product is poor. The rechargeable battery now holds almost no charge. To make matters worse, the HydraClean cleaning system is flaky to the point of being unusable.</li>
    <li> If you want a close shave, this shaver is for you!  The only problem is it makes me look kind of wussy because it shaves so close (baby face).  Very nice.  Even on my neck, it will get extremely close with very little irritation.  My other shaver absolutely would not cut the hair on my neck becuause it grows in so many different directions.  This one is awesome!  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to use the cleaning stand much, but even if that part sucks, the shaver is awesome enough to get 5 stars!    Update:    I&#x27;ve had this over 3 years and it&#x27;s still kicking!  Still works well too.  I&#x27;m very impressed!  Still love the self-cleaning!!</li>
    <li> This really is a great product !! I tried everything regarding shaving, Multi-blades, single blade everything! And i came across this shaver, and what struck me so odd about it, is that its a wet/dry shaver.    I really enjoy this razor, i use it everyday in the shower with all my shaving creams! I get a great against the grain shave, very smooth! And i&#x27;ve never been able to shave against the grain.    It dosen&#x27;t get all the hairs on the neck area and all, but it&#x27;s nothing to have a little dissposible razor to get a few missed hairs.   The trimmer dosen&#x27;t really do much for me. because i don&#x27;t have a goatee or anything. And it does seem sort of flimsy.      The Charger/cleaner is good, its loud but good. I seem to think that just  rinsing it in the shower does just as good if not better of a job, but i think maybe the cleaning base may have some \\&quot;sterlizing\\&quot; properties that are good for a clean shave.     Over all this is a good product, and will buy again when my wears out.</li>
    <li> Still using Ca-Ni recharge battery. Can hold any charge. Loss power in just one week without using. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> this is my third panasonic shaver. i think they give the best results and i will continue to buy  them. i have been using electric shavers for 30 years and this one gives the closest shave in the shortest time.i especially like the wet dry capability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned just about every brand electric razor on the market.  Braun&#x27;s are great quality but grossly over priced.  Norelco&#x27;s don&#x27;t cut close.  Remington&#x27;s burn your face.  Panasoic provide the closest shave out of them all, but have subpar quality.  I purchased this razor after a Braun I had didn&#x27;t work right anymore after a year of use.  The razor worked well for a month cutting as close if not closer than a blade.  After that it was horrible.  The razor wasn&#x27;t cutting as close which is typical with Panasoic&#x27;s.  The solution for the system would run back in to the device housing area leaving the razor constantly wet when I would use it.  To top it off when I called Panasoic they wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Keep in mind that when my Braun broke they were happy to refund me my money after one year of purchase.  Don&#x27;t be cheap, buy something of better quality and be willing to sacrifice a little on the closeness of the shave by getting a better quality razor and spending a little more money.</li>
    <li> This is a bad choice. Don&#x27;t throw away your Schick. Does not shave very well. Even after going over and over my face. I am not into the nasty day old look. Just wanted to stop paying 28 bucks a pop for blades. Guess I&#x27;ll buy a better one.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time using Panasonic ES7056S Vortex.  The first time I purchased one was for a father&#x27;s day gift and I had the chance to use it then.  I decided to get one for myself as well.  The shaver is pretty good in terms of not giving me razor burn like my old shaver always did.  The head is flexible enough where if you apply pressure it will give way to your face helping to not give you razor burn.  It shaves pretty close, not as good as a disposable but gets the job done.  The self cleaning unit does a pretty good job cleaning the thing although it&#x27;s a tad loud at first.  The blades come out looking brand new after it cycles through a cleaning process.  Be sure to take the screen off before using the automatic cleaner.  The instructions weren&#x27;t quite clear and didn&#x27;t provide a photo.  You can also run this under the water to clean it by hand if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip up trimmer is pretty weak and is only good for evening out sideburns.  The battery life seems a little short, it&#x27;ll get you through a few shaving sessions but I recommend charging it often when not in use.  Setting it in the dock will keep it charged so that&#x27;s handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> I used an Eltron for years, and considered it the Rolls Royce of shavers. It finally died after I dropped it on the tile floor one too many times. I picked up the Panasonic on sale to replace it.     My experience with electric shavers is limited to the Eltron, so I will compare Panasonic to that. It is far superior in every way. It is more powerful, faster, and much easier to maintain. A full battery charge delivers more shaves. Speaking of charging, the Panasonic has for LED&#x27;s that indicate charge level - while shaving or charging. The Eltron performed best with spray lubricant applied to the cutting head before each shave. The Panasonic made no mention of this type of lubrication in the manual, so I tried it ti see if it helped. It appeared to make no difference - one less consumable to buy. Unlike the Eltron, when you remove the screen from the head for daily cleaning, the cutters do not come with it. This makes removing whisker powder from them much easier. The Panasonic included some sort of combo holder/charger/ auto&#x3D;cleaner. I have not used it and don not intend to. The shaver is immersible, and sticking the head in soapy water for half a minute (a proper technique according to the manual) works just fine - again, fewer consumables to buy.     I&#x27;m actually kind of glad the old shaver  broke!</li>
    <li> WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT THIS RAZOR. I HAVE BEEN A REMINGTON CUSTOMER FOR OVER 50 YEARS AND THIS NEW RAZOR IS MUCH MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to be blown away by this product based on the great reviews it had received but I was under-whelmed. Maybe other shavers simply can&#x27;t measure up to Braun but again if you read the reviews you&#x27;d think this one would have been closer. I am not a burly, thick bearded man but it&#x27;s nice to not have to use a razor every day. I find myself trying the electric but after three passes I usually give up and grab the razor. Sort of self-defeating. Sorry can&#x27;t give this one even a silver star- I&#x27;d look to Braun.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these 3-4 years ago. Did OK at first, but never gave me a really close shave, even with new foil and blades in the unit. Always had rough spots, and as noted in one review, since the motor is \\&quot;slow\\&quot;, took a long time to get shaved relatively close. And if you have gone a day or two between shaves, takes a LONG time to shave.  After a while, like others&#x27; reviews, batteries would not hold a charge for long and could not find replacements anywhere. Then the charging/cleaning base unit started to act up.  Recently replaced this with a Braun Series 7 and am very happy, and got a great price for it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> When my wife bought this for me for Christmas 2 years ago, I thought to myself \\&quot;Arghh, I hate electric shavers - they don&#x27;t shave closely\\&quot;.  Boy, has my mind been changed due to the exception quality and performance of this product.  I use it every morning.  I&#x27;m not kidding, it shaves closer than any straight razor, but without all the cuts on my face.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I give it my very highest recommendation!  It&#x27;s phenomenal!</li>
    <li> DH loves his new shaver! Its easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t irritate his face. Finally after years of razor burn and ingrown hairs...this little shaver is heaven sent. DH has to shave every day for work and this delivers a clean, smooth shave every time...well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This was a step down for me from Braun and I had to return it.  The really stupid feature is that it won&#x27;t shave while it is charging -- who thought of that?  It is a problem because the battery life on this isn&#x27;t nearly as good as my Braun.  Second, and maybe this was just my unit, sometimes when I turned it on, it would just click but not shave.  I would have to charge it some more or squeeze it or turn it on and off to get it going.  That at least enabled me to return as defective.  Third, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t good at all compared to Braun.      All that said, it does shave very well.  If you can&#x27;t afford a $100+ model, this may be a good one to try.</li>
    <li> Not too bad of a shaver.  It shaves pretty close on the sides however it does not get my neck area done very well.  I still have to use a blade for a clean look on my neck.  It does do my cheeks pretty well and the cleaning system while it is a little loud (no biggee tho) does a really good job cleaning the blades.  I haven&#x27;t found one hair inside after 2 such cleanings.  The trimmer part on the side is ok but you cant really see what your shaving because of the location of the blade.  Overall I give this a thumbs up but I wish I had something else to compare it to.  I bought it pretty cheap on the gold box deal but if I had the chance to do it again I might would have paid more for another shaver if I knew it did a better job.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is a definite must-have. I bought this as a gift for someone, and he is constantly raving about how well it cuts his facial hair. Of course, if your hair is a little on the long side, it won&#x27;t cut as well and you will have to go over it with a manual razor.  I love that it has the wet/dry feature, but I wish that it had a built-in lotion dispenser.  I used to have an electric shaver (made by Norelco) that had 3 blades and had the built-in lotion dispenser which I miss.  The fact that it cleans itself too is a plus even though it is a little loud and annoying to listen to.  Overall, I gave this shaver 5 stars because of its performance.</li>
    <li> My main issue with this shaver is that sometimes it won&#x27;t start.  The battery&#x27;s not dead- if you turn it off and on a few times it eventually starts and then it works.  Granted, I don&#x27;t recall it doing this fresh out of the charger, but I&#x27;d like to be able to travel for a few days without bringing the charger along.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s difficult to get some areas on my neck.  I used to have a norelco with 3 rotating heads, and I don&#x27;t remember having that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, keep in mind that you&#x27;re supposed to replace the detergent/filter cartridge monthly, and they&#x27;re currently $12 for a 3-pack, so you&#x27;ve got $4 a month in consumables.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband with high hopes and it did not work. My husband has course facial hair and it did not work, he shaved harder and it just cut him. So now it is just my fancy leg shaver. He had to return to expensive razors. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I liked my other Panasonic so much, I bought this one for business travel.  I&#x27;ve been using the other one for 6 months and love it.  Clean shave, comfortable and self cleaning.  I still can&#x27;t believe I got this for $49.  I replaced my broken Braun and will never go back.</li>
    <li> I got this in November 2010 &amp; as of April 2011, the battery appears to be dead: it will not hold a charge &amp; the shaver is very warm to the touch.</li>
    <li> i found this razor on amazon...my boyfriend wanted a wet/dry razor for christmas, and they are VERY hard to come by in the stores...this one had a reasonable price and great reviews, so i took a gamble. well, he really likes it; says that it beats his manual razor, is easy to clean and doesnt hurt his face. but, he does need to go back and &#x27;clean up&#x27; problem spots like the jawline with his manual because the panasonic doesnt flex a whole lot. but he seems to really enjoy it, and it is very high quality. would recommend to a friend! also, you dont really need to purchase the cleaning solution...the user guide says you can use a gentle hand soap and warm water to clean the blade, so it really was a great buy!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES7056S Vortex Triple Head HydraClean is the best shaver that I have ever owned.  With the panasonic razor I get a close even shave regardless of the length of my whiskers.  Obviously if you had a beard that looks like it belongs in the band ZZ Top then this razor wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut it.  But if you missed a few days worth of shaving, this razor will still give a comfortable shave.  Clean up is a snap.  I like to take the screen off and stick underneath the shower head to wash it out.  I then place it in the base and dry it out.  A more thorough periodic cleaning is accomplished by cleaning it in the base.  The perfect razor.  I&#x27;ve previously owned several of those razors that have the circular cutting blades.  They worked but not very well.  The shave seemed to be uneven.  It was impossible to shave if my whiskers were too long.  I also didn&#x27;t enjoy cleaning the razor.  To clean it you needed to pull it apart and brush out the inside.  Then you had to take the blades off and brush them out.</li>
    <li> This shaver is absolutely brilliant! I borrowed it from my husband to shave my legs. You know....my winter coat? It didn&#x27;t flinch or hesitate. It took on that virtual shag-carpet like it was a hot knife cutting through butter. This shaver is a great investment.</li>
    <li> The shaver gives a good shave, however, not any faster then previous triple head units (both Norelco &amp; Remington) that I&#x27;ve owned. I still have to go over all areas of my face several times, but without the razor burn I always had from the triple head units. On the downside, it only holds a charge for about six shaves - the triple head units were good for the better part of a month. Also, unlike the triple head units, you cannot turn this Panasonic on, to shave while you charge the unit (certainly a safety consideration for it&#x27;s shaving wet capability). I haven&#x27;t messed with the HydraClean system that came with it, I just rinse mine under hot water and that seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, new grade 2 of 5, on 01/18/13; Shortly after my review above the battery deteriorated to the point where the shaver had to be charged before every shave, all in less than two years. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to get tired of doing that, so I abandoned it when I found a simple Remington ($17.95) that you replace the head instead of the blades (also purchased 5 of these @ $3.95 ea.).  Around Thanksgiving time (2012), I realized it was taking me forever to shave with this unit and it was not doing a very good job. I replaced it with a new Panasonic from AMAZON (deal of the day) model ES8243A. This new unit shaves as good as a razor and very fast.  I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that the battery lasts longer then the previous Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a replacement for a Norelco Triple-head Rotary shaver; what a mistake!     1. This shaver does not shave any closer than the Norelco rotary  2. It takes twice as long to shave with this compared to a rotary  3. The battery life is 1/3 as long as the Norelco rotaty  4. It has DIED in less than 6 months.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GLJR66 Panasonic ES7056S Vortex Triple Head HydraClean Men&#x27;s Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Braun electric shavers for over 20 years, so when my last shaver started to go bad, I figured I&#x27;d get another Braun, as before. Then I started checking out other varieties, and finally came across the Panasonic Vortex. The reason? Mainly the HydraClean system, and the fact that you can also wash the cleaner head under the running tap, with just hand soap. I like the fact that to complement the HydraClean cartridge, only regular tap water is needed, rather than the alcohol-based system used by the Braun counterpart. After having used it for over the 30-days \\&quot;to get used to it\\&quot; period, I can say that the results are as good, if not better than my previous Braun, in much less time, too! The price I paid for the Panasonic was a little under 1/3rd that of the Braun, another deciding factor. Finally, being male, I also like the indicator lights showing me how much charge remains in the battery. I tend to shave twice-a-day, for about  90 seconds at a time (yes, I did time myself!)</li>
    <li> two gripes.    1. Doesn&#x27;t get better after time. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;learn\\&quot; your face or your growth changes. I think they say that so the return period runs out.    2. Battery doesn&#x27;t last long. I have to wait a few minutes then it goes on when the battery is low. Last about 5 shaves, then it does this. Mine might be defective.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES7056S men&#x27;s shaver has proven to be an affordable and convenient way maintain a consistently clean-shaven look without the irritation and skin damage I had endured with even the high-end blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver pretty much daily for the last couple of years, and I was happy with its performance. However, it recently stopped charging. Now the battery is dead and it will not charge. When I opened it up, there was water inside. I haven&#x27;t submerged the unit nor do I shave in the shower, it got water inside from my rinsing it under the sink.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every Gillette and Schick razor that has ever been invented in my search for a close and comfortable shave and never thought I&#x27;d find an electric that would do the trick. I have super-sensitive skin (neck area especially!) and always got razor burn from those regular razors so about two years ago, I took a chance on the top of the line Norelco at the time(James Bond shaver). It worked o.k. but did not do well on certain areas of my face (mustache and neck) even when making several passes so I  had to go over those areas again with a regular razor (defeating the purpose of trying to save shaving time and get rid of the razor burn). Anyway, I was shopping for X-Mas gifts online about a week ago when I saw this shaver and the positive reviews written about it. At the time, it was listed for $49.99 (what a deal) so I went for it with the thinking that I could always sell it for what I paid if it didn&#x27;t work. Well the gamble paid off big time because this shaver blows away the Norelco and plows through the hairs that were left behind. I never thought I would say this but I actually look forward to shaving now- no cuts, irritation or razor burn period! At time of this review, this shaver is selling for $89.99 and is still the best deal out there. Do yourself a favor and buy this thing before Amazon realizes how good it is and raises the price again!</li>
    <li> This shaver was built to be sold for well over $100, and the blade and foil alone cost more that the price that Amazon is selling it for.  It is a terrific wet/dry shaver - I use it with shaving cream and shave in the shower for a shave as close as a razor.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I never used a eletric shaver before. &lt;br /&gt;At the first uses the shave don&#x27;t be perfect, but you achieve in a few weeks... &lt;br /&gt;You must buy this... &lt;br /&gt;Trust me</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son.  He said this shaver gives a nice smooth shave and being able to use it in the shower is great.  He doesn&#x27;t like the three blades though.  The head is too wide and does not contour to his face as well.  In this case more is not better.</li>
    <li> I finally received this shaver for my husband. He is very impressed after just a few shaves. It gives him a very close shave and lets him tidy up around the edges. He loves that you can charge and clean it in the base, or charge it without the base using just the cord adapter when traveling. The refills are affordable and do a great job cleaning and keeping the blades in top form. I haven&#x27;t found anywhere else to buy them other than here, but I don&#x27;t mind and I&#x27;ll keep looking, too.</li>
    <li> FINALLY, I HAVE A SHAVER THAT IS QUICK AND SHAVES ME CLEAN. I FIND IT WORKS BEST IF I KEEP THE HEAD WET.</li>
    <li> my husband has been using this for the past few weeks and is loving it! Gone are the razor bumps!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed. And, my husband wasn&#x27;t either. Doesn&#x27;t give a smooth shave. It holds a charge for a long time, but we don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
    <li> I brought the Panasonic Vortex Triple Head HydraClean Men&#x27;s Shaver for my husband for Christmas.  He never has had an electric shaver in his life and he is 54.  He loves it.  If I can&#x27;t find him he&#x27;s in shaving.   It also helped me to buy it because it was on sale.  Great price.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Although I have had my Panasonic less than a month it impresses me as an excellent product.  Remington razors are cheaper; however, I cannot get one with a foil head to last over 2 months and the Panasonic is a much smoother shave.  The head design allows for cutting long whiskers that may have been previously missed, this has been a problem with my previous foil head designs.  I would give it a very strong buy. &lt;br /&gt;CR Kentucky</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my razor&#x27;s performance and two other brands previously used - Remington and Norelco&#x27;s Triple Headers. The major advantage is that the Panasonic&#x27;s Vortex is water proof. The self cleaning feature is largely useless because you need a pace for it and it does not perform as well as the advertisements would have you believe. Although I guess if you have a active fear of germs it might be useful. The cleanup takes about the same amount of time for all razors used. None have the closeness of a safety razor.</li>
    <li> First let me say that this razor gives me a good shave, which is its primary purpose, so that&#x27;s good. I am a caucasian with a medium-heavy beard, and I get a generally close shave from the Panasonic. No electric razor is ever going to shave quite as close as a blade because of the simple fact that there is a screen between the blade and your face, but this one does a nice job. I have to go over some spots on my neck a couple of times, but I have to go a couple of different directions with a blade, too. (BTW, I use an electric because my neck breaks out a bit when I shave with a blade.) &lt;br /&gt;The reason that I&#x27;m giving four stars instead of five is that I think the Braun is a better product overall. Here are some comparison points: &lt;br /&gt;- The Panasonic is a little quieter  &lt;br /&gt;- The Panasonic can be used wet &lt;br /&gt;- The Braun head pivots the right way, so the head stays at the right angle to your face as you move the razor up and down (which is the way most men shave). The Panasonic head rocks side-to-side, which doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. I don&#x27;t see any benefit from that. &lt;br /&gt;- The Braun&#x27;s pop-up trimmer works better. I don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but trimming my sideburns with the Panasonic trimmer is painful and frustrating, while the Braun is quick and clean. &lt;br /&gt;- My experience is that the Braun can run longer before recharging. &lt;br /&gt;- The two cleaning systems are basically equivalent. The Braun solution has a stronger smell that my wife doesn&#x27;t care for. &lt;br /&gt;- I was surprised to find that I actually prefer the way the Braun feels in my hand. Somehow it&#x27;s more comfortable, even though the Panasonic is shapelier and looks like it should feel better. Maybe I&#x27;m holding it wrong. &lt;br /&gt;And one more big plus for the Panasonic: it&#x27;s cheaper! &lt;br /&gt;So the summary is that this is a nice razor that works well for me, but the Braun just happens to work a little better.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about this shaver.  I&#x27;ve had them all Norelco triple headers, the Braun with the cleaning system and all of them didn&#x27;t seem to do it for me.  That said, I HATE shaving with shaving cream and a razor.      I struggled through the last couple of years with a Norelco triple header.  I kind of felt like a caveman - never a very close shave.  For those hairs on the neck that lay down, forget it.    Anyhow, I bought one of these and was really shocked and amazed.  I shaved with a razor to compare and this is as close to the razor as I can get. On top of that, it is a treat to take this shaver in the shower and shave with gel and then wash the whole thing out.    Why did I wait so long to try this?    Edit - 30 days later:    Still feel the same about this shaver. This is simply the closest shave I have gotten from an electric shaver. The shave compares to a a good shave with a razor.  Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> This is Panasonic&#x27;s best so far.  I have had many and they fixed all flaws with this model.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver a few weeks ago.  I&#x27;m pleased with the closeness of its shave.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed that I apparently need to purchase cleaning cartridges in order to maintain its cleanliness.  I&#x27;ll determine later if I need to continue buying these cleaning cartridges or if manually cleaning is good enough.  All in all, I&#x27;m please with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited about getting this shaver.  It was a gift from my wife, and her intent and mine was that I could stop buying disposable razor blades.  The shaver came with an insert that urged me to keep going for at least a month, so my skin would get used to it.  I did.  I missed the return deadline, because I really wanted, hoped and dreamed that the razor would eventually perform as I had initially believed it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have rough skin or a stiff beard.  I have soft skin and a soft beard, and this razor gets about 83% of the beard, misses the rest.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I go over the same areas for 3 minutes or 8 minutes, if I want a clean shave, I need to use a razor to get my cheeks and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Panasonic, and they were helpful in that they provided me with a list of stuff to send with a return, but promised only to replace it with another of the same unit if, after testing, the unit was defective.  That seems pointless, as I&#x27;m guessing that the razor isn&#x27;t defective, it just doesn&#x27;t perform as the marketing statements lead one to believe.  So I now have a beautiful (the design is lovely) shaver that doesn&#x27;t do me much good.  Caveat emptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one place where I does hold some value is if I need a quick shave in order to kiss my wife, as it gets the area around my mouth pretty well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric shaver for a while, since my old Norelco was dropped and was exploded. I enjoyed using an electric for my cheeks and mustache and chin, but anywhere below the neckline just got destroyed by the Norelco. I&#x27;m not sure who came up with the concept of using three discs to cut hair from your face, but they should be beaten. My neck would turn red, get rashes, and the hair would not have been cut at all. So, Norelcos are out. I wanted a wet/dry shaver, so I discounted the Braun models (which are expensive and according to a friend less-than-ideal as a shaver), and I began looking. This Panasonic caught my eye, but there were dozens of models with basically the same technology and features, with random price fluctuations. It breaks down like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES8078S is basically this model with a new \\&quot;Linear\\&quot; motor. There is basically no difference in performance, but the new motor makes this one cost 30 bucks more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the ES8077S is as the above one, but is a Gold color. Also 110 bucks as of this review, and both of these come with the Vortex cleaning stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on and on and on.... there are dozens of these little choices, with tiny differences and random price changes and so forth. Its this way with Norelco, too, but it&#x27;s annoying and looking for a new razor was a big pain. Hopefully this review will help if you&#x27;re in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with this one. It went on sale the other weekend for 49.99 - 70% off! - and I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer. I got it the other day and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works great. That&#x27;s the main thing I care about - My first shave, my second and my third are all perfect, razor close with NO IRRITATION! It says that normally your face needs 30 days to adjust from a blade, but the only thing my face needed to adjust to was the lack of razor burn and nicks. I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 and a Quattro, but this is just as smooth. My neck is perfect, too - the head doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it&#x27;s been noticeably better since I started using the Panasonic. I used it dry the first two days and then tried a wet shave out of the shower for the third, and the wet shave was great! I wasn&#x27;t expecting an electric to perform this well, but I treated it just like a blade and the results are the same. The wet shave was (BARELY) closer, but only marginally, and I&#x27;ve been happy with the results. It&#x27;s as quiet as an electric as I&#x27;ve ever used, and while certainly not silent, it&#x27;s quiet enough to not wake roommates who are still sleeping, which is all I need in terms of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to other features...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Vortex cleaning stand works very well. It is a little noisy for the first 15 minutes, but no more than a dryer or television in the background. The cleaning cartridges work for six months and I&#x27;ve only used the cleaning setting once for three shaves, so this seems like it&#x27;ll last well, especially since a 3 pack of cartridges for the cleaning solution is only 10 bucks here. Also, you can use just soap and water to clean the shaver and it works just as well if you don&#x27;t want to pony up the dough, but seeing as how I used to drop 10 dollars every four weeks for new blade cartridges, paying those 10 every 1.5 years seems like a deal. It also has settings for just drying, just cleaning, cleaning and drying, charging, charging and cleaning, charging cleaning and drying... whatever you need, this can accommodate your needs, and it looks pretty good, too. Not too stainless-steel-black-marble-countertop in looks, and not too soft, either. The black stand and this blue/silver/black shaver look great, and more importantly, feel good in your hand. It&#x27;s very well made, heavy enough to feel solid and waterproof. You can take it in the shower with no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These may seem like little things, but all the intagibles are here - noise, feel, look, etc. - and that really matters when you get a shaver youwant to keep around for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great electric at a bargain price (at 80, this is on the low end, price wise [Norelco&#x27;s top of the line is 200, Braun is about 140, and even Panasonic&#x27;s other models can reach mid 150s], but performs beautifully. Buy this and you won&#x27;t be sorry!r you want to keep around for a few years.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great electric at a bargain price (at 80, this is on the low end, price wise [Norelco&#x27;s top of the line is 200, Braun is about 140, and even Panasonic&#x27;s other models can reach mid 150s], but performs beautifully. Buy this and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Look no further, because this is the one.  I&#x27;ve researched tons of different shavers, not to mention thrown away tons of money doing it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But having owned this shaver for a few months now I can happily report that is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, bar none.  It&#x27;s attractive, solidly built, and in my opinion a steal at eighty bucks.  The competitors are more expensive and most can&#x27;t even be used in the wet/dry setting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t think of much to fault with this shaver.  I will hold on to it until it literally falls apart.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver about 6 months ago i hardly used it and within 10 uses it died on me. it never recharges and doesnt turn on moreover the company&#x27;s return policy is worst in the universe.my only advice  DONT BUY THIS SHAVER.thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 6 or 7 different Panasonic wet/dry shavers over the past 12 or so years.This one gives the closest shave yet.The cleaning function,though loud,works well.This one is the best at fitting the hand and following the contours of the face.We&#x27;ll see how long the foil/blades stay \\&quot;sharp\\&quot;,as my tough beard seems to be a chllenge as time goes on.  EDIT COMMENT:Now almost two years later,after changing blade and foil 6 months ago,I&#x27;m not as satisfied with how long it takes,going back and forth,to get a close shave.When the razor was new,the shave seemed closer and smoother than with the replacement bade/foil set.I don&#x27;t think the \\&quot;status\\&quot; indicator light has ever worked properly on the cleaning unit-this makes it difficult to know when to replace the cleaning cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers for about 8 years.  This is my third one, and I purchased it as a GoldBox Special.  Comsidering it costs $25.00 to $50.00 to replace blades and screens, and this one cost $49.99, new, it was a no-brainer.  I personally like electric shavers (razors are too tough on my face) and the wet ability of these is well worth the price. If you use an electric, you should definitely try the wet/dry type.</li>
    <li> I have used many razors in my 40 years to include Norelco and Remington electric razors. I had given up on electric or high priced regular razors.  For a few years I have used the standard Bic razors you by in the dozen packs.  They were cheap and effective. I have very heavy facial hair and since I&#x27;m in the military I shave every day and I also shave my head at least 2 or 3 times a week.  I do a lot of shaving which happens to be my least favorite task in the world.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I finally found a store in the little town by my base that sells Panasonic razors.  Well they had one model which was out dated for the price of the newest model available.  I asked them their return policy and promptly bought the over priced razor.  It does take a little while to get use to and it may irritate your face.  My neck gets irritated easily and this was no exception.  After two weeks I loved the Panasonic and ordered the ES7056S through Amazon.  I then took the one I had been using back for my full refund.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does shave as close as a blade, so if you have any small bumps or pimples at may nick them.  It provides a smooth shave and the charge last me one week.  I also bought a pack of the cleaning cartridges. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I clean my razor after every use with a squirt or two of liquid hand soap and hot water; also I use the sonic cleaning speed.  Then I dry it off and place it back on my shelf.  When my razor needs a charging I place it in the charging/cleaning stand and give it the complete works (charge, clean &amp; dry).  Depending on how the water solution is I replace the cartridges every 10 to 12 cleanings. A cartridge lasts me three months, so don&#x27;t let the cost of them deter you from buying this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now the best thing about this razor is the dry/wet option.  I tried many ways to shave and found what works best for me.  I wet my face and head with hot/warm water and apply a small amount of shaving gel (the cheapest works) to make it slick.  Iuse the gel to lubricate and nothing more.  I tried the best shaving oils such as All Natural Shaving Oil from Pacific Shaving Company and found I need to use twice the recommended amount on my face to make it work, plus the same amount again on my head, multiplied by the number of times I shave just makes it not worth the price.  If you&#x27;re part way through a shave and you need a bit of moister just run it under the sink for a second and continue on.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving in the shower is nice option but water does not make a very good lubricant.  It rates just above a dry shave with an electric razor.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor does all the work and gives the same powerful shave from the first to the last on a charge.  The smooth/floating head is great for all shapes and sizes.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have never found a razor that truly is easy or comfortable to hold, especially since I shave such a big area, but this is one of the better ones.  It&#x27;s truly great for shaving your head.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still a skeptic just find a Panasonic at a local store and give it a try.  Most places have an easy return policy and they will explain it at their customer service desk if you ask. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my husband for Christmas, 2006.  He thinks it is the best thing since sliced bread.  Granted, the shaver it replaced was serveral years old, but he is very happy with this Panasonic ES7056S Vortex.  He keeps telling me I just don&#x27;t know how nice it is to have to go over his face just once, with no \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; to try and get those rebellious whiskers.  I know I am happy he is happy.  Plus the price was very reasonable.  I feel it was money well spent.  A very good product &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for about ten years now, and wanted to upgrade from my 2003 \\&quot;LINEAR\\&quot; model to the new generation of shavers. Both Panasonic and Braun have really been pushing their versions of HydraClean systems, so I went with Panasonic&#x27;s ES7056S, as it is submersable.  After 45 days of daily use, I can report that the RPM&#x27;s generated by the unit are painfully slow, making for long shaving sessions.  The sideburn trimmer is clumsily located on the back side of the shaver, is only about an inch wide, and is flimsy.  The HydraClean self-cleaning cradle is more or less a gimmick; you can get equal cleaning results by immersing the unit in plain soap and water for a few seconds.  The HydraClean system requires the consumer to purchase additional cleaning pods over time~ helping Panasonic&#x27;s bottom line, but wasting the consumer&#x27;s time and money.  When considering an electric razor, forget about all of the gimmicks~ look at how many RPM&#x27;s the shaver produces.  The higher the number, the faster the shave.  This one is s-l-o-w.</li>
    <li> I wrote a fairly negative review of this after using it just twice.  I started it off with some tough jobs -- my first shave with it was five days or so of stubble -- and the battery life was unimpressive, and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks, my opinion of it has risen slightly.  Shaving just one day&#x27;s growth doesn&#x27;t chew through the battery nearly so quickly.  And after using it for a bit, I got better at using it effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does give a very close, comfortable shave for much of my face; better, I think, than the Norelco I&#x27;d been using for the past ten years or so.  But it doesn&#x27;t perform as well with the concave contours, like the neck or the back of the jaw.  Because of that, though this may be good performance for the price, I don&#x27;t give it more than three stars.</li>
    <li> The shaver did a good job of shaving, but its battery went low very fast (after 2 shaves of 4-5 minutes in about 4-5 days). One time the indicator showed high battery but before I finished the job it went off. What sucks most is that the shaver doesn&#x27;t work while charging!!!  Also, the battery will get worse after a year or two so you would have to either replace the battery or buy a new unit.  Also, I didn&#x27;t like shaving in the wet mode with soap/foam on my face, because the shaved hairs got stuck on my skin so I couldn&#x27;t tell what parts are shaved and what parts not!</li>
    <li> Replacement blades and screens are very expensive.,  After this one bit the dust,  I got my husband a battery operated electric shaver for 10 dollars.  He loves it and carry&#x27;s it in his truck.  I suggest you look into the cheaper one, for ten dollars when it wears out, throw it away and get yourself a new one.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great and the cleaning system really works, EXCEPT for the fact that the vibrations cause the hold down arm to work loose. Sometimes it separates while the shaver is on and it runs totally down, other times it separates while still cleaning and the shaver sits in the fluid. I finally got a large rubber band that I put under the base and around the hold down arm during the cleaning and it is working fine now. I would give the product a 5 star rating otherwise.</li>
    <li> I ha had trouble with the razor cutting my neck/throat hair. It says to stretch the skin but it still does not get all the hair. The Cleaning is good and handy and yes the arm wiggles loose. I will have to stick with my bladed razor.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. I bought it for my dad. Panasonic really stands behind its products.</li>
    <li> This shaver works beautifully.  It charges so quickly.  It feels great in your hand.  It shaves very close and it did not take me long to get used to it.  I also like the self cleaning recharger.  It cleans the blades very well and it is like taking a shave with a new razor every day.</li>
    <li> Technically, the Panasonic Vortex Triple Head is a most excellent shaver with one BIG problem, which is that it&#x27;s vibrations emit dangerous levels of ELF (Extra Law Frequency) radiation that is destructive to neurons in the brain that are just a few centimeters away from its head when shaving. I used a special device (Extech Instruments) to measure this and it has by far the highest levels when compared to Braun and Phillips, both of which have safe levels. For the technically minded, the Braun 7570 emits 0.5 Tesla/5 Gaus while the Panasonic emits up to 50 (fifty!) Gaus which is up tp 10 times the radiation emitted by Braun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just a little warning to my fellow men...</li>
    <li> i have not tried an electric razor in years, but i was tired of nicks from my razor.  surprisingly, i did not get a rash from using this.  the vortex does seem to work better after a cleaning.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaver at a great price.  I will never use a rotory shaver again!  This panasonic shaver does a fantastic job on flat surfaces such as the cheek and the upper lip AND seems to hold it&#x27;s own on the more curved surfaces of the face.  I use the shaver wet with a little shaving gel and it seems to produce better results that way.    Pros:  Exceptionally close and comfortable shave  Works best wet with a little shave gel  cleaner base works well and leaves the shaver fresh and clean  Shaves the upper lip very well (which is always a problem with rotory shavers)    Cons:  Both shaving and cleaning can be relatively noisy  Has occasional difficulty with longer hairs (as do most electric shavers)    Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this panasonic shaver.  After reading a TON of reviews and refusing to pay the outrageous price that some companies are charging, I decided on this Vortex shaver.  I also considered the linear drive model, but at the time the price difference didn&#x27;t seem justifiable.    3 month update:  I&#x27;ve been using this shaver pretty much every day for the past 3 months and am still impressed with the results.  For my daily shave I use a non foaming shave cream which seems to give the best shave with the least discomfort.  The cleaning base seems to also do a very good job.  I generally use it every third day or so to extend the life of the solution.  I&#x27;m guessing you can get the shaver just as clean manually, but it&#x27;s really convenient to just set the thing up and let it run while I&#x27;m heading out the door!  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and about a year and a half it quiet cleaning and charging the razor.  I would not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Good saver. The cleaning system is noisy, but it seems to work okay. It has plenty of power and shaves really close. I think the previous owner/user did not let it discharge completely, because it drops to low power and cuts out way too soon!</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes good products and this shaver is no exception.  I still haven&#x27;t seen an electric razor that can give me smooth skin without using a regular razor first.  I like the wet/dry system because I like having my face wet when shaving.  The charger/cleaner is definitely loud and takes a while to do it all, but I rather have a cleaner shaver than a dirty one.  So far I would it give it 4/5 stars!</li>
    <li> First, allow me to preface my review by stating that prior to buying this shaver, I used Gillette&#x27;s Mach3 razor for several years.  I decided to try an electric to save time and to lessen the damage that shaving does to my neckline.  I use my shaver before showering.    The dry shave with this unit is slow: as slow as breaking out the shaving cream and getting it done the old-fashioned way.  It has a difficult time with whorl areas of growth, but I imagine most shavers would.  The shave is pretty good while not quite razor-quality, but it is less irritating to my skin and I consider it to be better than a razor shave overall.      The cleaning unit is a waste of time and energy, and quite loud to boot.  It seems designed to wear the shaver out as quickly as possible.  After using the cleaning unit a few times, I now squirt a bit of handsoap onto the blades then run the shaver a minute until it foams through the grille mesh.  Contrary to the propaganda included in the packaging, this is all the shaver needs to be cleaned.  Panasonic&#x27;s five-dollar soap solution is not some magic liquid whetstone.    The battery life is good--about 10 days or so of once-daily use.  The LED battery life indicators are worthless, as mine will stop running while the LEDs indicate medium battery life.  I&#x27;ve never had the shaver stop because of low battery power while running; it will just refuse to come back on after it&#x27;s been switched off, so I tend to finish my shave completely before turning the razor off.    All taken in all, I am not terribly impressed with this shaver&#x27;s value for the price.  I think the head would need to provide a good shave for three years minimum before I would consider this to be a good buy.    Edit: After about 3 months use, the shaver&#x27;s charge now lasts only four days.  I&#x27;m dissatisfied with this purchase.    Edit, 6/25/2010: My Panasonic ES7056S now loses its charge after a day after somewhere around 100 charge cycles and I am looking for a new shaver.  This battery (apparently NiCad?) is a disappointment to say the least.  Two years of use for ~$80 is not a good value and I will not be buying another Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> Threw out my old electric after getting this. Great shave. My only complaint is that the sideburn trimmer does not trim mustasche very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for Ed before Xmas &amp; he truly enjoys this because it&#x27;s smooth &amp; pivots the way he likes it!  This model automatically cleans itself. I know we&#x27;ll need to get additional cartridges, but they come in a pack of 3 &amp; last over 3 months so that extra $15 will be worth it. It recharges fast &amp; provides the option of a Wet or a Dry shave. He&#x27;s pleased &amp; so am I!</li>
    <li> This is a good shave but I have my doubt about the cleaning unit it shuts down after cleaning without going thru the drying phase. I have to restart and set to dry only. It has settings to set it up for recharge,clean,and dry but always turns it self off after the first process.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my birthday in 2008. I usually use a non electric razor.  I was excited that I could get this razor wet and use shaving cream.  Unfortunately the razor left my face feeling chafed.  After using the razor for maybe 10 times I put it away for a few months.  Later, I tried to use the razor and it would not turn on!  I tried recharging and tried turning the switch on and off, no sound out of the razor.     I got hold of Panasonic.  I was excited to hear that there is a 1 year warranty on their product, they even offered to send me a free shipping label. They LIED to me!  I called them 5 times in 15 days asking what happened to the email they were supposed to send me.  They told me they mailed me a coupon, I never got it.  Today when I called they told me they were having problems getting the shipping labels to customers!  They offered to reimburse me for mailing my unit to them.  I am shipping it today.  Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> A very nice razor, gives a very nice shave, however would probably not purchase again. The battery has not held a charge well even new and now gets only about 2 shaves before needing recharged.</li>
    <li> Only lasted a few seconds on a charge. Amazon would not take it back because it was from a different store. Sent it Panasonic. They sent it back with the same problem. It was not any less than any of the higher end, better ones. Because of this product and the crappy service and crappy repair I will not longer but Panasonic products. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> Bought this in February of 2008 so it is ~20 months old right now.  No longer holds a charge for more than a day or two. Have to leave it on constant charge to be sure of being able to use it.  Since new it has often refused to start if switched off in the middle of a shave and quickly turned back on.  Setting it in the charger for a couple of minutes required to get it going again.  Battery technology in this thing was obviously not a strong point and not at all what I expected for a fairly expensive (at time of purchase) shaver.  Cleaning cycle does not always dry the shaver properly.  The smell of the shave head after cleaning isn&#x27;t the greatest - not at all fresh smelling the way I expected.  Cleaning cycle not sufficient to deep clean razor - manual brushing and rinsing is still required periodically.  Slow shaving and have to go over and over a couple of places on my neck, probably go over everything 2-3 times routinely.  Some neck hairs almost never do actually get cut.  Will probably throw this out when I am finished with the last few cleaning cartridges I have on hand.  Very disappointed in this shaver.</li>
    <li> I use this for weekend shaves, and apart from cleaning and new blades once a year, it&#x27;s the best shaver in its class.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one of these a couple of years ago.  The shave is just fine.  The problem is that, after a year, the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I&#x27;d shave once and have to recharge.  Then, it got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t even hold a charge RIGHT AFTER CHARGING.  I had to pull it off the charger and be ready to shave right before it was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured this just needed a new battery.  Problem is you can&#x27;t get new batteries for this.  So, I bought a second, hoping that this was just an isolated case.  I mean, at this price, buying one a year really isn&#x27;t saving any money over blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It happened again.  I won&#x27;t be buying a third one of these.  Instead, I&#x27;ll be looking for one by another company.</li>
    <li> Shaver works very well, wet or dry.  The cleaning system is amazing!  I use water usually and let the shaver do it&#x27;s cleaning once a week to extend the blade life.  Stupid and confusing manual though.</li>
    <li> I tried it for 3 weeks with combination of dry and in shower and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I don&#x27;t have that tough a beard, yet I am back to the expensive cartridges that sent me trying an electric.  See if you can try it before you buy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. He&#x27;s tried others, but this one is by far the best.  Leaves him very smooth without the fear of ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with electric shavers for about 14 years now. I find that the rotary models irritate my face, especially the neck, so I always buy foil shavers, and I have always bought Panasonic Shavers because they are Wet/Dry shavers whereas Braun shavers are not, and also because Braun Shavers seem to get warmer on the foil while in operation. So far I have owned 3 Panasonic Shavers, as they have always lasted me a very long time, and they shave very closely, almost like a razor would. This is the best I have owned. It is very comfortable on the face, shaves very closely,and continues to be easy to clean (like other Wet/Dry Shavers).     On the downside, you do have to pay more attention to your shaving technique with a foil shaver than with a rotary shaver. With rotary shavers, you just have to give them a circular motion (like you would \\&quot;wax\\&quot; a car)all over your face and you are done. With the foil shaver you have to follow the same shaving patterns as you would with a conventional razor. The result is that it takes a little longer to shave with a foil shaver, but in my opinion the extra effort is worth it because the shave is closer and you get less irritation.</li>
    <li> I am only 21 years old, but have been shaving since I was about 13 ro 14 years old. My first razor was one with the three rotary heads. I always thought those were nice, so everytime I would purchase a new razor, it would be one of these rotary razors. September of 2007 I was notified that I would be getting deployed and I needed a new razor anyway. I figured this would be the perfect time to get one. I did a lot of research on razors finding out which ones had automatic voltage converters so that it would be compatible with a higher voltage overseas. There were many that came with this feature so I then had to decide what to go with. I was skeptical of going to this type of razor since I had used the rotary type for about 7-8 years. I had just always liked them. But, my wife said that it could be good to change and so we pondered one of these. The price was pretty good and I liked the automatic cleaner that it had. I researched this individual product on the panasonic website ([...]) and was quite impressed with what it had to offer me. I purchased the razor and took it with me to deploy. I first used it and it was the most amazing shave I have ever experienced with an electric razor. I couldn&#x27;t believe that I hadn&#x27;t tried this type earlier. There wasn&#x27;t one bit of irritation on my face or neck. It cut incredibly smooth and was just fantastic. This razor is my personal best and would recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> My first experience with an electric razor was roughly 17 years ago. It seemed to me a cruel form of medieval torture, thus converting me to Gillette razors that do give a close clean shave, but also takes a long time. I had sworn off electric forever. I was wrong to do so.     I purchased this shaver with the full intention of giving electric one more shot, probably disliking it, and have the full confidence I&#x27;d be able to return it to Amazon. I read the reviews, bad to good.     First thoughts - My first shave was dry. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be for right? Well it was comfortable. I winced as I started but only due to  my past trauma of using a primitive electric tool on my \\&quot;sensitive skinned face\\&quot; (girlfriends&#x27; term, not mine) but was soon shaving against the grain with no discomfort at all. Was it as close as a razor? Nearly. But I was disappointed with my chin. A face does need time to get used the razor so I gave it a week.     Second thoughts- I took some advice from a friend and started shaving in the shower with shaving cream to help ease the transition. It seemed to shave a closer and no more problems with my chin and jaw line. I gotta say thought even shaving in a shower with gel takes me around 3 minutes with this shaver, not a bad time at all. I dry shaved with it 3 days in a row now, just to see how my skin was adapting. NO COMPLAINTS whatsoever on the shave itself.     Conclusion- Perhaps I&#x27;m just new to the modern electric shaver world and my review is directed at guys who&#x27;ve been using regular razors, even the Gillette 3 power fusion razor. My job doesn&#x27;t require me to shave everyday, and I hadn&#x27;t out of, quite frankly, laziness. Not anymore, I just shave in the shower everyday. A single charge lasted me for 4 days before I noticed a slow down. I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;automated cleaning\\&quot; system once, as I wanted to write an accurate review. I set it and it turned on, I can see how it will eventually degrade the charging arm. Loud? I was ten feet away inmy one bedroom apt, and I didn&#x27;t notice it with my tv on. I don&#x27;t plan on using that feature much as the shaver is so easy to clean after a shave. A couple drops of liquid hand soap, a splash of water, turn on for a couple seconds, let it foam, rinse and done.      I&#x27;ve switched to be a shower shaver, and at this point I still use shaving gel. Just seems to be more comfortable. I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.     *final note (important) My girlfriend has sensitive skin and was always irritated by \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; when we kissed, so I always had to use my conventional razor against the grain to get my face smooth. This shaver has her stamp of approval. No irritation, close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.  My first test was to fully charge it and go on vacation for 10 days and not bring my charger.  It was running beautifully after I returned, giving me a close shave the entire time.  The cleaning system is simple and works well.</li>
    <li> Imposable to replace the batteries whey they die. Panasonic won&#x27;t sell them as parts. Rechargeable batteries do not last forever.</li>
    <li> Shaver is very compact and light, fits comfortably in your hands. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had alot of shavers over the  years, mainly Panasonic, but this is the best I&#x27;ve had so far. &lt;br /&gt;Gives me one of the closest shaves by far. &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shaver to shave his head every day. He loves it. He no longer cuts his head using a razor and his head is smooth and wonderful.</li>
    <li> So far the razor has exceeded expectations and the fact that it cleans itself is timesaving and performance enhancing.  As with most electrics that I have used in the past, it has some problems with the chin and neck (the sensitive areas) and doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like and I sometimes get some irritation.  But it is better than the rest including the Braun which also cleans the blades.  And for the price offered you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, he loves it! He used a Remington before and said this one is much better - closer shave and better for sensitive skin. Great gift idea!</li>
    <li> This is not one of Panasonic&#x27;s newer models. but I think it&#x27;s one of its best.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and, on my face and beard, it delivers a smooth, close shave -- comparable to a blade.  I use it as a wet shaver with a little bit of clear shaving gel (either Gillette or King of Shaves).  Recently, I&#x27;ve tried several electric razors, including the Philips/Norelco Smart Touch, Remington HGX-1 and the Remington ms-5500. All of these gave me a good dry shave with no irritation.  But the Panasonic wet shave is closer and more comfortable and I prefer the shape and build quality of the Panasonic.  The cleaning station has worked very well, but I only use it about every 2 weeks because the Panasonic is so easy to keep clean and fresh smelling with liquid soap and water.  It would be hard for me to find shaver that works so well for a better price. At under $100 it represents an outstanding value for a quality product.  In fact, I was so impressed by this Panasonic I just ordered a newer model through Amazon. I hope the new model performs as well as my current Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for christmas and he LOVES it.  Works great in and out of the shower.  Great price!</li>
    <li> My future son-in-law shaves his head and spent quite a bit of money buying razors. When I decided to get my husband an electric razor for trimming his beard, mustache and nose hairs, I decided to quiz my son-in-law about an electric head shaver. He said that they were on the market and that he would love to have one but they were kinda expensive for him.  That&#x27;s when I decided to give him one for Christmas. He Loves It.</li>
    <li> We Received a shaver that would not work. We contacted Amazon customer svs they were very polite and sent us a replacement.They sent us a return label to our email. We received our new one even before they received the old one back. The shaver works great holds a charge which we were having with his old one. Thanks for the excellent product.</li>
    <li> I loved Panasonic Shavers. My first shaver was Panasonic and I used it for six years. Then I bought this one but the battery is dead. It worked for few month only. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have to echo other reviews that the RPM on this is weak, and it takes awhile, even brand new, to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the killer for me is the bizarre design decision that the razor WILL NOT WORK while charging.  At least twice now I&#x27;ve forgotten to consistently plug it in every night while travelling, and have been screwed in the morning because it wouldn&#x27;t have enough juice for a full shave and I couldn&#x27;t just plug it in and finish the job.  You have to plug it in AND wait 30 min or so for the battery to fill before being able to shave.  And a full charge doesn&#x27;t last that long.. maybe 2-3 shaves, because each one takes so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what prompted this design decision, but a shaver that won&#x27;t shave no matter what isn&#x27;t much help to a person trying to complete their morning routine and get out the door.  Needless to say, I regret this purchase and will be purchasing another brand as soon as possible.. one of the MANY others that don&#x27;t have this design flaw.</li>
