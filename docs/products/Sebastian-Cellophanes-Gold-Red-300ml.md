      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The longer you leave the color under heat the more color deposit you get</li>
      <li>If you want something with more endurance, you&#x27;re going to have to use something with more chemicals.</li>
      <li>Some were okay</li>
      <li>Looking for a product or treatment which would add a significant gloss or shine to my hair, I was lead to the Sebastian Cellophanes which overall have impressive reviews.  </li>
      <li>great, but mix it with light brown for a more natural color</li>
      <li>silky smooth</li>
      <li>sure your hair is freshly shampooed with no conditioner.</li>
      <li>Its great because all the hair doesn&#x27;t end up as the same color.  </li>
      <li>, will leave it so shiny and smooth as silk...</li>
      <li>The Good thing about this product is how healthy my hair is, second</li>
      <li>I use the bonnet attachment for my hair dryer, but I&#x27;m sure there are other creative ways to keep your hair warm for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>I use the bonnet attachment for my hair dryer, but I&#x27;m sure there are other creative ways to keep your hair warm for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>The color was good, but not like the original formula of gleaming cooper which was red gold.</li>
      <li>My ideal color would be a dimensional, level 7-8 ginger with lots of gold, copper, and vibrant red tones--</li>
      <li>I also ordered a contraption you can put on your blow dryer that works kind of like an old bonnet hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Another great thing is that this is not a dye really, it is a deposit only.  </li>
      <li>My hair has been more manageable than normal too.</li>
      <li>when it arrived i was completely unprepared &amp; a little worried, BUT it turned out great!!</li>
      <li>Have a couple of moist paper towels available if needed.&lt;br /&gt;--Squirt out about what you think you will need to cover your whole head into a bowl that you don&#x27;t care about staining.</li>
      <li>Like the old formula and colors better but can&#x27;t find anything comparable to what it does.</li>
      <li>The color is very natural and super easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I could never find the right shade that looked like me.  </li>
      <li>great for African American hair</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair very shiny and gives it that nice punch of red</li>
      <li>I found that it works pretty well to just dip my gloved hand into the gel and work it through from root to tip and then clip up sections</li>
      <li>Try to get close to your scalp without getting it on your scalp as it will stain and look funny if you part your hair.&lt;br /&gt;--Once</li>
      <li>You can save yourself a lot of money by applying this product yourself rather than going to an expensive salon and get great results!</li>
      <li>Normally it&#x27;s pretty frizzy/</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone (even as unskilled in hair styling/dying as me) who wants a change in color &amp; health of hair without damaging it at all!</li>
      <li>If i can figure it out, anyone can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have auburn hair &amp; this left my hair a little more reddish &amp; very, very shiny, (as if I used some kind of serum in my hair).</li>
      <li>Once the 20 minutes is up, be sure to wait another five allowing your hair to cool down before you wash out.</li>
      <li>Once the 20 minutes is up, be sure to wait another five allowing your hair to cool down before you wash out.</li>
      <li>The first time I used a plastic shower cap and my regular blow dryer and it worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>Towel dry it with a microfiber towel to get most of the moisture out and comb thoroughly before you</li>
      <li>Good stain with long lasting color.</li>
      <li>I would suggest a sulfate-free or low sulfate shampoo and a light</li>
      <li>I would suggest a sulfate-free or low sulfate shampoo and a light</li>
      <li>Great way to add depth, tone and deep copper shine to brown or red-brown hair--easy to use (although rather messy!), washes off soiled towels in the first wash, but stays in your hair for weeks...</li>
      <li>I ordered it without reading about it really, thinking it was a color depositing rinse or something...</li>
      <li>am extremely pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone wanting a natural looking red.</li>
      <li>well, looks natural and best of all, Sebastian cellophanes don&#x27;t dye your hair, but rather coat the hair shaft for long-lasting temporary color requiring no peroxide or other harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>It gives my red highlights a beautiful but natural-looking boost and the rest of my hair takes on a bit of a reddish sheen that is subtle but very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure you have dark colors on the floor and counter of where you will be applying the dye.</li>
      <li>My scalp was a bit pink in areas where I got too close, but my hairline looked fine, and thanks to the gloves I used, my hands weren&#x27;t stained at all.</li>
      <li>(I freaked out at first but was able to get most of it off by scrubbing my hands like crazy with a loofah).</li>
      <li>I highly suggest this product to folks who are cautious and have patience.  </li>
      <li>With that warning, I highly suggest applying this product 2-3 WASHINGS BEFORE an event or returning to work.  </li>
      <li>:  If you get any of the gel on your skin, just pop off your gloves, wipe it with a moist paper towel and put on a new pair of gloves if you&#x27;re not done.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try a new color</li>
      <li>:  If you get any of the gel on your skin, just pop off your gloves, wipe it with a moist paper towel and put on a new pair of gloves if you&#x27;re not done.</li>
      <li>, the color is very natural looking.</li>
      <li>The red gold added more red to my brown hair, than the new formula gold red.</li>
      <li>the hair is completely coated, put on a disposable shower/processing cap and then use whatever method you want to heat your head for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Made my hair soft and healthier looking.</li>
      <li>have natural color hair, and wanted a change, so i opted for cellophanes cause it fades away</li>
      <li>I am (was) a natural red-head.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve washed my hair</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a natural redhead looking for a boost, I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s your natural color!&amp;#34; They don&#x27;t ask, they TELL me it&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>The amount of compliments I receive daily really speaks volumes of the quality of tis product</li>
      <li>I used a clarifying shampoo first, did not condition, and let my hair dry to 70-80%.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair lightened to strawberry blonde.</li>
      <li>Not only do redheads go gray but the once vibrant copper fades as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so i wrapped my head in saran wrap (!) and used a blow-dryer on high heat for almost 20 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but a day later were totally normal</li>
      <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve been a faux redhead for 4 years (doing it myself for 3 and 1/2), and if you&#x27;re not a salon professional, you&#x27;re</li>
      <li>Natural red hair.</li>
      <li>I have recently begun having my stylist add in red highlights which I love, but despite trying three different types of permanent color, the brilliance of the red does fade over time which is apparently a fairly common problem.</li>
      <li>If you wash your hair frequently and want something lasting, I&#x27;d recommend Redken Shades EQ--but for me that still only lasted about 5-6 weeks.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it washes out pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Based on other reviews for this product, I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll try Red Red next for a more dramatic result.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is excellent! While being terribly allergic to even the gentlest color developer in standard hair coloring products, I can use these cellophanes with great results and no fear!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> Very attractive hair color.  Will definitely be using it soon.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...it imparts shine and color for an affordable price...I have purchased this product 5 times already!</li>
    <li> This cellophane is the best leaves my hair silky smooth I use it with Sebastian penetrate hair mask  great for African American hair</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The color was good, but not like the original formula of gleaming cooper which was red gold. The red gold added more red to my brown hair, than the new formula gold red.</li>
    <li> Looking for a product or treatment which would add a significant gloss or shine to my hair, I was lead to the Sebastian Cellophanes which overall have impressive reviews.  While I have no problems with the color (and everyone will see color differently), there has been no difference in shine.  I&#x27;m disappointed in the product, but thankfully it wasn&#x27;t too expensive an experiment.</li>
    <li> great, but mix it with light brown for a more natural color</li>
    <li> This is the best color i have used. Made my hair soft and healthier looking. I use this every 4 weeks, since i have short hair this will last me a while.</li>
    <li> This leaves my damaged hair looking shiny and beautiful. It gives me the best red color I&#x27;ve ever had. Unfortunately, it washes out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Good stain with long lasting color. Messy and will stain the skin, scalp and tub. Like the old formula and colors better but can&#x27;t find anything comparable to what it does. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair shiny but I don&#x27;t use it for that. I have dark hair that I highlight. I use this because it takes the brass away and gives me the color that I cannot achieve with dye alone.</li>
    <li> Love the color. I just wish it would stay longer! Well what can I say I have tried all other cellophanes for my damaged hair and I must say this one is one of the best. Sadly after 3 to 5 washes it comes out completely.</li>
    <li> Natural red hair. . .old ladies compliment it, classmates make fun of it and you, the owner of the red mop develop a love/ hate relationship with it.  Just as you are old enough to really appreciate your ginger locks, something frightening happens. . . it begins to fade.  Not only do redheads go gray but the once vibrant copper fades as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried salon color, box color and temporary color.  Some were okay, one was a nightmare.  I could never find the right shade that looked like me.  I read about the Sebastian cellophanes and watched a youtube video about process and application and ordered the Gold Red.  I have to say its the best color (for me) ever!!  The color is very natural and super easy to use.  I chose to purchase a bonnet style hair dryer because it does need to be set with heat.  The first time I used a plastic shower cap and my regular blow dryer and it worked just fine.  The longer you leave the color under heat the more color deposit you get so you can control the depth of color.  Another great thing is that this is not a dye really, it is a deposit only.  Its great because all the hair doesn&#x27;t end up as the same color.  It&#x27;s like wrapping each strand of hair with tinted cling wrap.  You can still see what&#x27;s underneath but with a tint of color and shine.  I see the color fading at about three weeks with regular washing.  No big deal, it takes about 30 minutes in all,  I just do it again.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone wanting a natural looking red.</li>
    <li> I have recently begun having my stylist add in red highlights which I love, but despite trying three different types of permanent color, the brilliance of the red does fade over time which is apparently a fairly common problem. She recommended trying the cellophanes between the salon color treatment and this does the trick beautifully. It gives my red highlights a beautiful but natural-looking boost and the rest of my hair takes on a bit of a reddish sheen that is subtle but very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some hints for application:&lt;br /&gt;-Get some rubber gloves--you can get a big box of them that will last a long time on Amazon or at CVS or Walgreens. Also, order some disposable shower caps or processing caps. You can get a ton of them for only a few bucks on Amazon. I also ordered a contraption you can put on your blow dryer that works kind of like an old bonnet hair dryer. If you order one, you may need to cut additional vent holes on it so it doesn&#x27;t blow off your head during use.&lt;br /&gt;--Make sure your hair is freshly shampooed with no conditioner. Towel dry it with a microfiber towel to get most of the moisture out and comb thoroughly before you begin.&lt;br /&gt;--Drape a dark colored towel around your shoulders to protect you from spills. Protect your floor with some newspaper or just use a dark colored shower mat so stains won&#x27;t show up. Have a couple of moist paper towels available if needed.&lt;br /&gt;--Squirt out about what you think you will need to cover your whole head into a bowl that you don&#x27;t care about staining. I use a silicone bowl and it doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;--Apply in sections...I found that it works pretty well to just dip my gloved hand into the gel and work it through from root to tip and then clip up sections so things don&#x27;t get too unwieldy/messy. This wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if you have short hair. Try to get close to your scalp without getting it on your scalp as it will stain and look funny if you part your hair.&lt;br /&gt;--Once the hair is completely coated, put on a disposable shower/processing cap and then use whatever method you want to heat your head for 20 minutes. I use the bonnet attachment for my hair dryer, but I&#x27;m sure there are other creative ways to keep your hair warm for 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes is up, be sure to wait another five allowing your hair to cool down before you wash out. I would suggest a sulfate-free or low sulfate shampoo and a light conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  If you get any of the gel on your skin, just pop off your gloves, wipe it with a moist paper towel and put on a new pair of gloves if you&#x27;re not done. This won&#x27;t stain skin unless you leave it on for a fairly long time.oated, put on a disposable shower/processing cap and then use whatever method you want to heat your head for 20 minutes.

    <li> Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase</li>
    <li> Threw my money out the window. Honestly, I noticed no difference in color after using this product. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> I love this product I had to change my color I use to get Black Cherry in the salon it was discontinued when went to Laminates it hasn&#x27;t change. This product gives your hair the life shine and color no dullness at all. I&#x27;m going to try a new color I get a lot of compliment&#x27;s when the sunlight hits your hair it&#x27;s just awesome.</li>
    <li> Excellent results, very good value</li>
    <li> Great way to add depth, tone and deep copper shine to brown or red-brown hair--easy to use (although rather messy!), washes off soiled towels in the first wash, but stays in your hair for weeks...colors grey hair well, looks natural and best of all, Sebastian cellophanes don&#x27;t dye your hair, but rather coat the hair shaft for long-lasting temporary color requiring no peroxide or other harsh chemicals. It also works well as a conditioner for dry  hair. You can save yourself a lot of money by applying this product yourself rather than going to an expensive salon and get great results!</li>
    <li> have natural color hair, and wanted a change, so i opted for cellophanes cause it fades away still leave a bit of color back but wont harm ur hair at all, will leave it so shiny and smooth as silk...&lt;br /&gt;i would always recommend this product to everyone...</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews for this product, I had high hopes. The color payoff was fantastic, if a bit too bright at first--but I knew it would fade so I was happy with the results. I used a clarifying shampoo first, did not condition, and let my hair dry to 70-80%. I found the gel formula difficult to distribute, but my hair is very long and damaged, so I experience this regularly depending on a particular product formulation. I started with the top/front sections of my hair, as those are the lightest/most faded, and once I had covered every inch, I wrapped my hair up tight in saran wrap and used a blow dryer intermittently to apply heat. After 45 min, I washed it out with a color-safe shampoo and conditioned. My scalp was a bit pink in areas where I got too close, but my hairline looked fine, and thanks to the gloves I used, my hands weren&#x27;t stained at all. Hallelujah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did it last? Look, its temporary. It&#x27;s not permanent. It&#x27;s not even demi-permanent. I only wash my hair 2-3x a week, so it lasted about 3 weeks. If you want something with more endurance, you&#x27;re going to have to use something with more chemicals. Personally, I&#x27;ve been a faux redhead for 4 years (doing it myself for 3 and 1/2), and if you&#x27;re not a salon professional, you&#x27;re color options are limited. My ideal color would be a dimensional, level 7-8 ginger with lots of gold, copper, and vibrant red tones--think lighter than Christina Hendricks, but richer than Jessica Chastain. In my experience, most red dye will make you a Julianne Moore--which is pretty, but too dark and artificial looking for me. If you&#x27;re a natural redhead looking for a boost, I&#x27;d recommend this. If you&#x27;re a redhead by choice who is feeling faded but can&#x27;t bear the possibility of browned-out, darker, more damaged hair, I&#x27;d recommend this. If you wash your hair frequently and want something lasting, I&#x27;d recommend Redken Shades EQ--but for me that still only lasted about 5-6 weeks. And it was much more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have copper red hair that tends to bleach out in the sun. This product makes my hair very shiny and gives it that nice punch of red I was missing. If you don&#x27;t have a thermal cap try sitting out in the sun with the product on.</li>
    <li> I liked it! But I had to mix it with another one because made my hair very red! I just wanted a nice copper shine</li>
    <li> I am (was) a natural red-head. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair lightened to strawberry blonde. Hair dye strips the color to add color which means when the color fades, my hair turned lighter because it stripped. As a natural red-head, aging to a &#x27;blonde&#x27; was bad enough. Dye made it worse. Anyhoo, so I&#x27;ve been using This product for about 3-4 years now and I no longer have &#x27;faded stripped&#x27; hair. My hair is so shiny, healthy, no split ends, not  dry, just perfect! The Good thing about this product is how healthy my hair is, second, the color is very natural looking. Three times per day, total strangers compliment my hair stating, &amp;#34;and that&#x27;s your natural color!&amp;#34; They don&#x27;t ask, they TELL me it&#x27;s natural. Totally fooled that it&#x27;s &#x27;chemically enhanced!&#x27;  The bad -- use ALOT of Vaseline on your neck, scalp, ears, skin near hairline. This stuff is POTENT! Make sure you have dark colors on the floor and counter of where you will be applying the dye. With that warning, I highly suggest applying this product 2-3 WASHINGS BEFORE an event or returning to work.  I highly suggest this product to folks who are cautious and have patience.  The amount of compliments I receive daily really speaks volumes of the quality of tis product</li>
    <li> This is a really wonderful product. I am a complete moron when it comes to beauty-related stuff, I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair &amp; i can&#x27;t apply makeup to save my life. I was late-night Amazon shopping and saw this product. I ordered it without reading about it really, thinking it was a color depositing rinse or something...when it arrived i was completely unprepared &amp; a little worried, BUT it turned out great!! If i can figure it out, anyone can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have auburn hair &amp; this left my hair a little more reddish &amp; very, very shiny, (as if I used some kind of serum in my hair). So far I&#x27;ve washed my hair 1x &amp; color hasn&#x27;t faded, nor did the shine go away. My hair has been more manageable than normal too. Normally it&#x27;s pretty frizzy/unruly (I have wavy/slightly curly hair). I think I&#x27;ll try Red Red next for a more dramatic result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was unprepared, I didn&#x27;t even have gloves, so my hands got a little stained but a day later were totally normal (I freaked out at first but was able to get most of it off by scrubbing my hands like crazy with a loofah). I was careful not to get product on my scalp so thankfully I didn&#x27;t have a stained hairline or anything. I also had no shower cap so i wrapped my head in saran wrap (!) and used a blow-dryer on high heat for almost 20 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone (even as unskilled in hair styling/dying as me) who wants a change in color &amp; health of hair without damaging it at all!</li>
