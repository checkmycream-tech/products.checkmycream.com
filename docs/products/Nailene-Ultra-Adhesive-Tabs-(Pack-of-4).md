<li> As other gals have said, wear rubber or latex gloves to wash dishes, prepare food, and shampoo.</li>
<li> As other gals have said, wear rubber or latex gloves to wash dishes, prepare food, and shampoo.</li>
<li> Other than that, put the nails on &amp; forget them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My other beef?</li>
<li> They can last me up to a week, but sometimes they might come off after a day or two, usually if I haven&#x27;t prepped properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
<li> but since I am a tall gal with lengthy finger, the short tabs are too small.  </li>
<li> I do not use the fake nails as if they were real -</li>
<li> I have tried keeping them on to see how long they will stay on - they have actually stayed on through showers and shampoos, but after a day I am tired of them and just want them off.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (nail polish remover, alcohol, soap) with no success.</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s not wide enough, liquid can get underneath the fake nail and loosen it.</li>
<li> By then I had spent (wasted) over $35.</li>
<li> Slight filing of the surface will do so</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use them to tug on tight jeans, etc.  </li>
<li> I have tried other brands in the past and they just didn&#x27;t stick.</li>
<li> a little concerned about water/germs, etc.  </li>
<li> I have used these long enough that I know this was a bad batch</li>
<li> I had purchased them from - Went to every store I usually shop at, but no one had them.</li>
<li> The latest batch that this website sent me was awful.</li>
<li> I usually take them off as we are driving home, just because I like being &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; of thick nails.</li>
<li> Use to be cheaper at Wal Mart, but hard to find in stock.</li>
<li> Hard to get the tabs off of the sheet</li>
<li> (I learned this the hard way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> are my tips (learned the hard way, LOL):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My fingernails are very weak and thin from medical issues.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Appreciated!!</li>
    <li> I agree they can be a little tricky at times, however read the &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; on using them and they will quickly become your favorites! Use to be cheaper at Wal Mart, but hard to find in stock.</li>
    <li> excelent product!! fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed &amp; it arrived on time,</li>
    <li> Always looking for more</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for a quick fix for a nail that comes off.  Takes about 30 seconds, and you&#x27;re done! I keep them (and a pair of tweezers) in my purse, in case a nail comes off while I&#x27;m not at home.</li>
    <li> i like them, but they do not stick as well as i would want them too.  one pops off everytime i go to take up my jeans</li>
    <li> Worked great for my wife.</li>
    <li> These work great to hold nails in place without using glue which is hard on nails.  They are easy to remove as well.</li>

    <li> Great product, but since I am a tall gal with lengthy finger, the short tabs are too small.  Why don&#x27;t they have them in medium, as other vendors do?They would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Holds false nails in place beyond expectation. This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these..</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not into using glue for fake nails, these are perfect for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re strong but not insanely difficult to get off. If I didn&#x27;t pull these suckers off, they probably would have stayed on for weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sellers are also very polite and give great customer service!</li>
    <li> Love these....wish we could still find in stores. Manufacturer will not reply to emails on their website as to if they are still making them</li>
    <li> My fingernails are very weak and thin from medical issues. I used to have long nails by using acrylic on them, but that&#x27;s no longer an option for me. Then I found these tabs one day while shopping at several different stores. They&#x27;re Awesome and enabled me to have nice nails every day! When I ran out of the tabs, I couldn&#x27;t remember which store I had purchased them from - Went to every store I usually shop at, but no one had them. Then I searched Amazon - Yea!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my tips (learned the hard way, LOL):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After washing your hands, clean your fingernails with RUBBING ALCOHOL on a cotton swab or pad. This ensures that there is no oil or residue on your nails. The Alcohol also helps remove the tab residue when you take off the fake nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- USE THE WIDEST TAB for each finger. Put your finger underneath the plastic that holds the tabs to find the size you need. Make sure that the tab you select is WIDE enough. I&#x27;ve found that the fake nails stay on longer and more securely if the entire Width of my nail is covered with a tab. If it&#x27;s not wide enough, liquid can get underneath the fake nail and loosen it. Another TIP: If there isn&#x27;t a tab wide enough, select a smaller one and cut it to fill in the sides. It is tricky to cut them without getting them stuck on the scizzors, but practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- USE TWEEZERS, NOT YOUR FINGER, to remove the tab from the plastic and place on your finger. Even if your fingers are clean, touching the tab with your finger decreases its stickiness. Start it at the center right at your cuticle. Keep its plastic piece on top while you press it onto your entire nail bed with your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- DO ONE NAIL/FINGER AT A TIME. You&#x27;ll lose the plastic tops and can create quite a mess if you put the tabs on all of your fingers and then try to put on the fake nails. (I learned this the hard way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Once the tab is securely on your finger, remove the plastic piece off the tab, then put on the fake nail. Press it securely in the center first, then the sides. Then move on to the next finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the nails stay on if I keep my hands out of water. As other gals have said, wear rubber or latex gloves to wash dishes, prepare food, and shampoo. I haven&#x27;t tried keeping them on for more than 2-3 days, but I imagine they&#x27;ll stay on for the full 5 days promised by Nailene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO REMOVE: Soak your hands in warm, soapy water (or don&#x27;t wear gloves and take a shower or bath). Slide them off to avoid pulling on your nail beds. Roll off any glob of glue left on your nail. Then use Alcohol on a pad or cotton ball to remove all traces of the glue.t on the fake nail. Press it securely in the center first, then the sides. Then move on to the next finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the nails stay on if I keep my hands out of water. As other gals have said, wear rubber or latex gloves to wash dishes, prepare food, and shampoo. I haven&#x27;t tried keeping them on for more than 2-3 days, but I imagine they&#x27;ll stay on for the full 5 days promised by Nailene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO REMOVE: Soak your hands in warm, soapy water (or don&#x27;t wear gloves and take a shower or bath). Slide them off to avoid pulling on your nail beds. Roll off any glob of glue left on your nail. Then use Alcohol on a pad or cotton ball to remove all traces of the glue.</li>
    <li> These tabs work so much better than glue for the press on nails.  The glue comes right off and you don&#x27;t need remover.  They are easy to apply and can last as long as two weeks.  So easy to carry in your purse for instant replacements.</li>
    <li> They work great on my left hand not so good on the left. Work great for special occasions. I can let my nails rest in between</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I have tried other brands in the past and they just didn&#x27;t stick. These work great for what i needed them for. But they will only last maybe a day or 2.</li>
    <li> I am a home crafter, and I do not want acrylic or gel nails, as then my nails can&#x27;t handle pins, etc.  But when an important event or season comes around, I want the nice look of acrylic or gel nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bingo!  I buy the fake nail, but because I do not want to glue them to my nails, I use these tabs.  And for the night&#x27;s special event, my nails look beautiful.  Then I simply slide them off, and am back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used them for my big toe once, when I had to have that nail removed. Worked great as well as new nail grew out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints:  I put nails on last.  I do not put my  hands under water with these on.  If I need to wash my hands, I am careful to keep water away from nails, as it sometimes (not always) seems to loosen the adhesion.  I do not use the fake nails as if they were real - I don&#x27;t use them to tug on tight jeans, etc.  They are an accessory piece for me, and I don&#x27;t mind their limited use, as I am just using them for a special occasion event.

I usually take them off as we are driving home, just because I like being &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; of thick nails.</li>
    <li> Much smaller nail sizes than the ones I purchased in store, which I can&#x27;t find anymore</li>
    <li> These adhesive pads are awesome!  Well worth the $$.  Glad I found them online, couldn&#x27;t find them in any store.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> These worked fine until the last batch when the cover would not separate. Almost stabbed myself trying to make them work whereas in the past, the cover came away easily. I wrote to them to complain, asking for a refund, and ordered another batch, assuming I had simply received n &#x27;off&#x27; piece. But I never heard back from them and the second batch I ordered had the same problem. By then I had spent (wasted) over $35. I then went to eBay and found the same product and ordered them and those were fine. I will not be ordering these from here again.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery. Good price.</li>
    <li> You have to practice with these tabs until you do it right. The surface of the nails has to be prepared and clean. Slight filing of the surface will do so you don&#x27;t damage your nails. Then clean with alcohol, take the tabs off very carefully so you touch the sticky part as little as possible and stick it on your finger. Then rub over it several times and cut any excess. After you put your nails on, keep rubbing over your fingers whenever you remember on that day. Don&#x27;t wet your fingers for several hours. Good luck...They can last me up to a week, but sometimes they might come off after a day or two, usually if I haven&#x27;t prepped properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have bought these tabs for years both in stores and online. The latest batch that this website sent me was awful. Hard to get the tabs off of the sheet and they didn&#x27;t stick to the nails at all. I have used these long enough that I know this was a bad batch and since people who have bought it after me are making the same comment, my guess is that they are still bad ones. Too bad, can&#x27;t find in the stores any more.</li>
    <li> As described.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I found these tabs a couple of years ago, and they are perfect for what I need; An easy, quick and inexpensive way of keeping my fake nails on. Nailene claims you can wear your nails for up to 5 days - I&#x27;ve actually worn them for longer! You just have to be careful of certain liquids that may cause the adhesive to loosen its grip: Hand cream and baby oil (just avoid the cuticles), and use gloves when washing dishes. Other than that, put the nails on &amp; forget them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34;:  There is no adhesive remover specifically made to take the glue off. The instructions tell you to push the fake nail off (do not peel), and to roll off any remaining adhesive with your fingers... Easier said than done! I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (nail polish remover, alcohol, soap) with no success. Just have to manually rub it off your nails. One trick I did that made the process a tad faster: stick a piece of kleenex on the remaining adhesive, then rub - it helps a bit. My other beef? They sell out waaaay too quickly, so if you find a source, you&#x27;d be wise to stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip regarding adhesive remaining on your fake nails: Using an orange stick, roll the end of the stick in the glue that remained in the pad of the fake nail... keep twisting the stick and the glue will eventually &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off, leaving the nail practically glue-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing. Nailene claims that using this product will not harm natural nails. Well, if you have brittle or dry nails, be extra careful when removing your fake nails, as the adhesive will peel away bits of your own nail if you attempt to peel the fake nail up from the side. The solution to this would be an adhesive remover specifically made for this product. ARE YOU LISTENING, NAILENE? Great product - just need the company to go the extra mile :-)</li>
