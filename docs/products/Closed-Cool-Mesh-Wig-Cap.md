### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was very happy with this product, a very good buy!</li>
      <li>With these it blends with my hair/wig color. :D</li>
      <li>Very Nice!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much I loved it!</li>
      <li>I was very glad I recieved two of them, in case one tears!</li>
      <li>happy halloween.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>This was a great buy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;what else to say but holds the hair and great for under a wig</li>
      <li>Works great and does wonders, I am trying to train my hair to lay backwards.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also sold at a good price.  </li>
      <li>They work great, and have a cute illustration to show how to put them on.</li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s suitable for children if needed.</li>
      <li>This item is very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>so should be okay.</li>
      <li>The quality is way better than beauty supply stores.</li>
      <li>Kept the items and stitched the top</li>
      <li>the Grandkids love.</li>
      <li>I used this thing to catch my hair when I was wearing wig on Halloween, and it&#x27;s pretty good, I love it.</li>
      <li>so this product is excellent for my long hair!</li>
      <li>i thought the fishnet would help it fit better</li>
      <li>But it rips easy</li>
      <li>I guess they are produced to fit the biggest head size.</li>
      <li>Good quality and I use it frequently for wearing the wig.</li>
      <li>Unless you pin it in you can expect it to roll right off the top of your head...but wasn&#x27;t overpriced.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really have to secure it with pins either!</li>
      <li>Concerned about being able to thoroughly wash and rinse without wasting water, I looked for and found these net wig caps that keeps the t/b locks in place while allowing more free motion of shampoo and thorough riinsing.</li>
      <li>You get two for a great price and it shipped faster than any other product that I have purchased online.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong and does not tear easily if you handle it gently.  </li>
      <li>I brought this item for my cosplay wig and it was perfect, I have read the other reviews on being careful not to rip it with bobby pins and so on, but since I don&#x27;t have any it was perfectly fine with me</li>
      <li>Otherwise its more discrete than the beige wig caps which become obvious if your wig falls out of place.</li>
      <li>This product has an open top which I did not notice when I ordered it.</li>
      <li>Have holes on both ends - stretches out WAY too easily and does not go back to size/shape.</li>
      <li>the net makes it easy for me to clip it in place so the wig does not shift around on head</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for making wigs as it is a bit flimsy, but if your just using it to wear under your wig, it should be fine if you have a tiny head.</li>
      <li>The only reason am not giving it a 5 star is because it&#x27;s not my perfect head size so there is a little extra space at the centre when I wear it, it doesn&#x27;t affect the hair in any way though.</li>
      <li>It came on time, gets the job done, and there was no false advertisement.</li>
      <li>Do not buy if you are looking for a closed top cap.  </li>
      <li>I use it after I shower and it breathes easy so my hair can dry.</li>
      <li>Bobby pins can be placed under the hair of a wig and right through the holes of the net, securing the wig to your hair.  </li>
      <li>It is slightly different than the picture, it has a hole in the top instead of being closed.</li>
      <li>My head is small but it fits well, love them.</li>
      <li>simple idea but helps with the whole wig thing.</li>
      <li>Stays in place, doesn&#x27;t move around much like other wig caps I&#x27;ve tried -</li>

<li> Stays in place, doesn&#x27;t move around much like other wig caps I&#x27;ve tried -</li>
<li> If you buy this cap, it&#x27;ll be obvious you&#x27;re wearing a wig due to the extra material.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty tight on my (small) head</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t plan to wear it for very long</li>
<li> I bought a few and have worn one of them several times with pins and it did not tear.</li>
<li> Be careful that you don&#x27;t tear the fishnet though, my friend did that.</li>
<li> The image showed a closed cap, but received an opened cap.  </li>
<li> I had to go through the trouble of cutting it and sewing it closed at the top.</li>
<li> its a bit big but a few bobby pins arent a problem</li>
<li> so BE CAREFUL WHERE YOUR FINGERS ARE!</li>
<li> Not too loose or tight.  </li>
<li> One end has elastic and the other end is a raw cut.</li>
<li> not too tight.</li>
<li> After experiencing a bit of slippage while washing my twisted and bundled new sisterlocks, I was encouraged to cover them with a stocking cap while washing.</li>
<li> It does run small in sizing, but I did manage to stretch it with a mannequin head.  </li>
<li> Using for a halloween wig, fits my daughter well enough, a bit tight around the band but not to bad.</li>
<li> Complete crap</li>
<li> I have purchased several of these caps and have not been disappointed.</li>
<li> I can not tell you how much false advertisement drives me insane.</li>
<li> This cap is absolutely awful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well even though at the end of evening I had a bit of a headache but all in all it served its purpose</li>
    <li> I brought this item for my cosplay wig and it was perfect, I have read the other reviews on being careful not to rip it with bobby pins and so on, but since I don&#x27;t have any it was perfectly fine with me so this product is excellent for my long hair! Thank you so much I loved it!</li>
    <li> Complete crap i thought the fishnet would help it fit better might as well forget it.</li>
    <li> Actually, I use this mesh for chemical experiments, and it works well. It is used in a water experiment&lt;br /&gt;that the Grandkids love. Thank you!</li>
    <li> simple idea but helps with the whole wig thing. not too tight. does not fall off. i would recommend. happy halloween.</li>
    <li> Using for a halloween wig, fits my daughter well enough, a bit tight around the band but not to bad.</li>
    <li> Very Nice! Although I didn&#x27;t started to use them yet...It&#x27;s the brand I used before. I am looking forward to it.</li>
    <li> It came on time, gets the job done, and there was no false advertisement. I can not tell you how much false advertisement drives me insane.</li>
    <li> Have holes on both ends - stretches out WAY too easily and does not go back to size/shape. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It is slightly different than the picture, it has a hole in the top instead of being closed. but it actually makes it alot easier to put on so i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> They work great, and have a cute illustration to show how to put them on. Be careful that you don&#x27;t tear the fishnet though, my friend did that. Otherwise its more discrete than the beige wig caps which become obvious if your wig falls out of place. With these it blends with my hair/wig color. :D</li>

    <li> Works well. Stays in place, doesn&#x27;t move around much like other wig caps I&#x27;ve tried - I didn&#x27;t really have to secure it with pins either! Bonus!</li>
    <li> I used this thing to catch my hair when I was wearing wig on Halloween, and it&#x27;s pretty good, I love it.</li>

    <li> Good quality and I use it frequently for wearing the wig.</li>
    <li> This item is very comfortable.  Not too loose or tight.  Because it&#x27;s mesh, it does not give off any heat.  Bobby pins can be placed under the hair of a wig and right through the holes of the net, securing the wig to your hair.  It&#x27;s pretty strong and does not tear easily if you handle it gently.  I bought a few and have worn one of them several times with pins and it did not tear. It&#x27;s also sold at a good price.  I would definitely buy this item again.</li>
    <li> This product has an open top which I did not notice when I ordered it. It wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the description nor is it obvious looking at the picture. I had to go through the trouble of cutting it and sewing it closed at the top. It does run small in sizing, but I did manage to stretch it with a mannequin head.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for making wigs as it is a bit flimsy, but if your just using it to wear under your wig, it should be fine if you have a tiny head.</li>
    <li> This cap is absolutely awful.  Too big.  Has extra material that you cannot do anything with.  If you buy this cap, it&#x27;ll be obvious you&#x27;re wearing a wig due to the extra material.</li>
    <li> Do not buy if you are looking for a closed top cap.  It is open and it is flimsy.</li>
    <li> Just received and not yet used however posting the photos...2 qty! Hopefully lasts long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love them! The quality is way better than beauty supply stores. I have purchased several of these caps and have not been disappointed. I wear them over my nylon wig caps so the combs in the wig do not touch or damage my hair.</li>
    <li> recommended for cosplayers and anyone whos looking for something to wear under wigs. comfy and breathable and looks like the picture. its a bit big but a few bobby pins arent a problem</li>
    <li> great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what else to say but holds the hair and great for under a wig</li>
    <li> I USE IT WITH MY WIGS ALL THE TIME.</li>
    <li> Works great and does wonders, I am trying to train my hair to lay backwards. I use it after I shower and it breathes easy so my hair can dry. But it rips easy so BE CAREFUL WHERE YOUR FINGERS ARE!</li>
    <li> It is open at both ends as others have stated. One end has elastic and the other end is a raw cut. It&#x27;s pretty tight on my (small) head but I don&#x27;t plan to wear it for very long so should be okay. It&#x27;s suitable for children if needed.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. You get two for a great price and it shipped faster than any other product that I have purchased online.</li>
    <li> I guess they are produced to fit the biggest head size. But they are snug in front and stretchy so irrespective of your head size it still fits. My head is small but it fits well, love them. The only reason am not giving it a 5 star is because it&#x27;s not my perfect head size so there is a little extra space at the centre when I wear it, it doesn&#x27;t affect the hair in any way though.</li>
