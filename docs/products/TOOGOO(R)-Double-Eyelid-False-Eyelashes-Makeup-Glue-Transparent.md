      <li>And clean-up is as easy as washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Your product is fantastic and I would recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>but, when it does it well worth the wait :)</li>
      <li>But also easy to clean off.</li>
      <li>I reuse my lashes and this was easier to clean off.</li>
      <li>To say the least I have ran into glues that r cheap and don&#x27;t work well surprisingly</li>
      <li>Holds pretty well.</li>
      <li>I do however love the white picky thing for helping apply the lashes.</li>
      <li>Waste of money &amp; there are better glue available.</li>

      <li>Its pretty good, I like it much better than the black one, at least when your hand is not as steady as it used to be....</li>
      <li>make sure after u put them on use a eyelash comb and comb ur lashes or they will clump up but wouldn&#x27;t buy again not worth the money</li>
      <li>I have a steady hand and could paint the glue like eyeliner and also put some on the lash strip.</li>
      <li>If you want your lashes to stay in place, you might want to spend a little more money.</li>
      <li>just I still plan on trying the duo clear just to compare.</li>
      <li>and I prefer the brush on clear</li>
      <li>the Duo did have a better hold which in my case was not necessary due to my limited activity</li>
      <li>Well it holds the lashes for a few hrs but comes off quick.</li>
      <li>what that is O_o.</li>

<li> what that is O_o.</li>
<li> applied it to my eyelashes and made them stay all day long...</li>
<li> The downfall unfortunately it dried up so fast in the tube and was a tacky mess</li>
<li> I spread some glue on my face where I want the jewelry, apply the beads, and let dry.  </li>
<li> The instructions were not in English which made it hard to apply it properly when you don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
<li> u gave to be careful putting on the lashes</li>
<li> A tiny bit messy when trying to put it on.</li>
<li> AN EMPTY GLUE BOTTLE COLLECTOR</li>
<li> it takes a little long to glue on and it hurts when taking eye lashes off.</li>
<li> When arrived to my home it was dried out and couldn&#x27;t use it and was very not happy about this purchase</li>
<li> IT WOULD STAY ON, AND THE OTHER HALF WOULD COME UNDONE.</li>
<li> wish they sold the little &amp;#34;fork&amp;#34; separately, I keep losing it.</li>
<li> Not worth it at all!</li>
<li> It is a little tricky to use, however once you get the hang out it the product works</li>
<li> Two the glue is sticky and lightweight so my lashes couldn&#x27;t stay on because they were to heavy for the glue.</li>
<li> So today I am going to finally open my package to use the gule and the seal is broken</li>
<li> I AM NOT SURE</li>
<li> I watched a lot of videos on applying false eyelashes and they raved about the duo dark.</li>
<li> Not a good glue ..</li>
<li> I also think my item came in a bit of bad shape.</li>
<li> So let&#x27;s just say I called Amazon very disappointed in this product and wanted my refund for it.  </li>
<li> and this is the one product that I was very disappointed in.</li>
<li> horrible horrible!!!</li>

<ol>
    <li> My mom its a dancer and she loved it</li>
    <li> Ether I dont know how to use it, or it just does not stick well... I do however love the white picky thing for helping apply the lashes. I love another product not this one..</li>
    <li> Although its says transparent, it dries out white and clumpy. Not worth it at all! Waste of money &amp; there are better glue available.</li>
    <li> Well it holds the lashes for a few hrs but comes off quick. But also easy to clean off. Works for beginners</li>
    <li> I AM NOT SURE IF THE GLUE WORKS WELL FOR ME. I TRIED PUTTING THE EYELASHES ON WTH TH GLUE, AND SOME IT WOULD STAY ON, AND THE OTHER HALF WOULD COME UNDONE.</li>
    <li> This eye lash glue is better then the one I have but not the best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s easy to apply. Shipping took around 14 days.</li>
    <li> Not a good glue .. Within an hour it was peeling off</li>
    <li> Your product is fantastic and I would recommend it to others. The downfall unfortunately it dried up so fast in the tube and was a tacky mess</li>
    <li> it takes a little long to glue on and it hurts when taking eye lashes off. I used it one day n never again used it I just stick to t he one I use. DEBU  EYELASH ADHESIVE WATERPROOF</li>
    <li> The eyelash glue works but u gave to be careful putting on the lashes make sure after u put them on use a eyelash comb and comb ur lashes or they will clump up but wouldn&#x27;t buy again not worth the money</li>
    <li> I watched a lot of videos on applying false eyelashes and they raved about the duo dark. I bought both and I prefer the brush on clear I have a steady hand and could paint the glue like eyeliner and also put some on the lash strip. I reuse my lashes and this was easier to clean off. the Duo did have a better hold which in my case was not necessary due to my limited activity just I still plan on trying the duo clear just to compare.</li>
    <li> Holds pretty well. A tiny bit messy when trying to put it on. But I do like it. I don&#x27;t think I would chose this next time though.</li>
    <li> Yes very good glue sticks and holds well . To say the least I have ran into glues that r cheap and don&#x27;t work well surprisingly this glue holds well and good customer service .  thank you kristen ,</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  If you want your lashes to stay in place, you might want to spend a little more money.</li>
    <li> The item wasn&#x27;t all that great. The instructions were not in English which made it hard to apply it properly when you don&#x27;t know what to do. I also think my item came in a bit of bad shape. The bottle was dented and the paint was wearing off.</li>
    <li> It is a little tricky to use, however once you get the hang out it the product works A-Okay. It keeps your eyelashes on all day. The glue will keep your lashes on when you curl them too. Good quality glue in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product as eyelash glue, hence 4 of 5 stars.  It makes my eyelids flutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for gluing non-permanent jewelry, it&#x27;s perfect.  I enjoy wearing different size pearl-like beads as part of my make-up.  I spread some glue on my face where I want the jewelry, apply the beads, and let dry.  It lasts all day.  And clean-up is as easy as washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they sold the little &amp;#34;fork&amp;#34; separately, I keep losing it.</li>
    <li> When arrived to my home it was dried out and couldn&#x27;t use it and was very not happy about this purchase</li>
    <li> Its pretty good, I like it much better than the black one, at least when your hand is not as steady as it used to be....&lt;br /&gt;My isn&#x27;t so my lines don&#x27;t be like they used to be.</li>
    <li> applied it to my eyelashes and made them stay all day long... it takes a well to get here but, when it does it well worth the wait :)</li>
    <li> Where to start? For one its called cluewater have no idea what that is O_o. Two the glue is sticky and lightweight so my lashes couldn&#x27;t stay on because they were to heavy for the glue. It&#x27;s in Chinese so unless you&#x27;re Chinese or could read Chinese the instructions are unless. And the picture on the box don&#x27;t help at all.  So let&#x27;s just say I called Amazon very disappointed in this product and wanted my refund for it.  So please stay away from this, I shop on Amazon a lot and this is the one product that I was very disappointed in.</li>
    <li> So today I am going to finally open my package to use the gule and the seal is broken so the gule spill all over inside the package..horrible horrible!!!</li>
    <li> all i got was a bottle and there wasn&#x27;t even anYTHING INSIDE OF IT SO DONT ORDER UNLESS YOURE LIEK AN EMPTY GLUE BOTTLE COLLECTOR BECAUSE THATS ALL YOU GET</li>
