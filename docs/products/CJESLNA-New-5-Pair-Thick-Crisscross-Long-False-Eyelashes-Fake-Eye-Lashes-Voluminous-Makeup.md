<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these lashes so much. But I won&#x27;t be buying them anymore because they keep raising the price.</li>
    <li> Got here fast! And looks exactly like in the picture.</li>
    <li> They do not stay on at all. I was really upset I bought this. No matter how little or a lot of glue I put they don&#x27;t stay.</li>
    <li> They are so cute, definitely will be buying again :)&lt;br /&gt;-karina</li>
    <li> My favorite pair. I wear them daily. 5 stars doesn&#x27;t do them justice. I highly recommend them to all my friends and now they are purchasing this product themselves.</li>
    <li> These are alright if I layer them with another lash style, and after I&#x27;ve worn them a week or so, cause then they start to look more natural to my eyes. The price is right too. Don&#x27;t know if I will purchase again in the future though, since I know there are other styles out there that suit me better. But if you are looking to try false lashes for the first time, I would recommend buying these since they&#x27;re not very expensive.</li>
    <li> By far they are one of the best eyelashes and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Felt very cheap and synthetic. Not very flattering on the eyes. Maybe better for cosplay than glamour make up.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! Perfect! I will be purchasing them again! New holy grail lashes!</li>
    <li> So I was impatiently waiting for these lashes to arrive today. I kind of doubted the bands of the lashes were how it looked in the picture. BUT it is exactly how it is in the picture!!!!! I am not disappointed at all! I love love love them! Will order more. Thank you to the seller! And arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Love it. My new favorite lashes. Just ordered 4 more</li>
    <li> excellent for the price, is thick and wispy.. its very natural too. i would order again</li>
    <li> Love these! So pretty and good price for 5 pairs, I love how whispy they are. Also came faster than expected!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very nice and flexible but the plastic band stabbed me in the eye! I&#x27;ve been putting on False eyelashes for years so I am experienced but they make my eyes droopy?? Like those droopy eyed dogs? Idk they&#x27;re really pretty</li>
    <li> These are fantastic lashes- they are the least expensive lashes I&#x27;ve EVER been able to reuse. Wonderful buy- I&#x27;ll most definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Look so natural and just like the pic.</li>
    <li> truly these are exactly what I expected. I have not tried them, but I buy eyelashes all the time and know right away when they are good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love! I was a little &amp;#34;ify&amp;#34; about buying them but I bought them anyway since they&#x27;re so cheap and they look absolutely stunning, I naturally already have long eyelashes but these gave it a fuller look and they&#x27;re pretty long too so they&#x27;re perfect. definitely will purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get here and they didn&#x27;t even come in the box like the picture or like anybody else&#x27;s apparently. Some are thick and some are thin but they were cheap so I guess they were okay for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> So stiff you are not able to adhere them, waist of money.</li>
    <li> Love them! Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them out but I&#x27;m already super excited to do so. Shipping time was awesome, faster then expected.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and I love the lashes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still figuring out how to apply fake lashes but these do look more natural than most.</li>
    <li> They look fabulous! Shipping was quick too. Came in 11 days! They&#x27;re nice and winged just like they look, however, they&#x27;re a little difficult to apply and the kinda hurt when you wear them. The band is like a clear plastic stiff string. Almost like a fishing line. It kinda pokes me in the corner of my eye when i blink. Also I had to reapply glue like two times during the day when I wore them probably because the glue doesn&#x27;t stick well to the fishing line.  Another thing is, some of the eyelashes were crinkled up</li>
    <li> These lashes look prettier on the package than on the eyes. They are very shiny which makes it obvious that they&#x27;re fake.</li>
    <li> Surprised on how good these look on! They look real! The bristles are strong and wispie, can be reused.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE. I love cross and wispy eyelashes and these are perfect. I actually can&#x27;t believe the price on it, it is so cheap for the good quality. The eyelashes have a thin strand which is great because the thick ones are so uncomfortable. They are perfect to wear on a daily bases and if you plan on going out, they can easily be doubled up!</li>
    <li> AMAZING lashes!!! Wow, can&#x27;t say enough about them. They&#x27;re just as great as $20 lashes you see on IG. Definitely ordering several more packs.</li>
    <li> Looks fake and plasticy</li>
    <li> I loved these1 good quality!</li>
    <li> These lashes are so pretty. Not too long or dramatic, everyday wear. The lash strips are thin easy to apply and will stay on.  Buy them you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I wear eye lashes every single day... I am missing hue chunks of my own. These are perfect. I am confused by the people that say they are cheap and flimsy. The stiff eye lashes are horrid to use, you can gently place these on your eye lash line. The look perfect when placed over make up too. They even come in an extended lengths so you can trim to your own eyelid length and shape. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Okay here&#x27;s an update I been loving this eyepatches there cheap and good for practicing and everyday looks. Wet nice I&#x27;m going buy more I recommend to buy and it&#x27;s good for first starters.</li>
    <li> love them looks amazing with out looking overdone and fake</li>
    <li> These were cute and weren&#x27;t stiff. But I needed alot of glue to keep it on and the corners started to lift after an hour or two of wear.</li>
    <li> These are one of my most favorite lashes! I usually get a little worried about ordering lashes from China, so I was hesitant on buying these. But I&#x27;m really glad I did! They appear to be a bit on the shorter side in the packaging. But when I put them on they look full, long, and beautiful! They&#x27;re not too long so no need to worry about that. My only problem with these lashes compared to others is that they don&#x27;t mold to your eye shape after multiple wears. It does a little bit but it mostly stays a bit on the straighter side, and I think it&#x27;s because the band is not as flexible. It&#x27;s caused my black eyelash glue to accidentally get onto my lid while applying -_-&amp;#34; but other than that, I really really love these lashes and recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> Some of my new favorite lashes ever! They don&#x27;t look like I have falsies on when I wear them ! Their amazing</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and love these eye lashes</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE !! So very worth it! Id buy them again and again !</li>
    <li> long and full i love it !!</li>
    <li> Worth the money I enjoy using them I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> These are really nice lashes. They aren&#x27;t heavy on the eyes. Very light weight. The down side about these are that no matter how much adhesive your add on the ends of the lashes, it always pop off. They are great for half lashes though. Will I ever order again? No. I&#x27;ll stick with House of Lashes.</li>
    <li> These lashes are comparable to the Ardell 120 demis but not exactly alike. They are very natural looking and my favorite is stacking lashes because I like the thicker wispy look. These are great value for your money. I love the Ardell lashes but the multi-packs are always hard to find and I don&#x27;t like buying their lashes online because I can always see a discrepancy in thickness and shape of their lashes so I need to see them in front of me. However, these lashes came in great condition. For the price, I bought two and two days after getting them and wearing them for one day, I placed another order. The lashes are full and voluminous enough to work with my hooded Asian eyes with just one strip. They also flare to the side a little bit as the lashes get closer to the outer edge which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are however a little stiff and harder to move around and shape to the eye because of the stiffness. The lash band is a little difficult to work with when I tried to stack two together, the adhesive wasn&#x27;t strong enough and because they were stiffer than other brands, it took a while for me to shape it the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great value and would continue to make purchases on these lashes.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very full and looks pretty on :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful lashes! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Came way before the due date and really nice for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> Love love these! Especially the winged at the end, will order again(:</li>
    <li> They are good for the price. lash band is a little thick. they do look good on</li>
    <li> The lashes look better in the picture than in person. For the lash band it&#x27;s a little stiff which makes it hard to keep the lashes glued to your lash line. I find that they pop off in the inner corner no matter how much glue you apply. But hey for 5 bucks what can you say?</li>
    <li> I decided to give these a try. They are great lashes. I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great for daytime look. They look natural, not too long, not too thin. As a matter of fact, I like them so much, I bought them twice already.</li>
    <li> cheapest, best eyelashes you can buy. took a gamble and I am so happy that I did. wear these babies everyday! just ordered 5 more sets too lol</li>
    <li> Very cute I love them</li>
    <li> Amazing lashes. I have bought them more than once now, and they are wonderful! They feel so natural!</li>
    <li> Not as good of a quality as shown in the photo unfortunately.</li>
    <li> OMG!  I love these lases.  I&#x27;m a everyday lashes and person.  And when I tell you these are so cute on me..ooooh weeh !! I just order more.  I truly recommend.  If you like that flirty girl look.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes are nice but it&#x27;s way to thick for me they were too crisscrossed for me but if that&#x27;s what you like then go for it. I was hoping for a more nautral thick winged lash.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these lashes!!!</li>
    <li> These lashes look exactly like the photo. I was skeptical about what quality I would get with such cheap lashes, but I must say I am impressed. They look exactly like other more expensive lashes, including Ardell and Red Cherry. Will definitely buy more now that I know!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! And I&#x27;ll probably love them to bits, as soon as I practice enough for the application to take less than an hour. ;)</li>
    <li> Really nice love them!</li>
    <li> These are great! I work at Seohora and receive so many compliments when I wear them. Also, they arrive so much sooner than expected.  Will always buy, please don&#x27;t discontinue!</li>
    <li> They came way sooner than I expected and I absolutely love them. Will definitely be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I love these! They&#x27;re so pretty and look kinda natural. I wore them yesterday and my sister asked me what brand mascara I was wearing! Lol love them would buy them again. But they get a little gross after the second time wearing a pair</li>
    <li> I love the fullness of them. They are a bit stiff even after bending and shaping them. But, they are so pretty on, I&#x27;ll just keep working with them.</li>
    <li> I always get a little sketched out when it comes to buying eyelashes from China but these ones are the same quality as Ardell. I bought 15 pairs and I definitely plan on buying more</li>
    <li> I love it!! The band is clear and thin and very light weight. Natural looking and not plastic looking. Definitely going to buy again!</li>
    <li> Flimsy base to eyelashes. Horrible and can&#x27;t use because these are so cheap.</li>
