<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I believe in the product. I just have to realistically give my scalp and hair time to respond. I experience scalp damage from a relaxer over a year ago. To add insult to injury, I wore sew in extension styles for over a year with minimal to no rest periods. Though my scalp healed and hair growth returned slowly, my hair remained very thin.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a TWA that I am not thrilled about because the crown of my head is visibly thinner than the rest of my hair. Nevertheless, I will stay the course as I pray and anoint my head with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to providing favorable results and comments in very near future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it; I was disappointed because when I used it I found scabs on my scalp. I think I am allergic, but it did wonders for my mother. However, The smell wasn&#x27;t too great, so put it on at night.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it aids in hair growth but it did a great job in strengthening my hair and it smells great! :)</li>
    <li> Okay so let me start off by saying my hair is much different then what this product was designed for, so my review may not help the majority of people who would be looking at this product. The reason I got it though was because my hair is very damaged from all the dying I did and my hair grows very slow and I have been trying to correct the mistake of cutting it by growing it out but its taking forever. The strands of my hair are thin but I have a lot of it and its pretty damaged. Regular conditioners are not enough, so I looked for something stronger and I have only used it once last night (when I got it in the mail) and today my hair feels amazing. I will say that it does make my hair look very oily so I used it at night and then braided (to the best of my ability) it so it wouldn&#x27;t look so nasty, then took a shower in the morning. Today my hair feels great even after blow drying and straightening it. Its soft, smooth and looks healthy. This is definitely not a product I can use and leave in during the day but it is great for over night conditioning. I might at some point try leaving it in for a bit then washing it out but I like the idea of it working all night. Hopefully I will see some growth in my hair! Even if it doesn&#x27;t stimulate growth in my hair the product is still very much worth it just for the simple fact it does wonders for the health of the hair no matter what type of hair you have.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I love it!</li>
    <li> This product really works, will be ordering again soon!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in hair growth.</li>
    <li> Great product love it</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using long (about two weeks) so haven&#x27;t seen growth results.  The trick is to rub into scalp rather than to massage into the hair itself so that it doesn&#x27;t get too oily.</li>
    <li> So The summer of 2013, for no reason at all, I lost a HUGE chunk out of my hair Right at the top of my head. **SO EMBARRASSING* bought a ton of hats, needless to say, quite and attention grabber being 80degrees and I&#x27;ve got on my winter hat... I wasn&#x27;t happy to show up at work, or get the &amp;#34;nice hat&amp;#34; complement. My doctor called it some sort of fancy word for &amp;#34;I have no idea why your hair is falling out&amp;#34; syndrome. Could only imagin my distress. He recommended Rogaine... and I bought a three month supply, it said it&#x27;d should show results in 2-3 weeks of use, and the only thing I saw was my spot getting bigger. After 2 weeks it went from being smaller than a dime to being begger than a half dollar coin. :( I was devastated! I felt like soon I&#x27;d be considering wigs. (which Tirrified my fiance.) My spot was as bare as a newborns bottom... and just as smooth. *sigh* and I was all out of rogaine. :&#x27;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of research and going though product after product, I came accross this product. I thought, it&#x27;s got all the right oils for regrowth of hair, I&#x27;ll see how it works. Within one week, I saw fuzz!!! I couldn&#x27;t have been more happy to feel the stubble of little hairs covering my head again. Within 2 weeks it had grown about 1/4 inch! after 3 weeks of OBSESSIONAL use *I&#x27;m talking Every Night* it&#x27;s grown full and soft and amazing. I&#x27;ve slowed down my use of it, because it does SMELL very Strong! and I at first I couldn&#x27;t get by it, but thought to myself, would I rather be bald or smell like I&#x27;ve dived into a hug bunch of herbs... I chose the herbs. **the lavendar is nice, but mixed with the others makes it kind of funky** And I&#x27;m glad I did, my hair is now 4 inches long after months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sympathies to you, I know why your reading and considering this product, I TOTALLY understand the stress hair-loss brings on ANYONE/man/woman/child for any reason. But this product will help regrow hair. It has helped me ease my worries and even though I still wear my hats *mainly because 4 inches doesn&#x27;t always like to lay flat* I am one Happy Hairy Customer. :)</li>
    <li> I like smell and feel of it.  I am of the white race, so I only need very little to strengthen and shin my hair. I put in on scalp area, message a couple of minutes and let it sit as long as I can.  I use it  one to two times a week. Everyone should use a oil on at least the scalp area to have healthy hair. Thank you product maker.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! U start to see results almost instantly. I love it!!!  My hair is not only soft and moisturized, I can see it getting thicker and thicker.</li>
    <li> CONS&lt;br /&gt;- THE BOTTLE IS MINISCULE (WORTH A FEW USES)&lt;br /&gt;- EXTREMELY GREASY (RUNS DOWN MY FACE AND NECK AFTER APPLYING, REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE)&lt;br /&gt;- HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR (WITH SUCH A SMALL BOTTLE AND LMTD USES, CAN&#x27;T REALLY EXPECT MUCH EITHER :(&lt;br /&gt;- ....DID I MENTION REDICULOUSLY GREASY??!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- PLEASANT FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT AT ALL SATISFIED</li>
    <li> I just received my product and I mix it up with the wild growth oil and the gro aut oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I disregarded the negative reviews and ordered this.  It is a very light oil that I apply directly to my scalp. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and does not weigh my hair down.  My hair is also not greasy but I believe this is because I do not spray on my hair, only my scalp.  Growth remains to be seen, but I know that my hair is getting a healthy treatment with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the application, as this is so much easier to apply than a normal bottle of oil due to the spray bottle applicator.  With regards to quantity, in my opinion the bottle is not minuscule. I&#x27;ve ordered several other speciality hair oils and this is comparable in size for the price.</li>
    <li> Per the wife, it is okay, so far she has not seen any results and will not be making another purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> I love it and WILL recommend this to my family. I don&#x27;t want to mix a bunch of oils together myself (lazy lol) so when I came across this oil I thought I was in heaven. It lived up to my expectations. I&#x27;ve already bought another bottle!</li>
    <li> When i purchased this i was hoping that this would help with hair stimulation but it didn&#x27;t. It actually make my scalp peel really bad. If i could i would of returned it. I contacted the seller and they said that according to a study the product took 8 months to stimulate hair growth on cancer patients. If i would have known this i would not have wasted my money</li>
    <li> It worked awesome I recommend this to anyone trying to regrow hair and don&#x27;t want to pay for the hair club.  My hair was tingly all day and night and it smelled nice.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product and its great. Rosemary is a bit strong but it works. Great</li>
    <li> I imagine it is good foryour hair with all of the awesome ingredients in it.However,I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell and I don&#x27;t particularly care for the texture of it.However, I use t because ofallofthe goodness in it and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Thanks .My hair seems to be gaining strength and looks more shinier and healthy .I am still working on my receding hairline on the sides which was caused by excessive braiding ,pull and tag. Hope ful that I will have afro thick hair again I ordered one also for my sister in Sandiego and she loves it as it is very light and does not weigh hair down. Need to keep it in my budget so I dont run out.Wish I knew about this product 40 years ago</li>
    <li> this oil made my scalp sting and feel as if it was on fire.  Also made my hair shed at an alarming rate and caused dried, course hair in every area it was applied.</li>
    <li> really good..  hair feels different from the very first time you use it</li>
    <li> It has a very strong smell to it so I only use at night sometimes. Don&#x27;t know if it works or not have not used long enough to determine.</li>
    <li> smells good and relaxing, will have to use for awhile to see results</li>
    <li> Smells disgusting and makes my hair feel like plastic! My hair is growing but I think it&#x27;s from the other products I use along side this spray! I&#x27;m natural 4c</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice anything different.  I purchased 2 bottles and gave them both away. Left my hair dry and I didn&#x27;t notice any growth.</li>
    <li> finally I found a Hair oil that is light and effective! I love it</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair grow longer, thicker and fuller. I noticed a big difference when I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I am a natural hair stylist and I only promote the use of natural products. In December 2014 I purchased 3 bottles of this product (1 for me and 2 as gifts). Thus far I have seen positive results on my hair from using this Hair Oil.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I cut all my hair off last year to go natural. I started using this oil treatment. My hair grew a lot . It was on my shoulders but I had it cut so I could flip it up. It&#x27;s still pass my neck. I love this hair treatment</li>
    <li> This product has become a staple in my natural hair journey. I use it has a deep conditioning treatment, which leaves my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair that is also very coarse. I use Neno Natural as a conditioning or hot oil treatment and can&#x27;t believe how beautiful my hair is afterward. It feels soft and looks thicker. It does not have the unpleasant residue and heaviness the next day like other treatments I have used. Neno Natural is perfect for my hair and this is the first time in my life I can say that. I have tried expensive products from the salon only to find my hair weighed down with a grayish tinting over it. Neno Natural leaves my hair vibrant, silky and looking thicker!</li>
    <li> I have watch neno natural and husband on youtube I really like the product. I will order more when I need more it work very well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> That work for me and took me for 2 week to grow ! I don&#x27;t care about smell ....</li>
    <li> I like it, but this is definitely something I have and can mix together myself. Only purchased it to support the maker.</li>
    <li> Great shine haven&#x27;t seen growth yet still using while I have a protective style I use it maybe every other day</li>
    <li> I received this oil on 7/31/2013 and started using it today 8/1/2013. I&#x27;m super pleased with this oil and the way it responds to my hair I will use this oil for 4-6 weeks and then update again with my results regarding hair growth/thickness and overall health of hair I also love Neno Naturals website and the free booklet it&#x27;s simply amazing. Thank you Neno Naturals!!!!</li>
    <li> I have 4b and 4c hair that is thinning a little.  I recently purchased this product and can&#x27;t really comment yet on the it&#x27;s potential to grow the hair. It is very soothing to the scalp. My only caution is not to use before bedtime because it is greasy and will soil your linen.  Therefore, I prefer to use it as a hot treatment and rinse out.  I really do like the product as a hot oil treatment and will buy again.  Kindly, Liz - Boston, MA</li>
    <li> Great smell and very light.</li>
    <li> I love this oil it really controls my dandruff.  My hair stronger and healthier.  I will order again. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I really liked this blend of oils. It works really well on natural hair. I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair for. I use it to seal my hair when using the LOC method.</li>
    <li> Have to wash hair immediately when using small amount.&lt;br /&gt;Very oily when applied to dry hair. Next application I applied&lt;br /&gt;to wet hair, same very oily.</li>
    <li> This really works , my hair is growing so fast . Thanks Neno.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that contains all the best oils in one bottle.  The packaging is elegant and easy to use, you just spray!  It does what it says it will do, stimulate growth. After use, my hair feels so soft and very manageable and I have noticed a change within two weeks. Without a doubt I have found a favourite.  Thank you Neno Natural ......It&#x27;s about time my hair got the love it deserves!</li>
    <li> Been using Neno Natural&#x27;s Hair Growth Stimulator for a couple of months now and there are several things I love about this product.  It&#x27;s a robust mixture of oils without being too heavy or too light.  Sprays well from the bottle, you can either massage it in gently after or just leave it to do it&#x27;s thing. Great smell - the key one that comes out for me is the lavender which I found soothing.  I have used this product whilst my hair has been in twists and also now in braids and the great thing is that I am not seeing residue build up on my braids.  Finally, I have noticed some hair growth - but will wait a bit longer before I attribute the growth I have noticed directly to Neno Natural&#x27;s :), I am a bit of a sceptic when it comes to hair growth!</li>
    <li> Smells good, have not been using it consistently or as directed but I see my edges growing!!!</li>
    <li> You can see my full review @ the link below&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even shared the prodcut with my neighbor who is having some growth issues and she has seen results since usining the product</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I just can&#x27;t get use to the smell. I use it before I wash my hair and I let it sit in for a while under a plastic cap. It makes my scalp feel really good and my hair very healthy.</li>
    <li> I currently use this product twice a day.  I must say that I am absolutely loving the results that I&#x27;ve already gotten.  I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an effective product for some time to help stimulate the growth of my edges, and I&#x27;m elated that I&#x27;ve found Neno Naturals!  I love the fact that the blended oils are light and absorb very well into hair and scalp. There is no greasy residue left behind -- which is awesome!  This hair oil has become one of my staple products. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good blend of oils.  It makes my hair shiny every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the product for about two  weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing new growth! I will definitely be buying more.</li>
