      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>This product is a good value.</li>
      <li>Fit perfectly in my razor and good pricing.</li>

      <li>works well but is not as nicely made as they once were.  </li>
      <li>These blades seem to be better than the originals that came with my razor.  </li>
      <li>Shipped almost straight away great product easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver is like brand new.&lt;br /&gt;Combined</li>

      <li>Direct replacement, works great.</li>
      <li>good as new!</li>
      <li>Along with the outer foil, this made the razor as good as new!</li>
      <li>Have an older Panasonic shaver that my husband and I LOVED.</li>
      <li>Made a huge difference in the quality of the shave</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>These are genuine OEM replacement parts and they work as intended.</li>
      <li>and I wish it was still available.</li>
      <li>Someone must know where they are available.</li>
      <li>Though I was cautious after reading the \\&quot;these aren&#x27;t anywhere near as good as the originals\\</li>
      <li>&quot; We threw out the original, excellent, solid design and construction of the original blades in March 2004, and have replaced them with this very cheap, flimsy, shabby substitute, which will not shave you nearly as well as the originals.\\&quot;     NOT recommended... but there appears to be no choice.</li>
      <li>I shaved with the original blades for years and figured I should replace them.</li>
      <li>I have used the original blades and foil head since I have owned it.</li>
      <li>Extremely easy to replace, and provided a breadth of fresh air into an electric razor that was not performing well.</li>
      <li>Very easy to remove the existing blades and replace them with the new ones.  </li>
      <li>Easy to install and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>They work just fine, nice and sharp.</li>
      <li>For a reasonable cost, and very easy replacement of the old blades, I do not need to use my manual razor for &amp;#34;touchup&amp;#34;&amp;#62;  ;-]</li>
      <li>1st shave with new set was fine.</li>
      <li>Once again the sav-a-few pennies corp. mindset ruins a good product.</li>
      <li>The orginal blades where much higher quality, and had significantly more solid and substantial construction.  </li>
      <li>They sure last well.  </li>
      <li>SOMETHING is funny with these blades...</li>
      <li>This is the first time I feel I was ripped off by Amazon-</li>
      <li>If needed, I will return for more of the same.</li>
      <li>Why buy a new razor when the old one is as good as new with new blades.</li>
      <li>These are the genuine Panasonic blades....not the cheap knock-offs like other products that are being sold.  </li>
      <li>Only if they could make the rechargeable battery as easy to replace.</li>
      <li>Mine were several years old and these new blades deliver a much better shave faster!</li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t find decent blades I&#x27;ll have to get rid of the Panasonic shaver that has served me pretty well over the years.</li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>and I could shave fast again.  </li>
      <li>so the shave you get from them are fair to say the least.</li>
      <li>I was ready to send them back when I first saw them!    </li>
      <li>I had an older razor that was snagging.</li>
      <li>The replacement blades sound different than the old ones.  </li>
      <li>I liked my old razor and was not interested in buying a new one so this was an affordable resolution to making something old feel new again.</li>
      <li>Never had a fantastic shave since, even wet or with pre-shave.</li>
      <li>Well we have been through several and none give as close a shave as the old tried and true one.</li>
      <li>Since these are visually, mechanically and structurally inferior to the originals why can&#x27;t we find the right replacement blades?  </li>
      <li>What a difference new blades make.  </li>
      <li>Once I replaced the razor heads the razor was like new.</li>
      <li>This made my Panasonic wet/dry shaver work like new.</li>
      <li>The new blades do not even come close.  </li>
      <li>If you need new blades buy these.</li>
      <li>this with a new foil.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
      <li>I could cearly see why after I bought it, as I also had a new Remmington, and even tried a Grundig.</li>
      <li>My shaver shaves like it&#x27;s new again.</li>
      <li>I just assumed that after all these years... I should get new blades.  </li>
      <li>Now it works like new again.</li>
      <li>I have an older razor (10 years old), and was having difficulty locating replacement blades for it.  </li>
      <li>I did get shaved, and after a while, it was not bad, but it took as long as the old blades did.    </li>
      <li>I also purchased the Inner Blade set WES9070P as a replacement for the original ES9072 blades and installed  both at same time.</li>
      <li>Higher pitched, and more hollow, less substantial.  </li>
      <li>After using these a few times I put the old blades (probably 15 years old) back in and they work better by far than these new contraptions.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was expected</li>
      <li>Immediately I noticed a major difference in the construction of the blades.  </li>
      <li>I ended up putting the old blades back in</li>
      <li>They had to be dull or a different material than the ORIGINAL blades that came with my shaver.</li>
      <li>It took a long time to shave, and I had the pulling again, which I   experinced with the 8 year old blades.  </li>

<li> did I know that it was the wrong part until I have to replace my blades (1 1/2 years later.)  </li>
<li> I installed these new blades... and they were bad...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is a good value. Good price. Fast service. Good product. No cons. The product was just as advertised.  Will purchase again. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have owned a ES8068 for about 8 years. At the time I bought it consumer reviews regarded it as the best. I could cearly see why after I bought it, as I also had a new Remmington, and even tried a Grundig. No comparison. I have used the original blades and foil head since I have owned it. I get a good shave but it takes progressively longer. Occasionally I even get pulled hairs... which never happened in the past. Replacement blades were $70 in the past, so I kept putting off changing them.  Recently I decided it was time and ordered the blade foil head combination pack.  Immediately I noticed a major difference in the construction of the blades.  Panasonic, or whoever designed the baldes, took a continuous rectangular piece of metal, slotted it, and wrapped it around and attached it to the plastic base which connects to the blade mount.  The original blades consisisted of a series of 28 individual blades made out of thick steel, mounted individually in the plastic base. The orginal blades where much higher quality, and had significantly more solid and substantial construction.  The new blades do not even come close.  I was ready to send them back when I first saw them!    But I had to try them to see how they performed.  The replacement blades sound different than the old ones.  Higher pitched, and more hollow, less substantial.  The shave they delivered was also less substantial... It was almost as if I did not even change the blades. It took a long time to shave, and I had the pulling again, which I   experinced with the 8 year old blades.  I did get shaved, and after a while, it was not bad, but it took as long as the old blades did.    This appears to be another example of cutting corners and keeping costs down....     Too bad for Panasonic, and the have seriously compromised quality here.    I put the oringinal blades back in, and have returned to using them.    Panasonic states on the foil head / blade pack, that \\&quot;The blade&#x27;s shape has been modified since March 2004.\\&quot;    They should have said \\&quot; We threw out the original, excellent, solid design and construction of the original blades in March 2004, and have replaced them with this very cheap, flimsy, shabby substitute, which will not shave you nearly as well as the originals.\\&quot;     NOT recommended... but there appears to be no choice.</li>
    <li> This made my Panasonic wet/dry shaver work like new. I considered buying an expensive Braun shaver with the cleaning cartridges, but I can get the same results by rinsing and drying the blades and then spraying some Shaver Saver lubricant/cleaner on them.</li>
    <li> Great replacement part!  Along with the outer foil, this made the razor as good as new!</li>
    <li> WES9070P Panasonic Shaver Blades for my ES8068&lt;br /&gt;I just bought these blades to replace the blades that have been in my Panasonic model ES8068 shaver since I&#x27;ve owned it for the past 8+ years...  I wasn&#x27;t having a problem with my shaver... I just assumed that after all these years... I should get new blades.  I installed these new blades... and they were bad... like they were DULL... I had to go SLOW because it wasn&#x27;t cutting my facial hairs fast enough... I ended up putting the old blades back in and I could shave fast again.  SOMETHING is funny with these blades... They had to be dull or a different material than the ORIGINAL blades that came with my shaver.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
    <li> These are the genuine Panasonic blades....not the cheap knock-offs like other products that are being sold.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Very easy to remove the existing blades and replace them with the new ones.  Made a huge difference in the quality of the shave</li>
    <li> Since these are visually, mechanically and structurally inferior to the originals why can&#x27;t we find the right replacement blades?  Someone must know where they are available.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned and I wish it was still available.</li>
    <li> These blades seem to be better than the originals that came with my razor.  Mine were several years old and these new blades deliver a much better shave faster!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I purchased this and the replacement blades are linked to my shaver- they don&#x27;t fit.  not even close to being a match to my razor.  Thought I made a mistake, looked it up and this same advertisement for the blades are linked to my razor.  They do not fit.    OF course to get the blades out of the package, you have to tear the package apart.   This is the first time I feel I was ripped off by Amazon- your advertisement  clearly was wrong- these blades do not fit my razor.</li>
    <li> I had purchase this as part of Amazon&#x27;s recommendation when I purchased my Panasonic razor.  Little did I know that it was the wrong part until I have to replace my blades (1 1/2 years later.)  I wish Amazon would do cross-checks before placing products together!</li>
    <li> Easy to install and reasonably priced. My shaver shaves like it&#x27;s new again. Only if they could make the rechargeable battery as easy to replace.</li>
    <li> I had an older razor that was snagging. Once I replaced the razor heads the razor was like new. It is expensive but much cheaper than buying a whole new razor plus it minimizes waste. I liked my old razor and was not interested in buying a new one so this was an affordable resolution to making something old feel new again.</li>
    <li> You should always replace the foil and blades at the same time. especialy if the blades and foil are over due for a change. The old blades and foil wear unevenly together so the shave you get from them are fair to say the least. If you only replace the blades you are putting straight blades on an uneven foil which is worse than the old bades and foil.</li>
    <li> Great price and service.  Secnd purchase and works great,  and always get great shaves from this unit.  Saved good money and service was great.</li>
    <li> Have an older Panasonic shaver that my husband and I LOVED. After the blades dulled we did what everyone else does, purchase others. Well we have been through several and none give as close a shave as the old tried and true one. Watched a vid on youtube on how to pull the razor apart, change the batteries and the blades...good as new!</li>
    <li> After using these a few times I put the old blades (probably 15 years old) back in and they work better by far than these new contraptions. Once again the sav-a-few pennies corp. mindset ruins a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same wet/dry Panasonic battery operated shaver for about ten years now. I buy replacement foils and blades about every two years. These are genuine OEM replacement parts and they work as intended. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as advertised and arrived promptly and in good order.  Very satisfied.  If needed, I will return for more of the same.</li>
    <li> works well but is not as nicely made as they once were.  I got my shaver back in the nineties and the replacement parts then were make a little nicer back then</li>
    <li> Shipped almost straight away great product easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver is like brand new.&lt;br /&gt;Combined this with a new foil.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
    <li> I have an older razor (10 years old), and was having difficulty locating replacement blades for it.  These arrived on time, and work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I bought these some time ago.  They sure last well.  If you need new blades buy these. Why buy a new razor when the old one is as good as new with new blades.</li>
    <li> Though I was cautious after reading the \\&quot;these aren&#x27;t anywhere near as good as the originals\\&quot; posting below, I went ahead and bought these as replacement parts for my beloved panasonic es8068. They work just fine, nice and sharp. Give it a try, and return if they don&#x27;t work for you is my recommendation.</li>
    <li> Direct replacement, works great.</li>
    <li> Extremely easy to replace, and provided a breadth of fresh air into an electric razor that was not performing well. Now it works like new again. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> What a difference new blades make.  For a reasonable cost, and very easy replacement of the old blades, I do not need to use my manual razor for &amp;#34;touchup&amp;#34;&amp;#62;  ;-]</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers, I claim these things are pretty dull. I shaved with the original blades for years and figured I should replace them. Never had a fantastic shave since, even wet or with pre-shave. If I can&#x27;t find decent blades I&#x27;ll have to get rid of the Panasonic shaver that has served me pretty well over the years.</li>
    <li> This WES9077P outer foil fits my ancient Panasonic shaver ES8068. I also purchased the Inner Blade set WES9070P as a replacement for the original ES9072 blades and installed  both at same time. Hope these replacements last as long as the originals. 1st shave with new set was fine.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly in my razor and good pricing.</li>
