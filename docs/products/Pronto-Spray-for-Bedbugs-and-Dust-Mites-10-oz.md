      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>after capturing and running my own expriement, I am happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>Good products</li>
      <li>I bought two bottles of Pronto after reading good things about it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good dust controller</li>
      <li>I also recommend purchasing &amp; fitting your bed with mattress covers to prevent bed-bugs from ever getting inside the mattress ever again!  </li>
      <li>(make sure it hits the water!).  </li>
      <li>Product wasn&#x27;t effective.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t treat bedbugs on your own.  </li>
      <li>Just to be safe, bought more sprays, laid more DE ect.</li>
      <li>Please just call the exterminator, its a lot of money but trust me you are better off.</li>
      <li>You might get out two or even three uses out of one can, so stock up to four or five just to be sure.</li>
      <li>Maybe Pronto does eventually work, but if an insecticide spray takes more than 2 hrs.</li>
      <li>My neighbor was able to sign for it and immediately inquired what I ordered from the Pest Control Company....</li>
      <li>You do have to keep on going to be sure they are all gone.</li>
      <li>(They LOVE to hide during the day -- under fitted sheets, inside pillow cases, in you school backpack, in your pants pockets, etc.  </li>
      <li>I just go there and buy as many bottles as I want for no shipping charge.</li>
      <li>I have a queens side bed which had the most</li>
      <li>So I was happy to see this live bug</li>
      <li>Loved the fact that I could get a good night&#x27;s rest starting from the day it arrived.</li>
      <li>This stuff is strong smelling</li>
      <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff in the world and then for it not to work, not right.  </li>
      <li>I will give my recommendation as I see fit to all my tutors and students at TutorsTeach.com where I work as a tutor.</li>
      <li>My comforter was so filled with bugs and eggs</li>
      <li>I can say that I am not disappointed, as I wanted something that would kill bedbugs and it does.</li>
      <li>When I first used this spray I also used something called D Earth use the safe for pet grade not the pool grade.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Awesome product, it took me 2 cans to clean my bedroom.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was still spraying every week for a while just to make sure, but I am certain this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I have not found its claim to be lingering to be quite true:  </li>
      <li>It required two sprays to get rid of the bugs Good price for product but shipping costed same as product</li>
      <li>Now for the good news:  bedbugs CANNOT crawl up smooth surfaces like glass or stainless steel, so major appliances are an obstacle to them, walls and furniture ARE NOT.  </li>
      <li>The con is that it ended so quickly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what purpose bedbugs serve in the grand scheme of things, but this product will snuff out the lives of those ruining your personal grand scheme.  </li>
      <li>love it cause its powerful , have not put much because its too too powerful .</li>
      <li>had slept on my precious new mattress while I was away</li>
      <li>and he still kept right on crawling.  </li>
      <li>But there was the proof right there in my face as I sprayed and sprayed and sprayed that bedbug.  </li>
      <li>The product seems to be fine but you&#x27;ll need quite a few cans if you want it to be effective.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t stop them quickly, they will over-run your whole home.)    </li>
      <li>A professional came out, said we were fine.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re bitten, I&#x27;d recommend a tetanus booster and keeping the bite covered with an antiseptic cream (most of which also contain petrolatum, so you&#x27;re not only protecting yourself from bacteria in the environment, you&#x27;re keeping the bedbug from returning to a proven feeding ground).    </li>
      <li>It seems to work, so I am pleased with this purchase and would only recommend product if you use it without kids or pets around.</li>
      <li>However, my only dissapointment is that I was looking for more of a fogger that would cover all areas.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to work at first</li>
      <li>When I got bitten again the following night I was sure the bedbugs are back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you smell something like formaldehyde in a part of your home or office, it&#x27;s a safe bet that there are bedbugs present.      </li>
      <li>at first i didnt</li>
      <li>I know i&#x27;m back to order 2 more cans.</li>
      <li>I first noticed, after 3 weeks business trip away in NY,</li>
      <li>DO change the filter regularly, especially if anyone in the dwelling smokes (tobacco, weed, whatever -- the air filter will clean the tiny pollution particles out of the air as long as it&#x27;s kept clean and happy).    </li>
      <li>Used this product about one month ago and so far so good, no new bites.</li>
      <li>My advice get mattress and box spring covers along with pillow case, clean religously and hire a professional.    </li>
      <li>I bought this product and because of the strong smell, I thought it might actually work, but it didn&#x27;t, NOT at all!</li>
      <li>You MUST move the bed vacuum between it &amp; the boxspring, clean the bed itself and apply clean or new sheets.</li>
      <li>it reduces the swelling and stops the itching for hours if you take a large dose.  </li>
      <li>and start slaughtering the things before they can spread, you will probably escape the need for a professional exterminator who will charge you hundreds (or thousands) of dollars to spray ... pretty much the same ingredients which are in Pronto, just a whole lot more of it.    </li>
      <li>The good news is that bedbugs apparently cannot swim at all, unlike roaches and other insects.  </li>
      <li>If you see a live one crawling on a piece of paper, gently lift the paper and keepturning it so the bedbug stays on top (they have a powerful grip); then flick it directly into your toilet bowl.  </li>
      <li>This product worked very well.</li>
      <li>The shipment was fast.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first sleeping on the bed after I used it, but now I feel great especially since I have no more marks or bumps on my skin.</li>
      <li>Pronto really works.</li>
      <li>I hope this has helped you, gentle reader.  </li>
      <li>The 10 ounce can doesn&#x27;t seem to be sufficent and yet 2 cans is too much of this toxic killer.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally I&#x27;m ready to use it.  </li>
      <li>so yes you prob need to do this a couple of times to up your chances of really getting the eggs and the adults.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Jaundiced Eye&#x27;s helpful review of this product, I decided to buy 4 cans of Pronto, and let me tell you folks:  </li>
      <li>I received it in a very timely manner.    </li>
      <li>There has been a definate reduction of bedbugs thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>If you develop a histamine reaction (localized swelling) take as much benadryl or vistoril (hydroxizine) as your doctor will allow --</li>
      <li>, so keep extra cans handy for future eruptions.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t waste your money, honestly.</li>
      <li>As far as I have been able to determine, this is exactly the same product as 10 ounce \\&quot;Pronto,\\&quot; but at nearly twice the price.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to have received my Pronto spray, because although I&#x27;ve been spraying, I&#x27;m just spraying, not really able to tell a big difference or not.  </li>
      <li>and they are back full force.</li>
      <li>Bed Bugs LOVE dark areas, wood, and cardboard.  </li>
      <li>If a bedbug gets onto your skin, first try to gently shake it off into a toilet bowl, or scoop it up (gently!)</li>
      <li>If possible, just thrust the whole area where the bedbug is under a powerful stream of water, as in a shower or</li>
      <li>It seems they don&#x27;t take to metal well at all and by getting rid of their main nest</li>
      <li>Bed Bugs is high.</li>
      <li>Instead I needed to do a little more work and go from area to area and spray.</li>
      <li>One was a cheap powder I got from a hardware store that contained deltamethrin that I put in the corners and cracks away from direct contact with people according to the directions and the other was getting rid of my wooden bed frame, replacing it with a cheap metal one.</li>
      <li>These kind of products hardly ever work on bed bugs.</li>
      <li>But remember, you MUST dust, clean, sweep and vacuum all areas between beds, near the headboards including the mattress itself</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work.  It streamed out and trickled the spray</li>
    <li> Did NOT Work at all! Total waste of money, time and effort!!  In fact, I think it attracts bedbugs for some reason :(  P.S: Heard Diatect Bed Bug killer works the best - I am trying that.</li>
    <li> I put a bedbug in a jar.  I sprayed it with Pronto.  2 hrs. later it was still alive and well.  THIS kills &#x27;em:  Adams Flea and Tick Spray.  The aforementioned bed bug died within seconds of being sprayed with THAT!  Maybe Pronto does eventually work, but if an insecticide spray takes more than 2 hrs. to kill, I don&#x27;t want to take a chance on it.</li>
    <li> This product pronto sucks. It did not work. I bought a new mattress and everything;used the spray;they are still crawling all on my mattress, like I bought the new mattress for them to play on LoL. This is crazy. Where did bedbugs come from anyway and why is there all of a sudden a break out of these nasty critters. This is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Spot on it does kill them, takes seconds if you spray them directly. However, my only dissapointment is that I was looking for more of a fogger that would cover all areas. Instead I needed to do a little more work and go from area to area and spray. This stuff is strong smelling so yes you prob need to do this a couple of times to up your chances of really getting the eggs and the adults. Order many bottles, best to have them on hand than risk new eggs hatching cause you missed them orginally.</li>
    <li> The seller is very good.  I received it in a very timely manner.    Unfortunately this stuff is alright but does not get at the root of the problem with bedbugs.  It their lifecycle you have to end.    This only kills the ones you see and maybe some you don&#x27;t but it does not stop them from reproducing.    You can&#x27;t treat bedbugs on your own.  You have to call the professionals.  They are too pesty and annoying to deal with alone.    My advice get mattress and box spring covers along with pillow case, clean religously and hire a professional.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else on the market.  You are only helping the problem</li>
    <li> The product seems to be fine but you&#x27;ll need quite a few cans if you want it to be effective.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of Pronto after reading good things about it. It didn&#x27;t seem to work at first and I was very disappointed. However, 3 weeks after using it, the bed bugs were gone. It&#x27;s now been 2 months, and I still have not seen one. Not even at 5 in the morning in the spots I used to see them on my wooden bad frame. Previously I&#x27;ve tried Sterifab, diatomaceous earth, alcohol, heat, cold, neem oil, throwing things out and none of this worked beyond some contact killing. Pronto really works. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I&#x27;d update this review. I have since eliminated bedbugs from my apartment as of a year ago. This product helped but it was in my opinion 2 other things that really did it. One was a cheap powder I got from a hardware store that contained deltamethrin that I put in the corners and cracks away from direct contact with people according to the directions and the other was getting rid of my wooden bed frame, replacing it with a cheap metal one. I believe it was the metal bed frame that had the biggest impact. It seems they don&#x27;t take to metal well at all and by getting rid of their main nest I severely affected their ability to hang around. Good to be rid of them.</li>
    <li> I read that people brought this product with diatomaceous earth.  So, I followed in their footsteps.  I brought the Pronto and long and behold the packaging was not discreet.  My neighbor was able to sign for it and immediately inquired what I ordered from the Pest Control Company....so I explaned.  So I was upset that the packaging was not discreet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I&#x27;m ready to use it.  10oz does not go very far.  i would suggest if you decided to buy, to get at least 6 more cans than you think you need.  I shake the can, and there is pray inside, but since its so low, i&#x27;m wasting at least two ounces.  One can only did 1/4 of my carpet and a little bit of my couch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it work?  I see no results.  In fact, I saw 2 bed bugs over the last week.  I am so determined to see if my investments in these products worked that I put both bed bug in a zipper freezer bag. I poured Diatomaceous earth in one.  It took about 6 hours for it to finally die.  The other bag I sprayed pronto and it took about 15 minutes for it to die over.  But I had to spray directly on the bug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced that the pronto does the trick.  Its a repellant so you literally need 20 cans to douse everything in, because the bugs will run.  Diatomaceous Earth actually worked and I&#x27;m shocked because I brought 10 pounds of it . . . power everyone in my house . . and I didn&#x27;t know if it was working either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after capturing and running my own expriement, I am happy with the results.  I give Pronto 3 stars because the bug did die, but I saw no results in my house and the two cans I ordered ran out within minutes.</li>
    <li> nothing else to say \\&quot; IT WORKS\\&quot;. Expensive but worth the money if you have bed bugs.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and because of the strong smell, I thought it might actually work, but it didn&#x27;t, NOT at all! I totally wasted my money and till this very second I am being bitten by those nasty blood suckers. I hate bedbugs they are ruining my life and my skin looks like crap. No man will ever love me now because of all these nasty blemishes they leave behind. I am totally getting depressed over this situation, wish this product worked. Please just call the exterminator, its a lot of money but trust me you are better off. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle to treat my desk.  There is no sign of bedbug on my desk,  but I just want safety.  The con is that it ended so quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good dust controller but we don&#x27;t need to order it anymore. I found something great at Home Depot that I don&#x27;t have to ship. I just go there and buy as many bottles as I want for no shipping charge. It&#x27;s also cheaper there and bigger. I will give my recommendation as I see fit to all my tutors and students at TutorsTeach.com where I work as a tutor.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well. I would definetly recommend anyone having problems with bedbugs to use it. I was hesitant at first sleeping on the bed after I used it, but now I feel great especially since I have no more marks or bumps on my skin.</li>
    <li> The shipment was fast. The product turned out to be a good one. Haven&#x27;t seen any bedbugs after I sprayed my corners with it</li>
    <li> On 2009 I had a problem of bed bugs, I tried everything and nothing worked, then I found this product on Amazon, and I said: \\&quot;Well I don&#x27;t have anything to lose\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product, it took me 2 cans to clean my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Just apply, and seal your room. Repeat next day and you&#x27;ll see results after 2 days of doing this (morning and night)</li>
    <li> I bought this twice for bedbug treatment. But unless sprayed directly on the bug, this doesnt work if you wanna get rid of bedbugs. After spraying the bugs can still infest. So powder killers like Results bedbug powder or diatomaceous earth is recommended.</li>
    <li> This is very effective and kills bugs on contact. But doesn&#x27;t get rid of them.</li>
    <li> Unlikely extremely negative reviews for other supposed bedbug killers, I can assure you that this stuff kills &#x27;em DEAD.  The catch-22 is that they also find it repellant, so they will run away from a sprayed area.  The secret to success is spraying a wide area *around* the location with the infestation (a \\&quot;cordon sanitaire\\&quot; in military lingo), and THEN go after the bugs themselves.  When they try to flee, they will run up against the chemical barrier you laid down first.       Del Pharmaceuticals sells a 6 ounce can of what they call \\&quot;Pronto Plus\\&quot; for six bucks.  As far as I have been able to determine, this is exactly the same product as 10 ounce \\&quot;Pronto,\\&quot; but at nearly twice the price.  The problem I ran into with plain \\&quot;Pronto\\&quot; is that the last couple of ounces wouldn&#x27;t spray out of the can, so I effectively had 8 ounces of usable insecticide.    I have tried regular ant &amp; roach sprays on these d___d critters and they do NOT work -- bedbugs have a different physiology (and a grotesque life cycle - look &#x27;em up on the net; there&#x27;s at least one full web site dedicated just to them -- Cimex lectularius is their scientific name).    READ THE LABEL DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!  Spray and leave the room while it works its mojo to avoid poisoning yourself.    The bad news about Pronto is that however much you buy, you&#x27;ll always discover that you need at least two extra cans, so buy it in quantity.  I have not found its claim to be lingering to be quite true:  you&#x27;ll slaughter dozens of the things with the first spraying, but you must repeat the spraying every few days to guarantee that you have killed all of the little vermin.  On furniture, use your eyes to look for tiny pinpoints moving across fabric -- those are nymphs and they, too can suck your blood.  Scoop &#x27;em up and dump them into the toilet.  The good news is that bedbugs apparently cannot swim at all, unlike roaches and other insects.  If you see a live one crawling on a piece of paper, gently lift the paper and keepturning it so the bedbug stays on top (they have a powerful grip); then flick it directly into your toilet bowl.  More bad news is that they can live for up to 140 days without feeding (starvation actually EXTENDS their lifespan!), so keep extra cans handy for future eruptions.  The tiny transparent bugs you may see when you have a bedbug infestation ARE bedbugs -- just ones which haven&#x27;t sucked up your blood to fill their grotesque bellies -- kill them without mercy.  (Sorry, Gandhi!)    If you have the vermin in your carpet, get a vacuum cleaner which filters particles through water, or use a steam cleaner to get rid of them.  If you have a lot of books, just assume that the bed bugs are within the spines or under the covers, or inside the dust jacket, so just vacuum the bejeezus out of all of your books (on LOW, or you&#x27;ll rip the pages or damage the binding).  Speaking of vacuum cleaners, if you don&#x27;t have one which uses a water filtering system and can&#x27;t use steam (on books, for example), then TRY to get a vacuum cleaner with a multi-stage HEPA filter to keep from spraying minute bug bits into the air -- these can trigger severe allergic reactions in some people.    Other useful devices are hair dryers -- the vermin dehydrate and die at about 120 degrees F or thereabouts, and hot tumble dryers -- half an hour in that should kill any in your clothing and bedding. (They LOVE to hide during the day -- under fitted sheets, inside pillow cases, in you school backpack, in your pants pockets, etc.  If you don&#x27;t stop them quickly, they will over-run your whole home.)    C. lectularius CANNOT swim. If a bedbug gets onto your skin, first try to gently shake it off into a toilet bowl, or scoop it up (gently!) with a piece of paper and dump it in the toilet (make sure it hits the water!).  If possible, just thrust the whole area where the bedbug is under a powerful stream of water, as in a shower or a high-pressure kitchen or bathroom faucet.  DO NOT GRAB A BEDBUG WHICH ISON YOUR SKIN!!!!!  These things are EXTREMELY vicious and will ACTIVELY defend themselves instead of running away.  Yanking at a bedbug crawling on your skin is an invitation to it to bite you and hold on until it dies, and it WILL make you bleed.  Bedbug bites are VERY slow to heal, and if one&#x27;s sucked your blood for a while, the itchy mark it leaves behind may last two or three months (maybe longer).    If you develop a histamine reaction (localized swelling) take as much benadryl or vistoril (hydroxizine) as your doctor will allow -- it reduces the swelling and stops the itching for hours if you take a large dose.  DO NOT (!!!) drive or operate machinery if you are taking an antihistamine.  If you develop a pronounced allergic reaction (hives, difficult breathing, etc.) call 9-1-1 or go to a hospital emergency room IMMEDIATELY -- allergic reactions can cause shock and even death.      It is highly advisable to use a HEPA air filter in any room with bedbugs or mites to remove their feces and other nastiness from the air.  (I use a Holmes Model HAP 240.)  DO NOT get one of those silent, \\&quot;ionic air cleaners\\&quot; such as the Sharper Image sells -- they are all but completely useless; get something with a HEPA filter and make sure it&#x27;s big enough for the room you want to refresh.  DO change the filter regularly, especially if anyone in the dwelling smokes (tobacco, weed, whatever -- the air filter will clean the tiny pollution particles out of the air as long as it&#x27;s kept clean and happy).    One technique you might try ONLY IF THERE IS NO SMOKER AROUND, NOR ANY CHILDREN OR PETS (!!!!) is to drench an infested piece of furniture with isopropyl rubbing alcohol of at least 70% strength.  Isopropyl alcohol kills almost every living thing, so if you can alternate that with Pronto you can help to prevent resistant strains of the devils from developing.    Bedbugs have anal (Cloacal?) glands whic release a pungent stench like a stink bug.  If you smell something like formaldehyde in a part of your home or office, it&#x27;s a safe bet that there are bedbugs present.      Now for the good news:  bedbugs CANNOT crawl up smooth surfaces like glass or stainless steel, so major appliances are an obstacle to them, walls and furniture ARE NOT.  Another obstacle to them is petroleum jelly (one of Pronto&#x27;s ingredients is a petroleum product).  Smearing the legs of tables and chairs with petrolatum creates a barrier which they don&#x27;t like and have difficulty crossing. (A 99 cent store brand is just as good as a $3 jar of Vaseline for this purpose.)  If you have chairs and tables which won&#x27;t be damaged by water (resin chairs, for example), you can put the legs in a shallow saucer or pie pan of water -- once again, bedbugs can&#x27;t swim, so they can&#x27;t reach the furniture itself.    The best news of all?  Despite the huge number of horrible disease which blood sucking insects can transmit, BEDBUGS DO NOT SEEM TO TRANSMIT *ANY* DISEASES TO HUMANS!  (But they CAN trigger allergies.)  If you&#x27;re bitten, I&#x27;d recommend a tetanus booster and keeping the bite covered with an antiseptic cream (most of which also contain petrolatum, so you&#x27;re not only protecting yourself from bacteria in the environment, you&#x27;re keeping the bedbug from returning to a proven feeding ground).    I hope this has helped you, gentle reader.  I have studied the little monsters and even let myself be used as a human guinea pig ( ... ah ... \\&quot;volunteer research subject\\&quot;), so I know a lot about the damned things, and the more that are killed, the better off we&#x27;ll all be, sez I.  (Sorry, Dalai Lama -- pray for me.)  If you get your Pronto *pronto* and start slaughtering the things before they can spread, you will probably escape the need for a professional exterminator who will charge you hundreds (or thousands) of dollars to spray ... pretty much the same ingredients which are in Pronto, just a whole lot more of it.    ****** Pronto earns six stars out of five!  Long live Pronto! DEATH TO ALL BEDBUGS! ******</li>
    <li> I was being eaten alive by a sudden infestation of fleas and bedbugs.  My comforter was so filled with bugs and eggs I threw it away but I used both Pronto and Steri-Fab on my pillows, mattress and box spring.  There is no petroleum odor associated with either product.  Just spray in a well-ventilated area and let them air out through the day and you can sleep on them that same night.  I&#x27;ve had no skin irritation from using these products and my nasty infestation is gone!  Good products if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to need them.</li>
    <li> This product was received as promised and was packaged so that it would not be damaged.  It seems to work, so I am pleased with this purchase and would only recommend product if you use it without kids or pets around. It is toxic and manufacturer issued warnings on the product. The 10 ounce can doesn&#x27;t seem to be sufficent and yet 2 cans is too much of this toxic killer. Smells bad works well; I haven&#x27;t seen anything on the market that states will do the job like this one.  I can say that I am not disappointed, as I wanted something that would kill bedbugs and it does.</li>
    <li> Used this product about one month ago and so far so good, no new bites. I only gave it 4 of 5 because the can was hard to spray, it would only spray if held upright not on its side which made it a bit difficult to spray under the bed and other places where the little buggers might hide.</li>
    <li> I had a bad case of bedbugs in the apartment I moved in in the end of August 2008.  I managed to get out of there with no legal consequences, but my bed had to stay behind.  Even though I took careful measures not to transport these guys with me (washing, bagging straight from the dryer, inspecting everything), the second night in my new place I got two small bites on my ankle.  When I got bitten again the following night I was sure the bedbugs are back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Pronto and NEVER got bitten again.  I was still spraying every week for a while just to make sure, but I am certain this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product took so long to get to me that I put in another order on Amazon. It came 5 days before this showed up. I never got to use it. It is still in my cabinet. That is why I call this deal Sad.</li>
    <li> .this is garbage. I saw it in the store and decided to buy it . don&#x27;t waste your money, honestly.</li>
    <li> This is perfect product to compliment Steri-Fab. Use this in areas where the concentration of Bed Bugs is high. This will destroy bed bugs and their eggs as well! Since I wanted to use something less harmful and natural, I used Steri-Fab on my mattress and carpet and used Pronto for Cracks in wood and wall linings.   This will do what it promises to.. Must have to get rid of a bed bug infestation.</li>
    <li> love it cause its powerful , have not put much because its too too powerful . but it works well.</li>
    <li> This stuff does kill them off, after repeated use. There has been a definate reduction of bedbugs thanks to this product. May need a few cans for larger rooms, and don&#x27;t expect results overnight, but it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what purpose bedbugs serve in the grand scheme of things, but this product will snuff out the lives of those ruining your personal grand scheme.  I haven&#x27;t had time to deal with my bedbug problem fully, and I have sprayed the perimiter of my room, the doorjambs and threshholds, and the legs of my bed, and have managed (knock wood) to keep them corralled in the interim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have found dead bugs around the legs of my bed, so it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> It required two sprays to get rid of the bugs Good price for product but shipping costed same as product</li>
    <li> This product is great. I order 4 cans of Pronto and they arrived within one week. I spray around the beds, then worked my way inwards. I have a queens side bed which had the most so i removed the bed to the outside of my apartment building late at night. I sprayed the whole can on the bed(box Spring)and Knocking off any dead bugs with the brim. I even sprayed any bugs i seen. They die on the spot. Also buy bed covers for both parts of your bed just in case, mine hd cuts in it but they still work. So far I have been two weeks with seeing one bug.I still don&#x27;t sleep as well due to not knowing where these bugs came from in the frist place but i am sleeping. Buy this Pronto stuff. I know i&#x27;m back to order 2 more cans. Just in case. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Product wasn&#x27;t effective.  Sprayed twice, washed linen and still plagued with dust mites.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Jaundiced Eye&#x27;s helpful review of this product, I decided to buy 4 cans of Pronto, and let me tell you folks:  IT WORKS!  If you follow instructions carefully, by cleaning, vacuuming and sweeping all areas of the home FIRST before applying Pronto, you will summon death to all Bed Bugs!      I first noticed, after 3 weeks business trip away in NY, I returned home and noticed there were bedbugs invading my brand new mattress and they kept showing up as a relative had slept on my precious new mattress while I was away, they brought bed-bugs! Arrgh! I said NO MORE!  I read the reviews and instructions and decided to go with Pronto, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy!  Bed Bugs have been eliminated with no signs of returning!  I can now sleep with short sleeves or just shorts and I wont have any bed bug bites!      As other reviewers have stated, buy Pronto by the bulk!  But remember, you MUST dust, clean, sweep and vacuum all areas between beds, near the headboards including the mattress itself etc. DO NOT store any cardboard boxes or anything UNDER your bed, if you have shoeboxes or anything under the bed you MUST remove them and discard of them.  Bed Bugs LOVE dark areas, wood, and cardboard.  You MUST move the bed vacuum between it &amp; the boxspring, clean the bed itself and apply clean or new sheets. Spray Pronto within a foot of the walls from one end to the other, spray along cracks, and the floor under the bed.  I also recommend purchasing &amp; fitting your bed with mattress covers to prevent bed-bugs from ever getting inside the mattress ever again!  If this is done properly &amp; carefully (took me and my brother about 5hrs) you&#x27;ll never see a bed bug again guaranteed!</li>
    <li> Sh*t.  Pure and simple.  Sprays do crap vs. bedbugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple as that.</li>
    <li> This product does the job. I would buy the product again and i would recommend this product to anyone . I use it as prevention. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work that well at all didn&#x27;t appear to make any difference ended up going to get the real stulff from the proper people that deal with these type of problems</li>
    <li> Loved the fact that I could get a good night&#x27;s rest starting from the day it arrived. Was forced to go through Terminix treatment by the leasing office guys (for which they forced me to pay btw), but this has pretty much taken care of my bed bug problem.    The shipping takes a long  time -which is the only downside. Till then I used to swab lots of oil on the 4 legs of the bed -that works but only if you do it every night before turning off the lights.</li>
    <li> I saw a bedbug crawling up to my ceiling in the daytime, which is what they seem to do after they feast on us at night.  I was happy to have received my Pronto spray, because although I&#x27;ve been spraying, I&#x27;m just spraying, not really able to tell a big difference or not.  Still getting bitten about twice a night.  So I was happy to see this live bug and I could see the effect of this spray for myself.  NOTHING!  I sprayed that bedbug until I coated him with white and he still kept right on crawling.  You want to know what stopped him finally, Lice MD, the spray that people with head lice use on their furniture.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I was so angry.  This stuff isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff in the world and then for it not to work, not right.  But there was the proof right there in my face as I sprayed and sprayed and sprayed that bedbug.  I&#x27;ve done the same with rubbing alcohol and it would stop them in their tracks and they would fall right off the wall.  I&#x27;ve done it with peroxide, same thing, they clutch their little grimy throats and fall right off the wall, but when I sprayed, no saturated that critter with this Pronto, it kept right on trucking baby.      Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> Very good Product, my head was spinning when I saw bedbugs in my apartment, din&#x27;t know what to do. This product really works. But you need a lot to get rid of them, also you need to treat the house three times every two weeks to break the Bedbug, egg/reproduction cycle.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product, Dead bug, Steri Fab, DE, Safer, foggers, steamers, ect. I even spent over $500 to have all linen, and clothes professionally washed, bagged, and tightly sealed. A professional came out, said we were fine. For awhile seemed as though we were. Threw out and purchased all new furniture. Just to be safe, bought more sprays, laid more DE ect. Yay we thought they are gone.....Thousands of dollars later and they are back full force. Ugh I have yet to find a damn thing that works!</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected. Would require several cans to saturate a mattress.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product.  Although I used as directed, I&#x27;m still getting bit by flying flees in my bedroom.  I think the family that had this apartment prior to me moving in had a cat or dog who had flees.  I wish I had known this before moving in.  I would have \\&quot;bombed\\&quot; the place with a fogger!  I may still may consider the fogger!!!!!</li>
    <li> When I first used this spray I also used something called D Earth use the safe for pet grade not the pool grade. I also washed and dried everything in the temperature that I could very high heat kills them. I used every that could on them I wasn&#x27;t playing I steamed and vacuumed. And they was gone in a short time. By It self is not enough. Plus get at least four to five cans to kills the babies. Because a female can lay about 10 eggs a day.</li>
    <li> These kind of products hardly ever work on bed bugs. Do not waste your money, I used a ton of these but it did not work!</li>
    <li> Kills on contact...but for bedbugs you need something for the ones you don&#x27;t see. Was looking for something that would keep them away. This doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> I dont ever write reviews for any products, but for this I had to. I was unlucky enough to have bedbugs &amp; like everyone who had them, I was sick &amp; tired of being bit. I bought this, sprayed it around my bed and all the cracks by the bed &amp; bam 2 weeks later, I have yet to see a live bedbug. I see dead one from time to time ,but I dont mind that, Just shows the spray worked ! (:</li>
    <li> i used this all the time . spray everywhere so they dont come. and i didnt see them no more. keep spraying so the eggs will be killed too.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff. Killed those bugs at the second spray. Gone !! Just like that. You do have to keep on going to be sure they are all gone. You might get out two or even three uses out of one can, so stock up to four or five just to be sure.</li>
    <li> at first i didnt this wouldnt work,but we sprayed the bed the corners,basicly everything and i havent seen anybedbugs and not only that it kills stink bugs,so i highly recomend this product,the price is good,get at least 2cans!</li>
    <li> Works well. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with bug bites in my life until I just moved into my lastest place. I have not been bitten since using this spray.</li>
</ol>
