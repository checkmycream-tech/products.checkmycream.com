      <li>Smells good</li>
      <li>good buy.</li>
      <li>Its a nice smell that stays for about 4 or 5 hours..</li>
      <li>then its a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^^ that was my original preview.</li>
      <li>smells amazing, girls love it.</li>
      <li>To sum up, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to any one who is looking for a fresh and pleasant perfume.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE it to death.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colognes that my husband wears.</li>
      <li>You need to remember that not every cologne fits every person, but this one works excellent for me and it is a good everyday wear.  </li>
      <li>I love this smell on my husband.</li>
      <li>Anyway the fragrancy lasts enough in the wear that I use, so for me is ok, but if you have a better smell, maybe you are not going to be happy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cheap, high quality and very strong too</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loves this no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>This is a great deal at the price, smells like it should and lasts just as long as it would if bought from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
      <li>I am very picky about colognes, when go to shop one, I test large number and still mostly come out unsatisfied!</li>
      <li>After trying over 7 different famous colognes, this is perhaps my favorite.</li>
      <li>And every time he wears it he gets loads of compliments and it&#x27;s very reasonable priced!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a great, everyday cologne, this does the trick for me.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>get my taste, I also like Tsar very much.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Other brands don&#x27;t last 5 minutes on your body, but this here is a great, robust, lasting smell that captures the opposite sex in your corner for good!</li>
      <li>Also, it does last most of the day.</li>
      <li>He first got this as a christmas gift from a family member some years ago</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;ll most definitely benifit you in the women department.)</li>
      <li>This cologne is great smelling and it last long.</li>
      <li>I bought tha same lotion one year ago in a mall shop and is different from this one, because the quality of the bottle in this case is not as good as the first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, and very nice perfume maybe not sophisticated but for every day wearing is enough.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is handy and one push makes that a lot of perfume is applicate in one shot.</li>
      <li>as described fast shipping</li>
      <li>Real talk</li>
      <li>delivery fast.</li>
      <li>A fragrance worthy of the big cat-------You will feel like the King Of The Beasts or &amp;#34;Born Free&amp;#34; when applying this scent-------</li>
      <li>Close favourite to #1 favourite of Classic Gold.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>i highly suggest you buy it.</li>
      <li>This cologne is nothing other than a cheap product.</li>
      <li>What can I say, you never know how these products will actually fare after the first couple of time one uses it.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>and I bought a bottle for my 14 year old brother</li>
      <li>Moreover, it is supposed to be a French made which I really doubt, unless the perfumes&#x27; factories over there have lost their distinctive taste for excellence.</li>
      <li>, i bought a few as a present for my relatives from europe :)</li>
      <li>you would thinks that its fake because of the price, but the smell is so good</li>
      <li>I took a chance on this particular cologne, and boy did I hit it big.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find it on sale for around $20; however it doesn&#x27;t worth buying it for even less than $5.</li>
      <li>it really doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>Definitely have to purchase this again in the near future.</li>
      <li>Actually, so far, Tsar and this classic black Jaguar are the only two colognes that have attracted me, have not yet found a third one!!</li>
