      <li>If you have long, curly hair, this is one of the best hairdryers you can buy.</li>

      <li>This fit 3 requirements.  </li>
      <li>If you bought it then enjoy and if your thinking about it....</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have long, curly hair, this is one of the best hairdryers you can buy. The diffuser locks on, so it can&#x27;t just fall off all of the time like they will on most diffuser/hairdryer combos. There are a ton of heat and speed settings so you can vary as needed between blow-drying your hair straight or diffusing it. Also, the back filter is super great at preventing your hair from being sucked up into the intake fan.</li>
    <li> Got this for a relative for xmas. She is very pleased with it. It has 3 fan speeds, which is not that easy to find any more. It comes with a couple of drying accessories, too. It is not lightweight though, which, in my view is the only shortcoming.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great purchase and  great blower. My mother loves it herself. Buying her one for Xmas. If you bought it then enjoy and if your thinking about it.... GET IT ASAP!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to use the diffuser because the dryer itself is so heavy.</li>
    <li> Not a lot of power but perfect in every other way.  Attachments are excellent, and the cord is right length.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She really likes it, it is powerful, not too heavy, had great attachments for directing the air just where and how hot she wants it. Her only complaint is the control is done with a slide on the handle. She has a problem with hand strength and she has to struggle a bit to move the slide. Average person would probably not have an issue with this.</li>
    <li> This is Randolph&#x27;s wife: Best hairdryer ever because it has 3 speeds and 4 heat settings plus a 5th cool blast, and you can make combinations of the speeds and heats as you desire. Most other dryers only have high and low speeds, and either the low is too low, or not low enough.  This dryer really allows you to customize the heat and speed! It is not too heavy and not too loud.  I was apprehensive about ordering one online because I always tried to find a plug in stores whenever I bought a dryer, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a dryer in the stores that gave me these options, so I tried this one and I love it!  Smooths hair too.  I have much less \\&quot;frizzies.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this new hair dryer my husband bought me. It&#x27;s quiet. It doesn&#x27;t get ridiculously hot. It dried my hair in record time without disturbing people. I can&#x27;t wait to use the attachments that came with it.</li>
    <li> We keep coming back to this hairdryer.  This is our third one.  My daughter has super thick curly hair and the power and diffuser is perfect for her without any frizz.</li>
    <li> I like this because of the three speed settings and three heat settings.  I just like having the options.  I also like that the cord is fairly long.  Some are just too short and you have to stay so close to the outlet.  I will say, though, if you like your dryer to get super HOT this may not be the one for you.  It does get really warm but not &amp;#34;burn your skin&amp;#34; hot like some of them!  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Have three of these. Easy to clean. Multiple settings keeps my wife and our dogs very happy.  Made very well so that it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My current hair dyer was very old and did a horrible job of actually drying my hair. After much research I picked this one.  It was a little heavier then I thought it would be but otherwise I love it.  I have just longer then shoulder length hair that is fine but looks really thick. It is also very prone to the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do also use Bumble and Bumble Prep and Straight Blow dry which I am sure also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is fast and I like the cool shot button a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little hard to slide the controls in place so I sometimes use a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife requested I order this for her. She likes the design of the dryer and it is not available locally. The last one she purchased ran for a few years until it started smelling like burning electrical gear and we knew it was time for a new one.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty dryer.  Great construction.  Only problem....the on/off switches are a little hard to move with wet fingers.  But overall...still good product.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy ths hair dryer because its only 1875 watts, i started to buy a 2000 watt dryer, but chose this one instead......I have shoulder length hair and this hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes,  I love the color and also the fact that it has different heat settings and speeds,  so glad I purchased it</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to be dry as I get older. When I would get a haircut I would always leave the salon with my hair wet because I thought drying it would cause it to be frizzier, my stylist proved me wrong at my last visit. So now that I knew I could dry my hair and it would look good I searched the dryers for curly hair and read all the reviews and chose the Conair YOU. I really like the fact that I can dry my hair and have it look great in about 15 minutes and that&#x27;s using the low setting. It also comes with a defuser, which is a key to blowdrying curly hair. This is a great little dryer for naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> Just does not get hot enough</li>
    <li> Works fine, but large, heavy and has an awkward weighting that makes it more uncomfortable to use than my old one, but it dries the hair fine and has lots of different settings.</li>
    <li> Her last blow dryer died recently so I took a chance and surprised her (as I know nothing of blow dryers).  She couldnt be happier as not only does it work well (hot and cool modes) but it looks great too.</li>
    <li> I have been using the dryer for about a month. Dries hair in half the time than before.  Frizzies are tamed as well!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy but when I want it straighter, I use this dryer.  Dryer doesn&#x27;t fry hair and has multiple options for heat and speed.  Great dryer for all hair types!</li>
    <li> This is a good strong blow dryer. Its not as hot as some of the others I&#x27;ve owned, but it is still a good affordable option for a good basic hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I had an older version for years that I liked so much I matched the pictures to find this one. It has some serious blowing power which is the most important thing to me. Only possible downside is if your fingers are slippery from lotion or anything the buttons are harder to slide on or off. Not a big deal but that is the only possible bad side so still five stars! *****</li>
    <li> This product had been used and packaged up. The dryer does not get hot and the low speed is not very low. I will be returning the item. I liked the weight but the controls rub my hand badly</li>
    <li> I never owned a blow dryer before so i cant really compare drying time. Other than that i like the the item as a CG i choose to only use low heat on my hair with a finger diffuser to dry my hair. Which cuts my 8+ hrs (air drying) down to an hour (if i want it to be 100% dry) of waiting for my hair to dry. A couple of things that knocks this down to 4 stars instead of 5 is that you cant use the switches to keep it on a cool setting only the cool shot button, but holding down on that button while trying to get my entire head feels akward to me. Also, the finger diffuser that comes with it is tiny. I ended up purchasing a larger universal finger diffuser instead to cut down on the drying time.</li>
    <li> Looked for a long time for a hair dryer that has a low medium and high heat setting and a low medium and high blower button. This is a great hair dryer dried my hair fast!</li>
    <li> The problem that I have with this product is that the package makes it very clear this is a product geared towards dealing with curls.  Nothing in the title of the product or the description makes that very clear.  Don&#x27;t buy this thinking that you are just getting a normal hair-dryer...you aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I looked for months to find a hair dryer that had 3 heat settings (low, med, high) AND 3 actual fan speeds (low, med, high). It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I&#x27;m trying to cover all the topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fan Speeds:&lt;br /&gt;High: It&#x27;s a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I&#x27;d compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.&lt;br /&gt;Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat Settings:&lt;br /&gt;High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.&lt;br /&gt;Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I&#x27;d like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I&#x27;d rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don&#x27;t move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don&#x27;t find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you&#x27;re using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is a fantastic buy! I&#x27;m going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn&#x27;t get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won&#x27;t blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon&#x27;s site; it&#x27;s nice, but I really didn&#x27;t buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don&#x27;t find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you&#x27;re using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is a fantastic buy! I&#x27;m going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn&#x27;t get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won&#x27;t blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon&#x27;s site; it&#x27;s nice, but I really didn&#x27;t buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchased this dryer over the last 10+ years.  They have each had a different name, but the same features.  I have fairly long thick hair, and need the multiple speeds and heat settings available on this model. (OFF is NOT a speed!) The first 2 each lasted 5 years or more, and for an inexpensive dryer that gets used every day, I think that&#x27;s pretty darn amazing.  Only one tiny complaint: the cord needs to be a bit longer...  I was going to purchase a second dryer to leave at the beach house, but 2 weeks after the original purchase, the price had almost doubled.  Boooooooo...</li>
    <li> Its not bad for the price</li>
    <li> I had one like this for about 8 years. Even though it still works I figured I should retire it as an extra or back up. I searched everywhere and bought several new hair dryers but none compare to my old one. I googled the serial number of my old one and with awesome luck I found the exact same hair dryer that I loved for all those years. Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery and the great product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to upgrade my 5 year old pink Revlon dryer just because. It still works excellent but the color was peeling off and it was looking manky. I liked the color of this one, the additional of the ions and the reviews were fine. It was cheapest on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the same same watts as the Revlon but this one is quieter but doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful a blower but it dries my hair just as quick if not quicker than before so it&#x27;s fine with me. It has both three heat and three speed settings and previously I had just the heat settings. It makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair seemed to settle easier and wasn&#x27;t static-y or looked like I fell backwards through a hedge afterwards seeing I used minimal product and was going for a speedy dry not a style. I also never got a burnt scalp which was sometimes the case before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly heavier than the Revlon I had and the cool shot button is sometimes in the way but I&#x27;ll just train myself to hold it differently as it was only occasionally when switching sides that I bumped it. This was mentioned in other reviews so it was not a deal breaker for me anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems this one is also great for curls and comes with a diffuser and some curling instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also there is no &amp;#34;Infinity&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Conair&amp;#34; logo on the actual drier but the box seems totally kosher and even on their website it&#x27;s the same dryer.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a hair dryer that had 3 speed and 3 heat settings and was reasonable priced.  This fit 3 requirements.  It doesn&#x27;t get quit as hot as I expected, but I am still pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this dryer. She enjoys using all the attachments and says it dries her long hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> This thing does not die. I drop it every time I use it because I&#x27;m clumsy, and it keep going. I like how you can keep it on a low heat setting and blast cold air very easily. The temperature spectrum on this is good: hot is very hot, and low is warm. The cold button gives nice, cool air.  I never need to put this above medium speed and low heat and I have VERY thick hair. No weird smells, no weird noises, just a hair dryer that gives you lots of flexibility and does the job.</li>
    <li> I have decided to embrace the curl after years of trying to eliminate curls.  This dryer with the  diffuser does a great job of drying my hair without pulling out the curl.</li>
    <li> Works better then any hair dryer I ever owned, This product met all my expectations, I recommend this highly and will be buying more as presents.</li>
    <li> This was my second of this hair dryer because I accidentally left my first one behind at a hotel. I love all of the features especially the cool button for that last blast to set my style. My hair is wavy/curly and I love the diffuser, my hair always looks good when I use this dryer.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer works better than any other I&#x27;ve owned.  If you want a powerful, quick drying 3 speed, 3 temp device, this is the one!  It&#x27;s actually my second ( the first one was dropped); all others I tried were quite inferior. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon.  Also reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a dryer that had 3 speeds. I&#x27;d gotten a couple but returned them because the low speed was not so low.  It seemed they weren&#x27;t making them anymore until I saw this one. Now I have cool shot, several heat settings and a low, med. and high speed that all live up to their titles! My only complaint was a complaint on my last dryer and many I&#x27;ve seen. The two switches for the settings are almost flush with handle and slide up and down supposedly by the shallow  bumps on the slide. My problem is my thumbs slide off if they are at all wet or have product. With my last one I had to take a towel to turn it off or change settings. This one is not as bad but I was looking desperately for switches rather than slides. Alas... I had to compromise. Overall I am very happy with the dryer. Oh...it is not too heavy and is small enough to use easily.</li>
    <li> I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok. I usually use this and another dryer, both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn&#x27;t terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it&#x27;s ok with her, it&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
    <li> Of all of the dryers I&#x27;ve owned in my life- this is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy curly hair and avoided blow dryers in the past, because they always made my hair look dry and as if it doubled in volume. However, I decided to take a chance on this hair dryer, and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time! I use it five or so days a week and my hair looks just as nice as it does when I let my curls air dry. I have used both attachments that come with it and have no complaints about either of them. I mainly stick to the lower heat settings and the diffuser- I find that my hair looks best when I do this- but I do love that I can straighten and relax my hair a little using the higher heat settings and the concentrator attachment. Overall, I still think this blow dryer is amazing even months after I bought it, so I recommend you try it even if you are on the fence about it like I was.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days, but I already love it. The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it&#x27;s not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says \\&quot;you\\&quot; on it instead of \\&quot;infiniti\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;Conair\\&quot; underneath, though it does say \\&quot;Conair\\&quot; on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it&#x27;s just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it&#x27;s a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn&#x27;t last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn&#x27;t find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I&#x27;d only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It&#x27;s just a little longer than this one and it&#x27;s so easy to attach it. If they&#x27;d made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp.etter than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I&#x27;d only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update.

    <li> Seems to be a good hair dryer. Easy to use, not too heavy. I&#x27;ve had it about a month, no complaints so far. Cord is long enough. And it is a pretty teal.</li>
    <li> long ago, my unfavorite uncle and his wife bought me a hair dryer.  I desperately needed a new one and this one blows my old one out of the water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about a month and it works as expected. I struggled to find a reasonably priced hair dryer with 3 heat and 3 speed options and this one works well for me. My use is pretty basic and I don&#x27;t often switch between the settings, which take a little effort to move (hence the 4 stars). This dryer is quieter than my previous one but still scares the animals in the house. It came with 2 attachments (diffuser/director) and a click in feature that I like. The weight of the dryer is normal (I don&#x27;t consider it a light dryer). I had no issues with the delivery/shipping.</li>
    <li> This has the performance I was looking for.  I have fine, straight hair that I blowdry almost daily and this has the power to not only cut down my drying time but also makes it so I dont have to use the flat iron as much because it powers out the waves I do have.&lt;br /&gt;I do sometimes hit the cool button by accident while drying because of where its located on the handle but I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;My sister had this dryer before me and I had to copy her.  The only con I would say is it doesnt get super hot but my daughter loves that about it when I blowdry her hair.</li>
    <li> The dryer does a good job, much improved over my last one, which was also a Conair and lasted more than 15 years. The new one is obviously much heavier. My hair appears to be more manageable.</li>
    <li> The product works as I expected it to and lives up to others of that model I have had. Liked the price too and it came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I had this dryer for years and they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores around me any more so I was so happy when I found it on Amazon!  Love this dryer it does such a nice job with my curls! I ordered an extra one for the future, my daughters dryer died so she took my extra to use until she could replace hers. Well she loves it so much she just ordered two more one for me and a backup for herself!</li>
    <li> We first tried this at a relative&#x27;s house.  It is a great hair dryer that I recommend.  Nice even heat, good blower motor.</li>
    <li> I accidently left my Infinity hair dryer back home when I moved...so I was so happy to find this one which is pretty much identical. The only con to this one is that the cord tends to twist up too easily even with limited use. Otherwise it is a near replica of my favorite hair dryer! Overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair so fast!  I love it and would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good hair dryer at a low price.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really love these hair dryers. Very powerful and easy to pack on a trip. Great product</li>
    <li> This is an ok hair dryer. I had a previous model and it lasted for a very long time. My only real complaint is that I think it should get hotter on the high setting.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t lie, the color of this blow dryer caught my attention before anything! The reviews seemed decent and the price was great so I thought if go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did. The blow dryer works really well! It dried my long hair really quickly, and my hair holds on to water forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that dropped a star were the locations of the switches. These aren&#x27;t normal buttons you can avoid; the entire front of the handle is made of two switches that you slide up or down to control heat and air power. I haven&#x27;t accidentally changed the setting on myself, but its just an always spot and not easy to avoid.</li>
    <li> Disappointed to see that the hairdryer did NOT have the Infinity Conair logo on the side.  It does not look like the picture shown, therefore it is a misrepresentation of the product.  It has the logo &amp;#34;YOU&amp;#34;??  what is that suppose to mean.  I expected to get a hairdryer that looked exactly like the picture but I did not.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairdryer! I am on my third one. I have been using this hairdryer for about 10 years. They seem to just die after about 3 years of regular use. It is easy to clean, ergonomic, lightweight, comes with attachments, and it has lots of settings. I love the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; setting for sealing a blowout hairstyle. If you are cautious about using heat, it has a very low heat setting option.</li>
    <li> My old Conair hair dryer finally smoked--it owed me nothing after many years of great service--and I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the stores that measured up. Found this one online and so far, it&#x27;s great. I love that it has options. 4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations. It was the only one I found like it. While the speed isn&#x27;t as fast and the heat isn&#x27;t quite as hot as the old one, it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it! After returning one that felt awkward and top heavy, I like that this one feels light and balanced. I don&#x27;t have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality. Hoping it lasts as long as it&#x27;s predecessor!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast &amp; as described.  No complaints!  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is a superior hairdryer - we were fortunate enough to buy it for a super low price here, but it is worth any price.  Very powerful air and the right controls.  Perfectly balanced also.  I never thought much about the quality of a hair dryer before, but after having this one, know that there is a big difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t blow bry my hair often but I have to say this dryer doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I have curly hair so I have been doing the air dry thing for a long time until someone showed me how to use the curly hair thingy, (you know the big circle thing with fingers). So I thought this dryer would do the trick. I think it does the job,but considering I have had not even a year yet, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The dryer is powerful and dries well, but the on/off is a little awkward. I bought a dryer stand so it is still and easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Conair Hair Dryer several months ago. I have been very pleased with my purchase. My previous hair dryer was also a Conair and I had used it for several years. There are a few improvements on the new dryer that the old one didn&#x27;t have, and I am very happy to have them because they were things I didn&#x27;t like about the old dryer. This dryer has a &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; button, a feature I haven&#x27;t had before and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I even needed it. It does come in handy when finishing styling, holding your style in place.There are two attachments; a flow director and a defuser. These attachments easily snap into place and are easy to remove, unlike the old attachments which were a struggle to get on and off. This dryer fulfills all my needs. Thanks for the improvements Conair. The dryer shipped quickly and was in good shape when delivered. Fulfilled as promised by Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great and haves the heat and blower speed variations/combinations that I need for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Best hair dryer ever A++++++</li>
    <li> Blows my curls frizzy. Diffuser has a very small radius which makes it not so diffuse. Really disappointed given the price</li>
    <li> I have basically the same blow dryer that I needed to replace (different color).  This one is targeted for people with curly hair and the diffuser is half the size of the one that came with the older blow dryer.  Fortunately the old one fits on this new one.  Love that there are 3 heat and 3 speed settings - impossible to find at the store for some reason!</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  My old one finally broke, went to the store but I couldn&#x27;t find a similar dryer.  Bought a different one/brand and hated it - I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t check online first.  Anyway, I&#x27;m happy now - works great - strong airflow, easy to maneuver.</li>
</ol>
