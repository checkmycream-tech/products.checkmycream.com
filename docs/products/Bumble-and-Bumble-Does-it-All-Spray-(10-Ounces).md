      <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that while this is an excellent setting spray that helps hold my style all day, the aerosol can it&#x27;s packaged in is defective.</li>
      <li>this is the best I&#x27;ve found for styling.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a while since a hair product has impressed me</li>

      <li>I have used all kinds of hairsprays but this one is by far the best one!</li>
      <li>If you want a hairspray that keeps your hair in place but still soft and flowy looking this is the perfect one.</li>

      <li>it would not buy again, would love to have something that would hold and not flaten your hair</li>
      <li>And my hair has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>But, I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>Okay let me start by saying that i am not a fan of all b&amp;b products</li>
      <li>I have tried many types of hairspray for curly long hair and this one is perfect.  </li>
      <li>very light, easy to brush out</li>
      <li>I love that the mousse is light.</li>
      <li>always buy it , kind of pricy though, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Easy to style and hold</li>
      <li>(most scented hair products make me sneeze) and it works wonders to provide light hold and smooth flyaways.  </li>
      <li>Easy to comb out &amp; wash out.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for my fine hair in humid weather.</li>
      <li>ok I love this spray so much, going to be purchasing another one as soon as this ones gets used all up!</li>
      <li>Quick shipment by seller!</li>
      <li>This spray does it all shine, heat protect and LIGHT moveable hold.</li>
      <li>I think that this is a great product, especially for people who have oily hair like me.</li>
      <li>Sure almost 30 bucks is a lot but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>And this stuff wasn&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
      <li>I am dissapointed and definitly do not think it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>This spray is very light and would be suitable for those with very fine hair and wouldn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
      <li>This is really one produce I love.</li>
      <li>I am at the point of throwing away a 3/4 full can of this spray.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this spray.  </li>
      <li>Ladies i had the same problem as most are complaining about curls would not hold for more then a hour are so and in the texas heat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great finishing spray, keeps the frizz down and the shine up.</li>
      <li>It is great for smoothing out certain strangely pieces &amp; shaping styles.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, soft hair that gets fly-a-ways.</li>
      <li>It does smell good and light weight which I loved, however DOES NOT HOLD for long at all and for the price was not worth it.</li>
      <li>It works really well on my hard-to-hold hair, giving it the strong hold it needs.  </li>
      <li>, I ran it under hot water and cleaned the spray with a towel, it worked!</li>
      <li>My hairdresser recommended I use this before styling on my fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>Great the next day too, hair is so soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only hairspray I&#x27;ve ever liked</li>
      <li>Its does not leave your hair stiff, smells great and hold the curl/wave for hours.  </li>
      <li>if used right.</li>
      <li>He is right about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a light weight hair spray, this ones for you, highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>Have used it for a long time and it does a nice job.</li>
      <li>I find this spray keeps the curls as if I have no hairspray in my hair at all which allow my curls to move freely but with hold as if they are natural curls!</li>
      <li>(This particular Nexus hairspray is fantastic and MUCH cheaper than BB which I&amp;#34;m conserving) or Toni and Guy flexible hold hairspray.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind paying more for products that actually do what they promise.  </li>
      <li>Basically this product does nothing and if your looking for thermal protection I can&#x27;t imagine why you would choose this product over the countless others that do a much better job.</li>
      <li>about halfway through it, it takes extra force to try to get the spray to come out and the aerosol top is about to quit working.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is ALWAYS clogged!!!!</li>
      <li>And this spray is super other product friendly!</li>
      <li>hairspray for days when you don&#x27;t want your hair to move, but it&#x27;s certainly done wonders for my hair.</li>
      <li>which i really like but it does not hold well at all.  </li>
      <li>Is this a knock - off or the real product?  </li>
      <li>So be gentle with the nozzel (don&#x27;t try and twist</li>
      <li>I have thin, fly away hair that can&#x27;t handle a lot of product.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff because it hold well</li>
      <li>I did not like the smell very well</li>
      <li>I still use the BB primer, which is a miracle in a bottle and fights every last bit of frizz and adds fantastic shine so I will continue to fork out the cash for it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product to give me the hold I need.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I will most certainly NEVER buy this product again.</li>
      <li>This spray is very light and the hold is strong enough to last into a second day.  </li>
      <li>Then my cousins girlfriend who had long lasting curls that stayed in place at every family function, threw me a bone i asked how do you get such perfect curls that last and shine?</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
      <li>tag.ak to whether or not they hold up in high humidity.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>If you want something to hold an up-do or a difficult style then this probably won&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;The spray nozzle on this is part of what makes this hairspray so great.</li>
      <li>I went thru every kind of hairspray and complained it was not doing its job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Run Run Run, what the other reviewer wrote about this doing nothing and comparing it to water is 100% correct. I however relied on all the other glowing reviews... big mistake. Never in my life have I been so disappointed to the point of going online and warning others, and I am on my way with receipt in hand to return this product. I bought at bloomingdales so I think I have that option. Basically this product does nothing and if your looking for thermal protection I can&#x27;t imagine why you would choose this product over the countless others that do a much better job. Such a shame, I can&#x27;t even say it smells good because it doesn&#x27;t, the price also makes it particularly insulting. :( -10 stars...</li>
    <li> I like this spray a lot.  I use this spray on hair that&#x27;s been primed with BB&#x27;s Invisible Oil Primer and air dried overnight.  I think the two products work well together.  Even when it&#x27;s raining, I get no frizz and my style stays put all day and my hair has tons of body.  I can&#x27;t say anything better than that.  I sparingly spray my dry hair in sections and then let it dry completely before using hot tools, either hot rollers or a curling iron.  It doesn&#x27;t take much product to give me the hold I need.  After finishing my style, I use Nexus Comb Thru hairspray to set my hair with invisible flexible hold. (This particular Nexus hairspray is fantastic and MUCH cheaper than BB which I&amp;#34;m conserving) or Toni and Guy flexible hold hairspray.  The BB Does it All spray smells great, which is a nice feature, but the fragrance dissipates quickly however.  This spray is very light and would be suitable for those with very fine hair and wouldn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Although this spray was expensive, the can is large and should last a good while. I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that cost me a small fortune so I don&#x27;t mind paying more for products that actually do what they promise.  And this spray definitely fits the bill.  I&#x27;ve been looking for cheaper alternatives but haven&#x27;t found a single one.  Drugstore sprays are either too stiff or too sticky and don&#x27;t control frizz like BB.  This spray is very light and the hold is strong enough to last into a second day.  And if per chance I need to recurl, I don&#x27;t need any additional product.  And my hair has never looked better.  This spray is definitely the BOMB!  It works really well on my hard-to-hold hair, giving it the strong hold it needs.  I can&#x27;t ask more than that. If you buy this from Sephora or from the BB website, it&#x27;s $28.  Anything more is highway robbery!!  I definitely recommend it, despite the high price tag.ak to whether or not they hold up in high humidity.  Like BB, both of these need heat to work best.  Both define my waves.  I still use the BB primer, which is a miracle in a bottle and fights every last bit of frizz and adds fantastic shine so I will continue to fork out the cash for it. And I still use either Nexxus Comb Thru or Toni and Guy flexible hold hairspray.  It&#x27;s been a while since a hair product has impressed me and now I&#x27;ve found three.  I&#x27;ve just used up my 2nd can of BB and I have one in reserve.  However, when that one&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m going to use one of the products I mentioned instead.  There&#x27;s such a huge price disparity that I simply can&#x27;t justify the price of BB when I get the same results from two other sprays.</li>
    <li> Holds well without being sticky or stiff.  Smells great as well.  The best hair spray and would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> love this product! I have thick, fine hair and it holds the curls!!</li>
    <li> I hate this hairspray!! After years of using high quality hair sprays such as Paul Mitchell Freeze n Shine, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try after reading several reviews. I found it didnt hold my hairstyle at all, it was like spraying on water!! Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray! I have thin, fly away hair that can&#x27;t handle a lot of product. This hairspray is perfect - it&#x27;s super light and smells great. You can still work with your hair afterwards. If you are looking for a stiffer hairspray, I would not recommend this. This one is great for curls that you don&#x27;t want to douse in nasty stick hairspray or weigh down.</li>
    <li> This is really one produce I love. Have used it for a long time and it does a nice job. Not heavy and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I always buy it , kind of pricy though, but worth it.</li>
    <li> So after my second can of B&amp;B Does It All, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that while this is an excellent setting spray that helps hold my style all day, the aerosol can it&#x27;s packaged in is defective. The first can I had was a gift, and I was very impressed with how the spray worked but when the can quit spraying at half empty, I chalked it up to my fault or something and threw it out. I bought another and about halfway through it, it takes extra force to try to get the spray to come out and the aerosol top is about to quit working. What is it about cosmetics and hair product companies that they can&#x27;t make delivery systems that are convenient and functional?</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of the sticky, crunchy hair that is created with hairspray.  But, I LOVE this product.  It smells great (most scented hair products make me sneeze) and it works wonders to provide light hold and smooth flyaways.  It&#x27;s the only hairspray I&#x27;ve ever liked and it&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I think that this is a great product, especially for people who have oily hair like me. It protected my hair when I dried it and made styling much easier. I am not sure how good it is for people with dry hair though.</li>
    <li> I finally sucked it up and paid for a bb hairspray.  It&#x27;s light weight and smells good, which i really like but it does not hold well at all.  I am dissapointed and definitly do not think it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this spray. I&#x27;ve tried to use other sprays but always come back to this one.  So happy when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my fine hair in humid weather. The smell is not gr at either. I was expecting  something amazing after reading other reviews but was very disappointed. Unfortunately, it is non-returnable!!</li>
    <li> I am not a hair sprayer. I am a bed head kind of girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for those days when I must be more presentable, this spray helps hold my hair without helmet head. My stylist also told me that it serves as a &#x27;builder&#x27;, helping products to layer. He is right about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this product is that it smells. I have to spray it and then leave the room. Ick.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have been ordering it for years now.</li>
    <li> This did not seem to be the same as the cans I purchased directly from B $ B.  Is this a knock - off or the real product?  Maybe my hair has changed but it just didn&#x27;t work as it did before.</li>
    <li> very light, easy to brush out</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended I use this before styling on my fine, straight hair. I use it both before AND after curling, and it makes the curls last much longer. I even sometimes use this spray before going to bed with a bun or french braid in my hair to help the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; curls stick the next day. This won&#x27;t replace &amp;#34;mega-hold&amp;#34; hairspray for days when you don&#x27;t want your hair to move, but it&#x27;s certainly done wonders for my hair. One bottle has lasted me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have used B&amp;B Does it all for years because it holds my fine, thin hair without weighing it down.  There is no build up.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for years and it is great.  It gives your hair a moderate hold so there is still some movement.  I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell of this spray.  It has very little or no hold.  I use it for styling and then use another spray for hold.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff because it hold well but with movement. Easy to comb out &amp; wash out. It is great for smoothing out certain strangely pieces &amp; shaping styles. I just think it&#x27;s over priced.</li>
    <li> Simply my favorite.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> My hair gives trouble to hold styles.  This makes it possible.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll love this product. Use it with any tool....or use it as hair spray or to set your velcro rollers.  Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product. Seems to weigh hair down and offers little to no hold.</li>
    <li> I am at the point of throwing away a 3/4 full can of this spray. At least I was, until I was reminded (here) how expensive it is! I have fine, flyaway hair, also, and I am just looking for a little oomph and fullness. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is ALWAYS clogged!!!! Every Time! I rinse the nozzle and soak it in warm water. I try spraying upside down after use. It is such a pain in the neck! I will most certainly NEVER buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this spray by my stylist. It&#x27;s a great finishing spray, keeps the frizz down and the shine up. Not sticky. No hold. Great the next day too, hair is so soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray!</li>
    <li> I was the same way........sucked it up and bought it.  It does smell good and light weight which I loved, however DOES NOT HOLD for long at all and for the price was not worth it.</li>
    <li> Okay let me start by saying that i am not a fan of all b&amp;b products some are over priced and  over rated, but this hairspray is not one. Sure almost 30 bucks is a lot but worth every penny. This spray does it all shine, heat protect and LIGHT moveable hold. Ladies i had the same problem as most are complaining about curls would not hold for more then a hour are so and in the texas heat maybe 20 mins. I went thru every kind of hairspray and complained it was not doing its job. Then my cousins girlfriend who had long lasting curls that stayed in place at every family function, threw me a bone i asked how do you get such perfect curls that last and shine? Texturing she said then curl then hair spray. She gave me the names and i bought the texturing spray try it and no look back.you have to put guts in the hair before curling it to help it stick then finish off with a light moveable spray u don&#x27;t have to have helmet hair to or hard hair to get it to keep the curl. And this spray is super other product friendly! So don&#x27;t blame b&amp;b it dors the trick if used right. Hope this helps sone of you!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of hairspray for curly long hair and this one is perfect.  Not too heavy but with plenty of hold.  Quick shipment by seller!</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray! I have used all kinds of hairsprays but this one is by far the best one! Best part is it holds the curls without it being so sticky and clumpy dry looking leaving my curls looking like very healthy curled hair. I find this spray keeps the curls as if I have no hairspray in my hair at all which allow my curls to move freely but with hold as if they are natural curls! I haven&#x27;t tried spraying prior to curling yet, going to give that a try next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit though, I stopped using this spray for a long period of time because it clogged on me. It wasn&#x27;t until recently, I was visiting my sister whom had the same hair spray and wow what a difference in the quality of my curls after spraying compared to the hairspray I had been using lately from my hair dresser. That one always makes my curls too stiff and unmovable making my hair look dry too. I thought to myself there has got to be a way to unclog my BB spray again, I ran it under hot water and cleaned the spray with a towel, it worked! Clogged again but tis ok I love this spray so much, going to be purchasing another one as soon as this ones gets used all up!</li>
    <li> Love this product. If you are looking for a light weight hair spray, this ones for you, highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, soft hair that gets fly-a-ways. This hair spray tames all my fly-a-ways and molds my hair to the shape I want without making it hard or sticky. If you want a hairspray that keeps your hair in place but still soft and flowy looking this is the perfect one. If you want something to hold an up-do or a difficult style then this probably won&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;The spray nozzle on this is part of what makes this hairspray so great. It gives a perfect fine mist. But it also has a habit of getting stuck and then you are out a bottle. So be gentle with the nozzel (don&#x27;t try and twist it).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one for expensive hairsprays but this on I have been hooked on for ten years.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Easy to style and hold&lt;br /&gt;without the &amp;#34;helmet-head.&amp;#34;  Would definitely&lt;br /&gt;purchase again, though I will be price shoppimg&lt;br /&gt;as this is way to pricey, even though I liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> B&amp;B Does It All works well to set long loose wave/curl set with a curling iron.  Its does not leave your hair stiff, smells great and hold the curl/wave for hours.  Its expensive, but works well.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped promptly. I love that the mousse is light. Great product</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t care for this doesn&#x27;t hold and would not remended it would not buy again, would love to have something that would hold and not flaten your hair</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this spray.  Having very thin, fine hair this is the best I&#x27;ve found for styling. It holds the style with out a heavy residue.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say anything positive about this product because it was so poorly packaged and the cap and top that dispenses the product was crushed to pieces and the can was dented when I got it. Couldn&#x27;t spray anything. And this stuff wasn&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell very well and it did not hold. I was looking for a spray that had combable hold.</li>
