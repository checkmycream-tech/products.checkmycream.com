      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am happy with this product as an eye cream.</li>
      <li>If this was a gift, though, I would not have been happy.</li>
      <li>Very nice eye cream</li>
      <li>I have used many eye cream products over the years and this one appears to have the best results...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not smell the greatest and, being a guy, I am not use to creamy gels being applied to my face but, for the results it produces, it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I figure I will give it a month and report bac if there are any amazing differences.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>also the tube it is in is very easy to use and makes dispensing the product very accurate.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and this two pack is one of the best deals I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>I feel that this product has changed my eye area for the better, as it feels firmer and softer</li>
      <li>The cream is very light weight, goes on smooth, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
      <li>The boxes were damaged, but the product fine.</li>
      <li>This is the only eye cream that does not make my eyes burn and itch, makes them feel great.  </li>
      <li>Great product definitely works.</li>
      <li>It felt so good to actually be feeling smooth, healthy skin (even when outdoors in the wind...</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several months and have experienced a noticeable improvement.</li>
      <li>This eye cream works as good as other creams that are four times the price.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy does not burn and gives the right amount of moisture in your eye area.</li>
      <li>, just right.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>First off, I am a man.</li>
      <li>The price was good on Amazon, and I spent enough to get free shipping.</li>
      <li>The puffiness and dark circles are still present but have been diminished greatly to the point that, compared to before hand, look like they have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the ease in wich it goes on and</li>
      <li>this I cream really works.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>pay a fortune for fancy eye creams when this one, at least in my experience, does as good a job?</li>
      <li>For many years I have lived with dark lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
      <li>have had a difficult time finding it in stores and am fortunate that amazon carries many of the neutrogena products online.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For the past month I have been using Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream and it has worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For me, most products including cosmetics,  set off a reaction that results in red irritated patches that last for months, but this has been my standard for years.</li>
      <li>After a week I began to notice less wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
      <li>In the directions (in the box) clearly specifies that is just to avoid expresion lines in eyes area.</li>
      <li>No reactions, no itching, no tearing, and so far, no wrinkles.</li>
      <li>and so far no results -</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t spend a lot on cosmetics, but I am almost 50 and people are always surprised.</li>
      <li>I have tried many eye care products for eye area wrinkles and this stuff is pretty weak!  </li>
      <li>I usually use drugs.com until I found my Neutrogena here and the prices are better, plus I got a 2 pack so have back up.</li>
      <li>Very emollient, and you only need a tiny dab</li>
      <li>Many people mistake me for being extremely tired or suffering from allergies.</li>
      <li>when normally, the skin would feel dry again).</li>
      <li>My dark circles have been reduced and I have a much improved look to my eyes</li>
      <li>In the month since I started using it every night, the dark shadows under my eyes really have lightened, and the tiny wrinkles I was starting to get at the age of 32 have literally disappeared.</li>

<li> I hate to apply the eye cream around your eye area and it ends up in your eyes and running down your face</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice eye cream if you want something that would moisturize without allergic reaction.  I have been using for a while now.</li>
    <li> Was everything i knew it would be. A little drop lasts for both eyes. And this small tube will last awhile. Not greasy. No fragrance. Its great!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  I usually use drugs.com until I found my Neutrogena here and the prices are better, plus I got a 2 pack so have back up.</li>
    <li> Not greasy does not burn and gives the right amount of moisture in your eye area. I hate to apply the eye cream around your eye area and it ends up in your eyes and running down your face, I have periodic acne and cannot afford lotion on my face.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it that long. It is thick and it does moisturize well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally squished some in my eye the other morning and it was not akin to how I imagine sulfuric acid would feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product as an eye cream. I figure I will give it a month and report bac if there are any amazing differences.</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes is extremely sensitive, and trying new products is always very scary.

    <li> First off, I am a man. For many years I have lived with dark lines under my eyes. Many people mistake me for being extremely tired or suffering from allergies. I dislike glancing at my photos and suffering from the feeling that I am a walking talking raccoon and so I decided to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past month I have been using Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream and it has worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a small pearl sized drop to the underside of my eyes once in the morning and once in the evening. The cream is very light weight, goes on smooth, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. Within moments I can feel the cream interacting with the skin below my eyes. The puffiness and dark circles are still present but have been diminished greatly to the point that, compared to before hand, look like they have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been impressed and has been using this product as well. Due to the fact it leaves a very thin layer and drys instantaneously she is able to apply her daily make up over the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a difficult time finding it in stores and am fortunate that amazon carries many of the neutrogena products online. I subscribed to this produced and so, when I am just about to run out, one is already on its way through the mail to me. For myself, each small tube seems to generally last about a month and a half to two months on average. Amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell the greatest and, being a guy, I am not use to creamy gels being applied to my face but, for the results it produces, it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and this two pack is one of the best deals I&#x27;ve found.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very emollient, and you only need a tiny dab, so it&#x27;s economical.&lt;br /&gt;Why pay a fortune for fancy eye creams when this one, at least in my experience, does as good a job?</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and have experienced a noticeable improvement. My dark circles have been reduced and I have a much improved look to my eyes</li>
    <li> this I cream really works. In the month since I started using it every night, the dark shadows under my eyes really have lightened, and the tiny wrinkles I was starting to get at the age of 32 have literally disappeared. No exaggeration. I only wish they had a Naturals line form of this.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye cream products over the years and this one appears to have the best results...one suggestion is to use it for at least a week as it initially appears to dry area but I believe this is just skin getting use to the Retional A.  After a week I began to notice less wrinkles and fine lines. Moisture increased as week.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works as good as other creams that are four times the price.  And no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye care products for eye area wrinkles and this stuff is pretty weak!  Even though it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, as far as eye care products go, it&#x27;s not worth it and I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two weeks and so far no results -</li>
    <li> Love this! Not greasy and soothing to tender skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, I was finding that the skin around my eyes was extremely dry and starting to peel. Of course, makeup wouldn&#x27;t stay on, and my eyes felt irritated all the time. I bought this eye cream, and within a couple of days, the dryness was gone! It felt so good to actually be feeling smooth, healthy skin (even when outdoors in the wind...when normally, the skin would feel dry again). I would highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Great product definitely works. A++!</li>
    <li> This is the only eye cream that does not make my eyes burn and itch, makes them feel great.  Not too moist so it is hard to put on makeup and not too dry, just right.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This had made a definite change in the skin under my eyes I really like the ease in wich it goes on and also the tube it is in is very easy to use and makes dispensing the product very accurate.  I feel that this product has changed my eye area for the better, as it feels firmer and softer and I do think it has changed the dark circles a little, but the biggest change is firmness and softness.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for a long time. I don&#x27;t spend a lot on cosmetics, but I am almost 50 and people are always surprised. The price was good on Amazon, and I spent enough to get free shipping. The boxes were damaged, but the product fine. If this was a gift, though, I would not have been happy.</li>
    <li> This product is not to avoid, minimize or to make dissapear dark circles in eyes area. In the directions (in the box) clearly specifies that is just to avoid expresion lines in eyes area.</li>
