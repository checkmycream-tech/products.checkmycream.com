      <li>so I have to charge it more often.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>This product really works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>I would not recomend buying it to anyone, and i tried using it more than once</li>
      <li>I was so impressed by the T.V ad that I went to Target &amp;amp; picked one up as my Christmas present to self.  </li>
      <li>totally worth it!!</li>
      <li>and I find it easy to use.</li>
      <li>With the revo my hair comes out very straight with a nice curve at the ends in 10 - 15 minutes.      </li>
      <li>I love it, it makes my fine but lots if it hair full of bounce and shine which lasts all day.</li>
      <li>and it works fine.</li>
      <li>hair is quite fine</li>
      <li>The metal plates inside the brush work with the heat of the dryer to make your hair shiny and frizz free.  </li>
      <li>it really keeps my hair looking nice &amp;amp;</li>
      <li>I liked the way it worked on my naturally straight hair.</li>
      <li>A couple of weeks ago I decided to get a light body wave.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy another one and am so happy I have a spare on hand.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this product - huge fan!!!</li>
      <li>But with Revo, amazingly, I get straight, shiny hair EVERYTIME that is full of bounce.</li>
      <li>The Revo Styler is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>(originally it was once every 5 days)</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about the Revostyler.</li>
      <li>after awhile I ralized that the Revostlyer really works like magic.</li>
      <li>SO TRUE.</li>
      <li>Every time I visit the salon and get a blow-dry, that day and the next couple are the only days my hair used to look the best.</li>
      <li>but this makes it easy and really does polish the hair like they say.  </li>
      <li>Thanks REVO!!  </li>
      <li>I bought this item a few years ago and it works great on my collar-length curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t fun.  </li>
      <li>let me tell you, the purchase was definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>I now wear my hair down more often and love playing with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product, it&#x27;s unbelievable how it manages to get hair so straight!</li>
      <li>I thought this was a piece of junk the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>The Revo Styler is at first tricky to use</li>
      <li>When I first bought Revostyler</li>
      <li>keeps your hair looking pretty.</li>
      <li>After my first use of revostyler I had fuller hair</li>
      <li>It really does work!  </li>
      <li>When I first started using it, sometimes my hair would get tangled, but you just have to stick with it.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I was given another one for a gift about 2 years ago, so I have a spare in the closet that I can get out and start using when this one completely kicks the bucket.    </li>
      <li>The Revo Styler captured my interest years ago when I first saw the infomercial on it.  </li>
      <li>Once my hair was long enough, I began using this product and it has worked great.  </li>
      <li>I still use a flat iron afterwards, but mainly to add shine, as this Revo product does a great job straightening my hair without making it look flat.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t keeping my hair straight,</li>
      <li>it is a very lengthy process, &amp;amp;amp;amp; the info says it will get faster with practice.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has hair!</li>
      <li>But if you have straight hair and want body, with a clean-finished look, then you should try it.</li>
      <li>customer service is really there when you need them.</li>
      <li>Too much hair and the styler will get caught.</li>
      <li>This is so much easier.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it because it wasn&#x27;t working very well</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to everyone who has had problems getting that straight salon look.  </li>
      <li>But, it really does work.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my hair totally straight</li>
      <li>I really like the way</li>
      <li>straight.</li>
      <li>To my horror, it turned out to be a very curly perm.</li>
      <li>I really think that you should buy Revostyler</li>
      <li>My hair really comes out shiny and straight.  </li>
      <li>It makes styiling your hair very easy and takes up half the time.  </li>
      <li>The nice thing about the RevoStyler is it takes your hair style from wet to dry, leaving it full of bounce and body.</li>
      <li>After about a month of using it you will have it down to a T and be super fast!!!</li>
      <li>I use this on my 15 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair too which is also very long and thick...and she loves the look better than using a straightener.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very impressed. I usually hesitate to purchase things after seeing an infomercial, because they are usually overexaggerate the items.  I was very pleased and finally able to obtain the style I had been trying to for years.  It works best if used as the instructions tell you on damp hair.  Style stays with little use of hairspray.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about this product.  I went to Amazon and Jayashree&#x27;s review was there-- verbatim.  I&#x27;m wondering if she works for the company because not I&#x27;m not sure if I want a product that might rip out my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased the RevoStyler and used it everyday. I liked the way it worked on my naturally straight hair. A couple of weeks ago I decided to get a light body wave. To my horror, it turned out to be a very curly perm. Thankfully, I own the RevoStyler and I am able to straighten out my hair everyday without using a flat iron to further damage my hair (with the help of Rusk Str8 lotion). It saved me from deciding to cut my hair short to get rid of these curls. Thanks REVO!!  P.S.  For the people who get tangled and do not like it, You are not using it correctly.  Watch the video!!! It works!!!</li>
    <li> I have thin, frisky, wavy hair. Every time I visit the salon and get a blow-dry, that day and the next couple are the only days my hair used to look the best. Even with the best of my blow-drying, my hair never turned out the way done at the salons. Besides, even if I managed to get my hair straight enough, it still lacked that &#x27;bounce&#x27; with self blow-drying. But with Revo, amazingly, I get straight, shiny hair EVERYTIME that is full of bounce. I do take the same time, since I follow Revo drying with an additional step of styling with a spray, but fundamentally Revo has done the work for me and I&#x27;m doing the additional step for hold. I&#x27;m so happy with this product, it&#x27;s unbelievable how it manages to get hair so straight! Extremely happy with it and I find it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was definitely skeptical when I first got this product.  It did take some time to get use to it and my hair got tangled a few times.  I have carpal tunnel and arthritis so it is very hard for me to blow out my hair and very time consuming.  This product was great. I&#x27;ve gotten so good at it that my hair looks better done by me than my hairstylist.</li>
    <li> This product sucks, It either tanged my hair or did nothing, I would not recommend this to anyone. &lt;br /&gt;I have thick wavy/curly hair, and now I have a Conair straightner, which does not tangle my hair in knots, and actually does a good job &gt;_&gt;</li>
    <li> This product works!!!  I have never been able to successfully straighten my hair with a blowdryer and brush - but this makes it easy and really does polish the hair like they say.  My hair really comes out shiny and straight.  I think the people for whom it doesn&#x27;t work for probably don&#x27;t read the directions before using.  Make sure hair is damp, not wet and take it in small sections at a time.  Can&#x27;t say enough about this product - huge fan!!!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing that it was suppose to do.  It got tangled in hair and we almost had to cut my hair to get it out.  I advise you not to buy this product it is a waste.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Revo Styler on a Monday. The new blow dry version, with shipping is was over $120. After I made my purchase I found 100&#x27;s of negative reviews. I wanted to call immediately to cancel my order. But the website does not provide a phone number, or any means of contacting anyone. Even via email. It took me two days of research to locate a phone number. I finally found one through an 800. directory. I asked to cancel my order and they said they could not cancel it. They claimed that the product was already shipped. But the website says it takes 4 - 6 weeks to receive. I asked for a tracking number and they did not have one. \\&quot;They would have one in the next few days\\&quot;. I ship items daily. USPS or UPS or any other provides you with tracking numbers immediately. I plan on refusing the item and returning it to them. Because supposedly they have a 30 day money back guarantee. This is obviously a scam. They will make $20 off of the shipping alone. Not to mention probably not fulfill the 30 day money back guarantee. DO NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH BUSINESS, AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS. You can see from the comments below that many of these positive reviews are fake and coming from the company. SHAMFUL.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair and this product is fabulous.  You just have to remember to do small to medium sections of hair at a time or else it will not work well.  Takes a little while to get the hang of but totally worth it!! It doesnt cut down on blow drying time but makes hair look much better with less hassle.  My styler lasted for years.  just now not working so well and cant believe it was discontinued!</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few years ago and it works great on my collar-length curly hair.  It gives my hair volume and smoothness that I just couldn&#x27;t get with my dryer and a big brush.  This is so much easier.  My daughter has very long, very curly hair and it did not work on her hair.  I knocked off 1 star for that.  Too much hair and the styler will get caught.</li>
    <li> I have used the RevoStyler for 5 years; I have thick curly hair and have tried everything under the sun to straighten it. Flat irons leave my hair either crimpy or so sticks straight, I look like Morticia Addams from the Addams Family. The nice thing about the RevoStyler is it takes your hair style from wet to dry, leaving it full of bounce and body. I have read reviews saying the product gets tangled in the hair or leaves it frizzy.  To avoid this I would suggest a couple of things: Start styling it when it&#x27;s wet, put product in your hair (I use a lightweight gel and shine), and the MOST IMPORTANT thing is blow dry it on high heat and in SMALL sections, starting with the back. Also, there are a lot of imitation products out there, I&#x27;ve tried them and they don&#x27;t work! The RevoStyler is the only one that&#x27;s held up to hair as tough as mine. If this product ever goes off the market, I&#x27;m back to course, curly, unruly hair.</li>
    <li> I totaly agree with the negitive review. If your hair is anything less than 10&amp;quot; long, your results will not only dissapoint you, but might really make you mad. I purchased the revostyler as soon as I saw it at Target. I have used it- not only on my self, but on a few of my friends. All of our hair was straighter,yes. But at the same time, frizzy. While you blow dry your hair, you push up the loose, shorter hairs. This results in fly aways. If you use styling products the flyaways are not so bad. But I thought I was buying this to reduce the use of gels and hair spray!</li>
    <li> The Revo Styler captured my interest years ago when I first saw the infomercial on it.  Recently I received it as a gift and I can&#x27;t say enough about how well it works.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My hair is quite fine and it&#x27;s difficult to style in a manner that shows bounce and shine.  The Revo Styler is at first tricky to use but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s as simple as ever to use.  The results that I&#x27;ve gotten everytime are like never before when I do my own hair.  I have more fullness, body and shine to my hair now.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has hair!</li>
    <li> I am so sorry that this product is discontinued. I am already using my second one, because I couldnt change the battery of the first one, which lasted at least 5 years of continued usage.    This product is WONDERFUL. When I use it everybody thinks I went to the stylist.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without my Revostyler. I bought it several years ago after seeing it on an informercial. I, too, had trouble with my hair getting tangled in the beginning, but I kept trying and after a few days it started to get easier and easier. I have fine, thin hair, and it gives my hair lift and body.    I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 or 5 years, and I use it almost everyday to style my hair. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m just starting to find that it isn&#x27;t holding a charge for very long so I have to charge it more often. (If you ask me, I think it has lasted a really long time!) I literally panic if I forget to charge it, knowing that I&#x27;ll have to use a round brush and my hair just won&#x27;t look the same that day. Fortunately, I was given another one for a gift about 2 years ago, so I have a spare in the closet that I can get out and start using when this one completely kicks the bucket.    I&#x27;ve also found it to be very helpful because I have a little arthritis in my hands, and it relieves me of having to tire out my hand by rolling the round brush over and over again. I would definitely buy another one and am so happy I have a spare on hand. Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another one and keep that one on hand--to prepare for the demise of my second one.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed by the T.V ad that I went to Target &amp;amp; picked one up as my Christmas present to self.  I ususally don&#x27;t get into leaving reviews..but I would have like to have known how horrible this was.  it is a very lengthy process, &amp;amp;amp;amp; the info says it will get faster with practice. What you don&#x27;t see on T.V. is you have to blow dry you hair &amp;amp; use the styler at the same time.  Plus the brush part of the styler kept falling off.  It is to good to be true! Sorry my hope were up as well.</li>
    <li> I have short hair but have been in the process of growing it longer.  Once my hair was long enough, I began using this product and it has worked great.  I have thick, naturally curly hair which I spend time straightening.  This product cuts the drying time down as well as styling time.  Drying my hair with the Revo styler makes my hair shiny and bouncy, without having to use styling products.  I still use a flat iron afterwards, but mainly to add shine, as this Revo product does a great job straightening my hair without making it look flat.</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair that can be huge once dry. When I first purchased this item I was not happy with it, but I persevered with it as suggested by the company. Included in the package was a printed notification that it can take a couple of weeks to get the hang of it. SO TRUE. I can do my hair in half the time and tell everyone how I could never live without it. My RevoStyler has been used daily for a few years now and I am just now noticing that it needs to be charged more often (originally it was once every 5 days) I am preparing to buy another as I would not want to go without it even one morning! I use this on my 15 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair too which is also very long and thick...and she loves the look better than using a straightener. If you are not happy most likely it is user error (as in my original case) not the item. You need to learn how to hold the item in order to get the look you are trying to obtain. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This brush is the best I could ever find for my hair &#x27;cause I have very thin hair and very short time to deal with it and in 3 minutes I have my hair as in the beauty parlor.</li>
    <li> I disagree completely with the women&#x27;s review that this product is not good.  It is great.   I do not have any issues with it at all.  It saves me extreme time.  You just have to towel dry your hair no different than without the item.  My hair has a wave to it andit was always hard to styler it now it is a breeze I recommend this product for anyone who has to roll their hair dry. I am going to purchase another one for my sister. And my brush never fell off once.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> After my first use of revostyler I had fuller hair and it was manageable. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people think and I don&#x27;t care.  This review is based on my experience and my experience only.  I don&#x27;t work for Revostyler and have no idea where it is located.  I am a 21 year old who has been using the product since it first came out in 2002 and let me tell you, the purchase was definitely worth it.  My natural hair is very thick, long, and naturally wavy.  Too wavy.  Before I bought the revostyler, I was straightening my hair by using a paddle brush.  It hurt and I always had hair come out.  It wasn&#x27;t fun.  So, I decided to buy the revostyler.  When I first bought the revostyler, I too was skeptical.  I thought that nothing could straighten this hair. But, it really does work.  The time it takes to style my hair has been cut in half and it never looks limp.  Same goes for everyone else I have invited to use this wonderful product.  My mom uses it all the time to style her thin, limp hair and it always turns out wonderful with the least amount of effort.  So, don&#x27;t listen to anyone else.  Listen to my review.  Like I said, I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years and for 2 years, my hair has definitely been at it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and I thought this could help styling it a little.  Not only it is difficult to use but also it got my hair all tangled I had a difficult time trying to get my hair out of the machine.  I feel that using a normal brush and dryer is a lot easier.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t write reviews but after using the RevoStyler I had to help my fellow poofy hair friends out there.  I have a lot of thin coarse hair, that people always make comments about.  I admit I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time on my hair, and have never mastered the round brush and hair dryer.  If I go to a salon I walk out looking great - but I can never reproduce the results at home.  Guess I am not that coordinated - until I got the RevoStyler!  I use it almost everytime I blow dry my hair.  I have never gotten more compliments on my hair then I have recently.  I now wear my hair down more often and love playing with it.  I would recommend this to everyone who has had problems getting that straight salon look.  I can&#x27;t match it, but I come close and that is satisfies me!  My hair type is perfect for it - my hair is hardly ever tangled, which helps to minimize if I do let the RevoStyler climb up my hair too much where it could get tangled, and my hair falls about 2 inches below my shoulder.  I have never been more happy about how my hair looks, this is a MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Personally I don&#x27;t care for this product but it does curl hair under a little to much sometimes but I probably just stink at it! Bit tricky to use I would say.  My sister on the other hand loves it and has used it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This product really works great on my hair. I always have the problem of extremely frizzy hair when I am trying to blow dry it straight but when I use the Revo Hair Styler it lessens the frizz and when I am done styling I add some Bio-silk or Shine enhancer to control the frizz and it works fine. Even when I used a blow dryer and curling iron I couldn&#x27;t get my hair totally straight and they take sooooo much more time. With the revo my hair comes out very straight with a nice curve at the ends in 10 - 15 minutes.      I would definately recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever, I have extremly curly hair and it did nothing but tangle and knot my hair and made it even more frizzy. I would not recomend buying it to anyone, and i tried using it more than once and that didn&#x27;t help any so please do not purchase this item and if you do be prepared to take it back.</li>
    <li> For all the people who got their hair tangled in it- WATCH THE VIDEO!!! I thought this was a piece of junk the first time I used it. Then before returning it I decided to watch the video. It shows you how if you don&#x27;t take giant chunks of hair and if you turn the correct position, your hair will never tangle and it will always turn out perfectly! I have the hardest hair to manage and this made my hair look FANTASTIC! After about a month of using it you will have it down to a T and be super fast!!!</li>
    <li> i received the product damaged, not working.  brush was not rotating after charging.  i returned item mid december.  amazon is still working on my refund.  all i can say, product did not work for me and i returned it.  but as always, i am a satisfied amazon customer.  customer service is really there when you need them.</li>
    <li> I used to be totally inept at blowing my hair out.  It would take an hour and I would be left with frizzy straight hair in the front and wavy hair in the back.  If I was going to a party or away for the weekend, I went to the salon for a blow out.  Now with the Revostyler, I feel like I can blow out my own hair BETTER than a stylist at a nice salon!  Its literally saved me hundreds on salon visits.  It has also saved me time; it used to take an hour, and now with the Revo only takes 15 minutes!! I think anyone who wrote a bad review doesnt know how to use the Revo right.  The anti tangle system built into the brush should prevent tangles.  If your hair still tangles, maybe your hair is damaged and you should invest in a good quality conditioner?  For the girl who says the Revo makes her hair frizzy, you are blow drying wrong.  You need to direct the blowdryer downward ontop of the Revo.  The metal plates inside the brush work with the heat of the dryer to make your hair shiny and frizz free.  I cannot say enough good things about the Revostyler. Now I can blowdry my hair like a pro!!</li>
    <li> When I first bought Revostyler I really didn&#x27;t like it because it wasn&#x27;t working very well it wasn&#x27;t keeping my hair straight, But! after awhile I ralized that the Revostlyer really works like magic. I really like the way Revostlyer works on my hair it really keeps my hair looking nice &amp;amp; straight. I&#x27;m not the only one that agrees that Revostyler works, even my oldest sister think that it really works great. So! I really think that you should buy Revostyler try it out, it works like magic  keeps your hair looking pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought the RevoStyler after seeing it in a T.V. ad.  I was really excited and hoped that it could help my thick, wavy/curly hair.  I was wrong.  It did nothing but get stuck in my hair and cause more problems than before I had it.  I watched the instructional video and tried it a few times, but it didn&#x27;t get any easier.  Later, I saw on a consumer report what it rated.  It got 3 stars, but the final result was NOT something I would want on my head. I would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was looking through the reviews and I was amazed to see a negative review for this product.  I was a little skeptical before I made my purchase, but I thought I would go ahead and try it and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could just return it.  Well, the product never made it back to the store and I have been using it now for over a month.  The video that comes with it shows you step by step on how to use it.  At first the brush was very difficult as I have extremely thick hair.  But I stuck with it for a few more days and with practice, I am now a pro.  For those of you who have thought about buying the brush, I would definitely tell you to buy it.  It really does work!  You just have to be patient with the brush and you&#x27;ll get it.  It makes styiling your hair very easy and takes up half the time.  When you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;ll have georgeous results.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair and sometimes like to wear a straight style. The RevoStyler is the perfect straightening tool. It does all the work and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of straightening balms with it. My hair is a little below chin-length and I&#x27;ve had no problems with tangling or getting caught in the brush. Great item!</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and this styling tool works great for me! Without it my hair has odd natural waves, but with it, it tames those odd waves to make my hair have that finished, neat look, with body (and not that stick-to-your-head look). I guess if you have curly hair it&#x27;s not for you. As far as getting tangled...as long as you watch the video and follow instructions on how to use it, this won&#x27;t happen (unless you have curly hair because from what I&#x27;ve read...this isn&#x27;t the tool for curly hair). But if you have straight hair and want body, with a clean-finished look, then you should try it.</li>
    <li> The Revo Styler is awesome.  When I first started using it, sometimes my hair would get tangled, but you just have to stick with it.  Blow dry small sections of hair at a time with the Revo Styler.  It took me a few weeks to get the hang of it, but now I&#x27;ve been using the Revo for 6 months, and I can&#x27;t remember what it was like without it.  I have extremely curly and frizzy hair but with the Revo Styler it becomes shiny, straight, and smooth!&lt;BR&gt;The Revo Styler is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased a revo styler way back in 1999 and it finally stopped working after almost daily use,(10 plus years) so I purchased another one!  I love it, it makes my fine but lots if it hair full of bounce and shine which lasts all day.My hair length has changed from short to long over the years and the revo styler is fantastic.</li>
