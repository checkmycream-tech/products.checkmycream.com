      <li>Just get experienced before going out in public with this on.</li>
      <li>This was definitely worth buying!</li>
      <li>Magic Slim works very well.</li>
      <li>I loved how it is a double sided tape which you can hide it between your skin to make that desired crease without it being visible.</li>
      <li>I have a monolid and don&#x27;t have any fold at all, so I was looking for something pretty strong.</li>
      <li>and the adhesive is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>quick shipping</li>
      <li>I havent figure the science to putthing this on quickly though.</li>
      <li>I think these are pretty easy to use, might take a while to get it exactly where you want it though.</li>
      <li>I have pretty oily skin, so I clean off my eyes with cleanser</li>
      <li>So worth my money.</li>
      <li>It works fine but only if you use it everday consistently for more than two month&#x27;s .</li>
      <li>I got it right</li>
      <li>and it did lift it right up.  </li>
      <li>When done right I could not see the tape.</li>
      <li>They take some practice to master the application, however once you get it right</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty unnoticable if you put it on the right way</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and looks natural.</li>
      <li>the first couple of times I used it, but not once since.</li>
      <li>It works well at first, but seems like your eye gets accustomed to it, then doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
      <li>You look funny and would not recommend it.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product .... and the extra bonus !!</li>
      <li>and I think this works pretty well.</li>
      <li>me, I found using a small pointed tweezer to pick up each strip with the white covers still attached works best.</li>
      <li>This helps me a lot to put it exactly where I want it.</li>
      <li>this my first time using a product of it&#x27;s type</li>
      <li>that was pretty annoying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift from my friend, and it works really well!</li>
      <li>ok.. U would think that if this country is selling to the us they would give directions in English ..</li>
      <li>extra strong hold</li>
      <li>Im not an avid makeup girl and only wear it on special occasions.</li>
      <li>This works really well</li>
      <li>I think you have to have very droopy eyes for this product to work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Consider the cost of trying this for maybe even a year straight, compare to the cost of blepharoplasty.</li>
      <li>And they are absolutely transparent.</li>
      <li>It works terrifically and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>nothing but made my whole face sticky and itchy luck pal.</li>
      <li>I thought that this tape wouldn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this brand and size over anything else</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get your hopes up too much, but</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>this is for you other wise if you would wear it daily</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t use yet, but looks good, just too little, not many, if u want to buy, u should buy more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen other brands that provide a better tool also.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t clean off the sticky glue properly on my eyelid.</li>
      <li>I think the fork is better than average.</li>
      <li>Works great but not very sticky after you wear a few hours</li>
      <li>I been testing doublesided eyelid tapes and I would say this one works decently.</li>
      <li>Then I&#x27;ll place the sticky side where I want my crease to be, peel off the white papers and then make sure the tape is sticking to my skin as much as possible.</li>
      <li>Decent results, but I need to allow sufficient time.</li>
      <li>Need to improve the removal process because you mess up more tape lifting it off backing than you get to use.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this seller and its product.</li>
      <li>packaging was nice, like the picture, but a few of the eyelid tapes were misplaced on the sheets and some were damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Be patient, it&#x27;s hard to peel off the plastic and also can wrinkle on its own and cause issues. Just get experienced before going out in public with this on.</li>
    <li> If you have oily eyelids, this is not for you. It works fine but only if you use it everday consistently for more than two month&#x27;s . other than that it can be pretty toublesome to use if you have never used tape before.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t work this product.... too hard to apply</li>
    <li> Just as it was displayed</li>
    <li> If u can rean Chinese then I guess this product might b ok.. U would think that if this country is selling to the us they would give directions in English .. What a scam..</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me - Would need someone else to apply it other than myself.</li>
    <li> Hard to use and did not do work as described.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations at all.  Very difficult for my wife to put on.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, and looks natural.</li>
    <li> It works really well. It sticks where you put it all day, making your eyes bigger. Haha~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the price is a little high to me. I&#x27;ll try some other products.</li>
    <li> It falls off sometimes.</li>
    <li> eyelid tape was very thick not even thin and did not stick, so it was horrible to wear, do not recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Good: The product does it&#x27;s work well.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: the amount - only two pieces are included, with about 10 pieces on each, i.e. we can only use it for about 20 times.</li>
    <li> It works well at first, but seems like your eye gets accustomed to it, then doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Have not used yet but will soon.  love the price  Thank you</li>
    <li> Magic Slim works very well. It&#x27;s a little tricky peeling them off of the paper, but maybe I&#x27;m clumsy!! They truly hold back the sagging eyelid!! And they are absolutely transparent. I love them!! I will continue to order them as needed.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of double sided eyelid tape so I decided to give this a try. This takes some practice I will warn you, but don&#x27;t get too frustrated if you end up wasting a few through trial and error. I watch a lot of YouTube so I looked up tutorials on how people use this. I got the hang of it and it works fine. The only complaint I would have though is that it&#x27;s definitely not sticky enough. When used correctly, it creates a natural crease that is hard to notice, but if the staying/lasting power is weak, it becomes useless. I still use this from time to time at home to define my crease when it&#x27;s looking a little funky, but I would not wear this out for the fear of it not staying put. There are other brands that have greater lasting power so once I&#x27;m done with these, I might try the other ones. I&#x27;ve seen other brands that provide a better tool also. The tool that comes with this tape is not as helpful as it should be.</li>
    <li> Thank you , Sean !!!!! I fell in love with this product .... and the extra bonus !! :) It sticks on well and yup</li>
    <li> This brand is okay but if you have too much eyelid skin its practically impossible to do. You look funny and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken some time to figure out the best way to line these on my eyelid how I need to but been wearing them pretty frequently at night. Been about a month not much difference but giving it a little longer.</li>
    <li> A great bargain! Tricky to apply if you&#x27;re &amp;#34;multilid&amp;#34; with droopy lids. If you get it on correctly, it&#x27;s less noticeable than Easy-Eye eyelifts,which have a shiny exposed surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I found using a small pointed tweezer to pick up each strip with the white covers still attached works best. I position the strip just above the crease, press on the covers, then carefully remove the covers before pushing the upper lid down on the now exposed adhesive on the top of the strip. Smooth out the upper lid over the tape, and I&#x27;m ready for a little Trompe l&#x27;ouil with a very light application of a shadow line in imitation of a deep set eye. Decent results, but I need to allow sufficient time. Sometimes it takes several attempts to get the placement right.</li>
    <li> I been testing doublesided eyelid tapes and I would say this one works decently. The stickiness is pretty good. Generally lasts me through out the school day before the tape becomes really visible. At the end of the day I can almost always see some bit of the tape but it is not super noticable. It is a little bit pricey for the amount too.</li>
    <li> It works perfect, with my oily skin. I initial thought that it wouldnt work on my skin type, but I have to say it really works! So worth my money.</li>
    <li> Ive been using regular eye tape (not double sided) for almost three years. I have uneven eyes where one is normal with a crease and the other is droppy and my eyes look croaked whenever I wear makeup. Although Ive seen on line many videos of how to train your eyes to use this everyday for 22 hours for 3 months in order to created a semi-permanent crease - Im not an avid makeup girl and only wear it on special occasions. However, I feel the ones Ive been using limits me to what colors I can use so it&#x27;s not so noticeable so I finally decided to try the double sided eye tape instead. And I love it. The tape is completely invisible as it folds the eyelid over it - Im sure Im explaining it wrong - so Im able to play with darker makeup and not just the ones that blend with my skin as I have nothing to hide now. This tape is harder to take off and while the one sided tape felt like I had nothing on - I do feel something is holding my eye up with this. But that is probably because Im not use to it. Anyway, I&#x27;m liking this tape better than the one sided one and Id recommend this one instead.</li>
    <li> This works really well and the adhesive is pretty strong. I only use it at night while asleep and use makeup remover to get all the adhesive off before applying my morning lotion and makeup.</li>
    <li> When I woke up, my eye had an allergic reaction and puffed up when I wore it too long (all morning and all night up until 1am) and I didn&#x27;t clean off the sticky glue properly on my eyelid. I guess that&#x27;s normal. The tape does what it is made to do and other than the allergic reaction, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. I was able to find better eyelid tape for a cheaper price. It is visible and noticeable. Double sided and very easy to put on but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> it does what it says it will.  I have serious eyelid sage and it did lift it right up.  Takes a while to get right, and I worry about making my issue worse somehow..but I am glad I bought and tried this.  When done right I could not see the tape.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying and using double eyelid tape and I think this works pretty well. I&#x27;ve been lazy and haven&#x27;t committed to it but the occasions I have used it it lasted a really long time. I had a little trouble with applying it but that might just be my clumsy fingers. Will probably purchase more once I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. One of my eye douesnt have double eyelid. So i just wear it for one eye. You literally can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there. I havent figure the science to putthing this on quickly though.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from my friend, and it works really well! I have a monolid and don&#x27;t have any fold at all, so I was looking for something pretty strong. I also wear makeup on the daily, so I definitely wanted something double sided. This particular tape is not to thin and not too thick, so I like it a lot. I have pretty oily skin, so I clean off my eyes with cleanser well before I put on the tape, but it does stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I have trouble using the green applicator, so I don&#x27;t use that. Instead I take the eyelid tape off the sheet with the white tape still intact first. Then I put in on my eyelid where it needs to go before peeling off the white tape. This helps me a lot to put it exactly where I want it. I mean everyone does it differently, this just works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this brand and size over anything else and I definitely will buy it in the future!</li>
    <li> I thought that this tape wouldn&#x27;t work very well but I was wrong! It&#x27;s perfect and it holds your double eyelid for the whole day! However, some of my friends said that they could see the tape which made me a little uncomfortable wearing it sometimes..</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t know how to use it because non of the directions were in English. I couldn&#x27;t even try eye charm magic slim</li>
    <li> Too hard to place properly. I got it right the first couple of times I used it, but not once since. I think you have to have very droopy eyes for this product to work.</li>
    <li> Very good. It lasts long and is very sticky. Will pyrchase again if I run out</li>
    <li> Works great but not very sticky after you wear a few hours it becomes more noticeable if you need it for a special occasion this is for you other wise if you would wear it daily you may want to add the glue as well</li>
    <li> A small gift for my friend who is gonna do a cool halloween make up! She just loved it :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews, the product arrived really fast and was easy to use...and it works! I was afraid the white backing might be difficult to peel off once the tape was stuck to my eyelid, but it wasn&#x27;t. Also the price is way less than the similar item offered on infomercial (probably less than the shipping alone for that item). I tried it the night it arrived in my mailbox and have slept in it for 2 days and it&#x27;s still holding my eyelids up. The best part is that I can actually see better now since my eyes are no longer so hooded. I think I&#x27;ll be using these every day! I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
    <li> I can buy a very similar product at daiso for 1.00. Bit I think the fork is better than average.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as promoted.</li>
    <li> I use eyelid tapes whenever my eyes get swollen and I wake up with one eyelid crease lower than normal. I think these are pretty easy to use, might take a while to get it exactly where you want it though. What I like to do is take a piece of tape off, without removing the white papers yet. Then I&#x27;ll place the sticky side where I want my crease to be, peel off the white papers and then make sure the tape is sticking to my skin as much as possible. I prefer using these at night when I sleep or if I&#x27;m not going outside that day since they can be a little noticeable. Thinner tapes like this are less noticeable if you&#x27;re worried about people noticing them when you&#x27;re outside: [[ASIN:B006KZBKR6 BN Clear Micro Fiber Eyelid Tape]]  However, the microfiber tapes may not hold as well and will be harder to use than these pre-cut tapes. The process to put microfiber tapes on is different.</li>
    <li> it is easy to use and the appearance is good, but it is a little expensive for such few pieces. The quality is good.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! I loved how it is a double sided tape which you can hide it between your skin to make that desired crease without it being visible. Shipping was fast too. Really impressed!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold up your eyelid at all. It actually just made me look like a had 2 creases</li>
    <li> extra strong hold..instant eye lift!</li>
    <li> It was hard to put on the tape even though I was very careful.</li>
    <li> this my first time using a product of it&#x27;s type and i hate it!! yes i do ..i&#x27;m racking my eyeball to get the sticky thing off and i was looking for more of a eyelid lift and the most it done is .... nothing but made my whole face sticky and itchy luck pal.</li>
    <li> Good for eye lift.  Adheres well and is not visible like the one sided adhesive tapes.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This was definitely worth buying! The tapes are very clear and they really are double sided. The stickiness was very strong, so at the end of the day, they were still on my eyelid. The tapes are a little difficult to take off, though. I suggest running water over your face and eyelids before you take the eyelid tape off.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was nice, like the picture, but a few of the eyelid tapes were misplaced on the sheets and some were damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product! This is actually very effective for someone who already has an eyelid crease and wants it higher or they want to change their crease.</li>
    <li> biggest waste of money ever, I was so disappointed in the product did not work at all like it said in the ad.</li>
    <li> I like this tape is double side is stick like a glue, is way better than other eyelid tape. Is last all day, would buy again.......</li>
    <li> It works for evening out uneven eyelids as well. The ends may peel away some, but overall the work. Moreover, I noticed a fixed crease after one using it for 3 nights.</li>
    <li> There are no reviews for this item so I thought I would give at least one review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase was smooth, good seller. However, the product lack in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, its suppose to be a double sided tape,but the other side is not sticky enough to tape your eye lids together, therefore it will really show up on your lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not last long, comparing to other ones I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, way more expensive than other ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> These DS tapes stay on ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT! I love these ds tapes. They take some practice to master the application, however once you get it right they stay put all day and all night. I am caucasian with one slightly dropping lid and I work 12-18 hrs a day. I apply the tape immediately after washing and drying my face so that there are NO oils/makeup on my lid. It does alter the look of the crease slightly however the improvement in the lids being level with one another makes up for that minor difference.&lt;br /&gt;Eye Shadow application is my only issue with these, if any shadow gets on the edge of the tape it makes the tape obvious. If anyone can tell me how to apply shadow with these tapes in place, please let me know</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t use yet, but looks good, just too little, not many, if u want to buy, u should buy more</li>
    <li> the shape i made with it was okay but it doesn&#x27;t stick as well. sometimes half of the tape would be sticking and the other half doesn&#x27;t. that was pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;the fork was pretty good though</li>
    <li> My fav double eyelid tape. Easy transaction. Product is just as described in picture and looks the same as the picture. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a big fat 1. Difficult to remove tape from backing without messing up the tape. Need to improve the removal process because you mess up more tape lifting it off backing than you get to use.</li>
    <li> So unnoticable! Unless you put it on one eye, and you look down, you look scary. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s pretty unnoticable if you put it on the right way (;</li>
    <li> Great product!! It works terrifically and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m half white and half asian, and this has lead to some interesting facial configurations. At age 9, my right eye started folding American-style(double fold), and my left eye, until the age of 21, remained Asian-style(single fold). About a year ago, I ordered some of these, and because I only needed them in my left eye, I continued usage for about 4 months straight. I even brought them with me to stay-overs at other people&#x27;s houses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result? My left eye finally caught up with the right eye and started folding double with my other eye. Now I don&#x27;t even need it anymore. I&#x27;m not claiming this will work with everyone, but I once read another review that made claims towards double-fold permanence, and I decided to try it because of that. Now, my left and right eyes are equal in that they both fold American-style. I personally like that look a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the cost of trying this for maybe even a year straight, compare to the cost of blepharoplasty. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up too much, but hey. Never know.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive for the amount and doesn&#x27;t stick to my eyelids that well. I feel like I wasted money.</li>
    <li> I just got my 3rd package.....I really love this product....leaves my eyes up and its the best. I have using other tapes but this work by far much better than any other because its not thick and leave natural look . I highly recommend this seller and its product.</li>
    <li> These were ok. Just that I had a hard time covering it up with makeup that it made it noticeable.</li>
    <li> i am looking forward the effect.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately got a droopy eyelid from botox. I used this product on only the droopy eye while I waited 4 months for my eye to return to normal. The product worked great. The strips raised the eyelid up so that my eyes looked even. No one even noticed.</li>
    <li> Tape stay on well! Very natural looking! Use water to take off tape with ease.</li>
    <li> awesome!  quick shipping</li>
