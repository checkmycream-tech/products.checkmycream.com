<li> but, be carful because I burn my self a few times</li>
<li> but they are so hard to put on and off.</li>
<li> NO MORE!</li>
<li> I think its insane how much people buy for curling irons..</li>

    <li> Daughters love this curling iron</li>
    <li> Excelent, my friends want aon same, but  it don´t see in the Amazon</li>
    <li> The box that it came in was slightly damaged but the curling tool itself was fine.  Not what I had expected so I gave to my daughter she likes it.</li>
    <li> I tried to use it 2x after i recieved my curling wand set. Both times about 5 minutes into curling my hair the wand said &amp;#34;err&amp;#34; then it would cool down and not work. I tried usung different sizes and turning it off to reset it but everytime it led to error. I only gave it one star because on the plus side it was very easy to return</li>
    <li> It seemed like my bathroom drawers were overflowing with different shapes, sizes, and brands of curling irons. NO MORE! My wife has discarded all of them and uses this baby exclusively now.</li>
    <li> VERY PLEASED. GOT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, USED iT ON MY WEAVE &amp; GOT SOME BEAUTIFUL SPIRAL CURLS! BOMB.COM GIRL! U 2 C AN GET YOUR SEXY BACK WITH THIS PRODUCT. &amp; 5 BARRELS IN 1 WHETHER U WANT THAT LOOSE BEACH WAVE OR THAT TINY SPIRAL CURL! WHAT MORE CAN U ASK FOR! :-)</li>
    <li> amazing.. and my hair become more thick with it&lt;br /&gt;so easy to use but, be carful because I burn my self a few times</li>
    <li> So worth the money. Gets really hot though so watch out!!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It&#x27;d perfect and I keep getting so many compliments on my curls</li>
    <li> I do love this product , I was planning on doing a video on it, it heats up VERY fast to the point where I burnt a flesh of my skin off . So be careful . The only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the curls don&#x27;t stay in for like 2 days .</li>
    <li> It works amazing! And I only have to use the first setting! It&#x27;s so easy to use with the little glove they include too. The only thing I would say is a little tricky is switching the wand tips; it&#x27;s a little tough to pinch, and you have to give it quite a few tugs. Definitely have to be careful with that. Other than that, it fits all my needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> Super. Supports 220V in Europe</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It does get very hot, and i like all the different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i dislike about it is that its very hard to change the barrels. Other than that the product works great and my curls&lt;br /&gt;stay all day long :)I would definitely recommend this to my girls!</li>
    <li> Had to send back. I think they accidently sent me a returned one. They did replace it with a new one, however, it is not staying hot. I have used this product in the past and it curls better than any other ones I have tried. Overall, I would recommend this product!!! Hopefully, I just received a lemon.</li>
    <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t stay curled long</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because it has the 6 interchangeable head but they are so hard to put on and off. But for the price I couldn&#x27;t resist. I think its insane how much people buy for curling irons..you really just need to have a technique and know how to use them.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re a lot cheaper than others with 5 different sizes and it works really good! my curls even stay in over night! and I love how you can change to the barrel size you want!</li>
    <li> I love these curlers, got them at a good price too! Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that the barrels are hard to change.</li>
    <li> I love this instead of buying multiple curling irons, jus buy one. Works awesome with my hair extensions I really recommend it</li>
    <li> Awesome purchase !!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it !!!</li>
