<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I would buy this again.  I initially got this product at Costco, but they only carry a four pack with two other scents that I do not like.  I was happy to be able to order through Amazon just this scent.  It lasts a long time, and it smells fresh not over powering at all.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. It is luxurious, makes you feel great and your skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for a product that had been discontinued.  This is good, but not as thick and rich as I was hoping.  I am not going to return it, but not sure if I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is great product and my family has been using this for few years and delivery was on time. Thanks</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how wonderful this lotion is. I eagerly wait every year for my husband to order it around my birthday. I was super excited to see the four pack for sure.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Have ordered it twice.</li>
    <li> I *really* like this bosy butter!  Nice, fresh fragrance.  It just smells soft and clean, which doesn&#x27;t clash with any perfumes I wear.  Richly moisturizing that absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife got this a while back and loves it.  So much so that she gives it as gifts to friends that we visit.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Soaks in and does a great job moisturizing. Great value.</li>
    <li> Light frangrance, keeps dry skin moist. Exactly what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and quickly absorbed. Pleasant scent. This is my favorite body butter/cream. I&#x27;ve tried other Delon body butters, but found their scents too overpowering or to much like food.  I especially dislike coconut scented products. The olive is perfect. the price was right.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite body butter ever.  It glides on smoothely and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so smooth.  I love it. would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different moisturizers, from Sephora to Aveeno to Bath and Body Works to other brands. But I am in total love with these body butter. My sister-in-law recently ordered the set of 15 and I quickly &amp;#34;stole&amp;#34; the olive one from her because the smell is nowhere as overpowering as the other Delon Body Butters. Hey, if you like the other strong smells then go for it, but the olive body butter has a nice smell that is not at all overpowering and it&#x27;s really smooth to the skin. Ever since I discovered this body butter I have been hooked. I do not buy any other brand except this. Using it for months and still in love. If you are new to the olive, I would suggest ordering 1 of them rather than 4 just in case you don&#x27;t like the smell but chances are you will like it, or rather love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product before. I loved it then and I love it now. I&#x27;ve been ordering it for about three years and probably will as long as it&#x27;s available. Originally, I bought the variety pack but keep coming back to the Olive Body Butter.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. Not only does it moisturize beautifully...the scent is very pleasant and not overpowering.  It&#x27;s nice to use after showering and is also great for the hands.</li>
    <li> Best Ever...LOVE this product!!  When I was introduced to it, the first thing I thought was &amp;#34;Do I really want to smell like an olive&amp;#34;?  The scent is incredible!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite body butter.  It&#x27;s rich and thick and really moisturizes. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of body butter - different brands and scents over the years - this one really is nice and the only one I repeatedly purchase.  The scent is subtle and pleasant -- thankfully it doesn&#x27;t smell like olive (I wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like an olive!).  I love that this comes in a 4 pack as well so I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The best body cream in the world. It makes your skin feel sooooooo smooth, and lasts. Best scents are olive and pomegranate.</li>
    <li> Love this body butter! It&#x27;s the best and the only thing I use. Love it, love it, love it! Used to get it at Costco during the Christmas holidays, but they haven&#x27;t carried this for a couple of years. Only place I&#x27;ve found  to get this is on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ran into a friend at Costco when she was buying a 4-pack of body butters and she asked if I&#x27;d like to have this because olive wasn&#x27;t her favorite.  I love this stuff--the smell is very subtle and it goes on the skin very easily with no greasiness whatsoever.  You can tell they use quality ingredients, not like those cheap (but nice-smelling) Bath &amp; Body Works products that must be reapplied over and over.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body butter.  Smells clean, great moisturizing that lasts a long time. It leaves a beautiful light glow on my skin!</li>
    <li> This is just the best!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this body butter from Amazon.  Originally found in big box store in a multi-fragrance gift pack, but love the olive scent the best.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Like this brand so much. It makes your skin smooth and moist. Smells good!</li>
    <li> love this product so creamy and smooth does wonders for the skin and not a strong perfumie smell</li>
    <li> Love this product.....The price is right and delivery is quick...Recommend to anyone who likes a nice body butter with a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> I use it exclusively to help aching tendonitis.  It does not work for muscle symptoms and it is well used for body butter effect as well.</li>
    <li> I received this Olive Butter as a gift several years ago and fell in love. So now I must always have some on hand. The texture and the moisturizing effects are delicious. I love the fragrance as well because it doesn&#x27;t have a floral scent. I like floral scents, but I prefer this one over any of the expensive brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your nice product,&lt;br /&gt;Sierragirl</li>
    <li> Very emollient ...great fragrance !</li>
    <li> love this body butter (Olive flavor).  I first came across this product in a gift bag given to me years ago and have been ordering online ever since.  Everyone that I give it to as a gift loves it also.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased the Delon body butters in a set at Costco.  She offered me some so I chose the olive.  I instantly fell in love with it.  When I ran out I thought that I would not be able to get my hands on any more because warehouse stores tend to have items sold in gift sets only for the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started an internet search and I saw that the product was offered on Amazon which made me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 4-pack.  It arrived earlier than promised.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Great price and lightly scented.  My favorite body butter so far.</li>
    <li> This is now my go to moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Even though I like this item I must say my skin still seemed dry.  It felt like it was not soaking into my skin but just laid on top of my skin.  I guess my skin is dryer than I though.  I will still use this item by perhaps mixing it with one of my other lotions.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter...I have been using it for 4 yrs and the smell is neutral which I love. Its very hydrating and works wonders on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent in every way.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter.  It smells nice and is very moisturizing.  I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I buy again I like the products thanks very much.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a specific smelling body butter and this wasnt it, thats the only reason i only gave it a one</li>
    <li> My friend from Canada introduced me to this body butter and I am forever hooked! It smells great, is non-greasy, and it very hydrating. I give these out as gifts- especially to my grandmothers or house guests. It is a well-priced quality item.</li>
    <li> Consider this; I&#x27;m a 68 year old man living in Colorado where one&#x27;s skin gets very dry.  I love this stuff!  Was introduced to the benefits of olive oil along time ago in Marseilles. Found this &#x27;butter&#x27; and use it daily on my face after shaving.  The coconut smells great but I want the olive oil.  Makes your face (and hands) feel soft all day without being gummy or sticky. Just ordered through Amazon for the first time; used to hunt for it at a &amp;#34;big box store&amp;#34; around Xmas.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two years and love it!</li>
    <li> The best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I give it as gifts.  Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> I usually love Delon body butter, I specifically like the &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; scent so I ordered this. When it arrived I was excited but when I opened it I could tell something is off. I do not recommend this item because it smelled awful for one, also the containers were all already opened, they weren&#x27;t individually sealed like they usually are and the sticker on the lid is faded in color compared to the original (which I have). I wish I could get a refund because this is clearly a rip-off.</li>
    <li> wonderful product found by accident while shopping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;repeat customer been using for years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it today , you will love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price; and it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Very happy with olive body butter. My wife and I use this and find it really keeps the skin moisturized in winter.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product....husband loves it on his feet.  Says his heels are so much softer now and his socks slide on so easily after applying it....not sticky at all.  I may just have to steal a jar from him!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, and use it daily! Because of the olive oil, it has a much longer lasting effect opposed to others that are merely water based. I have been using this for a long time, and notice that it keeps my skin looking younger. I have a dry scalp, and it helps sooth the itchiness. I also love the smell - it&#x27;s like aromatherapy! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother. She finds this product better on her delicate skin that many others she used before for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion, been using it for years. The olive smell is so sweet and subtle, and it the creamy lotion leaves such a nice sheen to the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this body butter.  Makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I gave several of my friends a jar and they love it.  The scent is not over powering like some body butters.</li>
    <li> The Delon body moisturizers are very good. It is worth every penny spent on it. I love all the fragrances</li>
    <li> Smooth as butter and luxurious feeling for a tiny price.  It was delivered quickly, as well.</li>
    <li> I love the olive butter</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Smells great &amp; penetrates into the skin extremely well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this Olive Body Butter as gifts and use it myself - goes on nice and smooth, smells good and I highly recommend it!</li>
