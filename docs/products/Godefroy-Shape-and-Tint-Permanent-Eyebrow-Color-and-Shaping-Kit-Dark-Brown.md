      <li>My brows were the perfect color even when I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The amount in each capsule is absolutely PERFECT for eyebrows.</li>

      <li>Great Product</li>
      <li>great to shape up your brows and to tint them...</li>

      <li>Might be good paired with dye removing wipes.</li>

      <li>Liked this product a lot.  </li>
      <li>but I love thier wax ITS AMAZING</li>
      <li>and I absolutely LOVE IT.</li>

      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this kit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product many times on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>

      <li>It stains very very quickly</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s EASY  </li>

      <li>and Im comfortable using my brow brush)  </li>
      <li>Godefroy Shape and Tint, Light Brown, 3 Count]]</li>
      <li>just how quick and easy dying your brows was   </li>
      <li>Very easy to use really makes a difference.  </li>
      <li>I had to call my daughter right away 24 hours later to tell her how great they looked.</li>
      <li>This item was pretty easy to use</li>
      <li>really liked the effect but only lasted 5 days for me...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the flimsy plastic mixing &amp;#34;bowl,&amp;#34; so I use a tiny glass bowl of my own.  </li>
      <li>and I really liked this one because it was easy to use, hard to mess up your eyebrows, a nice color, and inexpensive!</li>
      <li>The first day I used it, it looked like I had tattooed my eyebrows</li>
      <li>The shaping portion of this kit was OK for the larger areas around the eyes but the tweezer gets the rest.</li>
      <li>Be aware though:</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better for blonde brows.</li>
      <li>I just got this product several days ago and it is really cool!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use the wax this time ,also I think you really don&#x27;t need the whole capsel  </li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>And the hair removal stickers really worked.</li>
      <li>I really like this eyebrow tint.  </li>
      <li>The capsules last for months (you don&#x27;t even need a full capsule per application)</li>
      <li>I was even able to split it in half and get two uses out of each capsule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions closely, it looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>This dye was easy to mix and apply, but required a LOT longer processing time to get a color that was not olive green.</li>
      <li>There is no taking it off early for a lighter brown with this kit.</li>
      <li>just a really light messy shadow.</li>
      <li>it disappeared  completely.</li>
      <li>I have very light blonde (and sparse) eyebrows to the point I usually look like I don&#x27;t have any.</li>
      <li>it looks natural and so far has stayed on for over 2 weeks, but is starting to fade at this point.</li>
      <li>It actually looks like I have eyebrows (natural looking vs colored/penciled in)  </li>

<li> It actually looks like I have eyebrows (natural looking vs colored/penciled in)  </li>
<li> The color is too dark and doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
<li> But I told I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere on the box as to how long the color should last.</li>
<li> i bought dark brown and it barely stained my eyebrow area.</li>
<li> I have BLOND almost invisible brows and have been dyeing them myself for a long time.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time too, and even when your brows start to grow out, if you use make up it can still work, so I just reapply whenever I am feeling like it.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t leave on for to long</li>
<li> I will buy more unless I can find a less expensive brand somewhere.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t think it was quite dark enough</li>
<li> The first time, I got it a little heavy on the skin, a little too far above my natural brow, so if you looked closely it was obviously fake.  </li>
<li> I have tried both dark brown and black and I only notice a little difference, so yes the dark brown is pretty dark.</li>
<li> Next time I will try to use half  </li>
<li> I would recommend using a makeup brush or maybe even a q-tip but not the little wooden stick they provide to use it with.</li>
<li> Or just be careful.</li>
<li> not sure how it would last 6 weeks</li>
<li> Also, I found that using a small makeup brush (for eyeliner) was easier for me than using the included stick applicator; but, that is a personal preference.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of other products for eye tinting before</li>
<li> I was weary about using dye for fear it would be hard to control, but the dye is a paste - making application quite simple.</li>
<li> so I took the dark brown</li>
<li> I am Hispanic and have dark eyebrows</li>
<li> Once you get to the dark brown, almost black color</li>
<li> I dye my hair black</li>
<li> the jet black one</li>
<li> It stains a little</li>
<li> but I think I went a little over board with the dye.  </li>
<li> My eyebrows and the skin around then was tinted very dark til I scrubbed them a few times.  </li>
<li> I had tried a few products before purchasing this item...</li>
<li> ...shaped my brows, like how I would color them in everyday  </li>
<li> I use makeup EVERYDAY to shape and color them in....</li>
<li> /&gt;However, they were missing from the box</li>
<li> this was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little expensive for only 3 applications.  </li>
<li> I usually leave it on longer than the recommended time, since if I don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick.</li>
<li> This will leave a tint behind the hairs so you have to be very careful with how you apply it.</li>
<li> I used my eyebrow brush to fill and shape my brows with the colored creme (I think it would be hard to use the stick they provide?</li>
<li> She looked it up online and thought it was at least month, six weeks?</li>
<li> I found you will have to leave it on for about 8-10 mins for it to cover thick gray hairs completley</li>
<li> tough to find balance</li>
<li> Therefore, I have thin eyebrows.  </li>
<li> and im sorry</li>
<li> I was skeptical when ordering this product and it sat in my bathroom for 2 weeks after I got it</li>
<li> i was very sad and disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s almost impossible to do that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product many times on Amazon.  It does the job and is simple to mix and apply.  I don&#x27;t care for the flimsy plastic mixing &amp;#34;bowl,&amp;#34; so I use a tiny glass bowl of my own.  Be sure to follow directions, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. It had no effect whatsoever on my brown eyebrows. Maybe it&#x27;s better for blonde brows. I was trying to darken mine so I don&#x27;t need a pencil. The shaping portion of this kit was OK for the larger areas around the eyes but the tweezer gets the rest. I&#x27;ll save my money next time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when ordering this product and it sat in my bathroom for 2 weeks after I got it (I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed).  I didn&#x27;t even realize people went and got their eybrows dyed (makes sense though!) I am Hispanic and have dark eyebrows BUT I have OVER PLUCKED them and the hair just doesnt grow back.  Therefore, I have thin eyebrows.  I use makeup EVERYDAY to shape and color them in....ohhhhhh.  What I did:  I used a fourth of the capsule (powdered dye) and an equal amount of developer.  I used my eyebrow brush to fill and shape my brows with the colored creme (I think it would be hard to use the stick they provide? Didn&#x27;t want to try it and Im comfortable using my brow brush)  I got the color on my skin...shaped my brows, like how I would color them in everyday  Waited about 5 mins, used a wash cloth to wash off  Didn&#x27;t think it was quite dark enough so I re-applied what I had already mixed (again on my skin)  Waited about 2 mins and washed off  I really, really liked the results.  It actually looks like I have eyebrows (natural looking vs colored/penciled in)  Its been 2 days and I grin everytime I pass a mirror knowing I put no effort forth in coloring them in for the day  Would I recommend it...yes.</li>
    <li> This dye was easy to mix and apply, but required a LOT longer processing time to get a color that was not olive green. There is no taking it off early for a lighter brown with this kit. I have BLOND almost invisible brows and have been dyeing them myself for a long time. Once you get to the dark brown, almost black color it looks natural and so far has stayed on for over 2 weeks, but is starting to fade at this point.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this product years ago  I would have save between $30-$50 per month  I just realized a couple of months ago just how quick and easy dying your brows was   It took the salon/spa about 5 mins max  I have been having my eyebrows waxed and tinted for years  I decided to try this product &amp; voila , it&#x27;s EASY  Really easy   I didn&#x27;t use the wax this time ,also I think you really don&#x27;t need the whole capsel  Next time I will try to use half  Don&#x27;t leave on for to long the longer you leave it the darker the colour  Great Product I will be back for another box</li>
    <li> Liked this product a lot.  I would prefer that you could buy the shaping and tinting seperatly since I didn&#x27;t want the shaping product.  The tint itself was great.  Doesn&#x27;t last but a couple of weeks but does make brows darker for that couple of weeks.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> really liked the effect but only lasted 5 days for me...not sure how it would last 6 weeks but i only left it on my brows for one min each.  maybe if i left it on longer?  but then i didn&#x27;t want it any darker.  tough to find balance</li>
    <li> I had tried a few products before purchasing this item...and im sorry I waited so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount in each capsule is absolutely PERFECT for eyebrows. I was even able to split it in half and get two uses out of each capsule!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dye my brows once every 45 days or so and you get 3 capsules in this order. I get over 6 months of use out of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I just got this product several days ago and it is really cool! It made my eyebrows darker and I have very fair and barely any color eyebrows. This will leave a tint behind the hairs so you have to be very careful with how you apply it. I would recommend using a makeup brush or maybe even a q-tip but not the little wooden stick they provide to use it with. It stains very very quickly so if you don&#x27;t get it off on time (assuming you made a mistake) you will get stuck with it for a couple days. The instructions do say not to apply it to the skin only the hair but it&#x27;s almost impossible to do that. The first day I used it, it looked like I had tattooed my eyebrows but then after that my eyebrows looked great!</li>
    <li> didnt like the color but LOVE the wax . I know this from a girl on youtube she is having the jet black one n recommended it . I have brown redish hair so I took the dark brown but It doesnt work for me . but I love thier wax ITS AMAZING</li>
    <li> I really like this eyebrow tint.  It&#x27;s a little expensive for only 3 applications.  It tints the eyebrows and also the skin, which I like.  If you&#x27;re careful, you can make it look like your eyebrows are naturally colored.  The first time, I got it a little heavy on the skin, a little too far above my natural brow, so if you looked closely it was obviously fake.  If you follow the directions closely, it looks very natural.  I will buy more unless I can find a less expensive brand somewhere.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use really makes a difference.  Would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend the $$ to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> This item was pretty easy to use but I think I went a little over board with the dye.  My eyebrows and the skin around then was tinted very dark til I scrubbed them a few times.  Over all I am happy with the end product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Went overboard, totally dyed my eyebrow skin so I looked like I had enormous Russian eyebrows, but that&#x27;s user error lol. Might be good paired with dye removing wipes. Or just be careful.</li>
    <li> this was a waste of my money. i bought dark brown and it barely stained my eyebrow area. i did it again as suggested on the instructions and my skin began to burn but it did not get darker. just a really light messy shadow. i washed my face then wiped it out with alcohol. it disappeared  completely.</li>
    <li> Good coverage....great to shape up your brows and to tint them...helped cover some spots that were not full...will buy more</li>
    <li> I have very light blonde (and sparse) eyebrows to the point I usually look like I don&#x27;t have any. I dye my hair black so it looks kind of off when I don&#x27;t cut my bangs perfectly over them to hide them. I decided to give this a try and I absolutely LOVE IT. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better. I have tried both dark brown and black and I only notice a little difference, so yes the dark brown is pretty dark. I usually leave it on longer than the recommended time, since if I don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t seem to stick. It stains a little but it doesn&#x27;t really show or matter if you shape the dye on perfectly. I still have to use makeup on my brows to fill them in but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this kit. It lasts a long time too, and even when your brows start to grow out, if you use make up it can still work, so I just reapply whenever I am feeling like it. It&#x27;s definitely a permanent thing I need to have on hand all the time and I would recommend this to anybody who wanted to change up their eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I brought this product after seeing it on Youtube tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was motivated even more since it included  12 popular brow designs for your perfect brow shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they were missing from the box i was very sad and disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy it again or recommend it to anyone. [[ASIN:B002QM3PJS Godefroy Shape and Tint, Light Brown, 3 Count]]</li>
    <li> I buy Godefroy twice a year for eyebrow tinting. The capsules last a loong time and so does the tint. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I found you will have to leave it on for about 8-10 mins for it to cover thick gray hairs completley</li>
    <li> I wanted to darken my eyebrows to highlight my eyes. This product works very well. I was weary about using dye for fear it would be hard to control, but the dye is a paste - making application quite simple. Be aware though: this dyes whatever it touches. So, make sure to put vaseline, tape, eucerin cream, etc. on the areas of your skin you don&#x27;t want dyed. Also, I found that using a small makeup brush (for eyeliner) was easier for me than using the included stick applicator; but, that is a personal preference. The capsules last for months (you don&#x27;t even need a full capsule per application) so the cost is negligible.  It also comes with eyebrow waxing strips; but, I did not use those.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of other products for eye tinting before and I really liked this one because it was easy to use, hard to mess up your eyebrows, a nice color, and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this product, I felt like clown after using this. The color is too dark and doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic when I tried this product. My brows were the perfect color even when I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup. And the hair removal stickers really worked. I had to call my daughter right away 24 hours later to tell her how great they looked. But I told I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere on the box as to how long the color should last. She looked it up online and thought it was at least month, six weeks? Well, to my dismay the color lasted 11 days. I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
