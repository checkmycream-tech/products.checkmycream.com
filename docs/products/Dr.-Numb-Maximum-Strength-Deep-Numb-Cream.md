      <li>I wad able to epilate my bikini area with no prob!!</li>
      <li>It was simply amazing!</li>
      <li>The best thing to do with this product to make it work even better is apply to skin and then cover the area with plastic wrap, wait 40 minutes and then peel off the plastic wrap.  </li>
      <li>Very happy that it can now be pain free!</li>
      <li>this item is good, just tested it on my leg and it was absolutely great</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I did not feel a thing for about the first hour, it was awesome!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff it truly amazing.</li>
      <li>Thrilled with the results</li>

      <li>anyway i&#x27;ll be using it for derma-rolling nice product.</li>
      <li>Numbs well, fast shipping, great experience!</li>
      <li>I orders this product In June and it worked liked a charm.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, awesome customer service.</li>
      <li>I very rarely write reviews on anything, even when they are great.</li>
      <li>Rib tattoo, it worked great for the first 45 min to an hour, but as the artist wipes before and as they are doing the work , it wipes it off and therefore stops being effective.</li>
      <li>That very important detail is not on the box or the tube.</li>
      <li>I was even able to feel when I pinched my navel myself when I was testing it before the procedure.  </li>
      <li>Two tattoos done with it and for the most part I dont feel a thing.</li>
      <li>Better peace-of-mind</li>
      <li>and i doubt it could be used more than twice.</li>
      <li>It was a great purchase, the shipping was fast, and the product was just as described.  </li>
      <li>okay...</li>
      <li>the numbing sprays at the drug stores are way better.</li>
      <li>Cheap price but not an effective product</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>okay when I was getting my tattoo.</li>
      <li>I will for sure be buying this many more</li>
      <li>Oh well no pain no gain:)</li>
      <li>It makes the needle a lot more bearable.</li>
      <li>but you should plan ahead if your using it for anything with needles :) :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed both results</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>It did okay, but didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>all:-)</li>
      <li>I was in more pain then</li>
      <li>Plenty of people love it</li>
      <li>Had it worked better, I&#x27;d have been satisfied.</li>
      <li>but it works and its a lot more affordable than 80 bucks for a vial of lidocaine.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it, but I&#x27;m glad that I tried it.</li>
      <li>worked for me yesterday with my latest tattoo piece on my ribs.</li>
      <li>I was able to get my side done</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I was impressed good for small tattoos</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>but it is not as strong as we thought it would be, its ok.</li>
      <li>it works better - this was the precise truth.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>Hoping to find a bigger bottle/tube that is more effective and cost effective than this.</li>
      <li>The first application went smoothly and I wasn&#x27;t able to feel anything.</li>
      <li>Did not numb as strong as I was hoping.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good for a small heart tattoo or something, lol, but not waxing large areas.</li>
      <li>nothing special.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for true numbing strength cream, I would look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>If the procedure was more intense, I think I would have felt it.</li>
      <li>You have to remember to use it and wait two FULL hours for it to take effect.</li>
      <li>I then decided to get a very large rib piece and OMG!</li>
      <li>Order arrived rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>Please note:  the numbness wears off pretty quickly but it works!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very large tattoo that goes on the whole top of my foot, around my ankle and up my leg.  </li>
      <li>For the first 5-10 minutes of my session I was quite comfortable.</li>
      <li>When I first got this for my Derma-Roller, I was excited.</li>
      <li>and it never numb the area even after 1 hour.</li>
      <li>By the second hour it completely wears off but nonetheless it&#x27;s still great.</li>
      <li>It does NOT numb at  al for ANY length of time.</li>
      <li>I applied it on my navel as directed before getting it pierced &amp; it did not numb my navel at all.</li>
      <li>Dermarolling goes pretty quick so numbness did not wear off.  </li>
      <li>Using this on my upper inner arm for my sleeve... loving the numbing properties... thinking of trying next with my aching joints, lol</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find Bacitracin with 4% lidocaine recently, but it is far better at pain relief.</li>
      <li>It is upsetting that i paid for this in the first place, this product does not numb anything it is used for.</li>
      <li>I still felt the procedure not not very painfully.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, it hasn&#x27;t worked since the first time</li>
      <li>This is.the first review I ever wrote</li>
      <li>I have ordered 3 more tubes for my next 3 appointments.</li>
      <li>My artist was already working when I asked if he was ready to start!  </li>
      <li>I took it off prior to walking into the shop because I didn&#x27;t want the tattooist to think I&#x27;m weak, but while he was tattooing he asked if I was ok, I just smiled and said Oh yes:)</li>
      <li>It seemed to last for only a couple of hours, but it worked and I consider it a good product.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty large tattoo on my chest that I&#x27;ve been working on removing with laser for quite a while</li>
      <li>Worked very well for my laser hair removal procedure on my scalp.</li>
      <li>After that I am quite sure that is was a million times harder to get though the rest of my session then using no numbing agents.</li>
      <li>but it wheres off  fairly fast.</li>
      <li>I applied the whole tube of cream and it did nothing.</li>
      <li>I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting this stuff to work, thinking it was some cheap scam.</li>
      <li>knowing it&#x27;s straight from the source, and not from China like these cheaper places get them from</li>
      <li>I really thought I was wasting my money</li>
      <li>so can&#x27;t complain that much it worked for an 1 1/2 hours</li>
      <li>Guess you really get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hated it does. Not work like it says it does I dont recimind anyone to buy it It&#x27;s junk</li>
    <li> I used it for micro-needling, it was enough for 1 use. It worked well my face stayed numb till i was done.I wish the tube was bigger.</li>
    <li> I really thought I was wasting my money but I waste more money on junk food so I figure I try this out I got a tattoo on my ribs and couldn&#x27;t finish cuz of the pain I tried this stuff and it&#x27;s a god sent from the tattoo gods I was able to get my side done w no problems only thing is I put it on too soon so it started to wear off so if u put it on 45 min before ur golden I will be purchasing again to finish my other side</li>
    <li> Slathered it on thick, wrapped in saran wrap, waited 45 minutes, nothing is numb... felt every zap of the laser.</li>
    <li> Dr. Numb is sub-par...nothing special. Works okay but not great. I would not recommend it, but I&#x27;m glad that I tried it.</li>
    <li> She didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  I had used it before to get a tattoo.  I recommend it highly although I wish it came in a bigger tube.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried on the product yet but the size on the product detail states 8oz when in reality it is actually just a super tiny tube of 10g which is approximately 0.3oz NOT 8oz. This was very misleading and I paid $8.50 when the current price is now $6.00 so I am not happy about that either.</li>
    <li> It was a great purchase, the shipping was fast, and the product was just as described.  I will rate it four stars!</li>
    <li> It does the job of numbing quite well. I use this prior to my laser hair removal sessions and find that in order to be effective, it has to be slathered on for at least 2 hours prior. I don&#x27;t feel a thing with this on, I used to find laser treatments unbearable without the numbing gel. Laser technicians have warned me against using non-prescription numbing creams, hence the 1 star removed. The tube is fairly tiny and you would need a few for more skin coverage.</li>
    <li> Cheap price but not an effective product you will still feel all pain if using this to gt thru a tattoo session</li>
    <li> If you apply it about 2 hours before procedures such as tattoos and piercing and wrap with seran wrap. I didn&#x27;t feel anything for about an hour during a tattoo. It goes away after about an hour</li>
    <li> I love this product for adding with my other numbing products when I am doing permanent make-up on brows and lips.. it adds a boost to numb faster.</li>
    <li> The way I used this was rub some in, then coat area to get tattooed and DO NOT RUB IN, cover with saran wrap and tape edges a couple of hours before the work is to be done. Rib tattoo, it worked great for the first 45 min to an hour, but as the artist wipes before and as they are doing the work , it wipes it off and therefore stops being effective. I did not feel a thing for about the first hour, it was awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would numb a little better as I was using it for microderming.  It did okay, but didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  If you are looking for true numbing strength cream, I would look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> this item is good, just tested it on my leg and it was absolutely great anyway i&#x27;ll be using it for derma-rolling nice product.</li>
    <li> was reccomended it by a colleague.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it, and will buy it again. Suggest any Pro tattoo artist keep a few tubes on hand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t numb me at all. I heard that your supposed to use half a tube. I&#x27;m not sure about this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that it would ease the pain of my next tattoo.. well.. not only did it ease the pain, it made it disappear!! This stuff it truly amazing. I applied Deep numb 2 hours prior to my appointment. I wrapped my arm in plastic wrap after applying a thick layer of the product. Before I went into the tattoo shop I cut off the plastic and wiped it off. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing!! I was so shocked. The only time I felt pain was when the needle hit a spot that I didn&#x27;t put the cream on. I took it off prior to walking into the shop because I didn&#x27;t want the tattooist to think I&#x27;m weak, but while he was tattooing he asked if I was ok, I just smiled and said Oh yes:) Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I aint a wimp. I would sit through the pain regardless, but why hurt if you don&#x27;t have to? I will for sure be buying this many more times.&lt;br /&gt;Ps: the tats I got are on my arm near my wrists. One says &amp;#34;make it count&amp;#34; the other says &amp;#34;never let go&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I will be getting this again. tried other stuff and it did not last after 10 minutes. this stuff lasted for about an hour or so.. numb most spots and took the edge off for other spots. Highly recommend this. I love it.</li>
    <li> The Deep Numb numbing cream works ok but it is not as strong as we thought it would be, its ok.</li>
    <li> Order arrived rather quickly.  Applied product 45min-1hour prior to my appointment.  It seemed to last for only a couple of hours, but it worked and I consider it a good product.</li>
    <li> It is upsetting that i paid for this in the first place, this product does not numb anything it is used for. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t numb near as well as Bacitracin with pain relief (4% lidocaine).  Haven&#x27;t been able to find Bacitracin with 4% lidocaine recently, but it is far better at pain relief.</li>
    <li> I left it on for about half an hour and it worked great. It comes in a little tube but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all. I hadn&#x27;t realized how small the tube actually was. It&#x27;s only for about one or two uses. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a low pain tolerance. I have 12 tattoos and several piercings. The product just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Numbs well, fast shipping, great experience! We are using it to numb my daughter for site changes with an insulin pump. Very happy that it can now be pain free!</li>
    <li> My sister and I got this (we went and got matching tattoos on our feet.) and she had it on for like an hour, I put mine on while she was getting tattooed and believe me we felt everything! If your getting this for a tattoo, don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is not worth buying because if there is any of the claimed active ingredient in it, it is an infinitesimal amount. Go ahead and buy this product if you want a product that does not do what it is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve used other dr numb products and that works well for me. This was a waste of money</li>
    <li> This cream did not work for me at all. I applied it on my navel as directed before getting it pierced &amp; it did not numb my navel at all. I felt everything. I was even able to feel when I pinched my navel myself when I was testing it before the procedure.  I applied the whole tube of cream and it did nothing.</li>
    <li> OK but not much different from other brands. It does have a local numbing affect and can stop an itch.</li>
    <li> Deep Numb works great!!  I bought it in preparation for getting a new tattoo.  The tricks to maximizing its effectiveness are properly gaging the size of the tattoo so that you can cover an area large enough for the whole tattoo, and also making sure that you leave the cream on the area for a while.  Although the directions suggest 45 minutes, I left it on for 1-1/2 hours, covered it with Saran wrap, and refreshed it as needed so that it didn&#x27;t dry out.  The only sting I felt during the procedure was on areas where I had underestimated the size of the tattoo.</li>
    <li> This is.the first review I ever wrote but I have to say this product works wonders!! I have a few tattoos that I got with no creams, medicines ect..(wrist, stomach, lower and upper back, and inner ankle) but I was terrified to get my foot so I tried Dr numb left in on for 3-4 hours wrapped in plastic wrap and didn&#x27;t feel a thing! Im doing it for my other foot today!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I let it for the required time and I still felt pain once I started.</li>
    <li> Wow, such a high price for such a small amount. I only got one use out of it for an underarm wax and a bikini wax. It worked for the underarms pretty well, but I only knew to put it on about 30 minutes prior because I had to Google search everywhere for it. That very important detail is not on the box or the tube. Hoping to find a bigger bottle/tube that is more effective and cost effective than this. Maybe it&#x27;s good for a small heart tattoo or something, lol, but not waxing large areas.</li>
    <li> Works as I hoped it would.  I used it to assist with a painful tattoo on my foot.  It&#x27;s a very large tattoo that goes on the whole top of my foot, around my ankle and up my leg.  My pain tolerance is low due to med. issues.  I put this cream on very thick, wrapped it, and left it on two hours before I did my tattoo.  Yay!  No pain!</li>
    <li> I am 10 hours into a shoulder / back piece. I ordered this product based on the reviews and took the advice from those who found the products helpful. I was suppose to be finishing the last 3 hours yesterday. I have to admit the cream caused a burning sensation after 30 minutes of applying it, but I didn&#x27;t have any other reactions. For the first 5-10 minutes of my session I was quite comfortable. After that I am quite sure that is was a million times harder to get though the rest of my session then using no numbing agents. I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the session which is not what I expected considering I already made it through the outline and grey shading in the same area. I think I had too much confidence in this product and when it failed to work I was in more pain then if I would have just let me body do what it normally does in response to pain and let me endorphin&#x27;s kick in. I would not absolutely recommend this product for tattooing. I will go back in 3 weeks to finish this masterpiece but I will not be foolish enough to think that I am going to do so &amp;#34;pain free&amp;#34;. If you can&#x27;t handle the pain of tattooing....don&#x27;t get one!</li>
    <li> this product does not numb the skin especially for a tattoo...would not recommend to anyone getting a tattoo in a painful spot needing a crutch to deal with the constant uncomfy pain of ink work....do not buy...</li>
    <li> Bad product!!!! Didn&#x27;t cause any numbing on skin at all! Zero numbing! I used it on my skin before a treatment and felt the same as if nothing was used. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> wanted to use this for my tria laser hair removal, and for one the tube is sooo tiny! then you have to wait 45 mins? and its not supposed to dry?? way to much trouble for mediocre results. the numbing sprays at the drug stores are way better.</li>
    <li> I used the product on my face and it worked okay...I waited about 40 minutes before I performed the needling...I did not find a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin after using the numbing cream than when I needled without it.  I also received Deep Numb rather than Dr. Numb that was a bummer.  Perhaps Dr. Numb is more effective--I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> The numbing cream worked better than I had expected. I didn&#x27;t feel anything. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast unfortunatly didn&#x27;t work for me,put on as directed waited a hour still nothing. Oh well no pain no gain:)</li>
    <li> This only numbs it a little...I went to get a surface piercing and I felt all of it. This is the worst product ever...the tube is so small....u get what u paid for</li>
    <li> When I first got this for my Derma-Roller, I was excited. The first application went smoothly and I wasn&#x27;t able to feel anything. You have to remember to use it and wait two FULL hours for it to take effect. Otherwise, you&#x27;re stuck with feeling parts of your face. That being said, the other three times that I&#x27;ve used this product didn&#x27;t go like the first. Is it possible for our body to build immunity to the numbing agent? Anyways, it hasn&#x27;t worked since the first time but I will try to use it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought Dr Numb and it does not work very good and it doesn&#x27;t live up to its name.  It says to apply n wait at least 45 mins but it doesn&#x27;t go the job</li>
    <li> *** REVIEW FOR DR NUMB NOT DEEP NUMB ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked for me yesterday with my latest tattoo piece on my ribs. It only lasted about an hour because we were lagging on getting started, so next time I will tell my artist to get started ASAP, and I&#x27;m sure it will last closer to 2 hours. I was REALLY skeptical of this product thinking all the positive reviews I read online are people affiliated so I was really surprised and trippen out when I couldn&#x27;t feel pain, it was actually kind of weird. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t order from cheaper places like here or eBay, I ordered straight from Dr Numb for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- They have a money-back guarantee&lt;br /&gt;- Better peace-of-mind knowing it&#x27;s straight from the source, and not from China like these cheaper places get them from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I applied:&lt;br /&gt;- Applied two hours before appointment time and saran wrapped&lt;br /&gt;- Applied second time an hour before appointment time and saran wrapped, removing saran wrap before getting in the tattoo chair/table&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It works, for me at least, and I will continue to use... but will probably only order from their site directly.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but really,  this cream works!! you start feeling the needle after an hour and a half..  By the second hour it completely wears off but nonetheless it&#x27;s still great. Made the last 30 mins of  my tattoo bearable. highly recommended. I will definitely be buying more once I figure out what to get next..</li>
    <li> It says Dr. Numb, but I got Deep Numb instead. So it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted and it worked okay when I was getting my tattoo.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write reviews on anything, even when they are great. However, I couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to tell my story on this one. I had 7 tattoos, one being an entire chest piece that took 3 hours, each done with no creams/medicine/etc. I then decided to get a very large rib piece and OMG! I never expected the intense and excruciating pain that came with this tattoo. After 2 hours, I had maybe a quarter of the outline done, and that was all I could handle. It was torture. I honestly thought I would be stuck with an incomplete tattoo on my side. But I decided to try one more time with the dr numb cream (it was suggested to me by a friend who swore by it) and see if I could at least bare it long enough to finish the outline. Well, to my extreme surprise, after putting it on thick, wrapping with press &amp; seal and leaving it on for about an hour, there was NO PAIN, ZERO, ZILCH, NADA!!!!! I literally could not feel a single thing at all while getting the tattoo!!!!!!! It was simply amazing! It only lasts about an hour, but it is WELL WORTH every penny and every second of no pain!</li>
    <li> Works like its supposed to. Numbs the skin enough to do the derma rolling. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin even on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a bikini waxing session but didn&#x27;t really feel much difference from the regular waxing experience. It&#x27;s a very small tube too, so maybe it wasn&#x27;t enough for the area I needed covered....</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t for me. Plenty of people love it but, it barely helped the pain. I left it on for two hours, sealed with plastic wrap. Had it worked better, I&#x27;d have been satisfied.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on my Mom and my skin after she complained to feel pain.&lt;br /&gt;This product did NOT work, I felt the sting when I applied the compound freezer on my warts.</li>
    <li> I orders this product In June and it worked liked a charm. Fast delivery, awesome customer service. Iam now ordering 2 more Deep Numb. They work great just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for my laser hair removal procedure on my scalp. I have ordered 3 more tubes for my next 3 appointments.</li>
    <li> I will be using this when I go to get my tattoos. It makes the needle a lot more bearable.</li>
    <li> Perfect for laser hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;does not stain .......&lt;br /&gt;works fast&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was a much bigger size. But!!</li>
    <li> Deep Numb works amazingly! I put it on two hours before my Brazilian Wax and barely felt anything. I would recommend this product. Take two pain relievers ( I took aleve) and lather yourself up.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! I waited and waited for it to numb my skin and it never did!!!! Hated it!!! bad</li>
    <li> Using this on my upper inner arm for my sleeve... loving the numbing properties... thinking of trying next with my aching joints, lol</li>
    <li> Even though the tube is small it works fantastic!  I have a NO!NO! laser hair remover(old version) and is very sensitive to the prickling feeling it gives when being lasered.  I can tolerate epilation but not lasering so I needed something that will numb my skin because ice wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I won four tubes off of a website and was a bit upset because I wasted a tube and a half because the instructions were wrong!  After finding the right instructions: apply a thin layer first, then proceed with a thicker layer and cover with a cloth or saran wrap for an hour to keep cream from drying, then do tatooing or laser removing 45 minutes after the numbing cream takes effect.  Once this is achieved it will work!  The downside is if you&#x27;re going to laser your skin instead of getting a tatoo you&#x27;re going to need a lot of cream!  It will also keep your skin numb well over 8 hours!!!</li>
    <li> we found that this stuff works a little for about 10 minutes when used for tattooing ...not at all what we thought</li>
    <li> Used this for a tattoo, never saw the first signs of the area starting to numb. I did not get the results expected, nor any at all.</li>
    <li> This product does what it said I still felt a little but it was not as bad as when I didn&#x27;t have any on me so it helped.</li>
    <li> i have to say that deep numb works really well and fast and would recommend it to anyone who needs to numb a spot to have tattooed or peirced etc.</li>
    <li> This tubing is really small and i doubt it could be used more than twice. Ive used Dr. Numb before for tattooing but it was the red tube and that worked so well for me until it was time for the shading portion which means the tattoo was nearly finished anyway. I bought this blue container of dr. Numb to use with a derma roller and after keeping this cream on for about 50 mins covered with plastic. It only felt a little numb for about 3 mins max then the numbness wore off. I will not be purchasing this product again but instead i will stick to the red container of Dr. Numb because it lasted me thru an entire tattoo 3 times. Yes this tubing is cheaper but i&#x27;ve learned my lesson now. guess u get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> This deep numb is awesome stuff for like if you have a cut finger or need to do stitches with now with that said the only downfall is that you have to wait almost 2 hours if you want a deep numb to do stitches but it works and its a lot more affordable than 80 bucks for a vial of lidocaine. but great stuff , I give it a 5 i guess lol</li>
    <li> Bought this to use when I get my tatto, but got into ants and tried it , boy does it every work!</li>
    <li> This is a total scam don&#x27;t waste your money. I used it for a tattoo a small one at that just to see how it worked. It does NOT numb at  al for ANY length of time.</li>
    <li> works great but it wheres off  fairly fast. i would recommend it if it wasn&#x27;t priced so high for such a small tube</li>
    <li> I have gotten a lot of tattoos in the pass 6 mos and think its because of the cream thank you deep numb.</li>
    <li> No need for a long review so to sum it all up I LOVE THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT! Thats all:-)</li>
    <li> I mean I had my doubts about but as soon as I used it, it worked!! Wrapped it with saran wrap and left it on for 2 hrs. I knew it worked because I couldn&#x27;t feel a thing when I had to wipe off the excess. I wad able to epilate my bikini area with no prob!!</li>
    <li> thats how long it was saran wrapped on my nipples still hurt not nearly as bad tho as the first time</li>
    <li> Use: Brazilian wax numbing. Wow! The previous review is legit. This product really works. I do self Brazilian wax. I put a thick layer and saran wrap for 45mins, re-apply a bit more and wait 10mins (because the wax wasn&#x27;t ready yet). I wouldn&#x27;t say it is completely painless, but definitely 80% less pain. I am looking forward to use it again on my next Brazilian wax.</li>
    <li> I tried Deep Numb for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, which is like I took a cheese grater to my feet and then I poured alcohol on them. CONSTANTLY!! This pain took me out of my life for over a year. But...When I found your wonderful product, Deep Numb, I am able to deal with my daily pain so much easier. I can&#x27;t thank you enough for your product!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Kat</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use for muscle aches and sore feet and calves the other was for tattoo use I enjoyed both results Thanks</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream because I micro-needle my face and Wow!  It works GREAT!  The best thing to do with this product to make it work even better is apply to skin and then cover the area with plastic wrap, wait 40 minutes and then peel off the plastic wrap.  The area you applied the Dr. Deep Numb cream will be numb and you won&#x27;t feel a thing.  Please note:  the numbness wears off pretty quickly but it works!  Boy does it work.</li>
    <li> It did the job! numbed me during my tattoo laser removal, and waxing. Definitely recommend it for its numbing use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the 24th and it said i wouldnt get it til nov 20th and i actually got it today , 4 days later ! Very happy with the service .</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product, the ointment didn&#x27;t numb the area at all. I did what the direction stated to do with how to apply the ointment and waited 45 minutes and it never numb the area even after 1 hour. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to my enemies that&#x27;s how bad it was, unless I just got a bad box.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t numb very much even after following the instructions on the package and tips from online.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used about half the tube (it&#x27;s teeny tiny) and wrapped the area with plastic and let it sit for over 2 hours before my brazilian wax. LEMME TELL YOU, there was NO FEELING in the &amp;#34;Line of Fire&amp;#34;, the most sensitive and painful section of a bikini wax. I felt some heat from the wax, in fact I had to ask if it was hotter than normal, but it wasn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know why I could feel the heat so much, but the ripping of the hair was NOTHING at all. There was no sting; NOTHING AT ALL! Directly after my waxing appointment, I ordered another tube. I will NEVER be without this little beauty again for a full brazilian wax. Absolutely worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> works a lot faster than they say! and it stays numb for a long time!  just wish it was a bigger package!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Two tattoos done with it and for the most part I dont feel a thing. I read a comment on amazon that states if you leave it on for two hours it works better - this was the precise truth. I left it on the first time for two hours and then did the tattoo, I didnt feel even a bit of anything. The second time was for the shading on that piece - on for one hour and it hurt pretty bad about fourty five minutes into it. The next tattoo I got I left it on for two hours - didnt feel a thing except the spots that I didnt put any on. :) Thrilled with the results but you should plan ahead if your using it for anything with needles :) :)</li>
    <li> I used this prior to dermarolling my face with 1.5mm roller.  Worked great, couldn&#x27;t have rolled my face without it. I did one small area the first day as a test and left the cream on for 45 minutes, covering with saran wrap to prevent drying out.  Dermarolling goes pretty quick so numbness did not wear off.  The second time I noticed my skin was numb in around 20 minutes so I wiped the cream off and got started.  Pain was the same as the first time (tolerable), so as others have noted, it numbed faster than 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for so can&#x27;t complain that much it worked for an 1 1/2 hours I was impressed good for small tattoos</li>
    <li> I only have it one star cuz well I had to rate it. This stuff did not work at all. I was maybe numb for about 10 minutes and then nothing. Even the area that wasn&#x27;t cut off when working on my tattoo wasn&#x27;t even numb anymore than the area we worked on. Guess you really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Did not numb as strong as I was hoping.  I still felt the procedure not not very painfully.  If the procedure was more intense, I think I would have felt it.</li>
    <li> It works but you have to wait a few hours , i used it to pierced my belly button. and i didnt Feel a thing.</li>
    <li> I have tried several numbing agents for large tattoo work and many don&#x27;t last long or work at all.  I know each person is different but I got the entire outline on a large back piece with very little pain.  My artist was already working when I asked if he was ready to start!  I would recommend it to anyone based on price and the way it works!!!</li>
    <li> I have to put it on about 40 prior to my appointment, but it works if you give it enough time and keep the area covered. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate the pain entirely, but it does make it tolerable.</li>
    <li> I can not express how much I love this stuff!! I have a pretty large tattoo on my chest that I&#x27;ve been working on removing with laser for quite a while and it was insanely painful. I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting this stuff to work, thinking it was some cheap scam. I first applied a thin layer and let it absorb, then I applied a very thick layer and covered it with plastic wrap for two hours before my appointment.  My appointments used to take an hour due to all the breaks I needed because of how painful it was. It took less than twenty minutes after I used this stuff. I barely felt a thing!!! This stuff is amazing, I highly recommend it!!</li>
