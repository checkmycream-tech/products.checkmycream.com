      <li>I love rocking red lips, but I don&#x27;t like bright colors on myself, so this is the perfect shade of red for me!</li>
      <li>With oil it comes off easy.</li>
      <li>so smooth</li>
      <li>Might be good for costume makeup if you plan on completely scrubbing your face off afterwards.</li>
      <li>It looks great, but be warned, it is quite sticky when dry.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a bit sticky but other than that it&#x27;s a beautiful color</li>

      <li>SUPER stick after it dries.</li>
      <li>Very dark color which is beautiful.</li>
      <li>I normally have to retouch my lips throughout the day (once I eat/drink) but this one seemed to stay in place, for the most part.  </li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s definitely a new favorite of mine</li>

      <li>comes right off</li>
      <li>Its sticky and gets very dry but nice color.</li>
      <li>First, I tested it on my hand.</li>

      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Really stays on your lips.</li>
      <li>It also lasts really long, doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge easily nor does it come off when wet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to use a makeup remover product to take it off or something a little oily like lotion or Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con from the product is the applicator, it is very long and thing and at the end is the little fuzzy part similar to the ones in cheap lip gloss applicators.</li>
      <li>Then when it dried I touched it and it was smooth,</li>
      <li>Its very matte, dry, and sticky.</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I first applied it, because the color was a little bit darker than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>When it says long lasting, it really means it.</li>
      <li>Really pigmented and long lasting...</li>
      <li>very pigment and does last a long time,</li>
      <li>I went a whole day with it on while I ate and did all other activities</li>
      <li>The stickiness feels like if my lips are glued together and it can feel hard to pull apart (but not painful), the color does last.</li>
      <li>and it comes off as a dark vibrant red on me</li>

<li> Seriously unless you want to glue ur lips together or you want to forever have that color lip go right ahead.</li>
<li> Lasts a long time.</li>
<li> Different look from picture,this lip color is so dark,when applied it looks like black lip gloss.</li>
<li> It never really fully dries</li>
<li> Although it is not this exact shade it is matte and it is very long lasting a little difficult to take off</li>
<li> , its really dry !!</li>
<li> Makes me wonder how well it will go in the shower, or any other activity that means getting soaked it water.</li>
<li> im getting other colors soon  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s sticky when dry, but nothing a little chap stick won&#x27;t fix.</li>
<li> though when eating it will come off a little but not very noticeable</li>
<li> Only down side is its really hard to get off after it dries so of</li>
<li> If you want a dark, matte, stay on all day lip product , well this is the one.</li>
<li> but it comes off as dark maroon on lighter skin tones.</li>
<li> It is long wearing and really hard to get off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s length makes it a bit difficult to apply in an even stroke, so I definitely recommend using a little bit of the product at a time and applying the lipstick on the inside of the lips than working out towards the outside line of the lips.</li>
<li> , It&#x27;s just a little darker than the picture</li>
<li> It feels like the Revlon 24hr lipstick, but a little stickier.</li>
<li> and it smeared a little.</li>
<li> But after a few minutes (I&#x27;m guessing once it fully dried), the color lightened up a bit.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s very very little stickiness..</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to take off , if you&#x27;re having trouble getting it off ,use some coconut oil</li>
<li> You can look past it..</li>
<li> My only issue is that it becomes a weird texture after drinking something.</li>
<li> Dry not waterproof bad customer service tried to cheat me and give partial refund when color is way off,product is not waterproof as stated, and flakes off even when exfoliating lips happens.</li>
<li> So hard to take of unless using make up remover and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It never really fully dries so it&#x27;s a bit sticky but other than that it&#x27;s a beautiful color and it&#x27;s definitely a new favorite of mine</li>
    <li> I really like it but, it is a tad bit darker than the picture. I think mines might be defective because I read a lot of comments saying the color was dead on and that it is really sticky. First, I tested it on my hand. Then when it dried I touched it and it was smooth, so smooth I went around making everyone touch my hand- they agreed. I rubbed it too and it stayed put. Also, I washed my hands and lets just say water is not match for this... thing. Makes me wonder how well it will go in the shower, or any other activity that means getting soaked it water. After a while, I decided it to take it off with chap stick and it smeared a little. I then got vegetable oil to take it off, I had to rub it in to get it out. With oil it comes off easy. So i question how this will hold on against feeding time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a picture of two women with red lipstick, which I think the color looks more like. I would post a personal picture, but for some reason my phone will not let me without a fight.</li>
    <li> Color is not for me lookslike blood but its waterproof and it lasts a day(24hr) im getting other colors soon  they are cheap and good quality</li>
    <li> Image is the same as the product when I bought 22 I swatched it and didn&#x27;t really use it when I wrote the review but it was really sticky and dried as I applied it. But with this one I instantly loved it because of how smooth it went on. I love it and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Only down side is its really hard to get off after it dries so of you make a mistake and try to wipe it, it will smear everywhere and not come off. Otherwise it lasts all day and night and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off if I drink something.</li>
    <li> Dry not waterproof bad customer service tried to cheat me and give partial refund when color is way off,product is not waterproof as stated, and flakes off even when exfoliating lips happens. Offered a crappy unsanitary solution.</li>
    <li> Love it for the price it really isn&#x27;t annoying to wear</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt; lovely color, but not the color I expected to be.</li>
    <li> Its very matte, dry, and sticky. But it does last all day. Very hard to come off. Have to scrub it.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed, it is a perfect matte &amp; it has a good price. For sure I will be getting another one. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> , its really dry !! wouldn&#x27;t recommend &amp; its hard to get off ! you have to add lip gloss</li>
    <li> I love the color! It looks great, but be warned, it is quite sticky when dry. It feels like the Revlon 24hr lipstick, but a little stickier. It&#x27;s sticky when dry, but nothing a little chap stick won&#x27;t fix. The stickiness feels like if my lips are glued together and it can feel hard to pull apart (but not painful), the color does last. The longest I wore it was 7 hours, no smears even while drinking water or eating snacks, it does come off with oily foods though. It doesn&#x27;t smudge easily nor does it come off when wet. It&#x27;s best to use a makeup remover product to take it off or something a little oily like lotion or Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con from the product is the applicator, it is very long and thing and at the end is the little fuzzy part similar to the ones in cheap lip gloss applicators. It&#x27;s length makes it a bit difficult to apply in an even stroke, so I definitely recommend using a little bit of the product at a time and applying the lipstick on the inside of the lips than working out towards the outside line of the lips.</li>
    <li> When it came in the mail and I tried it on I was very impressed....thanks wxbuy.</li>
    <li> Love!!! So matte... So hard to take of unless using make up remover and even then it takes a bit of scrubbing but very beautiful and would definitely purchase again...</li>
    <li> When it says long lasting, it really means it. Don&#x27;t get it anywhere but on your lips or if won&#x27;t come off. I got some on my fingers and it literally took all day to get it off. But the color is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Adore this color! I was surprised when I first applied it, because the color was a little bit darker than I thought it would be. But after a few minutes (I&#x27;m guessing once it fully dried), the color lightened up a bit. I personally love it. Its a deep, vampy, blood red color. Very similar to Jeffree Starr&#x27;s &amp;#34;Unicorn Blood&amp;#34; liquid lipstick color, but about a shade lighter.  This also stays on very well. I normally have to retouch my lips throughout the day (once I eat/drink) but this one seemed to stay in place, for the most part.  I love rocking red lips, but I don&#x27;t like bright colors on myself, so this is the perfect shade of red for me! I will be buying another one soon!</li>
    <li> Although it is not this exact shade it is matte and it is very long lasting a little difficult to take off but thats a plus. I always leave lipstick stains on my glasses so this is perfect i dont need to keep applying. The color shown looks cherry but the product is a little darker, has more of a maroon tone to it but looked amazing. loved it</li>
    <li> Lipstick is OK but has  one .moisture  and had to keep reapplying</li>
    <li> Has a good color. However, it is extremely hard to get off of your lips! It sticks to your skin! It&#x27;s like peeling a sticker off something! It leaves residue and red splotches on your face. Might be good for costume makeup if you plan on completely scrubbing your face off afterwards. You HAVE to use soap to get it off. But it has good pigment and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love the color, but its sticky -_____-</li>
    <li> I love the color, It&#x27;s just a little darker than the picture but it&#x27;s pretty. It also lasts really long, doesn&#x27;t come off easily. The only con is that it gets sticky after it dries.</li>
    <li> SUPER stick after it dries. It dries more mousse textured than matte. It is long wearing and really hard to get off. It took 3 weeks to get here the day after estimated delivery. I&#x27;m a brown/black girl and it comes off as a dark vibrant red on me but it comes off as dark maroon on lighter skin tones.</li>
    <li> Different look from picture,this lip color is so dark,when applied it looks like black lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Love this. Lasts a long time. Through eating, drinking, kissing, and whatever else 😜 it has smooth application, and Is a really pretty shade.</li>
    <li> My first time trying a matte and this is perfect. Very dark color which is beautiful. This matte drys fast and stays on all day without smudging. I went a whole day with it on while I ate and did all other activities yet this product did not come off at all while doing all of these activities. This item is the only lipstick I use. It goes on wet at first the dries into a beautiful matte. If you want a dark, matte, stay on all day lip product , well this is the one. Overall perfect low price for a perfect beautiful product</li>
    <li> Ir&#x27;a whaterproof, but it is not the color shown in the picture. It&#x27;s brown.</li>
    <li> Awesome lips stain. Seller needs to also have the color in the title.</li>
    <li> Its sticky and gets very dry but nice color.</li>
    <li> very pigment and does last a long time, though when eating it will come off a little but not very noticeable</li>
    <li> Seriously unless you want to glue ur lips together or you want to forever have that color lip go right ahead. I don&#x27;t recommend this to even my worst enemy. The shipping took almost a week after the estimated day. I hate it is horrible. The color is pretty tho. Would make beautiful glue. I wish I never bought it and I will never order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The color in the picture is literally what you get! It&#x27;s awesome I love it.. Iv now ordered 4 more colors.. Really pigmented and long lasting... Only complaint is that it is a tad bit sticky when dry (I hate sticky stuff) but it&#x27;s very very little stickiness.. You can look past it..</li>
    <li> Its to sticky and not waterproof</li>
    <li> My ruby red waterproof lip gloss I order them six at a time to ensure that I don&#x27;t run out that should tell you how much I love it. It doesn&#x27;t smear doesn&#x27;t run lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> In love. Really stays on your lips. Color is beautiful.</li>
    <li> It was the exact color I was looking for! My only issue is that it becomes a weird texture after drinking something.</li>
    <li> lip sticks looks good but it is way too sticky..</li>
    <li> FYI it&#x27;s hard to take off , if you&#x27;re having trouble getting it off ,use some coconut oil comes right off (:</li>
    <li> This lipstick is just perfect I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;It looks amazing and it stay a lot and is just perfect😙🙌😻</li>
    <li> i like this labial (:)</li>
