### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What a great confidence builder for anyone on the spot about their appearance!</li>
      <li>As with all Philosophy products, the design of the container is very attractive.</li>
      <li>The smell is also wonderful.</li>
      <li>My skin feels beautiful in it!</li>
      <li>you know what I am talking about, those things you see when you are in great lighting and looking into your compact!</li>
      <li>Your face won&#x27;t feel plasticy, you can still feel things as though nothing at all is there, and it best of all, it doesn&#x27;t come off like foundation does.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>This is actually a very good product for what it is.</li>
      <li>Philosphy&#x27;s own \\&quot;airbrush\\&quot; foundation works perfectly with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also great as just a moisturizer when you want to go without makeup.</li>
      <li>This will preserve all the good I just did to my face before loading up the make up.</li>
      <li>this is a reallyy good stuff.</li>
      <li>You need a really good cleanser before it and to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>just turned 21 and feel like that i need to cover up my face with this kind of thing as time goes by because of bit acnes and wrinkles on my face.</li>
      <li>I find it best described as a \\&quot;soft focus moisturizer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clear makeup is the best product I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- If you don&#x27;t start with a pristinely clean face you won&#x27;t get as good</li>
      <li>It was more cost effective than most primers.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just like a lightweight cream full of good stuff for skin.</li>
      <li>It went on very smooth.  </li>
      <li>stuff will fill in your pores and leave your face looking very smooth.  </li>
      <li>love the mattifying on this primer, it keeps the shine off all day.  </li>

      <li>Gives my skin a radiant but still matte appearance, even under the most severe convention floor lighting.  </li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>and I actually enjoyed the smell of lavender in the primer.</li>
      <li>My make up went on flawlessly and stayed on all day which is a miracle in the deep South.  </li>
      <li>Online, I searched for primers and found what I thought would have been a perfect combination of the Ulta advice and purchased The Present by Philosophy.</li>
      <li>The combination of the two works like a champ for me! :)</li>
      <li>I love most of Philosophy products, but this one is a dud.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I am really impressed with the fact that this product balances my skin out all over, it stays that way for a long time, and feels like there&#x27;s nothing there.</li>
      <li>Very mild and works fantastic.</li>
      <li>When the package came in the mail I was enthusiastic, looking forward to experiencing the positive reviews found on Sephora and Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is also a *fantastic* moisturizer</li>
      <li>Lose the parabens, increase the hydration ability of the formulation and offer it in an opaque tube to resist degradation from light</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost like having your face lightly</li>
      <li>skin looks smooth, no oily patches, not shiny</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it, I felt like I was on top of the world.  </li>
      <li>I have used the present over on a clear day retinol treatment (paraben-free) with excellent results.</li>
      <li>) Provides a barrier for stage makeup - keeping my pores relatively clean when I have to wear it for camera work.  </li>
      <li>You have wait two full minutes, then you can apply foundation if you like.  </li>
      <li>it really worked well for me, but i&#x27;m not quite sure if it works for others as well.</li>
      <li>I tried this product after reading several good reviews on this site and others.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this in hopes to smooth out the tiny pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;It works like magic!  </li>
      <li>It helps as well to blend your foundation in quickly.</li>
      <li>I consider myself lucky...</li>
      <li>I was excited to try \\&quot;The Present\\&quot; because I love the way that clear makeup and makeup primers feel on my skin.  </li>
      <li>As a painter, I felt as though I was prepping my facial canvas, so my makeup just glided on very smoothly and easily.  </li>
      <li>am a Product Junkie - I highly recommend this one!!!  </li>
      <li>You just need to make sure it&#x27;s totally dry before applying anything on top of it.</li>
      <li>I put on my self tan first to a clean face.  </li>
      <li>After reading the positive reviews of this primer, I was excited to try it out before my upcoming wedding.  </li>
      <li>Later that evening, I was very enthusiastic and surprised that my skin still felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>I am also very sensitive, and breakout easily.  </li>
      <li>Hoping for an even texture on my face, I applied my powder matte foundation (Bare Minerals) and my depth and appearance of pores seemed to be more prevalent than not using the primer before a make up application.     </li>
      <li>Excellent staying power, the present goes on smooth and glides on relatively thick and leaves a noticeably tactile layer across the skin.</li>
      <li>When I finally ordered, I was a little saddened that Philosophy had removed the wonderful lavender-like fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have even, on rare occasions, even used a silicon primer on top of this as a double primer, and had no problems with pilling.    </li>
      <li>It made my very sensitive skin smooth out and just glow.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to use my regular \\&quot;bare escentuals\\&quot; products on top.  </li>
      <li>I had seen them use this product on QVC and I was interested in it.  </li>
      <li>Try Korres primer, 99% silicone free, natural, does wonders for skin</li>
      <li>Make-up will not go on smoothly with Clear Makeup and wearing it alone does nothing to improve the look of your skin.</li>
      <li>my friend Stacy ate in first grade but it feels like a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>As a primer it works ok, but I checked ingredients, and it&#x27;s the same stuff like in Philosophy</li>
      <li>over top of The Present.  </li>
      <li>I prefer to use more than less in order to take advantage of its light moisturizing abilities.</li>
      <li>My skin was in good condition, but after about 2 weeks of daily use of this product, my chin broke out with large, swollen pimples that were deep under the surface.  </li>
      <li>Started of with Kiehl&#x27;s, but was turned off by its high fragrance content across most of its products and a slew of parabens in the middle of ingredients lists.</li>
      <li>I have large pores and patchy skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it lookes like glue on, your using way too much.  </li>
      <li>it really locks in moisture and make-up seems to glide on.  </li>
      <li>I use the present primarily at night before bed, or before an evening around town.</li>
      <li>it just cover littlest things very silghtly.</li>
      <li>(Yes, the guys on camera absolutely do wear makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to individuals who need to smooth out the surface of their skin without using a liquid foundation and who want to use a mineral powder foundation but it is just not enough for them.</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair and pseudo natural blonde (blonde up until my 20&#x27;s when it started getting darker...</li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist, and I use The Present on myself and so many of my clients.  </li>
      <li>If you are on the normal to dry side, you still would want a light moisturizer, then use the present over top of it.   </li>
      <li>If you give it time to dry, you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>(What&#x27;s more, it makes it a bit more difficult to pick at scabs because they&#x27;re covered up.)  </li>
      <li>After reading rave reviews on Sephora and Amazon.com, I was pumped to make The Present my first primer and first Philosophy product.     </li>
      <li>A normal makeup remover does the trick at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Under long description hides make up primer, full of silicone</li>
      <li>My skin is normal to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Since using The Present, I rarely have any acne anymore.  </li>
      <li>And contrary to some other posts I&#x27;ve found that this works fine under a cream or liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>I just want to say, I have given Philosophy items chance after chance hoping that I will like their new products.  </li>
      <li>Its formulation very closely mimics that of the on a clear day \\&quot;oil-free moisturizer for sensitive, blemish-prone skin\\&quot;, also marketed by philosophy.</li>
      <li>A married guy who lives with his wife and younger sister who are cosmetics freaks.</li>
      <li>This product will not replace normal \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; makeup because it is _clear_.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Clear makeup is the best product I have ever used.  The first time I tried it, I felt like I was on top of the world.  It gave me such new, fresh skin that I glowed from the outside in.  Acne scars, discolorations, even scabs became less noticible.  (What&#x27;s more, it makes it a bit more difficult to pick at scabs because they&#x27;re covered up.)  It made my skin incredibly soft.  As a painter, I felt as though I was prepping my facial canvas, so my makeup just glided on very smoothly and easily.  (And I used a lot less makeup than usual.)  Are there downsides?  Nope.  Your face won&#x27;t feel plasticy, you can still feel things as though nothing at all is there, and it best of all, it doesn&#x27;t come off like foundation does.  My skin can still breathe, my face still sweats if it needs to.  This stuff is a miracle.  I&#x27;m recommending it to lots and lots of people, men and women alike.</li>
    <li> If people are experiencing a glue like effect I would think that they are not giving it enough time to dry. It might feel dry after one minute but wait at least two like the product suggests. It helps as well to blend your foundation in quickly. Do it in sections if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. It acts as a barrier to the elements and makes pores disappear. I have never been disasstified with a Philosophy product. They corner the market on must have.</li>
    <li> I had seen them use this product on QVC and I was interested in it.  Finally broke down and got it and I must say this product delivers!   It made my very sensitive skin smooth out and just glow.  My pores look so much smaller.   The redness in my face is gone.   For a quick out the door in a hurry look, this one is the best.</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews on Sephora and Amazon.com, I was pumped to make The Present my first primer and first Philosophy product.     My introductions to primers began on a vacation at an Ulta where a sales associate turned me to Studio Gear&#x27;s Prime Objective Primer. I&#x27;ll admit I was very apprehensive about the silicon feel and it deterred me from purchasing the primer even after the sales associate demonstrated the product on the back of my hand. Later that evening, I was very enthusiastic and surprised that my skin still felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom. When getting back from my vacation I decided that I would also use the sales associate&#x27;s advice and purchase a Philosophy product.    Online, I searched for primers and found what I thought would have been a perfect combination of the Ulta advice and purchased The Present by Philosophy. When the package came in the mail I was enthusiastic, looking forward to experiencing the positive reviews found on Sephora and Amazon. Sadly, I was disappointed.    With skin that doesn&#x27;t undergo much acne, but is prone to redness and uneven texture, I was hoping for The Present to minimize my appearance of pores. I have sensitive/combination skin. My pores tend to be large on my cheeks and lower forehead and trying to treat larger pores with oil reducing cleansers leave my skin completely dry and flaky. What I found with The Present (after cleansing, moisturizing, applying and waiting 2 minutes) was that it leaves my skin very, very soft, but the reduction of pores does not seem to happen. Hoping for an even texture on my face, I applied my powder matte foundation (Bare Minerals) and my depth and appearance of pores seemed to be more prevalent than not using the primer before a make up application.     I did not experience the glue feeling that some people have claimed and I actually enjoyed the smell of lavender in the primer. As with all Philosophy products, the design of the container is very attractive. My disappointment is mostly with the end result.</li>
    <li> My mission seems to be to try all the philosophy products so when I tried the Present (a sample) I was at first skeptical.  Oh come on, a clear make-up to smooth out my icky skin?  It does resemble the Elmer&#x27;s Glue my friend Stacy ate in first grade but it feels like a moisturizer.  It went on very smooth.  As with most philosophy products, a little goes a long way.  Use this sparingly daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once it dried (seconds later), my skin was incredibly smooth to the touch.  My make up went on flawlessly and stayed on all day which is a miracle in the deep South.  I was using DHC Skincare Velvet Skin as a primer but this stuff leaves that in the dust.  It was more cost effective than most primers.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews of this primer, I was excited to try it out before my upcoming wedding.  I used it as directed and liked the results.  My make-up lasted all day without touch-ups.  My skin was in good condition, but after about 2 weeks of daily use of this product, my chin broke out with large, swollen pimples that were deep under the surface.  I stopped using the product and my chin has since cleared up.  Is this a scientific study?  No, but it is my experience.  I may consider using it when I get married, but I will be trying other primers also.</li>
    <li> I just want to say, I have given Philosophy items chance after chance hoping that I will like their new products.  But once again, I was highly disappointed!  I was excited to try \\&quot;The Present\\&quot; because I love the way that clear makeup and makeup primers feel on my skin.  This stuff felt like I was smearing Elmers Glue on my face!  I followed the directions and waited the recommended 2 minutes before applying makeup.  My foundation (Lancome MAQUICONTRLE which I&#x27;ve been using forever)went on all smeary, cakey, and streaked. Magnifying my pores 10x what they are. It was awful!  And if you think about using powder alone, forget about it!  Every line, wrinkle, and imperfection were also magnified 100%!  I&#x27;m sticking with my Smashbox Photo Finish Primer!</li>
    <li> I consider myself lucky... I recieved a few sample packets of this product and after several applications from each packet I am consistantly pleased.  I have a few ideas as to why there are such disparate love/hate reviews (here and on other sites), so I want to explain a few of them: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Use: a very tiny bit goes a long way. Do not apply as much as you would any other moisturizer or foundation.  A few small dots quickly and lightly blended is all that is needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- This product will not replace normal \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; makeup because it is _clear_. It isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;primer\\&quot; makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t cover up problem areas, colour imbalances, etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- This product does \\&quot;prime\\&quot; skin by smoothing out minor imperfections and textural differences. It also softens and leaves a shine-free finish with a velvety, natural feel.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- I personally have patches of different types of skin (slightly oily, slightly dry, large pores in areas, etc.) and I use this alone as a \\&quot;lightweight oil-free moisturiser\\&quot;. I am really impressed with the fact that this product balances my skin out all over, it stays that way for a long time, and feels like there&#x27;s nothing there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- When I wear this, I look like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup and just happen to have naturally Good Skin.  The times that I have applied foundation over this I haven&#x27;t had any troubles, plus I seem to require less makeup. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- If I had any doubts I would consider heading to a department store and sampling this (especially with coaching from a Philosophy Rep) before purchasing a full-sized container online.</li>
    <li> This is actually a very good product for what it is. And yes, I am a guy. A married guy who lives with his wife and younger sister who are cosmetics freaks. Started of with Kiehl&#x27;s, but was turned off by its high fragrance content across most of its products and a slew of parabens in the middle of ingredients lists. At least philosophy lists parabens towards the end, or at the very end of their products which do contain such preservatives. I prefer to use more than less in order to take advantage of its light moisturizing abilities. Not exactly my first choice as a facial moisturizer, but I&#x27;ll take a single-step product over layering multiple products. Does not provide enough moisturizing (or SPF, for that matter) for post glycolic treatments. I use the present primarily at night before bed, or before an evening around town. Excellent staying power, the present goes on smooth and glides on relatively thick and leaves a noticeably tactile layer across the skin. Its formulation very closely mimics that of the on a clear day \\&quot;oil-free moisturizer for sensitive, blemish-prone skin\\&quot;, also marketed by philosophy. I have used the present over on a clear day retinol treatment (paraben-free) with excellent results. What can earn this recommended product another two stars? Lose the parabens, increase the hydration ability of the formulation and offer it in an opaque tube to resist degradation from light (I have seen quite a few testers turn yellow over time). Even so, I would suggest you give this relatively inexpensive option a try as it works as generally advertised.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers who say this is like glue. It does nothing to benefit the skin. It is simply annoying. Make-up will not go on smoothly with Clear Makeup and wearing it alone does nothing to improve the look of your skin. If you&#x27;re looking for a makeup primer try Laura Mercier&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re looking for something clear to help with imperfections give up.</li>
    <li> As a primer it works ok, but I checked ingredients, and it&#x27;s the same stuff like in Philosophy On a clear day Protection cream. Under long description hides make up primer, full of silicone and it&#x27;s derivatives (just google it; all those words ending with \\&quot;thicone\\&quot; and \\&quot;thiconol\\&quot; plus parabens used as a preservatives. No wonder some sensitive skin breaks out or has a rush.  Try Korres primer, 99% silicone free, natural, does wonders for skin and it&#x27;s just like a lightweight cream full of good stuff for skin. I love most of Philosophy products, but this one is a dud.</li>
    <li> I have become a Philosophy fan after trying several of their products and have recently purchased about all of the skin care line! I had larger then normal pores (not overly large) in my T-Zone that have almost vanished  after using Purity Made Simple Facial Cleanser and the Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash for the last month. The Present Clear Makeup gives my skin a smoothed out, soft focus look without having to use a liquid foundation. I use the Airbrushed canvas on top and I am good to go! My skin is the clearest it has ever been and people comment on how radiant my face looks! I recommend this product to individuals who need to smooth out the surface of their skin without using a liquid foundation and who want to use a mineral powder foundation but it is just not enough for them. The combination of the two works like a champ for me! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes to smooth out the tiny pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;It works like magic!  This time of year I am a self tanner.  I put on my self tan first to a clean face.  Wait for it to dry.  Then I put on my Philosophy The Present Clear Makeup.  You have wait two full minutes, then you can apply foundation if you like.  I use a tinted moisturizer and follow with Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will fill in your pores and leave your face looking very smooth.  Before I did not enjoy seeing my face up close because of those pores...you know what I am talking about, those things you see when you are in great lighting and looking into your compact! With this product you can not see them, I am amazed!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had no adverse reactions to this product and I have been using it over a month now.  My skin is normal to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried a sample of this product before purchasing.  When I finally ordered, I was a little saddened that Philosophy had removed the wonderful lavender-like fragrance.  It has zero smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Product Junkie - I highly recommend this one!!!  Don&#x27;t forget to try their cleanser also, Purity Made Simple.  It is the BOMB.  Very mild and works fantastic.</li>
    <li> it really locks in moisture and make-up seems to glide on.  Also great as just a moisturizer when you want to go without makeup.</li>
    <li> this is a reallyy good stuff. i actually hesitated buying this a lot cuz have never used foundations or premier things.i&#x27;m just turned 21 and feel like that i need to cover up my face with this kind of thing as time goes by because of bit acnes and wrinkles on my face. it really worked well for me, but i&#x27;m not quite sure if it works for others as well. it just cover littlest things very silghtly.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading several good reviews on this site and others.  It was such a disappointment.  It made my skin look worse when I used it.  I have oily, acne prone skin with scars.  It didn&#x27;t cover anything up and my skin was still as oily as ever.  I waited a lot longer than the recommended time before putting on my makeup.  It made my makeup impossible to put on, and it made my skin look horrible.  I tried it for several days, but it just made me feel awful about the way my skin looked, so I stopped using it.  What a waste of money for me.  I can&#x27;t say that you shouldn&#x27;t try it, because apparently it works for some people, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist, and I use The Present on myself and so many of my clients.  I love this stuff!!! &lt;br /&gt;I love the mattifying on this primer, it keeps the shine off all day.  I am extremely oily, and it still works wonders on me.  I am also very sensitive, and breakout easily.  Since using The Present, I rarely have any acne anymore.  I get so many compliments on my complexion.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also to clear up on some issues from other posts. &lt;br /&gt;YES you can wear this with liquid or any other foundation.  It clearly states on the bottle that you must give it two minutes to set before applying foundation.  If you give it time to dry, you&#x27;ll be fine.  I have even, on rare occasions, even used a silicon primer on top of this as a double primer, and had no problems with pilling.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it lookes like glue on, your using way too much.  A little goes a long way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed in another post, someone using this twice a day as a moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t do that, it is not intended as a daily moisturizer.  Only if you are oily, you can use it as a morning moisturizer, then follow up with something different for night. (Remember, oily skin still needs hydration.)  If you are on the normal to dry side, you still would want a light moisturizer, then use the present over top of it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have used The Present for 2 years.  And I&#x27;m a *guy*.  I am the director of a telecommunications consultancy and spend lots of time at conventions, in front of crowds, etc.  I am extremely fair and pseudo natural blonde (blonde up until my 20&#x27;s when it started getting darker... now it&#x27;s chemically assisted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Present has been my salvation on the show floor, on stage and in front of cameras!  And it continues to prove itself every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You cannot put liquid or creme foundation over top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You need a really good cleanser before it and to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is *clear* so expect to see your skin under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I find it best described as a \\&quot;soft focus moisturizer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I recommend Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Purity\\&quot; cleanser to remove it.  Regular soap doesn&#x27;t really budge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you don&#x27;t start with a pristinely clean face you won&#x27;t get as good a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Evens out my skin texture.  I have large pores and patchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Gives my skin a radiant but still matte appearance, even under the most severe convention floor lighting.  It&#x27;s almost like having your face lightly airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Locks in whatever moisturizer you put under it.  It is also a *fantastic* moisturizer itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Provides a barrier for stage makeup - keeping my pores relatively clean when I have to wear it for camera work.  (Yes, the guys on camera absolutely do wear makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you have hormone issues, wild and crazy skin or your skin just needs a kick in the pants to get it back into shape, put The Present on in the morning, come home at night and wash your face, then put The Present on and wear it to bed.  [My adult acne flareups have disappeared since starting this myself.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Use mineral makeup, powder, etc. over top of The Present.  Creams and liquids WILL slide off.  Philosphy&#x27;s own \\&quot;airbrush\\&quot; foundation works perfectly with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Remember The Present was originally designed to cover vulnerable skin after dermabrasion and acid skin peels.  It acts like a second layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wait for it to dry.  2 minutes means 2 minutes.  If it isn&#x27;t drying you should use less or start with a dryer face.rfectly with it. &lt;br /&gt;- Remember The Present was originally designed to cover vulnerable skin after dermabrasion and acid skin peels.

    <li> I received a sample of this at Sephora and fell in love with it immediately! as soon as I finish my last sample I will buy it. My skin feels beautiful in it! The smell is also wonderful. Im not too crazy about lavender scents, but this one really smells ENTICING and sometimes I will smell it before bed- its relaxing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I am a user of the Bare Escentuals products. I wear the foundation, mineral veil and blush everyday but needed *something* underneath as a \\&quot;primer\\&quot;, to keep the makeup on all day, to give that \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; look while also moisturizing my skin, and I needed something that my sensitive skin wouldnt react to in a bad way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Present, 2oz, by philosophy does all of what I asked from a product. A tiny bit goes a long way, because I would think that a bunch would just build up and cause that \\&quot;streaking\\&quot; effect other reviewers have commented on. I have found no such streaking even using a powder base and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks smooth, no oily patches, not shiny and it lasts ALL DAY LONG, i dont have to touch it up!!! A normal makeup remover does the trick at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for about a year. It acts as a band-aid for your skin. It keeps the good things in and the bad things out. So in the morning after all your moisturizers and serums and what not I put this on before I put on my make up. This will preserve all the good I just did to my face before loading up the make up. And contrary to some other posts I&#x27;ve found that this works fine under a cream or liquid foundation. You just need to make sure it&#x27;s totally dry before applying anything on top of it. I also like to use it at night. After I put on a night cream or serum I apply the Present and I have another layer of protection.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about this product, because it mentions \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; moisturizer as a base.  My highly sensitive skin needs heavier product--so I pressed on.  WOW!  This product gave me a finished look and I was able to use my regular \\&quot;bare escentuals\\&quot; products on top.  Touch ups were not needed and--most important--it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  Because I use a heavy cold cream to remove my makeup anyway, removal was not a problem.  What a great confidence builder for anyone on the spot about their appearance!</li>
