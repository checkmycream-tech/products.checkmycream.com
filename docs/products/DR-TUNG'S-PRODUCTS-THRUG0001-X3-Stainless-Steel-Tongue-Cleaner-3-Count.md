<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I know everyone has different expectations but this is perfect to me. I was afraid that the part that scrapes the tongue would be too this and would just slide over it while picking up just a little bit of the yucky stuff. This thing is amazing!! Leaves my tongue looking and feeling clean. My tongue is the cleanest I think I&#x27;ve ever seen it.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of tongue scrapers in the past but I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> It does scrape off the white stuff, but my tongue wasn&#x27;t left completely clean, even after swiping a lot.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it works really well.  Has helped me to have a more pink tongue!</li>
    <li> I recommend these for everyone that doesn&#x27;t have some kind of active inflammation in their tongue or some connective tissue problem or who is stronger than they think they are, because only then might it cause tongue abrasions and bleeding. Don&#x27;t go crazy scrubbing too hard back and forth. Use common sense. You only need to scrape gently, from back to front. Really helps decrease bad breath. Please use. It would make the work place more pleasant if fewer people had bad breath.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. The only thing it removes is spit. Tongue looks the same as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect many of these reviews are fake. Beware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tempted to give this 3 stars, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m simply trying to use it in a way it wasn&#x27;t meant.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to clean the back of my tongue, but I find it a bit hard to do with this tool, because, while my tongue is quite flat in the front, the back forms a sort of V shape, and that central crevasse is also where most of the nasty stuff is which I want to clean. But it&#x27;s hard to get to with this cleaner. I can kind of do a two phase approach where I angle it on one half of the V first, and then the other half, but that doesn&#x27;t work so great because it&#x27;s hard to fit this tool into just half of my mouth when it&#x27;s that far back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m not giving 3 stars, because if you&#x27;re trying to clean the middle/front of your tongue it should work fine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it.  I see no difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> Product is fine, just can&#x27;t get comfortable with the tool.</li>
    <li> I am now addicted to tongue scraping.</li>
    <li> Works well, cleans off most of the stuff that builds up on the tongue. It is a little uncomfortable to use, but nothing that keeps me from using it. Just be careful not to bump the metal band into your teeth and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Amazingly useful product. After months of use, though, the soft plastic is coming undone where it touches the metal, which makes it more difficult to properly clean.</li>
    <li> This is the strongest and most effective tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve ever found.  This is my second one, because as strong as the stainless steel is, when my dog gets hold of it, he will chew a little of the pink rubber-like material.  My dog can destroy my shoes in five minutes, but it takes him months to get this tongue cleaner to the point where I&#x27;d like another, although I can still use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, it&#x27;s amazing to see what comes off your tongue, especially in the early morning.  Once you see that once, you will not want to be without this product ever.  I&#x27;ve never seen a plastic tongue cleaner that compares to this one.</li>
    <li> Keep&#x27;n my tongue clean and my breath fresh</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your tongue sore or hurt.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I use it once a day and it makes the world of difference to my breath. Just be careful not to be over zealous when using or you could end up with a raw tongue.</li>
    <li> Very good quality tongue cleaner. Steel and plastic are of high quality. I&#x27;m sure this one will last me for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best Tongue scrapper I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Better than the ordinary tongue scraper ! Does the job much better than the plastic ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright but nothing groundbreaking.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as it seems: a metal piece attached to two rubber handles. Though nothing fancy, it certainly does work. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice thing to have in your bathroom. Use it almost daily, serves it purpose amazingly. Easy to use, sturdy material, good size if you like to take it with you.</li>
    <li> The handles do smell like rubber. It is a little smaller than I expected. But overall, it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Tongue cleaner? Is this a joke? How did I end up with this widget? I saw it in a movie and on Oprah. Curious, I search on Amazon.  I read Stew Clyde&#x27;s screaming funny review about this product. Anybody who put that much effort into a review 1) understands the product, 2) has described the performance in sufficient detail to be convincing and 3) can write like nobody&#x27;s business. Hey, Stew - go give Dave Barry a run for his money! Confident, I ordered although no one I knew used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - what about the product? It&#x27;s everything Stew says it is. I don&#x27;t have his extreme needs but it works for me. I&#x27;m adding it to a routine which includes brushing teeth and tongue 5 times a day, mouthwash twice a day, interdental brushes and floss to remove gunk from my highly variable gum spaces about 3 times a day. You&#x27;d think there would be little room for improvement. Not so. There is significant improvement. Have you ever nibbled on something before bed, done the full cleaning routine and woken up with the taste of it again in the morning? After using this tongue cleaner this problem is gone. In addition, I used to do the full oral cleaning before bed and woke up every morning all plaque-y. Now, the plaque problem is GREATLY reduced. Finally, morning breath isn&#x27;t such an immediate problem after waking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, after a week of use 2x a day, my tongue has gone from a pink with white dots to almost pure pink.</li>
    <li> it has a reduced gag reflex but a toothbrush is more effective at cleaning</li>
    <li> It works without sharp edges catching my tongue, and the narrow edge minimizes gagging (for me no gagging).&lt;br /&gt;It rinses clean and shakes dry. It could be used one handed, or by just one handle but is easier to control with two. You may notice the metallic taste of the steel but a little aromatherapy in the bathroom and the senses are distracted to something more pleasant and less utilitarian.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d bother with one of these as long as I kept flossing, brushing and rinsing consistently, but brought it up with my dental hygienist who said she loves hers. Sure enough, I figured I&#x27;d try it and definitely feel fresher after scraping. In particular, I feel it knocks out any sign of morning breath right away.</li>
    <li> I got this bout couple months ago and I have noticed it made a difference in my breath &amp; the foods I usually eat.. now I am trying to get my other half to get one! I recommend it to anyone looking for a fresher breath. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years to have fresher breath--tooth brushing just doesn&#x27;t cut it for my morning &amp;#34;dragon.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older one has smoother edges, not sure if that&#x27;s due to age or a change in production, so just be gentle with this one so you don&#x27;t cut your tongue papillae.</li>
    <li> These work great. Make a note though that this is not a single purchase!! It came in a box of 6, I think, maybe more. I didn&#x27;t want to take them all out and I couldn&#x27;t put them back in, but for sure I counted 4 inside the box, with more in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess the extras would be good gag gifts, or you can save them as stocking stuffers for Christmas. :)</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have bought, because the first one I had got moldy from sitting in the bathroom all the time. Good quality and works really well.</li>
    <li> I am one of many.  This is an outstanding product.  After this one I bought each of my family members one.  And even bought it for close friends.  You dont know how nasty your tongue is until you use this item.  Smiling everyday because I use this item.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tongue cleaner for anyone with post nasal drip&lt;br /&gt;Because of my post nasal drip I have suffered from a white tongue my whole life. No matter how much I have brushed and brushed, my tongue always turns white again within a matter of hours. Does this tongue cleaner make it stop? No of course not, but it does leave my tongue so clean that I can go an entire day with a relatively pink tongue. I don&#x27;t get that perfect pink that some people get but it still looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has excellent build quality! The rubber grips give you a strong hold while you are brushing your tongue and because it is made out of metal the brush is going to last a long time. The design of the brush is also excellent! Because of the way that the tool is designed I never have to worry about my gag reflex kicking in even when I go to the very back end of my tongue. This is amazing considering that I have an extremely strong gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the tongue cleaner did rip off some of my taste buds on several occasions. I wasn&#x27;t pressing down too hard so it may just be that my tongue is more sensitive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works very well&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easily&lt;br /&gt;Very Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Made out of metal&lt;br /&gt;Rubber grips give you a strong grip on the brush&lt;br /&gt;Designed well to prevent gagging reflex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Rubber grips can start to break down if not dried&lt;br /&gt;Can be painful for people with sensitive tongues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a tongue brush! This thing is built to last!!&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I never used a tongue cleaner prior to using this so I had lots of bacteria on my tongue that must have been the cause of my bad breath.  My wife doesn&#x27;t complain about my breath anymore using this on a daily basis.  It was painful the first day that I used it, but now there is no pain at all.</li>
    <li> i have been looking for years for a tongue cleaner that would get all of the leftovers. i work in the adult film business and there are sometimes strange things on mens organs that get stuck to your tongue. This has helped to get those leftovers out of my mouth. now if i could just find a reasonable stomach pump...</li>
    <li> It is nice and sturdy, just wish it had more of a serrated edge.  I like it a lot and well made.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, no gagging like when you use a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> A few hours after I brush and floss my teeth, I feel like I need to brush again, even if I haven&#x27;t eaten anything.  I thought this meant that I needed a tongue scraper, so I got this one.       This Dr. Tung&#x27;s tongue cleaner is adorably packaged, with a cute little illustration of Dr. Tung in white lab coat and glasses.  The product is well-built and fits into my toothbrush holder in my bathroom.  And it doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything.      I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a week, and I don&#x27;t feel cleaner.  I don&#x27;t know whether this tongue scraper isn&#x27;t effective or if I don&#x27;t need a tongue scraper, after all.  Still don&#x27;t know why I feel like I need to brush my teeth even if I haven&#x27;t eaten anything lately.</li>
    <li> I gag horribly when trying to clean my tongue with a toothbrush. It&#x27;s not a fun way to start a morning. This little device doesn&#x27;t make me gag at all (okay, I did once but I was testing the limits of how far back I could use it and I probably touched a tonsil or something).     The first time I used it I was a bit horrified at how much my toothbrush scraping wasn&#x27;t getting. I won&#x27;t go into details but it was gross. Since then I&#x27;ve used it every day and no longer have so much \\&quot;mess\\&quot; to clean up. Once you&#x27;ve used this product and seen how much awful stuff is on your tongue you&#x27;ll never stop using it. At least I won&#x27;t. Jeez.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s essential for oral cleaning</li>
    <li> It really does work.  I use it once every other day or so, nice to have a pink tongue again.  And yes, my food does taste a little bit different, seem to notice bitter and sour notes a little more, but not in an unpleasant way at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main reason I got it was to help fight bad breath, which it does an excellent job of...no comparison compared to using a toothbrush or even a metal spoon to clean your tongue!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a health food store expecting it to be better then the plastic ones I had in the past.Nope wasted a few dollars.I dont like the metal at all.Holding the handles are wabble wabble.Im going back to the sturdy plastic one.</li>
    <li> Does what it supposed to do.....just what the dentist ordered!</li>
    <li> Agree with other reviewers, this is way better than the plastic ones and seems to stay cleaner with a hot water rinse after each use.  I got blue handles, but would have liked the pink!  Don&#x27;t get to choose.</li>
    <li> They say most bad breath actually comes from bacteria on your tongue. Get rid of all that with Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner. This is a simple but effective product for good oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> The stainless steel is the best.  It&#x27;s easy on your tongue but cleans it very well!</li>
    <li> I used a plastic instrument, and somebody recoment this new one, it is very good, I love it!  The best! try it!</li>
    <li> I was always self-conscience about the smell of my breath. I often wondered whether it is good or bad and i always seem to think it is bad no matter how many times I brush my teeth. I bought this tongue cleaner to give it a shot and see if it helps. The very first time I used it, I was totally disgusted by what this thing was able to scrape off of my tongue. It looked slimy and really gross. After few uses, this slimy stuff started to decrease and now (after about 6 months or so of using it), I barely notice anything being scrapped off. I used few other tongue cleaners (including my toothbrush), but I always end up gagging. This thing can go as as my tonsils and it won&#x27;t bother me much, although you shouldn&#x27;t jam it that far. They say the bacteria that causes bad breath comes a lot from your tongue, so buying this little thing really helps you have fresher breath. Of course, you have to brush your teeth regularly, floss, and use mouth wash.   Final verdict: I think this thing really works. It is cheap and it will improve your breath. I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I read a lot about this tongue cleaner and I was a little skeptical at first but when i first used it, it really showed me how I really needed one of these in my life, my breath has improved, I no longer have an uncomfortable sensation in my throat when i wake up and my mouth feels clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use it as directed and you&#x27;ll see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Give this thing a try!&lt;br /&gt;It worked for me.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush works better. This is too rough.</li>
    <li> I can only give this product four stars because the best tongue scrapers are made of pure silver. Silver is antimicrobial and antibacterial and will give an added boost to a tongue scraper. That said, this is the basic model you want to go with. Narrower tongue scrapers can activate the gag reflex. Don&#x27;t even try cleaning your tongue with a toothbrush, even one that says it has a tongue cleaner. It&#x27;s just like sticking two fingers down the back of your throat and will produce the same result. This scraper has handles for easy control. The wide, flexible design allows you to scrape your whole tongue without gagging. The stainless steel will last forever. And it&#x27;s a good price. Just hold onto the handles, put the tip on the back of your tongue, and scrape a couple of times. You won&#x27;t believe how much better your mouth feels, or how much longer your breath stays fresh. Do it regularly, every time you brush, and you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever thought your mouth was clean without it.</li>
    <li> We just purchased two tongue cleaners and they work pretty well.  The handles are padded/comfortable to grip and you can bend them in or out to adjust them to your tongue.  I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
    <li> very effective and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> very good, I love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know what a tongue scraper was until about a day before I bought this.  I had a disgusting taste in my mouth that made me gag and it was to the point that even my favorite foods tasted disgusting to me.  I didn&#x27;t know what was going on, and brushing my teeth (and using the toothbrush on my tongue) frequently didn&#x27;t seem to help.  My doctor recommended this tongue scraper.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so I&#x27;m glad it was stocked at Amazon.  It&#x27;s a little gross to see what it takes off your tongue!  However, it definitely works.  If I haven&#x27;t used it for a few days, I start to notice the gross taste again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I had been using mouthwash and my doctor mentioned that this can actually make the problem worse, and that the best defense is to drink a lot of water, brush your teeth frequently, and use the tongue scraper.</li>
    <li> This is an easy product to work with and comfortable to hold. If you haven&#x27;t used a tongue scraper before - go for it!  I take about seven light strokes, to work from the back of the tongue to the front and then repeat 3 or 4 times more. It&#x27;s very quick and easy to do. I can really feel the difference. I also recently started using a neti pot too, as I&#x27;d been fighting a minor sore throat/sinus infection for a while. My morning routine: is to splash cold water on my face seven times, then brush my teeth, scrape my tongue and rinse the dust from my nose - and Boy... Do I feel clean, watered, healthy and wide awake in no time at all! Wish I&#x27;d started this routine years ago, it&#x27;s fun - I actually look forward to getting out of bed these days.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product prior to purchase. I love it! Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This simple tongue works wonders! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it extremely well. You will be amazed at the gunk that it pulls off your tongue the first time you use it. It is so much more effective than using your toothbrush bristles or those toothbrushes with the tongue cleaners on the back of the head. It will also help to get rid of or prevent bad breath. You&#x27;d be amazed at all the bacteria that gathers on the back of the tongue and that is a main source for bad breath. Get rid of the gunk, get ride of the stinky breath. Trust me, it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have had plastic tongue cleaners and recently I had a brush tongue cleaner which was like a toothbrush but with a wider brush to cover the area of the tongue.  Well this Dr. Tung&#x27;s is the KING and at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I threw away all of the others and just love this tongue cleaner!  The cleaner is metal and the shape makes it easy to use and clean.  You really see all of the grim just wipe away off your tongue.  I can reach farther back with this cleaner too and there is hardly any gag reflex.  The quality of the tongue cleaner is top notch with nice firm rubber handles and the metal &#x27;U&#x27; shaped cleaner.  Near the bend in the &#x27;U&#x27; shape it is thicker to compensate for the shape of the tongue - very effective. Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong - price and usability which is what matter most in a product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Keeps my tongue nice and clean!</li>
    <li> I got this tongue cleaner because I was tired of cheap plastic ones, and it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gets all the gunk off of your tongue and keeps it super clean.  Get it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why this has such good reviews. For one thing, it doesn&#x27;t even work that well. Sure, it cleans your tongue a little bit, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t remove all the white stuff no matter how hard you scrape, and a toothbrush would work just as well. Plus, it hurts, and even made my tongue bleed a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There simply is no reason to buy this thing. Just get a toothbrush with bumps on the back and use that to clean your tongue. Just as effective and far less painful.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and effective</li>
    <li> Get your grossness scraped.  I had no idea!  Great tool for cleaner tongue.</li>
    <li> I learned about this item watching The Tyra Show. I already had a plastic motorized tongue scraper. This one will amaze you when you see how much more gunk it removes from your tongue. (It also may kinda gross you out.) But it is well worth the money. Anything that makes you more kissable is a great investment. ;-)</li>
    <li> I have tried many many different types of tongue scrapers over the years. Some break as soon as you apply a bit of presure.&lt;br /&gt;Some make you gag, some don&#x27;t scrape properly , no matter now hard you press, some have an edge thats just too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Well Dr tungs is by far the best tongue scraper I have ever used. No question. I was able to remove all the gunk from all the way back on my tongue. It is steel, so no breaking, the scraping edge is just right for your tonge, and you can use one hand or two. No gag reflex as you don&#x27;t have to open your mouth too wide to get right back, and it cleans nicely under hot water after use, being stainless steel. Do yourself a favour, and try this scraper.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner, works as must be and doesn&#x27;t get black. 3 times per day and tongue is almost shiny!&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, i didn&#x27;t get the color i wanted.</li>
    <li> bought this for my 8 yr old who gags every time i brush his tounge, making it difficult to clean well. he scrapes his own tounge and has had no bad breath since we started using this. it does not make him gag and does not hurt him at all. very easy to use, very effective. I love it!</li>
    <li> This works great and is super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s over-priced for a piece of stainless steel &amp; plastic... but I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I have had many cleaners but after a while the plastic smells no matter what you do.  This metal one not only works better and gets your tongue cleaner but is easy clean and no smell.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this. It&#x27;s a bit shorter than I am used to having switched from plastic tongue cleaners. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and am very happy with it! It&#x27;s easy to use with one hand. I haven&#x27;t had any comfort issues with it when using it. I also like that it is easier to clean than the plastic models. Now that I am used to it, I will be sticking with this brand the next time I have to replace it.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Hard to recommend. If it was free...</li>
    <li> So easy to use. The first time I scrapped my toung, I was amazed of all the bacteria and debri landed in the skin. This tounge scraper cleans wonderful.</li>
    <li> Wow, read about how important it is to clean your tongue, especially in the morning. This is such an awesome little gadget to have. I love using it. It feels good and works amazing. I have boughten the plastic ones that almost look like a toothbrush, such a waste... this is the item to get. Also the Stainless Steel just feels so much better on your tongue. Research.... super interesting and educational and necessary.</li>
    <li> This thing hung on a peg in my bathroom for a couple of years.  The plastic handles discolored and developed cracks and droplets of some kind of clear liquid slowly oozed from them, eventually dripping off.  Now, I have no idea what the liquid was, but it certainly seems the plastic was decomposing.  Regardless, is that something you want near your mouth and even in it?  Sorry, but this piece of junk deserves zero stars, if that were possible.</li>
    <li> If you have white bacteria on your tongue or bad breath, do yourself a favor, buy this. It will take a few uses over a period of time, but eventually you will have a clean pretty pink tongue. Works so much better than a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews thinking it will work better than the brush kind I already own, but it does not. The other one is far superior so I stopped using this.</li>
    <li> The first time you use this it will be terrifying and sickening. You will not believe what comes off. I highly recommend keeping this in the shower as it allows for easy cleaning as you are scraping. It is much better than a spoon since the edges are a tad sharper and you have a lot more control.</li>
    <li> Good quality, metal is wide enough and heavy enough to get the job done.  Handle flexibility is great.  I will be ordering another one just for travel.</li>
    <li> Wow! I did not know there were a lot of stuff in my tongue. Why didn&#x27;t I know about this product earlier? Improved my oral health and my self-esteem.</li>
    <li> I just recently replaced my Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner, the one I had gave way after more than a decade of use. It&#x27;s inexpensive, and does what it is intended for very well. It cleans much better than the plastic round versions, and does a much more thorough job than a toothbrush. This is just a really great product.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own one</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I always brush my tongue with my toothbrush when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth, so I didn&#x27;t really think a scraper would do much more. But I decided to try it anyway and I&#x27;m so glad I did. After brushing my teeth and my tongue, I used the scraper the way the directions tell you to. I was surprised to see a &#x27;string&#x27; of gooey film like substance come off of my tongue! Ewww! Now I know that simply brushing my tongue does NOT work that well! I use this scraper after brushing and before my mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Love this thing great buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scraper for about 4 months.  It&#x27;s is good at scraping my tongue and not so thin that you would cut your fingers.  The grips are great.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> It does what it is made to do.</li>
    <li> My tongue has never been so clean.  Feels like my breath is fresher.  The scraping does irritate my tongue though, so I&#x27;m trying to learn to go easier on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eating healthy and working out regularly. My weight stayed the same. But as soon as I bought Naturewise green coffe bean the weight decreased. I was astonished how powerful this stuff is!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Mouth feels much cleaner afterwards.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Works well</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner! A lot better than the ones at grocery stores. The items came quickly and the customer service I received was great! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do.  I initially didn&#x27;t like the handle, but used to it now.</li>
    <li> I thought my plastic tongue cleaner did a great job, but this works so much better!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this little piece of metal is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me go back...&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I was constantly getting sick(combination of weak immune system and allergies).  Upon taking an allergy test in high school, my doctor said to me: &amp;#34;...it would be easier for me to tell you what you are NOT allergic to&amp;#34;.  Post nasal drip and sinus drainage were simply a way of life for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brush morning and night, floss my teeth every night and brush my tongue twice a day.  My tongue has always had a white film on it.  I knew I had bad breath.  I could smell it when I smelled the silverware or floss that I used--so I have always been paranoid talking to people.  I then read some articles a few days ago that explained how completely useless brushing your tongue with a toothbrush is(really, a half step above using mouthwash expecting to clean your tongue).  So I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scraper came in last night and I used it.  I spent thirty minutes scraping off everything that had been on my tongue for who know how long.  To say it was gross is an understatement.  My breath has since smelled, my mouth is no longer dry and I slept great last night.  No morning congestion or &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, by this--you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This tongue scraper is amazing at getting all the food debris off and allowing your tongue to breathe again. I haven&#x27;t noticed stronger favors from food as some have said, but its definitely a clean feeling!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this scraper.  I&#x27;ve owned and broken many plastic ones, but this one is incredibly durable and much more effective than its thick, plastic counterparts.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> I bought two tongue cleaners at the same time to see which one I liked most.  I must say this one is by far better than the platic one I bought.  For the price you cannot go wrong and it really does a good job at cleaning your tongue.</li>
    <li> Good quality product that actually works. I would love it if you could hang it on a standard toothbrush rack because I&#x27;m not a fan of storing it flat on any of my bathroom surfaces, but that isn&#x27;t really a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> You would be blown away at the amount of gunk on your tongue. It took me about 15 minutes to clean my tongue thoroughly the first time using this product, but once I got it all off, a perfectly pink tongue was revealed. I use it every other day now and what accumulates on your tongue in those two days is still crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some people say not to be too rough with it, but in my own experience that is the only way I could truly clean my tongue. The first couple times it might hurt a bit, I still have VERY slight blood from the back of my tongue(almost non-existent but there is a very small amount), but because I was somewhat rough with it, my tongue became almost perfectly clean. This product is great with its effectiveness, and durability.</li>
    <li> Healty mouth is vital for your life and this is one of it is kind, easy, working well, necessary tool to make it happen.</li>
    <li> I wanted to point out that on this package it says &amp;#34;lasts for years&amp;#34;, mine did not even last for one! Five months to be exact. I bought mine &amp; was happy with it until it broke in half! I am very disappointed with the false advertisement &amp; won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
    <li> Never thought a tongue scraper would improve things so much! yep, my tongue is a lot pinker and cleaner looking and&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m sure it improves my breath as well (a long with proper brushing and mouthwashes of course).&lt;br /&gt;no problems so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before, but I love it. I have noticed a reduction in bad breath. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I never used a tongue scraper before. I always used the toothbrush to clean my tongue and I thought that&#x27;s good enough until I used this one.   This one is a must have, cleans very well and looks durable.  Be sure to use gently since its easy to overuse and damage your tongue.</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing testimonials from friends on the wonders of tongue scraping. I can tell a huge difference when I use the stainless steel tongue cleaner versus trying to scrape my tongue with a toothbrush. The stainless steel cleaner works MUCH better than just using an ordinary toothbrush. Perhaps the biggest benefit is that I can clean farther back on my tongue with the metal cleaner without making myself gag, which happens a lot when trying to do it with a toothbrush. It cleans off with a quick rinse and I can feel a difference in my mouth for several hours after using the tongue scraper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the best.  Nothing more to say about the scraper.  They last a long time and my whole family uses them.</li>
    <li> Happy with my new tongue cleaner. It gently scrapes bacteria off my tongue without me choking like when I used my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I get this style of tongue scraper (he didn&#x27;t recommend any particular brand) so I bought this one and I have been really happy with it.  I was already brushing twice a day, flossing most nights, and using  mouthwash but I still had a furry tongue sometimes and occasional bad breath (like bad enough that I could actually tell) Using it adds just a few seconds to my daily routine, and it&#x27;s amazing how much gunk comes off of your tongue.  My breath has been fine, and I hardly ever have that icky gunk-mouth feeling anymore, even when I first wake up in the morning.  I have been using it for several months now and the handles are still on tight, and since the metal flexes a bit, I now have it shaped so that it fits my mouth perfectly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this due to an news article (or news plug) about potential need for scraper and not just toothbrush.  For people who does not routinely brush their tongues and have alot of accumulation on their tongues, the scraper may be useful.  I did not find it more effective than my toothbrush, but then I brush my tongue daily and have no accumulation on my tongue.  If you brush frequently, you may want to save your money and not purchase this.</li>
    <li> a great tool for tongue cleaning.  much easier to use than tongue brush or other implements.  does a great job and easy to clean after use.</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve ever come across.  However, I wish the handles were not plastic/rubber.  With the pressure of normal use, eventually the edge of the scraper wears through the handles.  Granted, it takes a few years for this wearing through to occur, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a waste of money with regular replacements, but I&#x27;d really rather not be throwing away the old one to purchase a new one due to this flaw.  Landfill material, when it could easily be made with solid stainless construction to last a lifetime and longer.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described it seems built sturdy and it does the job well. The seller shipped promptly, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Want to know why your mouth stinks? Clean your tongue. You will be amazed of the crap on your tongue.</li>
    <li> Simple. No gagging. Works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish everyone used one. The world would be a better place. Really, it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;Huntington Beach, CA.</li>
    <li> This little tool works wonders.  Just a couple passes from the back to the front of your tongue and you have fresh breath for the remainder of the day!</li>
    <li> Got this tongue cleaner for my husband and he&#x27;s very pleased with it. He says it works great. It&#x27;s a must-have for all those with whitish tongues and bad breath!</li>
    <li> everyone should have one of these</li>
    <li> I had assumed that my tongue was normal looking. I mean, I brushed it every day and even used a little plastic scraper now and then, so that whiteish stuff on it just had to be normal, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ew. No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my tongue pierced recently, and afterwards was looking at tons of pictures of other people&#x27;s piercings. I slowly began to notice that they all had nice, pink, healthy-looking tongues compared to my whitish, dull one. And now I had a piercing to draw attention to it! Gah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best tongue cleaner out there, imo. The plastic ones or a toothbrush just aren&#x27;t firm enough to really scrape the nastiness away. Dr Tungs is made out of stainless steel, so it really scrapes the gunk away. Trust me, you&#x27;ll be amazed/horrified the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice: after reading other reviews, I kind of thought I should just keep scraping and scraping away in one session. Bad. I had to actually to take a break for a couple of days because I irritated it so much. It&#x27;s better to just run it over your tongue a few times twice a day. Trust me, gunk will be coming off and after a few days--tops--you should see results. My tongue looks so much healthier now! It&#x27;s a little annoying with the piercing, but I just sort of go around it, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about this product is that, being stainless steel, it&#x27;s easy to sterilize.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with deep skepticism because I was more familiar with the plastic type, rather than stainless steel.  I am sold.  I do maintain a dental schedule with my dentist for the purpose of achieving good oral hygiene.  However, sitting in the dentist chair as everyone is well aware, can be excruciatingly painful during the performance of oral work, not to mention expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that regular flossing, brushing, and using a good tongue cleaner like this one conveniently translate to cheap insurance.  As noted previously, I&#x27;m accustomed to the plastic ones, but Dr. Tung&#x27;s is the real deal - no disappointment here.  It optimizes my oral hygiene regimen by destroying bacteria colony, in addition to removing the plaque and fungi buildup, all of which contribute to bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to get carried away while using this oral device as a result of its effectiveness.  I do have to frequently remind myself that it is a steel instrument which demands slow, gentle strokes in an effort to avoid cracks on my tongue that resemble a route on a road map. I have thrown out the plastic devices since my new discovery.</li>
    <li> ..Yeah this isn&#x27;t really that good. When it was shipped the packaging was open and it also isn&#x27;t very sharp. It&#x27;s sort of got the width of a typical spoon and scrapes like a spoon. I&#x27;d say find another &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> It feels great having a nice pink and cleaned tongue &#x3D;p. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Just make sure to not press it too hard against your tongue and you&#x27;ll be alright.</li>
    <li> First time ever using a tongue cleaner and this one is great!  I like that it gets all across the top and sides of the tongue with one swipe down, saw most others weren&#x27;t as wide.  I like to run this over my tongue 4 or 5 times to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An amazing benefit that I didn&#x27;t really think about, I have a better sense of taste; makes sense though, when you get all that gunk off your tongue the food can get to your taste buds easier. I liked it so well, I got a second one for my husband and he is as big a fan as I am.  Great product.</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this, I was in disbelief. I&#x27;ve tried those plastic tongue cleaners that you can get at my local drug store and I hated those things! My tongue felt weird for a bit, and I thought my breath was super fresh; that is, until I went to a party and found out that my breath smelled funny, despite me not eating or drinking anything prior. I even tried all those breath mints and sprays, but, they only taste good, not make my breath fresher, or even make food taste better. After taking various products, I quit.  For a while, I just lived with it, that is, until I heard about this from a friend so, I looked it up on Google.com, and found it on Amazon.com. When I first read the description, I rolled my eyes. I thought it was either some kind of scam, or like using a razor to shave without water, soap, or shaving cream! But, my curiosity got the better of me, and I finally ordered it.   When I finally got the tongue cleaner, I went to the bathroom, read the instructions, and used it. This is where things became different. The sight of the gunk on my tongue was similar to mucus. I was disgusted, for sure about that. Then, I tried some different foods/beverages after using this product, and, I was astonished by what I tasted.   I had:   -Water  -Milk  -Soy beans  -Tofu  -Soy milk  -Brie  -Chicken karahi  -Apples  -Bananas  -Durian  -Jackfruit  -Coconut  -Ginger juice  -Oranges  and a bunch of other foods, and the taste was different. It tasted a lot better than before. I never knew what tap water really tasted like until I used this product (tasted chlorine, fluoride, and oddly enough, salt). Bananas tasted fresher than before. Chicken Karahi was much spicier than ever (also tasted a hint of turmeric, to my surprise), milk tasted better (tasted sweet), and even those ice breath mints were better tasting (like a surge of minty ice flooding my taste buds for a few minutes, which was addicting considering that people said my breath smelled minty fresh and better than their house sprays...sweet!)  Overall, I highly recommend this product. Plus, my girlfriend says I&#x27;m more kissable on the lips!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what so magical about this but it works. My breath is much fresher then before. This tool kills germs effectively! Was skeptical at time of purchase but I&#x27;m no longer a skeptic. Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought foul breath was caused by a cavity or emanating from my stomach but it was the tongue even though it visually looked clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered a bunch more for friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love it. It feels very sturdy and gets the job done very well.</li>
    <li> surprisingly this product did better than I thought it would.  I purchased one and liked it so much that I ordered another for my husband.  I love that its stainless steel</li>
    <li> I have been an avid Amazon shopper for years. Never once have I (selfishly) written a review for a product. After purchasing this simple tongue scraper, tonight I am ending that streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before today, my tongue had (unknowingly) never seen the light of day. That&#x27;s right. For YEARS, my tongue had been a whiteish-covered organ. It was more white-covered than pink. It looked like it had been born permanently stained with streaks of vanilla ice cream  (as long as I can remember).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was just born \\&quot;different\\&quot;. But deep down, I secretly envied the wet, pink, glistening tongues of others. Over the years and with countless attempts of desperation, I scrubbed and scrubbed my tongue with the fronts and backs of toothbrushes, all to no avail. I resigned myself that I would always be a freak, I would always be the outcast with a white-splotched tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I skeptically opened the tongue cleaner and went into the bathroom. Sure, I had read all of the other ecstatic reviews, but I was different. Momma didn&#x27;t raise a boy with no pink tongue, no sir, and there was no way it would change now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost chuckled at the absurdity of even trying this, as I raised the scraper into my mouth. \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been through this so many times, so many years...\\&quot;, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened my mouth and rested the scraper at the back of my tongue, giving myself one last look, almost as if to say \\&quot;It&#x27;s ok Stewart, one day others will judge you not by the color of your tongue but by the flavor of your breath.\\&quot; But then I remembered that my breath was probably caused by my tongue, and cried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shook my head as I looked at myself, giving me lonesome one last sorrowful look, trying to let myself down easy... and started scraping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I pulled the gentle scraper down across my tongue, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What is that??\\&quot; I asked myself. It continued piling up on the scraper, I dare not describe its feature. More and more, it continued to pile up... Was not my tongue in its barren and dry state just a moment ago? Wherefore doth this infernal material spring forth from? What manner of sorcery does this device command?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper rolled off my tongue, my eyes following it down the mirror as I lowered it to the sink, washing off what I thought must have been residual dragon saliva, hiding in the nether caves of my taste budduals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked back up to the mirror, into the nefarious cave of the mouthlock, the home of the white wildebeast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What is this.... Are not my eyes deceiving me?? Dothfore I not see a pinkish-red plain that was therefore not there before???!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT. I HAD FINALLY UNCOVERED WHAT MY SOUL HAS CRIED FOR FOR YEARS -- A PINKISH-RED TONGUE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was freaking out of my mind. I put the scraper back in and started scraping like a bug-eyed Californian goldminer in 1848, giggling gleefully as I hopped up and down with childish delight. Scrape, scrape, scrape -- the sins of my tongue coming off with each gentle scrape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably scraped for almost five minutes. When I finally cleared it all, I stood there in front of the mirror with my big ol&#x27; tongue hanging out like Lassie&#x27;s on a hot summer day. I was laughing and shaking my head, watching that big beautiful pink tongue that had shamed me for so many years laugh and play in his pinkish-red wonderland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m going a bit overboard here. But I just can&#x27;t get enough -- I have literally been going into the bathroom JUST to unfurl my tongue before the mirror so I can admire it, like rolling out the red carpet to Nirvana, watching it sway back and forth like the pendulum of the divine, with myself still wide-eyed and wondrous of the miracle of Dr Tung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m anxious for tomorrow, when I&#x27;ll surely be over-zealous in showing off my new \\&quot;look\\&quot; to others. I even catch myself pondering how I can garner as much exposure time for my new \\&quot;pride\\&quot; as possible. I have visions of me jumping up on my coworkers desks and rolling out my best \\&quot;Gene Simmons\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then imagine my colleagues leaning over to each others&#x27; cubicles, whispering their shocked surprise -- \\&quot;Goodness gracious, have you seen Stewart today? Something&#x27;s different about him... Something&#x27;s different, alright, and whatever it is, I LIKE IT.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Short version]: BUY THIS SCRAPER. It will take years off your tongue and add them back upon your life.ch exposure time for my new \\&quot;pride\\&quot; as possible.

    <li> This is the best tongue cleaner I have ever used! Much better than the plastic one I have always used from WalMart and other drugstores. It cleans your tongue much better. I even like it better than using my toothbrush. Be careful not to apply too much pressure when scraping, because it will cause a little soreness and mild bleeding of your taste buds. That was my fault however. If used properly, you shouldn&#x27;t have that issue. This cleaner is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Easy and fast.</li>
    <li> Great seller, fast shipping and high quality product.  This product will last a long time and is durable.  It is quite effective and easy to clean after each use.</li>
    <li> After years of using plastic/rubber scrapers I switched to this and would not go back as it does such a better job. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great and does what it needs to.  I feel like my breath is much better than it used to be and I don&#x27;t have to constantly have a mint or gum in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Best tongue scraper I have ever used. It is absolutely insane how much dirt and bacteria is on your tongue. After using this your tongue feels fresher and cleaner then ever.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, personally I have a very strong gag reflex which prevents me from cleaning my tongue with a toothbrush, but the tongue cleaner goes across easily. The product seems sturdy so I doubt I&#x27;ll have to buy another one for a while.</li>
    <li> I have 4 cleaners. Every cleaner I&#x27;ve purchased after my first was purchased because I found a better one. The first three were plastic and this is my first stainless steel one. The only thing about having a tongue cleaner and having a pink tongue is that you suddenly realize whenever someone else has a white-coated tongue. And the whole time their talking, you just wanna wipe out your tongue cleaner and take care of it for them. They would get to keep it, of course. Everyone walks away happy. lol. Aaaaaanywhooooo, here&#x27;s the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s I found between this new one and the old plastic one&#x27;s I have.  Pros:  1. The fact that the stainless steel on this one is thin and flexible means you can grab it with one hand (like the others) and squeeze the handles until the curve fits the width of your tongue, allowing you to scrape down and getting almost everything off in one swipe (the very sides of your tongue will still contain saliva and therefore the other stuff you didn&#x27;t want there (I&#x27;ll keep it vague to prevent any \\&quot;ewww\\&quot; reactions, hopefully). This way you still have to make two extra swipes to get it off. One on the left and the other on the right.  2. The same product feature listed above allows two hands to be used, which allows for better control, which also allows for almost all the saliva to be collected in one swipe down. Takes a little practice, but after the 10th tongue cleaning, I had it down-pact.  3. The stainless steel is straight and flat. Most other have angles that allow calcium, etc. to collect within the angles, making for a gross 3 minutes when you have to get a Q-tip and remove the gunk from there.  4. The stainless steel is more hygienic than plastic ones.  5. The current price (as of 01/24/12). So long as the shipping stays free, this will remain an excellent buy.  Cons:  1. Takes up more space than the other plastic ones which are straight, allowing it to be packed easily with other items that are straight as well (speaking of the plastic ones, right now).  2. The stainless steel is a bit too thin. This allows it to be bent a little out of its shape, if you&#x27;re not too careful with it. I can imagine someone trying to bend it and fix the shape to the way it was before, only to have  it bent even worse. So long as you don&#x27;t get crazy trying to get it exactly into the perfect shape for the width of your tongue, it should be fine. After I saw how easily it bent, I quickly gave up trying to make the width absolutely perfect for my tongue.  I didn&#x27;t feel these cons warranted me reducing the rating, since the strength of any one pro over-weighed both the cons for me.  An additional consideration:  It is a thin and flat piece of stainless steel. If you go overboard like I do (working on it) with trying to get your tongue pink completely pink, you may end up making the circumvallate papillae bleed (had to google this one). It&#x27;s the arrow shaped row of big bumps near the back of your tongue. With the plastic ones, this barely happened. I found out it was unnecessary to scrape as hard, as only 1/2 the pressure I used with the plastic ones did the job of taking whatever was on my tongue off.  Great product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t something new.  Steel toungue scrapers are a daily part of hygiene in the indian culture.  If you live in a community that has an indian grocery store, go in and ask for this.  It will be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. This is way better than the regular plastic tounge scraper! NO GAG MORE CLEAN!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but this truly does work. You can even taste the difference! It is a bit disgusting, but that&#x27;s how you can tell it&#x27;s working. Don&#x27;t get too enthusiastic though, you might hurt yourself. Scrape your tongue lightly, you only need little to no pressure to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This simply-designed apparatus works well.  It quickly and easily cleans your tongue for that extra security against bad breath.  I was pleased that this company made a special effort to re-ship this item quickly since the first shipment was returned due to an address change.</li>
    <li> everyone should use these. they work great and help cut down on bad breath. i was very thankful that mine had blue handles when they arrived, not pink like the picture... whew! That would have been embarrassing. I mean, PINK.. can you imagine?</li>
    <li> I have had this for at least 2 years and I&#x27;ve kiss my bad breath away.</li>
    <li> It was a waste of money.  Nothing on my tongue came off like reviews said.  I would not have wasted my money if I had known, but I wanted to try it.</li>
    <li> After reading the good reviews, I decided to try out this tongue cleaner, instead of the plastic ones that I have been so accustomed to over the years. Well, I wish I just ordered a regular plastic one, because for one, the item did not ship until three weeks after placing my order, so I did not receive it for over two weeks after the expected arrival date. That&#x27;s a long time to go around with bad breath. But more importantly, the product quality is not very good. It is messy and difficult to rinse off, clean, and store. I much rather prefer the plastic kind that can fit in a cup or a toothbrush slot.</li>
    <li> Keeps bad breathe down, and leaves you with a fresh taste when combined with mouthwash and daily teeth brushing. Great for getting that taste out after meals and mornings. You will be surprised at all the gunk that comes off this bad boy. Worth the price, however you could probably find one at a CVS or similar store for much cheaper. But I&#x27;m lazy, so this works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sharp, but it definitely hurts a little bit to press a steel tongue cleaner hard down onto your tongue for scraping. It works well, I like it a lot. The handles are fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my oral health since I quit smoking.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it removes a lot more from the tongue than just brushing can do and even waking up in the morning I was surprised as to how clean my breath was. The tongue holds a lot of things that a brush doesn&#x27;t remove but this does. I Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast, cleans the tongue very well and very easy to use.  Use is all the time and keeps my mouth fresh and my tongue very clean.  Follow it up with the Tung cleaner brush and gel to get it extra clean.</li>
    <li> I saw an ad for Orabrush and was going to check it out, but I saw that Dr. Tung&#x27;s had higher reviews here on Amazon.  I have used this tongue cleaner for about a week and it most definitely works!  This thing is WAY better than the rubber one I have been using from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Much much better than traditional platic tounge scrapers</li>
    <li> I HATE this product. It&#x27;s far too ridged and cuts my tongue constantly. Great packaging and convincing claims, but the darn thing hurts and makes my tongue bleed. Stay away, ouch!</li>
    <li> I have entered into a new era of oral hygiene with this product. I&#x27;ve always brushed by tongue each time I brush my teeth but I couldn&#x27;t help but feel that it was a futile attempt at controlling the growing white carpet on my tongue. Enter cheap plastic tongue scrapers. They were clunky, broke easily, and produced minimal results. Soon, I gave up and returned to my tongue brushing. Then I spotted this product. It arrived and I immediately tried it out. The design makes it easy to reach the back of the tongue with minimal gagging. The first scrape produced particularly nasty results on the metal tool. After the first pass, you get diminishing returns. Two or three swipes is all it takes to have a clean tongue.  Pro-tip: turn the water to hot when you start scraping. The hot water will dissolve the nastiness from the blade much more readily than cold.</li>
    <li> Well made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I removed an alarming amount of mucous type saliva from my tongue. It took 5 scrapes to get it all off. I had no idea all this build up was there, I was disgusted. Every night since then I have only had sort of thin foamy saliva that is completely gone after the first scrape. What a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Best tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve purchased!  Stainless steel  &amp;#62; plastic</li>
    <li> Of the two products I tried, this one worked by far the best.  You need something slender like this to not cause a gag response.  It is easy to use &amp; the earlier review indicating that this product was too rough, or hurt the tongue, did not apply to me.  I had no problem adjusting the level of pressure on the tongue so that it was very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the first tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m impressed by how effective it is for improving bad breath.  The quality is excellent; it&#x27;s solid and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and it has retained its shape perfectly.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1298572P7ENSZ]]</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the negative reviews and am completely shocked at how silly they are. A tootbrush is NOT an adequate cleaning utensil for the tongue, unless you have some kind of magical tongue, and I am more prone to bleeding from a toothbrush than a tongue scraping utensil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a plastic tongue scraper and switched to this steel type to see the difference. I can only use it every other day as the scraping is pretty sharp and one cleaning can last me over 24 hrs. You have to be precise &amp; careful, don&#x27;t just slam and pull recklessly as you may very well cut your tongue. The meaty center-back portion of the tongue is the hardest for me to clean and regardless of the methods I have tried over the years, I have never managed to acquire a perfectly rose-pink texture back there. There is always a little bit of faded white film stuck to that tongue area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it only takes a minute or two of swiping and then a quick swig of mouthrinse and you have as clean a tongue as you can possibly get given current hygiene technology. I definitely noticed the difference in my breath and the general feel in my mouth after the first use. I&#x27;m sure someone could invent something even more precise than this, but currently this is the best tool on the market.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised although it can be a tad messy - it pulls everything off your tongue (including saliva) so keep over the sink.  It&#x27;s a bit more gentle than [[ASIN:B00005BAWO Dr. Wieder&#x27;s Original Tung-Brush]] (which I also own).  The bristles on the Tung-Brush can draw blood pretty easily if over-used while this doesn&#x27;t really have any sharp edges to speak of.  There&#x27;s no serious gagging issues with this product either -- it&#x27;s certainly better than trying to use your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> glad I bought two - one to keep in the travel bag.   It&#x27;s so much better than the plastic ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.    Feels better on my tongue, and handle doesn&#x27;t break!  shipping was fast too.    thanks</li>
    <li> It hurts to use. It&#x27;s also hard to get to the back of the tongue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these and it worked great.  I think that everyone should have one of these in their bathroom and it should be used daily.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because it did what it was supposed to do which was clean my tongue, I noticed after a use my bad breath was almost gone.</li>
    <li> Like most of the reviews this will most likely be pretty nasty but its a review of something that cleans your tongue! I drink way too much soda and after a while it starts to build up at the very back of my tongue. It feels really gross so I decided I needed to do something about it! I felt like this was a cheap enough solution and decided to try it out and it gets the job done great. It takes some getting used to but once you get it down you will really notice the difference it can make. Its cheap and it does what its supposed to so you should buy this if your looking to have a clean tongue.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner is amazing! After chemo treatments and tons of medication, my tongue has been affected. My tongue holds on to food colors and tastes, which makes my mouth feel unclean. I was brushing my teeth over 3 times a day to try and clean my mouth. I decided to try out a tongue cleaner, and boy am I happy. This gets off all the gunk and color that sticks on my tongue. Just using it makes my mouth feel so much cleaner. Extremely happy I found this product, absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Okay, I have always had a bit of a problem with bad breath.  For several years I would combat my halitosis by brushing my tongue each time I brushed my teeth (each morning and night), but I was still having noticeable issues.  Anyway, I gave this tongue cleaner a try and I can&#x27;t believe the difference!  It&#x27;s very easy and quick to use right after brushing my teeth, and not only does it help get rid of bad breath, it actually helps prevent it as well!  I used to wake up each morning with terrible (and I mean make the wallpaper peel terrible) morning breath, but since I&#x27;ve started using this I&#x27;ve been amazed how un-stinky my breath is almost every single morning!  I highly recommend this product for anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> This thing kind of leaves my tongue raw... but my breath doesn&#x27;t reek... so you take the good with the bad.</li>
    <li> works really well, my breath has improved and my mouth feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it said it should do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used disposable plastic tongue scrapes off and on in the past, and while they work alright, they usually leave my tongue slightly bloodied and sore. I ordered this from Amazon recently and haven&#x27;t looked back since. It&#x27;s quicker, as it covers the entire width of the tongue at once, and still manages to clean without tearing my tastebuds into a bloody mess. A must for dental hygiene!</li>
    <li> Received this product in the mail yesterday and I&#x27;ve used it twice now. The first time it seemed to do a good job getting rid of any white stuff on my tongue but that night when I used it a second time I had cut my tongue in a few places. I&#x27;m not sure if this was from raised taste buds or because I applied too much pressure. This product seems to do a good job and helps prevent gagging but just make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much force when using it.</li>
    <li> My expectations were met which this tongue scraper. It doesn&#x27;t hurt like the cheap tongue scrapers out there. There&#x27;s nothing much to say, it does it job and well at that.</li>
    <li> This is one of those devices that most people think they can do without. You know, ya&#x27; say, \\&quot;I brush, I floss, what more do you want?\\&quot; Well let me tell you, you need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people who brushes, gargles with Listerine, flosses and uses a Sonicare at least twice daily, but was always gagging when brushing my tongue. This little device not only works wonders in scraping the white residue that collects on the tongue, but it also doesn&#x27;t affect my gag reflex, so I can really get to the back of my tongue for a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be amazed by the amount of residue still remaining on your tongue after you brush that you weren&#x27;t aware of. As you scrape with this, you will visibly see the excess gunk coming off your tongue. (Not to gross anyone out...) I can actually tell a difference with how foods taste and smell after using this for a few days. This works so much better than those cheap plastic ones at the drug store and is so sturdy, it&#x27;ll last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, try it. You&#x27;ll be hooked. It&#x27;s so quick and easy to use and you&#x27;ll never have bad breath or an icky tongue again. Those who kiss you will thank you and those who don&#x27;t may start...;8^)</li>
    <li> At first, I found that this device cause scraping pains and was not as effective as a traditional spoon-shaped scraper. After altering my technique, and changing the arc of my tongue, I found this device to be far superior to any brush or spoon-shaped scraper I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can clean further back onto my tongue, and around the sides of my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and to travel with too. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just got this a couple of days ago.  The stainless steel seems to be of very high quality, it is sturdy and the handles are ergonomically designed.  This isn&#x27;t a space ship, so as far as tongue cleaners go, I think this is the best out there.  I tried the BreathRx tongue cleaner just a couple of weeks ago and was disappointed. It was low grade plastic and was too flimsy and gave me a gag reaction.  I&#x27;ve always been used to a stainless steel one, and very glad I found this one.  Of course, the earlier ones I had were from India and cost me 50 cents and did the job admirably.  Couldn&#x27;t find those on my recent trip, and could not deal with the plastic ones.  If you are looking for a good quality tongue cleaner that might last you a couple of years, this one product is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I have tried about 8 different tongue cleaners in my life. This style is by far the best out there. Mine is almost identical but doesn&#x27;t have the cool handles which would be a major plus. Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else unless you require single handed use.</li>
    <li> The Tongue cleaner is an excellent way to clear the film on your tongue before every meal; Especially in the morning; Also good before going to bed at night. EVERYTHING tastes so much better and it gets rid of bad breath too!.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, be careful when ordering; Perhaps best to order several at the same time, as otherwise the shipping charges are far too high for such a lightweight small item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other stainless steel and copper tongue cleaners but nothing can compare to this one. Copper tended to rust and stained badly while other stainless steel ones was just so so that I had to repeat few times to clean. With this one, my tongue was cleaned with just one stroke, and the soft grip was comfortable to hold, plus hygienic packaging and the the material is very well made, it seems last long. I thought it was a bit expensive at first but now I can say that its totally worth the money. My husband loves it as well. However, its very effective so you dont have to use much pressure to avoid bleeding.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this works! The other tongue cleaners I used would always gag me and not clean very well.....but this one is excellent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tongue cleaners for around 17 years. These are by far the best I&#x27;ve used, the steel band doesn&#x27;t rust and the grips are comfortable and allow you to really apply force for a good scraping. the band will definitely outlast the grips depending on how much force you use, mine usually last a few years before i need new grips. plaque on the tongue is a major cause of bad breath (it&#x27;s literally hosting bacteria that are pooping and peeing in your mouth), I wish everyone would use tongue scrapers in addition to brushing and flossing .</li>
    <li> This is a MUST for oral care. I am soo addicted now that I use it 3-4x a day!  Get it and you can kiss your morning breath goodbye!</li>
    <li> This product works really well. Leaves your tongue feeling less grimy and takes the underlying bad taste out of your mouth. Definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> my breath never tastes(and smells!)as fresh without using it.  a tongue scraper should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet right next to the toothbrush.  use it often!</li>
    <li> Prior to use this tongue scraper i used a plastic one,it was doing a good job but not nearly as good as this stainless steel tongue scraper.The bent shape makes the tongue scraper easy to use.Love it.</li>
    <li> This really works. I dont have issues with stale breath anymore. I also like the travel pouch that comes with it because it can stick it in my purse to use after each meal.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day and it works great.  I just wish I had bought one sooner.  Thank you Dr Cassar.</li>
    <li> Very effective and high in quality. Keeps breath smelling fresh. I would recommend to a friend. Really gives that complete clean feeling after brushing.</li>
    <li> Transaction went great and my husband and I love this product. It&#x27;s great way to improve health and taste buds.</li>
    <li> Works well, even when you don&#x27;t remember to use it every night.  Simple construction makes it easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it anymore. I notice that it&#x27;s easier to remove odor and bacteria the old way... that is, brushing my tongue with my toothbrush. When I started using this product, I felt weird scrapping my tongue with this sharp metal. I was left with vague bad odor, and was wasting at least two extra minutes in the mornings. I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it I think it&#x27;s BS sorry.</li>
    <li> Before this product I owned a plastic tongue cleaner. This Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner blows it out of the water. I can clean more tongue with less effort and time. One or 2 swipes and I am done. Very simple and easy to clean. Also the plastic one started to break after a while. I haven&#x27;t experienced any damage with this at this time.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a magazine article as one of those products \\&quot;we all love.\\&quot; Since I&#x27;ve never used one, my curiosity got the better of me. It&#x27;s insane what you find once you use this baby, even if you&#x27;re one of those uber clean freaks like myself. Just get one...or two...or three.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how much it cleans my tongue. I thought toothbrushing my tongue was enough but I was so wrong. This scrapes my tongue clean everyday. Very simple design but very effective.</li>
    <li> Nothing else will work for my son, this is the best!</li>
    <li> As someone who has always struggled with bad breath despite brushing twice a day with an electric toothbrush, flossing daily, and constantly chewing gum, I can say that this tongue cleaner has made a world of difference.  I use it every morning (four or five scrapes from the back of the tongue to the front), rinsing with hot water between each scrape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of cleaners and they didn&#x27;t do anything at all. This one works very well and appears to be better quality.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase Dentek&#x27;s plastic tongue cleaners at Target.  Since they&#x27;re plastic, I would have to purchase multiple.  I&#x27;m definitely happy with this purchase.  I will NEVER go back to getting plastic tongue cleaners again.  Dr. Tung&#x27;s is super easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt either.  It scrapes the tongue well.  It cleans easily too (a quick rinse under water).  It&#x27;s also adjustable, so it&#x27;s flexible, but still has stability.  Plus, I don&#x27;t have to spend anymore money replacing my tongue cleaner.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know because I never recieved it nor has anyone gotten back to me from customer service. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Simple, works flawlessly, and looks like it will last a while. Perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not only good for your tongue. It&#x27;s great when you run out of toilet paper!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about five years, and use it quite often. It is so effective, and seems as good as new. If you are finicky about the cleanliness of the mouth, then this product is a must. The teeth are only half of the issue. There is a lot tongue, and like everything else, it  needs cleaning. Cleanliness is next to Godliness.</li>
    <li> Never had a tongue cleaner before but thought I&#x27;d try it to fight bad breath.  In the past I&#x27;ve just used a toothbrush, but this works much better.  You can go farther back without gagging and it scrapes the surface off pretty well.  Hopefully on my way to fresher breath!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so wide and so much material in your mouth it&#x27;s hard to get your tongue up far/flat enough to get a good scrape.  I still prefer the less wide, but more effective plastic Breath Remedy version - tho it&#x27;s hard to find w/o the rubber scraper insert.</li>
    <li> I used to brush my tongue with my toothbrush in the mornings which would always make me gag. This does a much better job and does not trigger my gag reflex. It really is quite amazing. I am pretty sure I can even taste things better after using it. My whole mouth also feels cleaner. It feels well constructed and should last a long time. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I am thinking about giving these out as stocking stuffer/Christmas presents. If I had one minor gripe it is that the company is located in Hawaii yet the product is manufactured in China... but that is hardly a reason not to buy one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product could be better. I mean...it&#x27;s a scraper for your tongue. Does a good job and is flexible/adjustable.</li>
    <li> The Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner quickly and effectively cleans the back of your tongue to give you fresher breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- Effective Cleaning Edge&lt;br /&gt;The Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner is made in the traditional form of an arched metal strip as opposed to the other kind such as this [[ASIN:B0007R6L5E Tongue Sweeper PRO]].&lt;br /&gt;The tongue scraper provides just enough of an edge to effectively scrape of plague and debris from your tongue without posing a cutting hazard. With the rubberized handles, you can easily vary the amount of pressure the strip exerts on your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- One-Pass Cleaning of Entire Tongue Surface&lt;br /&gt;The Dr. Tung&#x27;s tongue cleaner&#x27;s traditional design allows me to angle the ends for a wider spread to clean the entire area of my tongue in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Less Gagging&lt;br /&gt;The flexibility and maneuverability of the metal strip gives you a lot of control so you&#x27;re less likely to trigger a gagging reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- Two-Handed Use&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the [[ASIN:B0007R6L5E Tongue Sweeper PRO]], which you can use with one hand, the Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner requires the use of both of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Reduction of Bad Breath&lt;br /&gt;Halitosis (bad breath) comes from the volatile sulfuric compounds in the back of your mouth. Most of the VSC is concentrated near the back of the tongue. Cleaning the tongue with a tongue scraper is thus a very effective way of reducing bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;With Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner, my breath smell fresher. It&#x27;s an indispensable part of my oral hygiene regime. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and does wonders for your breath. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this! No more dragon breath in the morning!</li>
    <li> Have used these for decades.  They do last, even if they get slightly bent.  Worst thing is the plastic handles will eventually crack and fall off, but you can still use the scraper.  I demoted it to four stars because of the handle life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been an day but I&#x27;m seeing amazing results. I imagine with daily upkeep my tounge will be the perfect pink shade. Only thing i warn you about is that it&#x27;s pretty gross seeing what coming off ur tounge lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really gross how much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; this scraper took off my tongue the first time I used it but it is well worth it - my breath is much better.</li>
    <li> Simple to use, easy to clean, and seems durable.  Most importantly, it seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to look for one of these at a local store, but they didn&#x27;t have it, so I bought it here.  I think it&#x27;s a bit expensive for what it is, but I hope to use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Scrapes plaque very well!</li>
    <li> Great product- works really well.  I wish that I had been introduced to this sooner!</li>
    <li> An excellent way to keep your tongue feeling clean. I use it at least two times a day. I prefer this tongue cleaner over the plastic ones. Stainless steel is much better than the plastic tongue cleaners. Helps keep your breath fresh.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  It is stainless steel, so bacteria don&#x27;t stick to it as readily as they stick to plastic.  It does a great job of cleaning the tongue.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My oral hygiene is something I&#x27;m slightly obsessed with. I went from the plastic &amp;#34;The Tongue Cleaner&amp;#34;, to this because I wanted to try something new. The steel is something I&#x27;m not quite use to, but it still works great. The only thing I dislike is the two little handles. To get the best clean, I usually have to use two hands to keep the handles far enough apart. But all-in-all, a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used other tongue cleaners and find this one superior to others I have used. It is very durable and does a great job. The price is very reasonable. A great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is simply GREAT! I have been using it now for 3 days and I have seen a BIG improvement on the color of my tongue and also fresher breathe. It works period.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels while using it.  Easy to clean and good ergonomics.  The issue is my tongue doesn&#x27;t feel really cleaned and that&#x27;s the reason I bought it.  It feels just like I ran a spoon down my tongue.  I wish I&#x27;d bought another on online and probably will.  Too bad I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Removes plaque much better than brush. Stainless blade and textured grip is made to last. No sharp edges to cut or injure the tongue. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this just to test my tongue brushing abilities and I don&#x27;t have any skill in that department but this did the trick.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Pink/purple handle demotes 1 star.</li>
    <li> Use it because it works, clean it regularly because that nasty tongue scum builds up on it</li>
    <li> Holy smokes!  What the hell just came off of my tongue?!  I had no idea that much, whatever it is, was stuck to my tongue.  I brush my tongue with my toothbrush every morning and night and I have never seen as much debris come off of my tongue as I did with the scraper.  The scraper itself it pretty solid.  The stainless steel appears high quality, so I imagine this thing will last for some time.  If your tongue is looking more white than pink, than perhaps it&#x27;s time to consider this product.</li>
    <li> I hate this thing, it shows me how much crude is on my tongue!</li>
    <li> Effective and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> After you use this tongue cleaner, you can see how much \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; is left after brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe that I went to bed with such a \\&quot;dirty tongue\\&quot; all these years.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality of the product and easy handling. Would recommend again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I used to just brush my tongue with my toothbrush, but after using this, I won&#x27;t ever go back.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> Normal, plastic tongue scrapers make me gag.  This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me gag! I enjoy scraping my tongue using this product</li>
    <li> I was leery about spending five dollars on such a simple product, but decided to take a chance on this purchase. I am very glad that I did. In the past, I tried to deal with a funky tongue by either brushing it with my toothbrush or scraping it with any object that I had handy. Both methods were only moderately effective. This product is perfectly designed and I can now clean my tongue off with only two or three swipes. My quality of life is greatly increased now.</li>
    <li> Cleaning up your tongue really good</li>
    <li> I have tried several different tongue cleaners in hope of finding the one that actually works and gets rid of the white stuff on my tongue. This steel tongue cleaner works no better than a spoon-- as a matter of fact, a spoon might do a better job at scraping your tongue than this tongue cleaner and it also saves you $5 from buying this. The steel tongue cleaner did&#x27;t scrape all the white stuff from my tongue very thoroughly; there was still some white stuff left on my tongue. I would not recommend to buy this item...a spoon will work just as well.</li>
    <li> the best of the ones I have bought so far</li>
    <li> I was advised by my dentist to get a U shaped tongue cleaner and I did.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I recommend it to everyone as part of dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Hygienist recommended a stainless steel cleaner and it works much better than the plastic one I had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tongue cleaners but for some reason I always experience that gagging sensation.  This one does the best job keeping that from happening, maybe because you hold it with both hands.  Anyway, it is comfortable to hold and the stainless steel seems to do a better job on the tongue than the plastic alternatives.</li>
    <li> Perhaps you&#x27;ve tried those plastic tongue cleaners that ends up with a white buildup of your tongue goo... look no further. This is the ultimate. This is the best way to do it, pulls off all the white glop, and easily washes away from the stainless steel. Dr. Tung is the champ!</li>
    <li> GREAT tongue cleaner. A big difference between the plastic ones and this one (stainless steel). I love it and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Amazing what it scrapes off!!!love it</li>
    <li> Great for getting the bacteria off of your tongue. Don&#x27;t apply too hard though, or your tastebuds will be sore for a few days. Also, don&#x27;t expect to get off all the gunk in one day, especially if you&#x27;ve never cleaned your tongue before. Consistently clean twice a day and you&#x27;ll have a pink tongue in no time. I recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want a white, stinky tongue!</li>
    <li> It works disgustingly well!</li>
    <li> Tried it. Did not like they way it felt on tongue. Tooth brush does a better job.</li>
    <li> Came recommended via my study of ayuveda. Love it! Did not think it could make such a difference and be so easy to use. Makes my mouth feel fresh. Need to get one to keep at the office.</li>
    <li> Great product! Gets the job done and I don&#x27;t see why it shouldn&#x27;t last a lifetime...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ayurvedic to clean your tongue in the morning. I&#x27;ve been doing it for about a year with a plastic scraper and now upon reco of my yoga teacher I&#x27;ve started using this stainless steel one and it&#x27;s a bit better, provides more tongue coverage. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this morning and night. Makes my mouth feel fresher than just brushing alone. Better than the plastic kind I used to use.</li>
    <li> I never looked into tongue scrapers before but I remember reading about how it was essential on a men&#x27;s grooming/hygiene article and decided to buy one as a throw in to reach my $25 required for free shipping. I was surprised at the stuff that comes off your tongue. I&#x27;ve read that 80-90% of bad breath comes from your tongue so having one of these is very much essential if you don&#x27;t want bad breath.</li>
    <li> This little device should be owned and used by anyone who drinks coffee!  A couple swipes with this over your tongue and coffee breath is gone, gone, gone.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product. Here&#x27;s what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves you with a fresh mouth (for real).&lt;br /&gt;- Completely painless; I would even go as far as saying the sensation is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to handle/control. It might seem awkward, but even my 3-year old was able to use it, which is also a huge plus (see below).&lt;br /&gt;- Kids friendly - my 3-year old started using it too. It&#x27;s harder to get her to use floss on a regular basis. It was actually my daughter&#x27;s dentist who recommended this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure dentists could add more items, but I am not one so can&#x27;t attest to any of its dental benefits. But I&#x27;m sure there are some. Overall, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how we lived without this. Some mornings I hardly get anything off my tongue and some mornings it&#x27;s just gross. I have noticed that I haven&#x27;t gotten nearly as sick since I started scraping my tongue about a year ago.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, comfortable and sanitary product. Much better feeling than plastic ones and probably will last and eternity due to been made of stainless steel.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this little titan would do the job of keeping my tongue clean.  Like an Athiest at a Billy Graham crusade - I AM CONVERTED.  Stop reading and buy this thing right now.</li>
    <li> I really like that I can get my whole tongue in one scrape with this scraper. Sturdy feeling, and I like the squishy grips. It has become an irreplaceable tool in my bathroom arsenal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple, really. It does just what you&#x27;d expect! The picture is of a pink one, however, I was sent a blue one. Which I was actually happy about haha. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Cannot completely scrape all the white stuff off the tongue. Don&#x27;t expect too much from this. The quality of this also feels cheap, it should be sold in the dollar stores.</li>
    <li> This does work to clean the tongue, but the white stuff comes back.  It&#x27;s necessary to use it regularly.  It&#x27;s also a little rough on the back of the tongue since the tongue is a bit thicker there.  Otherwise, it works great.</li>
    <li> Could not live without my tongue scraper. Its unbelievable how much plaque comes off. I brush 3 x a day and still remove a nice film of plaque each time. Even my hygienist noticed that my tongue is so fresh and so clean, clean!!</li>
    <li> I know many people think brushing is enough. Really, it isn&#x27;t. And I had been trying &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; my tongue for years without much result. My boyfriend told me my breath was still not great. Which isn&#x27;t the reaction you want from a boyfriend :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally gave in and bought this. It really does work. Even if I brush my tongue first, and then use this, I can see all the stuff the scraper gets off that the brush missed. Maybe the brush is just making things worse, mashing gunk down INTO the tongue so it stays there longer. Whatever the case, the cleaner gets it back out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things taste better. And my breath is cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The Tongue Cleaner activates all the meridians on the tongue that are completely related with all the organs. An ayurvedic must for optimal health.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Had mine for a while now, no problems with rust or the handles falling off. Feels well made.</li>
    <li> I love this tongue cleaner.  I have tried many over the years and this is by far, the best one yet.  It does a great job cleaning the tongue, and has a smooth surface so the tongue does not get irritated.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has the original of this tongue scraper that didn&#x27;t have the rubber grip handles and he loved it so much that I decided to give this one a try.  What can I say, it&#x27;s awesome! You don&#x27;t even want to know that stuff came off your tongue and trust me it scraps off A LOT!!!! Definately worth the money to invest in this little piece of metal.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and every night and it works great. Cleans my tongue really well and makes my mouth feel so much cleaner. This is my second one now and I love it. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> product was having rust when opened .so returned it.waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything different.  I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks, but I don&#x27;t notice &amp;#34;fresher breath&amp;#34; or better taste buds.  It just seems like it scrapes the saliva off of my tongue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  I had found that even after flossing, brushing my teeth and tongue, I was still left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Using the tongue scraper has eliminated this.  It took a few days to get used to, but I use it after brushing my teeth in the morning and before I go to bed.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It really works to scrap bacteria off of the tongue. I will definitely be getting one for my nephew.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner scraps off a lot crap off the tongue. I would reccomend this tongue cleaner. Good Price. Cheapest price online. No gag, unless u go all the way back.</li>
    <li> Using the plastic ones with a rubber type head (scraper) always left a noticeable amount of white residue. When I switched over to this model it got it much cleaner. Kind of like using a straight razor compared to an electric one for closeness and effectiveness. I am not trying to indicate that this item is in any way sharp, as it is not.</li>
    <li> Works wonders, so much better than just brushing your tongue! Very easy to use also.</li>
    <li> I have never believed in tongue cleaners in the past, but after being unsuccessful with my toothbrush and later learning that, that only pushes the bacteria further into our tongue, I decided to try this product. It works excellent and I can even taste my food better now.</li>
    <li> So refreshing.  Think about going your whole life without a toothbrush. Just wiping your teeth with a cloth. How much better would it feel when you discovered the toothbrush? This tongue scraper is just like that feeling. How does not everyone have one?</li>
    <li> scrapes your tongue and you instantly feels fresher.</li>
    <li> This item works very well for what it is suppose to do. What its made of seems inexpensive so thats why the price is seemingly low. its value is in what it does and not what its made of. nice product.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a life changing device. I purchased this mostly because onion hangs on my breath and lately I&#x27;ve noticed some white gunk on my tongue and don&#x27;t know why. This definitely cleans it off, but it is sort of a one time thing. The next day it is back and needs to be done again. I haven&#x27;t really noticed fresher breath or anything, so I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s even worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars because it cleans the crap off my tongue. Is a little abrasive but doesn&#x27;t cut or anything which is good. I&#x27;d buy it again, the price is cheap and it probably improves my overall oral health.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. It really cleans your tongue and the hard to reach areas. At least I dont choke anymore unlike when I use my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a great tongue scraper - it beats the hard plastic hoops that make you gag.  The stainless steel edge scrapes effectively, and the soft rubbery handles provide a good non-skid gripping surface.</li>
    <li> This item is a very effective way to ensure removal of accumluted debris from food on the back of your tongue. I use it every day after brushing and before using mouthwash. It helps for a clean fresh mouth!</li>
    <li> Does a great job removing &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; from tongue.  Easy to use. Didn&#x27;t trigger gag reflex too much.</li>
    <li> I am a big coffee drinker (about 2-3 cups daily) and I&#x27;ve noticed plaque build-up on my tongue that causes me to have bad breath.  This tongue scraper is great at removing all of that so I can feel good about my breath.  It is more effective than rinsing with Listerine.</li>
    <li> Thanks, fast shipping, I really like this Tongue Cleaner, it works great.</li>
    <li> After all the wonderful reviews I had to try this tongue cleaner out. I honestly don&#x27;t know what all the great reviews were about. I expected this to have some kind of texture or abrasiveness to help clean the tongue but it&#x27;s just a curved piece of flat metal. Feels like you are putting the edge of a metal spoon in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it does a good job, it hasn&#x27;t rust. It is easy to use, the handles have a little grip so it makes me feel more secure when using it, as I am just getting use to scrap my tonge.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! After the first use i could already sense a change. Although be warned, the first time i tried it, i did it to hard and bled a little. This is one powerful little tool which i recommend to anyone who will hear.</li>
    <li> Amazing, absolutely love it! This really gets the job done, something a plastic/toothbrush tongue scraper just can&#x27;t do. Thank you !</li>
    <li> It functions awesomely without hurting my tongue.</li>
    <li> This product got me tongue-tied in reviewing it. This really is natures&#x27; best!</li>
    <li> This is seriously one of the best products I ever got on Amazon. So worth it! I raved about it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit disgusting at first when you see what&#x27;s coming off your tongue. But a bit riveting too. Now I don&#x27;t feel right without using it every day.</li>
    <li> Just plain awesome! Buy this!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to clean the tongue, so much better than brushing it or the back of the toothbrush rubbery thing.  It really does do wonders.  It probably doesn&#x27;t solve why your tongue needs to be cleaned in the first place (diet, yeast, coffee etc.) but it does clean it effectively daily and helps lot.  I was a little overzealous the first time I used it and scraped a little too hard.  Hurt for a day but now I am used to it.  Just don&#x27;t scrape too hard the first try and let the tongue adjust!</li>
    <li> Step one: Scrape Tongue&lt;br /&gt;Step two: Be more attractive&lt;br /&gt;Step three: Get some</li>
    <li> I like it. Give my tongue a few passes before bed along with mouthwash. Don&#x27;t use it too much or press TOO hard or obviously you will have problems. Easy to hold and stainless steel is also nice.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, I noticed a different after using it.</li>
    <li> You have no idea what filth lies on your tongue.  Yes, you need one.  In fact, buy two! Cause you should of bought one years ago!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived 27 years without one of these beauties. I am serious when I express to you that EVERYONE needs one of these!  Brushing your tongue with your toothbrush? Stop it right now! Yea, you!&lt;br /&gt;This tongue cleaner will detoxify and make your taste buds wake up (while cleaning your tongue of course).&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know more healthy living tips start researching ayurvedic principles.  Life changing.</li>
    <li> Great seller!! Great Product!</li>
    <li> Instant fresher breath.  I figured the toothbrush was working fine and I was wrong.  This is much better for the tongue.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My tongue already feels and looks cleaner and I&#x27;ve only had this for about 3 days.  I highly recommend this to keep your mouth clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years now. I still use it 2 or 3 times a week. I&#x27;ts definitely cut back on bad breath and morning breath. I wash it with plain soap before and after use. And every now and then put it in a cup of hydrogen peroxide for an hour to get it real clean. It&#x27;s cheap and works just as good if not better than the expensive stuff!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS..plain and simple! I honestly didnt think itd improve my mouth but boy was i wrong! give it a shot!</li>
    <li> It always amazes me how ignorant some people&#x27;s comments are when it comes to oral hygiene. I&#x27;ve suffered from a lightly coated tongue for years. Despite brushing every day, gargling with mouthwash and even taking a fingernail to it to try and scrape some of the stuff off, nothing has worked. I purchased this tongue scraper because of the fantastic reviews, but still I was not convinced. Then I used it. Loads of white particles peeled off my tongue like snow under a plow. It was gross, but it was also a relief to have that stuff gone. When I sniffed it--who could resist--it smelled like the bad breath you&#x27;d suffer from in the morning. I can&#x27;t help but believe it will only improve my breath throughout the day. Tip-get as far back on the tongue as you can. The buds on your tongue get larger as they go back farther and the stinkiest stuff is caught on those big taste buds. Not all the gargling in the world is going to move that junk. Now, my tongue is on its way to being completely pink. Its not a one-time cure all but it made a BIG difference. This skeptic is turned.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Gets tongue super clean, and great for cleaning small childrens wiggly tongues too! I got some for my kids, and makes tongue cleaning so much easier!</li>
    <li> I have had a plethora of tongue scrappers that have all fallen short after about a month of use. But the Tung&#x27;s Tongue Scrapper is the best by far! This tongue scrapper will last for a while before replacing it. It&#x27;s very strong and will handle a lot of pressure compared to the plastic tongue scappers! I recommend this product to anyone who like to keep fresh breath and a pink tongue, the way it should be; not a white tongue.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner is a must. Takes a little getting use to at first if your like me and press down too hard, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s small, flexible and can be washed.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleaner I have tried - three times a charm, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cause that gag reflex, due to the shape.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase one again.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want hot pink, there is also a light blue available.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I was uneasy because I have geographic tongue and my tongue is very sensitive.  It was painless and helps with bad breath!</li>
    <li> Product works as promised, does my tongue some great justice by scraping off all the old residue. I can tell it&#x27;s working because my breath stays fresh much longer. A definite recommend!!</li>
    <li> This does the trick for sure!  Gets all the gunk off your tongue and easy to clean too.  Like that it has the rubber handles and is tasteless due to stainless steel.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I am just not seeing enough benefit.  I bought three tongue-cleaning products; the gel, toothbrush and this stainless steel tongue cleaner and have been using it faithfully for about six weeks and I truly do not see a difference from using a regular toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this tongue cleaner, I used it and nothing much was visible (either I have a fairly clean tongue or this product did nothing to clean my tongue any better) jury still out!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m a stickler for fresh breath and since using this tongue cleaner I have not felt the need to buy or use mints like I used to. I feel so much fresher after having cleaned my tongue. I don&#x27;t know why I never thought of having one before. Now I can&#x27;t imagine being without one! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the rave reviews. This product is equivalent to brushing your tongue with your toothbrush. The only difference being that the tongue scraper literally SCRAPES your tongue, which only appears to irritate the taste buds, not cleaning the tongue more than brushing it. Or just scrape your tongue with a teaspoon, same thing.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve purchased for myself in a long time. It beats the old plastic scraper hands down. I tell all my friends about this little gadget and highly encourage them to purchase one for themselves. It is worth every penny, and then some.</li>
    <li> Good but is more sensitive to the tongue.</li>
    <li> He USED to have the worst morning breaths EVER! So I looked and looked for solutions and answers! This tongue cleaner works the best! I can now kiss him in the mornings and anytime of the day without saying,&amp;#34;OMG! go brush your teeth!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful having that feeling of kissing him whenever. I love this and obviously he loves this item. He uses it every morning and night.</li>
    <li> These are an excellent addition to most people&#x27;s regular oral hygiene regimen.&lt;br /&gt;The tongue cleaner in general helps with keeping bacteria and thick yuck off of the tongue, but the DR. Tung tongue cleaner has soft rubberized handles, and a stainless \\&quot;blade\\&quot; which will not cut, or harm any part of the body it touches.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used some others, which were all stainless, but they weren&#x27;t as nice.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 3d I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ll buy them every year or two as they need replacement.</li>
    <li> Love it! It really cleans your tongue. Do it gently at first, or it might hurt. Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s so nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth spending a couple more dollars for a durable and cleanable scraper. Just don&#x27;t scrape too hard or you&#x27;ll damage your taste buds. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really all this is is a bent piece of metal with rubber handles on it...  but wadda ya know it gets the job done, and how!  Seriously, I had never actually seen my tongue before using this product... (gross).  My breath is better, I&#x27;m more confident, and it just took a minute.  The shape allows you to get back to the back of the tongue where just brushing doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this...  it works.</li>
    <li> Mouth just feels cleaner with this little item. It works better than a toothbrush alone and you can adjust your own pressure to make it work for you.</li>
    <li> This will change your life if you are prone to bad breath.  I might buy another one to carry around in my car just in case. When you see the pile of tongue crap that comes off, it will forever make you want this.  Most of your bad breath come from your tongue.</li>
    <li> A friend told me recently about using a tongue cleaner in addition to brushing my teeth. So I of course got on Amazon and began looking for a tongue cleaner. I LOVE it!!  Dr Tung&#x27;s tongue cleaner had great reviews and is also a best seller!  Now I will never not use a tongue cleaner! :)  it&#x27;s so easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday. I love because it&#x27;s removing the bacteria that your toothbrush is unable to reach.</li>
    <li> This tongue scrapper is a winner. The thin stainless steel blade seems to reduce the gag reflex when using this scraper. I am able to place it further back on my tongue and it scrapes effectively. I also really like that the stainless steel construction makes thorough sanitizing easier.</li>
    <li> Get the all plastic ones. This metal is sharp and it is uncomfortable to use. I wish I had gotten the all plastic one.</li>
    <li> This is much better than the plastic ones that dentists give for free. It does a very nice job and feels great.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold with one hand and works very well.</li>
    <li> Works very good.  Amazing how much it cleans. Use it every day.</li>
    <li> simple product - no brainer on the benefits.  Easy decision to make.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that it would last your lifetime.</li>
    <li> Really amazing tool! I can&#x27;t believe how well this worked and did not realize how much gunk it would get off my tongue. Totally recommend this item to anyone in the market for one.</li>
    <li> The product itself does what it says: it cleans your tongue. It took a while before I got a technique down that let me do it quickly and carefully (there was some minor bleeding my first few times since I was too rough), but now I can scrape my tongue pretty quickly with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this three stars is because I don&#x27;t feel it provides much benefit over just cleaning your tongue with a toothbrush (at least to me and the way I clean it with my brush). I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in either method. The item itself is a quality tongue cleaner but I just don&#x27;t see why anyone would need it over a toothbrush (I guess if they don&#x27;t want to carry toothpaste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came with a travel baggie which is nice.</li>
    <li> Does an outstanding job of cleaning your tongue, much better than any plastic version of the same instrument or likewise currently in the stores.</li>
    <li> Never knew how much I needed it until I got it. That sounds dumb and made up but whatever... maybe YOU&#x27;RE dumb and made up!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.  I have had plastic tongue cleaners which broke within a few weeks&#x27; use.  I have had very cheap metal cleaners that pitted and tasted nasty.  This is the best.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best brand of tongue cleaner and the only one I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
    <li> Finally my dentist showed me a &amp;#34;tongue scraper&amp;#34; - I had no idea how much gunk can accumulate on the tongue, and brushing isn&#x27;t enough. This thing works great - which means it&#x27;s totally gross that I can scrape all that off my tongue - yuck!</li>
    <li> I really like this thing. I feel like it really works at getting my tongue super clean and making my breath smell better. I really like how you can hold it comfortably . A great purchase</li>
    <li> Works great gets all then white poo off. Makes my tongue sorta raw b/c I&#x27;m addicted to it and I use it several times a day</li>
    <li> This tongue scraper is guaranteed to make you think twice about how clean your mouth is. My dentist even complimented me on the clean tongue. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I paid about 13.00 for this scraper.  It is just a piece of stainless steel with two rubber ends to hold on to.  I have bad breath, and my mother told me that it was because of my tongue not being clean and stuff in between my teeth.  I floss all the time so it isn&#x27;t that part.  I tried using this because I read so many good reviews that a bunch of stuff comes off your tongue like plaque and stuff.  I guess it was too good to be true.  This might work if I have a bunch of stuff leftover on my tongue, but when i brush my teeth and rinse out, there is nothing left on my tongue.  I scraped my tongue 4 times with this and saw NOTHING on the thing.  I will try it again, but I doubt it will perform miracles.</li>
    <li> Works as described, its gross seeing the gunk come off of your tongue after a day of bad eating. Exercise caution when using it though, you can definitely scrape too hard and have a bleeding tongue.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to get that excess \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; off your tongue. This product will last a long time because of its strength and durability. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> makes my breath smell less like ass...thanks guys</li>
    <li> I hate thus thing.....it feels like I tear my tongue. Get a different one.</li>
    <li> I never knew how much I needed a Tongue Scraper until I bought this bad boy. The metal is perfect - it cleans my tongue very well. It&#x27;s a huge improvement for my breath!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m in the habit, I can tell when I&#x27;ve missed a day or two. Consider this an adjunct to flossing.</li>
    <li> It seemed to have worked because some white stuff came off, but not much at all. I thought I might have been doing it , so I scraped harder and then nothing. Tried it a few more times and still nothing. Was expecting to be blown away by how gross my tongue is.... it appears that I either have a very clean tongue or this product is not all it&#x27;s hyped up to be. Could be either, was never sure how clean my tongue was to begin with...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. This is easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My breath would not smell good no matter how many times I brushed my teeth. This product made a world of a difference.</li>
    <li> this works great, don&#x27;t be too hard when you pull it on your tongue and use it daily.</li>
    <li> after using these I could see a noticeable difference in the film or &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; being removed from my tongue. After a couple of doctors visits, however, I&#x27;ve learned that a coating of some sort is natural and that I had nothing to worry about. ALWAYS CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN</li>
    <li> I had been debating on whether to buy it or not but now im glad i did buy it because after using it and seeing just how much junk would come out of my tongue it was just disturbing. Now i can&#x27;t stop cleaning my tongue because it really makes a difference not only does my mouth feel cleaner but foods taste better too down to the very last bite :) .. Also since its stainless steel you just rinse it good and its ready for use again, i say its a very good investment .. If your thinking about buying it i would say go for it.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for myself and one for my husband.  We have both liked the idea of a cleaner tongue, and better breath.  We lightly wash after each use, and it holds up well.  (much better than the plastic models).  Very effective.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I should have been using one of these long ago.  Simple and durable--this will last 20 yrs if I don&#x27;t lose it first!</li>
    <li> I had a plastic BreathRX tongue cleaner, which worked very, very well.  That seems \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; than this, which is made of stainless steel.</li>
    <li> Works well, no issues.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use it can definitely taste the difference after use in the morning</li>
    <li> I wish I used this as often as I need to.&lt;br /&gt;It does work to give you fresh breath add it to your daily&lt;br /&gt;dental regime. your mouth feels extremely clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, effective way to a healthier, cleaner mouth. Would recommend to anybody wanting better oral hygiene. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good for fresh breath, and a clean mouth. I would definitely purchase again. This is a great product, should be included with all oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I can reach much further back in my throat than the plastic one from the dentist.  It&#x27;s stronger, too.  My plastic one broke.  I use 2 hands with this one;  my old one was a one-handed version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, this one removes a lot of stuff compared to my old one.  After months of use, it still works great.  Although, it&#x27;s starting to have a slightly dull look to it.  However, if it does start to rust eventually, I&#x27;ll probably buy another since I haven&#x27;t found anything that works this good.</li>
    <li> Not quite the magic product the other reviews make it out to be, but it does a far better job than a toothbrush. If you have trouble with your gag reflex, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. Otherwise, it does exactly what it promises--a quick and simple tongue cleaning that is easier, if not better, than using a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Omg... This product is awesome! I bought this product after hearing some reviews about it, and have to say that it definitely lived up to the reviews. Just one scrape on your tongue and your mind will be blown at the epicness of this little strip of metal.</li>
    <li> I frequently get a sour taste in the back of my tongue, and I KNOW my breath smells badly.  Others must notice, too, but it&#x27;s one of those things people are too nice to say, and I&#x27;m too afraid to ask.  I&#x27;ve tried brushing my tongue and various mouth washes and breath mints, but they either just mask the problem temporarily or they aren&#x27;t effective enough.  With a little research, it seemed the only thing I had left to try was a tongue scraper.  I found Dr. Tung&#x27;s scraper on Amazon and decided to try due to the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week, all I&#x27;m wondering is why I didn&#x27;t try a tongue scraper sooner.  The difference in the feel and taste in my mouth, and in my breath, is drastic.  I&#x27;m still doing my usual brushing and flossing, and I&#x27;m using the scraper twice a day.  I do apply a good amount of pressure, but not enough to hurt, and not enough to irritate the bumps on the back of my tongue.  (What ARE those things anyway?)  I scrape 5-6 times, going from side to side.  I do try to get it as far back as I can, since that&#x27;s where my main problem seems to lie, but I&#x27;m hindered by those bumps and by a tendency to gag.  I hope that as I get more accustomed to the scraper, this won&#x27;t be as much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend Dr. Tung&#x27;s to anyone trying to improve oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> it works really good, worth getting it. cleans the tongue very well and it is easy to clean. everyone needs one</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll definitely see an improvement. This tool will reduce bacteria in the mouth plus you can even feel the difference.  5\5</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, I&#x27;m just not really sure it does anything for my tongue. For 6 bucks though it&#x27;s not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> If you have never scraped your tongue you need to!  This is an integral part of living a healthy lifestyle.</li>
    <li> Very very good quality of steel used. Plastic grip is great too. When I held it, it did feel like a great product. Cleans tongue better than any toungue I ever had in my entire life.</li>
    <li> So easy to use &amp; extremely effective...This really does clean the tongue, and since it&#x27;s metal I can use it essentially forever and know that it&#x27;s tons safer for my body than using a plastic tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give it a try and works well, although I can&#x27;t say if I can actually notice a difference from not using it.</li>
    <li> It arrived in good time and in plastic packaging. It works as expected though it is a bit sharp and hurts to use it. It bends to adjust to the size you want, narrow or wide. At the wider positioning it doesn&#x27;t make me gag when I place it way back on my tongue, which is great! It makes my tongue feel rather raw and dry until I rinse it with cool water. All together, a good find!</li>
    <li> the only thing i didnt like was i got sent one with pink handles. Im pretty sure from the original picture it should have been blue.</li>
    <li> greatest tool ever invented.</li>
    <li> EWW. That stuff has been IN MY MOUTH?? Affecting my both my taste and breath?? I can&#x27;t believe how much I needed this product without even knowing I needed it. You&#x27;ll be blown away the first time you use it. Fantastic and gross at the same time!</li>
    <li> And so far so good. Dr Tungs has lived up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Now, if only it could not cause the gag reflex, I&#x27;d have a scrubbed pink tongue.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I am on medication that just leaves the worst taste in my mouth and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it no matter how much I brushed. At first I thought this was gonna be a temporary product but I&#x27;m hooked. This leaves my mouth feeling like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist. Everyone should have one of these. Brushing and mouthwash is not enough. This thing removes so much build up from my tongue it&#x27;s disgusting. It&#x27;s so easy and painless to use, I will always keep one around. I gag a lot so I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this, but I just take a deep breath, exhale slowly while holding the tip of my tongue, and I&#x27;m fine. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> Product works exactly as advertised. The design allows you to easily scrape your tongue as long as your gag reflex doesn&#x27;t kick in. I use it twice a day and the grips haven&#x27;t deteriorated in any way. The stainless steel makes it easy to clean as you just run it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted, if you&#x27;re using this for the first time, you are very likely to be grossed out by the amount of crap that comes out with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using a plastic Oolitt tongue cleaner for a while and it needed replacement. I was excited to see this product since it was stainless steel, a metal known to kill many germs.  I am sorry to say that the only thing this did was cut my tongue. I would not recommend this product, especially if you have a soft tongue or are a child.  My dentist tells me the human mouth has more bacteria than any other part of the body. The risk of introducing a bloodstream infection is not very high but it is still a risk I don&#x27;t want to take.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Oolitt.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with it, it works great.I would recommend it to people, it helps a lot more then I thought.</li>
    <li> I been using this brand name product for years and it works wonders on the tongue. This tongue cleaner actually cleans the tongue better than Orabrush! Plus you can use it for few years without having to purchase a new one every 3 months.</li>
    <li> What a great way to clean the tongue and prevent disease! Very sturdy and easy to clean. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Can not live without this thing!  Once you have used this, you will never NOT use it!  WAY better than brushing your tongue...super effective and you feel amazing all day!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It is not tongue clearner but tongue destoryer</li>
    <li> I ordered him a green plastic one last time and it finally broke after a year or so.  I don&#x27;t think these will break.  He says they work really well.</li>
    <li> While it works fine and cleans your tongue, the rubber handle accumulates black residue over time. I would think for the price they are charging they should come up with a better design and material for the handle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after browsing through tongue cleaners for a couple of weeks (honestly, I purchased it because not only was it a fairly low price(compared to others), but it also had pretty good reviews).&lt;br /&gt;first of all. yes, it is a little big so it takes up quite a bit of space. but that wasn&#x27;t too important to me.. all I wanted was a clean pink tongue.&lt;br /&gt;for some reason, I was expecting this tongue cleaner to have the little grooves(my dentist recommended those) but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if I was reading the description for another cleaner when I ordered this one and that&#x27;s why I thought it would have the zig-zag grooves but like I said, it didn&#x27;t have them.&lt;br /&gt;anyhow. I really don&#x27;t have anything too bad to say about the cleaner, but I wasn&#x27;t too impressed by it.. it didn&#x27;t exactly make my tongue look clean and pink and remove the white coat like it did for a lot of you.. So I guess it just depends on the severity of your tongue&#x27;s white-ness...? I don&#x27;t know. my tongue isn&#x27;t very bad. ever since I was a kid I was always self-conscious about my teeth being clean and white and my tongue being that pretty pink. but for the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been having problems with my tongues color.. it has a thin white coat and though my dentist said my tongue is &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; I still thought I&#x27;d try this.. to my dismay, it didn&#x27;t work.. at all!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return it, but that would probably be kind of gross... I still use it every other day, but I try to stay away from it because it hurts/irritates my tongue if I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, I would recommend it to someone who has an extra $6 to spare. I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Apparently I bought this in Jan 2014 (thanks Amazon for remembering) and I still use it every morning and night. I love it and all the grossness it rids me of! I wash regularly in the dishwasher and it seems to have held up just fine.</li>
    <li> I have always been one to have morning breath, yes, it&#x27;s embarrassing, but it&#x27;s a fact.  Most people I know do not, or have never, used a Tongue Cleaner.  For just under $7, I figured I would give it a whirl; what was the worst thing that would happen?  I received the tongue cleaner, and it came with a cute little travel pouch.  I couldn’t wait to try it.  So, I brushed my teeth, brushed my tongue, and then took out the tongue cleaner.  I LOVE IT! Ok, I’m one of those weird people who also like to empty my vacuum canister after every use because I like to see what all comes out (I have three pets, so the hair always fascinates me).  But, back to the Tongue Cleaner – here’s the deal.  Use it after your brush your teeth, because your tongue is most, and if you brush your tongue, you already started to “move” stuff around.  Be prepared to “swipe it” a few times, and go as far back as possible without gagging yourself.  You DO NOT have to use a lot of pressure, and as you slide the cleaner forward, you will notice (if you’re looking in the mirror) white “gunk” lifting.  When you get to the front of your tongue, it pulls right off, rinse your cleaner in the sink, and go for round 2.  I usually do this routine 3 to 4 times.  My mouth feels clean and it has definitely made a difference on my morning breath.  Keep in mind, I only do it in the morning – and just by adding it into my morning routine, my morning breath is practically gone.  Honestly, give it a try – you won’t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different kinds and this is the best. I lost one in a move and bought another one, otherwise it will last forever. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. There is no metal taste and if you cut your tongue (which I frankly don&#x27;t even see as being possible; it&#x27;s not a sharp edge) using this then you&#x27;re doing it wrong!</li>
    <li> What can I say, It does what it says it will do. I had some stank breath (smoker) but now I just scrape that nastiness off my tongue before I go to work or go out with friends and I have fresh breath for the rest of the day. From the other reviews, I was expecting to have taken off all the white nastiness in one sweep, but it takes a few scrapes and it doesn&#x27;t take off the last layer. All that doesn&#x27;t matter though when your breath isn&#x27;t atrocious!</li>
    <li> Quickly and effectively removes &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; from tongue.</li>
    <li> This product literally changed my life. I am obsessed with this. I cannot start or end my day without scraping my tongue. The amount of bacteria that builds up throughout the day/night is horrifying. I feel much healthier/cleaner after I use this product. I would recommend to EVERYONE!!</li>
    <li> This does help remove &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; the plaque that my toothbrush does not. No matter how many times I brush and use this tool, I still have a small amount of plaque that never comes off. Does that sound like a personal problem? Yessir! This tool is pretty sharp and scrape a tongue till there&#x27;s so much blood, you&#x27;ll never see the plaque anymore. I&#x27;ve never gone that far, but close. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, But my tongue bleeds and is sore for a long time, at least my taste buds and breath are better.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased Dr. Tung, I highly recommend it to my family and to my clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean swipe, convenient use, the company has more colors if you contact them, I am not proud to show a very clean tongue!</li>
    <li> excellent product for good oral hygiene</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow!! I was about to cancel my order thinking I could just pick this up at cvs or Duane reade? No where to be found and so happy I didn&#x27;t just get any old tongue cleaner. This cleans your tongue with out the harshness you would typically get with a toothbrush and its stainless steel so you could get years out of this one!</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this and USE it.  Your tongue and possibly your significant other will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and nice product! I&#x27;ve used these before but tried others lately-don&#x27;t waste your time, this type is the best.</li>
    <li> Ok seriously these things are awesome. I thought my tongue was clean after scraping it with the little brush on the back of my toothbrush. WRONG. You need this to not be gross.</li>
    <li> This is one of those things that you don&#x27;t know you need until you start using it. Now I am wondering how I ever got by without it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Have purchased this several times. It does not make you want to gag like some tongue cleaners do. I clean it with Dr. Tischenors or I put it in the dishwasher. I love these! A must for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I swear by this! Use this after brushing, but before rinsing with mouthwash and the bad breath will stay away for a good majority of the day (unless you have bad habits that effect the breath).</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. It makes me gag sometimes when I go too far back on my tongue, but it&#x27;s great. You will be amazed at how much gook you have on your tongue. Every time I use it I feel like my breath smells better immediately.</li>
    <li> Compared to the plastic tongue cleaners I&#x27;ve used before, this is by far way more hygienic then those. It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> After using this product, my mouth feels fresher and cleaner all around. The difference is pretty amazing for never having used a scraper before. I definitely noticed a difference in taste and smell of my breath, too. It&#x27;s super easy to use and clean and the non-slip grips are awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does the job well and very safely. It is very well made. I highly recommend this to everyone. Great Price too!</li>
    <li> Metal is a little harsh but the handles are nice and padded</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s easy to clean too</li>
    <li> The first time I use it, the metal scratched my tongue, but that never happened again.</li>
    <li> First time user and I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  It gets rid of bad breath quickly.  Makes your mouth feel very clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great tongue cleaner. Made of stainless less (good quality). Have had it for more than a week now and use it twice a day. Has a rubberized area where you hold, not required I think, nevertheless there. I just think it&#x27;s a little expensive for the purpose it serves. But I needed one and I got this since there are very few options anywhere in this country. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works as described! I hate brushing my tongue and was looking for a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was the pink handle grips. Oh well... :)</li>
    <li> LOL.  Bought this on a whim.  I don&#x27;t know if it works better than just brushing my tongue, but it sure is funny to use.  Kinda gross scraping all that garbage off your tongue.</li>
    <li> Best tongue cleaner, hands down.</li>
    <li> Thank god for this!  I bought a different one on Amazon that had almost five stars (I have NO idea why) and it was hard plastic that hurt to rake over the tongue.  This thing is so easy and you literally watch it remove the crap from your tongue...it&#x27;s amazing.  Combine this with Dr. Katz&#x27; Therafresh products, and you&#x27;ve got a good smelling kisser.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. A must have for everyone&#x27;s regular oral hygeine</li>
    <li> 100% bathroom necessity!  Scrapes ALL of the garbage off the top of your tongue.  It is shaped just right not to damage your tongue.  It is made to easily access the tongue from the back of the throat all the way down so that it gets a deep scraping.  These are a must have in my hygiene kit!</li>
    <li> I bought it, I like or it works for me or the recipient of the item or it makes the college students in the family happy.  Nothing profound or lyrical – whatever I bought, it does what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the way my mouth felt after using it.  I would tell all my friends to buy one.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this, I can&#x27;t complete my teeth/mouth cleaning routine without it. It really does scrap out the nasty stuff from my tongue!!</li>
    <li> This cleans exceptionally well. Didn&#x27;t realize how much just brushing with your toothbrush leaves behind. I would recommend this to everyone, especially those with bad breath issues.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, thank you! :D</li>
    <li> Other tongue cleaner manufacturers need to take note. This isn&#x27;t the cheap plastic stuff that your dentist gives away for free, this is a quality tool that will last a long time. It is also the only one that kept me from gagging during use.</li>
    <li> I had a Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue cleaner years ago, and, honestly, I have really missed it! It feels like I don&#x27;t have my mouth fully clean after brushing my teeth until I have scraped my tongue. It is especially useful when you have a cold or upper respiratory issue, just to get that gunk out of your mouth!</li>
    <li> The best tongue cleaner in the world. I&#x27;ve had all different kinds, but this is by far the best. There&#x27;s nothing I would change about it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good and really cleans the tongue, you&#x27;ll notice it the moment you start using it and a week later you&#x27;ll notice the difference in the color of your tongue.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly....Better than any one I&#x27;ve had before</li>
    <li> This thing is amazingly effective. So nasty seeing the slime but happy it&#x27;s gone nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it, it keeps my breath fresh and tongue clean. Best thing ever for hygienic care.&lt;br /&gt;Wash it after every use.</li>
    <li> good product... fast delivery</li>
    <li> Forgets spoons and floss.This thing is stainless,had handles,shaped just right and has a edge on it that will scrape 4 cups of coffee right off your tongue from as far back as you wanna go! Almost works to good so be careful.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how much spit and excess junk this thing got off of my tongue.  I assume this really freshens your breath up with the amount of spitty bubbly yucky liquid this scrapes right off of your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to rub it lightly on your tongue, that&#x27;s all it needs to scrape the gunk off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this product is that you can go as far back as you want, all the way to the way back of the tongue without triggering your gag reflex.  Whenever I use it i keep expecting a gag but it never comes!</li>
    <li> I love this device so far, the flexibility is a good feature, cleans easy and seems like it will last a good long while. I&#x27;m very prone to gagging easy and while I still do occasionally, this drastically cuts back on it and allows me to clean the very back of my tongue without much trouble at all.  I like that it is wide enough to get your whole tongue in one pass unlike those small ones. Highly suggest it.</li>
    <li> I got a blue one! It came with a little cloth bag to keep it in, as well- nice surprise.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what they say it will do. Easy to keep clean because of the spring-action. I just prop it up in a mug in my medicine cabinet, with the handles against the inside of the mug so the tongue scraper part is kind of hovering above everything, staying dry and clean. Nice!</li>
    <li> Good product use it daily. Needs a little getting used to. Cleans well. Great for the price. Best one so far that I used.</li>
    <li> Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner, Stainless Steel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only had it a few days but I already love it.  It works and it will save me $ since I wont be going through toothbrushes so fast.</li>
    <li> And, little did I know, all that effort was in vain. Now, I have a *really* clean tongue thanks to this little device. I&#x27;ll never be without one again.</li>
    <li> Item works very well, and is so easy to use. My tongue feels so good after cleaning it every morning.</li>
    <li> Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner has gotten rave reviews both here and elsewhere. It seems to be the premier tongue cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not find it really cleaned my tongue to the pinkness others described. That may not matter, it just did not live up to its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, although people say it&#x27;s not bad at causing a gag reflex, I have a fairly sensitive reflex, and although I powered through it to keep using it, I gagged multiple times when using the tongue cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it might work for you, but I think the rave reviews are overstating how good a product this is for everyone.</li>
    <li> This is smaller than it looks so if you&#x27;re ordering it online, it really only fits in one hand.  I was a little worried that I was going to have to use two hands but it fits in the one hand.  (I&#x27;m less than 5&#x27;1&#x27;&#x27; so that should give you an idea of how big my hand is.)  I really like it.  It did cause my tongue to bleed once when I first used it because I hadn&#x27;t scraped my tongue in awhile.  (I&#x27;ve been brushing it since the hit because I lost my scraper.)  After the first couple of days it was great.  It&#x27;s better than the old plastic one I had been using.  It rinses clean easily and is very effective.</li>
    <li> Whenever I brushed my teeth before I had this, no matter how hard I tried, there was always visible residue left on my tongue. This has taken care of that.</li>
    <li> I just discovered the power of tongue scraping a few days ago. OMG WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE it makes to my breath and confidence!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last a few years I had been wondering about my breath and I think it&#x27;s questionable at times (partly because I started drinking coffee). No one ever complained about my breath and at times I had asked my friends(and bf) and they said my breath was fine but still I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable enough to talk to someone inches from their face because I was skeptical about my breath. I had always brushed my tongue but now i know BRUSHING IS NOT NEARLY AS EFFECTIVE AS TONGUE SCRAPING. After I discovered the wonders of tongue scraping a few days ago, my saliva started tasting mildly sweet--it&#x27;s like I am drinking flavored water all the time. The color of my tongue improved. It&#x27;s more pink now. I can FEEL that freshness in my mouth. If you&#x27;ve tried mint, gum, brushing like there&#x27;s no tomorrow, mouthwash, flossing, etc and your breath is still not perfect, START SCRAPING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tongue scraper arrived next day. It works well but I like the little spoon-like one that came with my water flosser set even better because that one can reach all the way back and can be used to scrap the upper palate as well. I keep the spoonlike one in my purse and use this one at home.</li>
    <li> I use this twice everyday!  I have no idea why dentists don&#x27;t recommend this more.</li>
    <li> Got the idea from YouTube. When I wake up in the morning its the first thing I do. You would be grossed out by what is on your tongue, then image that&#x27;s on your teeth. Dental care is now first thing when my peepers are open.</li>
    <li> I like the product is general, it&#x27;s cleans you tongue better than a toothbrush because it is made of sturdy material.  However, because the metal part is just a a flat piece of metal, so it scrapes off the surface of the tongue which gets most of the stuff that creates bad breath.  If you are very particular about getting your tongue cleaned, i would look more into the toothbrush like tongue cleaners with little round spikes on them, it probably gets more in between the tastebuds.  Also, because the front part of the cleaner is narrower than the metal part near the handle, it doesn&#x27;t necessary catch the stuff that is located on the two sides of the back of tongue.  But you can adjust the direction to eventually get it.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the tongue and overall I think it&#x27;s a good quick tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> Essential. If your breath stinks, it&#x27;s probably because you don&#x27;t have one of these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s disgusting what you can get from your tongue!  It doesn&#x27;t help me personally to get rid of bad breath...but it helps clean it somewhat.</li>
    <li> When it comes to tongue cleaners, this one&#x27;s the best! Durable and strong, but don&#x27;t scrape off your taste buds with it Bucko! Just use it to save your Friends and loved one from your \\&quot;Morning DRAGON BREATH!! Use it, and enjoy life.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve had one before this one for a while until it got gross/broke so I got a new one and I am happy I did. It really makes a huge difference in the hygiene of your mouth and I think everybody should have one of these and use it daily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now.  Bought my first one about 8 years ago and recently just ordered my second because one of the handles wore out.  Still, 8 years of fresher breath for &lt;$10 is pretty good.    It works great to remove the build-up on the back of the tongue on which odor forming bacteria seem to thrive in. Works much better and with much less gagging than just trying to brush the tongue. Even with regular teeth brushings, I found that this build-up was a problem, especially after eating sugary foods.  Dr. Tung&#x27;s scraper removes this easily with just one or two sweeps and it is very easy to rinse off the scraper afterwards.  You don&#x27;t have to put a lot of pressure on your tongue with the scraper either; if it&#x27;s bleeing afterwards, you&#x27;re probably being too heavy-handed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing!  I use it every couple of days and am amazed at what comes off even AFTER brushing my tongue!  I&#x27;m thinking of buying a second one to keep in my purse!!!      I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I tried a plastic tongue cleaner in the past and it seemed to do nothing at all. It didn&#x27;t have any effect better than brushing the tongue with a toothbrush. I found this product is much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. After using this, I wouldn&#x27;t want to skip this step in the future.</li>
    <li> This products works great. I have been using it for about 2 months now, scraping all the grime off my tongue for a cleaner healthier looking mouth. And it does that job perfectly. Also purchased one for my father who has horrible breath, and that seemed to help him. Great Product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tongue cleaners I have ever used. Love it.</li>
    <li> Simple addition to my morning routine. Keeps that tongue fresh. Use at night too for best results.</li>
    <li> I get better results with a toothbrush. A toothbrush is more comfortable too...</li>
    <li> You know that gross taste in the morning that&#x27;s a mix of night breath, toothpaste and who knows what else? That stuff sits on your tongue. Pick up one of these awesome tongue scrapers and destroy that mouth funk. There were people that wrote on their reviews that they cut themselves.....the only way to cut your tongue would be if you angle the scraper upward so that the edge is facing out, and scrape. The metal is good quality and not thin (meaning not sharp), and I&#x27;ve never cut or hurt myself with it. You don&#x27;t need to scrape vigorously, a few passes gets gross tongue buildup out quickly and easily. I can taste the water I use to rinse afterwards, that&#x27;s how much it&#x27;ll clean your tongue. BUY IT.</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue scraper I ever used. It lasts for years . I bought for my love ones too.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Way better than those plastic tongue cleaners. The amount of stuff it scraps off from your tongue is horrifying. I like that you&#x27;re able to reach all the way in the back with this.The only thing I did not like was finding a place to store it. But overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Use before brushing and mouthwash.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s half lit&lt;br /&gt;(Hurts my tongue at times)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty obsessed with my oral hygiene. I brush, I floss, I rinse. I thought I had it covered. Covered, that is, until I realized I wasn&#x27;t giving my tongue the attention it needed. I figured that brushing my tongue was good enough. Turns out, brushing just tends to push the nasties deeper into the nooks and crannies of the tongue rather than flushing them out. Enter the tongue scraper. I did some research, considered smaller, plastic, curved, ergonomic and then decided on Dr. Tung&#x27;s. Why? A couple of reasons. It&#x27;s got those nice, nobby hand grips so it won&#x27;t slip out during use. It&#x27;s made of stainless steel so it won&#x27;t rust. It&#x27;s nice and wide so you can cover the entire tongue in one pass. It&#x27;s got it all. I might even go as far as to say it just might be the Cadillac of tongue cleaners, the Miller High Life of oral care. I thought my tongue was clean until I did my first pass with this nifty piece of metal. What I saw had me dry heaving immediately. It was disgusting and it was on my tongue. I thought my tongue was pink. It was not. Now after a few days of using it once a day at night I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. No more morning breath. OK, maybe a little, just not nearly as bad. My mouth just feels fresher all day. Actually, my mouth feels so clean I could eat off of it. Don&#x27;t neglect your tongue. Get this, scrape off the film, and lavish some love on that lengua.</li>
    <li> Cheap cheap product bends like foil.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it really gets stuff off your tongue. Keep in mind that it is stainless steel, so it has a rougher feel compared to plastic tongue cleaners.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> good quality and durable.</li>
    <li> I will never not use thing thing now. After using it once, you will be a believer. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on tongue scrappers and was unsure which one would be the best. I&#x27;m pretty sure I chose correctly. This one really scraps even though it has no teeth on it, it really gets everything off. If you keep scraping you can draw blood. This one also doesn&#x27;t make you gag which a lot of the others one make me do.</li>
    <li> I bought the tongue cleaner after trying to get rid of bad morning breath, and this does the job.  I use it every morning and night now.  I&#x27;ve converted some friends of mine to start using one as well, and at the price point, it&#x27;s hard to beat.  This a product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow, could not believe all of the gunk coming off of my tongue even after brushing teeth. This is a must have product if you want a clean mouth. People often forget about the tongue when trying to keep your breath fresh. This works a lot better than the tongue cleaners on tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Good quality and very flexible without fear of it breaking. Would buy other Dr Tung&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Keeps your tongue cleaner than any toothbrush could. Great for maintaining a healthy mouth and, obviously, fresh breath haha. Great product.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a few days I have fallen in love with it. Not sure about you, but when I used to brush my tongue sometimes my reflex felt unpleasant. With the Tongue Cleaner I am able to scrape my tongue very far back with ease.</li>
    <li> My mouth has never felt so clean. Fantastic</li>
    <li> This item actually works and it is very easy to use on a regular basis. Your tongue will definitely be clean after each use.</li>
    <li> It has really helped me to realize how nasty our mouth is in the morning and at night before going to bed!  I feel that it has helped me to taste my food better in the morning!</li>
    <li> This item shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $1.99. I feel ripped off for spending almost $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just a piece of bent medal with handles, no groves or anything on the part that scraps the tongue. It has its use but is way overpriced.</li>
    <li> I brush, I floss, I brush my tongue, and I use a rinse.  Then I saw some health news report about a product similar to this and the reporter was shocked at the effective results.  I used this thing and I was surprised that it still removes stuff off your tongue.  It&#x27;s a simple tool that does the trick.  My tongue does feel waaaaaay more cleaner.  Simple to use and it is stainless steel.  It is not a gimmick.  I love mine, but my wife won&#x27;t use it because it looks weird.  What a weirdo.</li>
    <li> It works like a champ, even tho its metal you dont feel it at all. Its smooth and cleans well. Definitely a product worth having</li>
    <li> This is so cool. Gets the white stuff off your tongue, but dont go HAM because you can give yourself a scrape and you may bleed. Happened to me, but its no big deal.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realized how effective this product could be for cleaning the tongue and getting rid of unwanted bacteria in the mouth.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a tongue cleaner, you have never really experienced a clean mouth after brushing your teeth. Even if you brush your tongue with your toothbrush, it&#x27;s just not the same. I invite you to try the awesomeness known as a tongue cleaner. Your (mouth) world will never be the same!</li>
    <li> Have been using this every night for 2 years and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition. Was recommended to me for overall wellness and although I really have nothing concrete to back up my claims, I do feel like it helps, and my mouth definitely feels cleaner after I use it, especially if I ate sugary foods that day. So easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t rust or lose its shape at all.</li>
    <li> This really cleans the gunk off your tongue. All you have to do is over your tongue and it slides right off. I use it once a day and haven&#x27;t had</li>
    <li> Update 08.13.13: it does not feel of good quality anymore, it got a little torn and it still makes me gag real bad. the plastic scrapers don&#x27;t. so I just gave up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;old review: it&#x27;s a good quality scraper. i gave it a 4* and not 5 because it triggers a gag reflex that i learned to overcome with other plastic scrapers. i guess it&#x27;s so efficient and reaches further that it causes that in the beginning. i must say i have a super easy gag reflex, so i think the product might not be to blame. overall satisfied</li>
    <li> As the product description says \\&quot;Cleaning your tongue is comfortable, quick and effective\\&quot;. It 100% does what is said. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I reviewed tongue cleaners first of all because cleaning my tongue with a toothbrush sometimes made me gag, and secondly because whenever possible I try to use the internet to find the best product at the best price.  This tounge cleaner has to me become as valuble as my toothbrush and mouthwash for oral hygine.  I have not tried any other tongue cleaner, nor will I.  This one works great, cleanes my tongue and doesn&#x27;t make me gag.  I think I paid around 7 dollars. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many tongue cleaners before, and I will do some comparisons to other products I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B00005BAWO Dr. Wieder&#x27;s Original Tung-Brush with Free Gel Sample - 1 ea]] for many years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tung-Brush&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans deep&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans well with the tongue gel&lt;br /&gt;- But however can cause bleeding from too much pressure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steel Tongue Cleaner&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t clean as deep&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans and covers a larger surface area&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding because of the scrape forward motion&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t require a brush or back and forth motion, just an easy pulling motion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I&#x27;ve also used the tongue cleaner that you find everywhere in Wallgreens, Target, and Walmart [[ASIN:B002EC12M2 DenTek Breath Remedy, Comfort Clean, Tongue Cleaner 1 ea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentek&lt;br /&gt;- Rubber is comfortable, but doesn&#x27;t clean as well&lt;br /&gt;- Triangular gap doesn&#x27;t really contribute much to comfort or cleaning quality&lt;br /&gt;- Flexible and can reach the back of the tongue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steel Tongue Cleaner&lt;br /&gt;- Steel is surprising comfortable, and can scrap off surprising well&lt;br /&gt;- Simple design cleans and covers more tongue surface&lt;br /&gt;- Is very flexible, and can manipulate the steel however way desired&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, The Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner is very efficient and dependable. Even though it doesn&#x27;t clean as deep as I would want, it does a great job scraping a lot off and keeping bacteria minimized until the next visit to the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner could perhaps be used with another tongue cleaner, so that you could have a better tongue cleaning routine. I say buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> it is as it was described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to get one of these to try it out, and I can honestly say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. You don&#x27;t know all the crap on your tongue (it&#x27;s actually kind of disgusting the first time), but using it a few times you definitely feel much better about your mouth.  I&#x27;ve noticed a better, fresher breath (that I might be imagining...not sure) that makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing a better job of keeping my oral hygiene in check. Overall it&#x27;s a very solid product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Very helpful and easy to use, I definitely feel that my mouth is cleaner.</li>
    <li> If u have bad breath use this ! It wks well !the best tongue scupper I have used because it metal which is better than the plastic ones . I am doing the oil pulling thing which is great after I do that I use my tongue scrapper to get rid of what left. My breath feels super clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> did the job the 1st day and a little the 2nd day but seem to be dull now unless I did such a great job at cleaning my childs tongue that there s nothing else to scrap off...but I tested it on my tongue and it just dont seem to be doing what it suppose to be. I think I shouldve just brushed harder and more frequent with a stronger toothpaste and water afterwards for the tongue and it wouldve did a better job.</li>
    <li> Works well, but my gag reflex is too stronk to use it to maximum effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Easily the best tongue scraper I have use. better than any plastic one.</li>
    <li> I own several of these and have given them away as stocking stuffers too.  I like the rubber grip.  I bought a cheaper one at whole foods that didn&#x27;t have a grip and it hurts to use it.  They are durable and easy to keep clean because they&#x27;re made of steel.</li>
    <li> This was my first and will probably be my only tongue scraper! It is very sturdy and easy to clean. The design makes it so you can get way back on your tongue and the broad surface keeps any gag reflex from occurring for me. I was quite surprised at how much junk comes off!</li>
    <li> It works very well. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this thing..It cleans my tongue great!! love it.. Makes your breath really fresh as well.. I am going to order another!</li>
    <li> I have always wondered if these work or just a gimmick.  So I have used this for a month and here is my evaluation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think there is some value but for the average person probably not a life changing difference.  People that have a tendency to collect food debri on their tongue will see a value.  I brush my tongue everyday so I feel that I was ok before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use this I do look at the device and see somethings removed but not every time.  If you are brave and low gag reflex you can reach back and get more but still it would depend on the person.  I am also a little afraid to really drag this across my tongue with force so I only use a small amount of pressure so maybe that would make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are simple and easy to follow.  This tool probably creeps people out but it is simple and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Very smooth surface, does a grab job, much better than the plastic kind. Comfortable design makes it easy to use, this is the best tongue cleaner I have ever had, I won&#x27;t go back to plastic.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that my tounge would be a nice pinkish color after using this. While it did help significantly, there is still a noticeable white frost still remaining on my tounge after a week or so of consistent use. Was hoping for it to be a little more effective like others claimed it was.</li>
    <li> I guess this works as described.  It&#x27;s just weird, lol.</li>
    <li> as many others said in their reviews, this product is the #1 choice in tongue cleaners. Made of metal ensures that it can be cleaned properly without leaving any residue.</li>
    <li> July 2013 -  The plastic tongue scraper I had been using for a few years finally broke at the handle, and I could not find a replacement @ the local drug stores that seemed to actually scrape my tongue effectively (they just glided over my tongue without cleaning it)...Then I found this stainless steel one on Amazon and decided to give it a try, and it has worked VERY well.  It has a very simple but effective design, and I would imagine it will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - December 19, 2013 - OK...I have been using this for six months now, and I felt compelled to update my review.  This is an AWESOME product...Dr Tung&#x27;s Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner is great!  Every single day I am impressed with how effectively this product removes plaque comfortably and safely.  The rubber handles and the contoured stainless steel scraper are designed for optimum ergonomics.  I read on a prior review that someone claimed they had \\&quot;cut their tongue\\&quot; with this scraper.  I have never come close to doing that even when I was being intentionally overaggressive with the product.  I know I probably sound like a commercial for the product, but I felt compelled to praise this excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, but be very gentle.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Much thicker than the traditional tongue scrapers you might find in an indian store.  Rubber handles are whatever, but definitely sturdy metal and no curvature where gunk can get stuck.  Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This item has become an essential component of our daily dental hygiene. It is very effective. This item was a gift to me years ago, it worked so well that I had to purchase one for my spouse. We have been healthier since using this product. No sore throats and such for a long time. Can&#x27;t imagine life without it. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I read reviews saying they&#x27;re rough on the tongue so I was  skeptical. It&#x27;s only as rough as you make it. It&#x27;s not sharp at all and it gets the job done really well.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective tongue scraper. This is the best I have ever used. Will never use a plastic one.</li>
    <li> It Is Amazing What You Scrape Off Your Tongue The First Time You Scrape It! The NASTIEST STUFF!  EW!&lt;br /&gt;But, Food Taste Even More Amazing.. And There Is Less And Less Of A Bad Taste In My Mouth When I Wake Up!&lt;br /&gt;I Need To Scrape My Tongue All The Time..LOL</li>
    <li> Every time I use this in front of a mirror it makes me want to barf. The only thing more disgusting than the stuff that this scrapes off your tongue... is the knowledge that I went twenty years without ever using one of these. I shudder just thinking about how filthy my tongue had been before I got this, and I was never even aware it had so much gunk on it.</li>
    <li> Very effective! I love the handles to help keep hands clean, my tastebuds are brand new....I can taste everything. In scraping twice a day, but be careful not to scrape too hard and cause bleeding...fyi</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tongue cleaner for months now, and it&#x27;s pretty great. Stainless steel means this will probably last me for a very, very long time, and is also extremely easy to clean. Very effective!</li>
    <li> If you have bad breath this is the product for you. It will gently and thoroughly clean you morning tongue of nightly debris and excess. The last one I had was still going strong after 6 plus years. I just had to change it out since the handles were getting grudgey.</li>
    <li> Pay a little more and get stainless steel Tongue Sweeper. I got both and tossed this one out after one of the grips came loose. Tongue Sweeper stores upright with toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Most bad breath is caused by tonsil issues, which a tongue scraper can&#x27;t address. The tongue scraper definitely seems to help with thrush on the tongue and assists with clearing bad flavors out of the mouth. Back to bad breath, though: it makes little difference in my case, since mine is caused by my tonsils (as is most people&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the item is built well and does provide some benefit.</li>
    <li> This is probably the most effective tongue cleaner I have tried to date. I love the fact that it is stainless steel and that maintenance is practically effortless. Don&#x27;t waste your time with the plastic cleaners in the stores, this one is way more effective and will most likely cost less!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I used to brush my tongue with my toothbrush only, which I thought worked just fine.  Then I started to use this tongue cleaner and OMG I am so mad no one introduced this to me years ago!!! This is by far the best thing ever!!!! I love that it is stainless steel to ward off bacteria, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been said that bad breath comes from mostly your tongue, so merely brushing your teeth is not the cure. I&#x27;ve used several tongue cleaners in my day, and this one is my favorite. The plastic ones are not flexible and causes me to gag more easily, and the purely metal ones (without the handles) are thin and difficult to hold.   This tongue cleaner is flexible and allows me to reach farther back on my tongue and the handles allow me to control it. Also, the metal is thick enough to minimize the risk of cutting into your tongue. I am very happy with my purchase and have been using it everyday for over a year.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  My mouth has never felt so clean!  Unlike other products, this one is made to last because it can be rinsed and reused.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tongue cleaner folks, and it works well. It seems like it will hold up for years, and I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Two to four swipes of your tongue and your done. Does a great job. Will buy more as stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> This is extremely useful, great for stopping bad breath and getting the white stuff off your tongue for a red tongue</li>
    <li> Clean and works well.</li>
    <li> Works as expected and cleans much better than the my previous one.  This one does better at reaching farther back...</li>
    <li> This is my first tongue scraper, and I think it&#x27;s been working well for me. My mouth gets dry sometimes, and I start to feel like my breath is going bad. (You know when you get &amp;#34;hints&amp;#34; of bad breath waft through your sense of smell?) It took a while to get the hang of scraping the middle back of my tongue (gag reflex). Your tongue needs to be flat in order to get this part of the tongue. The metal isn&#x27;t very sharp. I was afraid that I would cut my tongue when using a scraper, but I was relieved to know that it&#x27;s not like that at all. The grips are rubber and the colors are assorted, so you can&#x27;t pick the color given to you. I was lucky to get purple. I rinse the metal part after each use, and then dry the whole thing with a towel. After using this scraper for a while, I haven&#x27;t gotten those &amp;#34;hints&amp;#34; of bad breath here and there. I&#x27;m finally more secure about my breath.</li>
    <li> Great product I noticed a fresh breath after the fist use</li>
    <li> This tool worked great for my 8 yo daughter.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and felt driven to try it!  Didn&#x27;t work for me and actually scared my tongue a bit.  Tossed it right away.</li>
    <li> Quality tongue scraper. Worth the extra couple bucks to go with this one. Better than any other plastic option.</li>
    <li> What can one say about cleaning the tongue?  Works well.</li>
    <li> So much easier than using a thin toothbrush.  It is not a miracle worker, but my tongue does feel cleaner than it did before I started using it.  It is easier to use one-handed.  I definitely recommend over a toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job very well. It definitely makes a big difference in how clean and fresh my mouth feels.</li>
    <li> I do this and then oil pull ... bingo.</li>
    <li> Use it once and you&#x27;ll use it every day and wonder how you ever did oral hygiene without it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
    <li> Clean tongue equals better breath!</li>
    <li> Really love this gadget.  Sorry to gross anyone out, but quite often my tongue gets a white coating on it.  This gets it all off after running it over tongue about 5-6 times.  Much better than using electric toothbrush.  My husband kept raving about how good this tongue cleaner worked, but I thought my toothbrush was good enough.  He bought me one, and I have to admit that he was right on the money!</li>
    <li> These tongue cleaner are super hygienic and an last you a lifetime. I bought two one for me and the other for my husband and we both love them.</li>
    <li> Wow my tongue was so nasty on the first scrape! Keeping it clean from now on.</li>
    <li> The cleaner works great!  Much better than the ones designed with the brushes which leave too much residue behind.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it took a couple of weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Sounds stupid but I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  I use it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it and I honestly think it makes a difference!!</li>
    <li> It cleans my tongue, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it hasn&#x27;t broken after several months. Good, simple, reliable product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love using my tongue cleaner! It removes the film on the tongue that can cause bacteria buildup and make your breath stink. Since I added this to my oral hygiene routine at night and in the morning, my breath is much fresher! I recommend to anyone looking for a more natural and simple way to make your mouth cleaner!</li>
    <li> Cleaned my tongue wll of all contaminants. I wish I had bought one of these sonner. You will love it</li>
    <li> Easily the best tongue scraper that I&#x27;ve used to date.  Way better than any plastic one I&#x27;ve tried, and I like this design a ton better than the solid metal stick shaped ones with the loop on the end.</li>
    <li> It is convenient and effective. Very easy to clean after use.</li>
    <li> Just as described, I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve ever owned. And I&#x27;ve previously owned two. One was the brush type, which barely did anything, and the second was a plastic cleaner, which only got part of the muck on my tongue. This thing gets EVERYTHING!</li>
    <li> Really like this guy! I feel that the nasty morning film is eliminated and thus the odor.</li>
    <li> Seriously had no idea how much of a difference scraping your tongue makes in helping your mouth feel extra clean. It&#x27;s incredible. Why are dentists not pushing these??</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as described. Kinda gross to see what all comes off your tongue, which makes me glad I have this now.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have bad breath before, but bought this from a Reddit review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s useless.  It literally scrapes just the spit off your tongue.  Doing a quick Google search, you can see these aren&#x27;t any more effective than brushing your tongue.  I brush, floss, and mouth wash twice a day and don&#x27;t have issues.  I don&#x27;t see why I need another utensil in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up in the trash.</li>
    <li> It is taking a bit to get used to since I always used a plastic one.  It takes two hands, not one.  It should last forever though.</li>
    <li> I always though a tongue cleaner was silly and pointless, but I have honestly noticed such a difference. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel all gross and nasty in the mornings and just throughout the day my breath smells better.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a tongue \\&quot;scrapper\\&quot; to remove bacteria on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works perfectly and it is not overly sharp, which was a concern&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vastly over-priced for what it is but I didn&#x27;t want to shop around</li>
    <li> This thing is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used my toothbrush as well as dental floss and was suspicious how this could be much different but let me tell you - IT WORKS! After just one use my mouth felt like I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office! I thought my mouth could only feel that way after having my teeth cleaned so I&#x27;m just amazed. It is well worth spending a bit more on since it&#x27;s stainless steel which lasts much longer than other types and works MUCH better too. Get it!!! :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t describe how important of staple this in my health. I do it every day twice a day and my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind the results from  it ;) Don&#x27;t second guess the purchase. Just get it!</li>
    <li> I liked this. Works well to scrap the junk off your tongue and TRULY reduces bad breath. Use it consistently and you will not be disappointed. You do have to press hard and my tongue did bleed a little at first</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my husband and we love it. Way better than a tooth brush on your tounge, and quicker too. I use it 2 or three times a day, I love it!!</li>
    <li> Does as advertised. I don&#x27;t think there is a better tool for the job. My tounge tastes like tounge again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my BreathRx plastic tongue scrapers.  I don&#x27;t like it as much as the BreathRx scrapers because it doesn&#x27;t conform to the shape of the tongue the way the plastic scrapers do.  But it will certainly outlast any piece of plastic, so I&#x27;m sticking with it!  To respond to another reviewer&#x27;s note that he/she got a cut from using this tongue cleaner, I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible.  It is, however, possible to scrape so hard that you can irritate your tongue.</li>
    <li> a good solid tongue scraper, durable enough that I anticipate having it a good while and its easy to clean, happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, thanks</li>
    <li> Does the job and cleans easily.  I am pleased with this cleaner.  Flexible and the handles grip well. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> SO MUCH BETTER than the tongue scraper that&#x27;s shaped like a pencil!  Oh my gosh, that style of scraper makes me gag.  This one works so well and is just so simple.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer, just buy it and be happy knowing this is the best one you can get.  This scraper design also enables you to do it faster than the straight ones.  It&#x27;s wonderful, just wonderful.  Use it at night to keep morning breath at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please ask in the comments and I&#x27;ll try and respond promptly.</li>
    <li> Works great. Lasts years. Can be held in one hand or two. The handles get sticky if left in water too much though.</li>
    <li> Everyone should invest in a tongue scraper; especially this one!      It was very easy to use, soft grips to hold on to, and it didn&#x27;t even hurt my tongue.  I gag very easily, but had no problems when I used it.  After one use, I immediately felt a difference!!!  I&#x27;m VERY pleased so far :)      The only thing I wished it came with is a case to store it safely.</li>
    <li> I use this tongue cleaner every morning and it really does a good job of scrapping off unnecessary &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; from your tongue also can cure bad breath for some people!</li>
    <li> This product arrived pretty quickly. I love how this tongue scraper works. It definitely removes a lot of odor from my breath and a lot of bacteria from my tongue.</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 months ago. It really pulls out a lot of gunk that is trapped. It&#x27;s a simple design, and easy to clean once you&#x27;re done. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> IMO this product does a good job of getting whatever&#x27;s on top of the tongue off.  However, it does not completely scrape all that white stuff off.  Point is, if you have white tongue, it&#x27;s not going to turn pink using this.</li>
    <li> Before ordering this I read scores of reviews and decided to give it a go.  I don&#x27;t understand the people who were saying that it cut up their tongue after using it.  What the heck were you guys doing? All you need to do is place it as far back on your tongue as you can go, add a little downward pressure and scrape toward the tip of your tongue.  There&#x27;s nothing on it that would cut your tongue--no serrated edges or anything.  I just don&#x27;t get it.  It works well and after just a few uses, I feel a world of difference.  Give it a shot.  You&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> Works great.  This is my second time I&#x27;ve purchased one these (lost the first one and it had lasted a long time)</li>
    <li> This is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot.  I do notice my breath smells much better after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I like to brush my teeth, floss, use mouth wash, then use the tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> love it! if only we had the option to choose between colors.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks b*$s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried quite a few tongue cleaners. Some great, some not so good. This one went straight to the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrapes 5 to 10 % of the bacteria on your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away.</li>
    <li> Gets all that plaque or whatever off your tongue. I recommend you use water at lube or let your mouth fill back up with saliva between scrapes, reason being your tongue will be totally dry after a scarpe and if you try to scrape your dry tongue it will hurt and there will be blood.</li>
    <li> Delivery: On time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: Durable and easy to clean. Gets my tongue clean. No reason not to pick this one over a plastic one that will break down quickly.</li>
    <li> I have had many plastic tongue cleaners and have had little success with any of them. They all work fine for about a month then seem to loose their friction. This one has been excellent for 6+ months now. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is the handles bending a little but I&#x27;m sure I will get at least a year out of it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used it over a year and this is an excellent product. If a sticky layer on your tongue bothers you, this is for you. It is stainless steel, and reusable. Forget about plastic ones! You can use it for years. Good for you pocket and environment.</li>
    <li> I came upon an article that discussed the health benefits of scraping your tongue, and decided to try it for myself. Here&#x27;s the link: [...]  I have been using it for a week now, and I must say I feel my mouth is the cleanest it has ever been. The best pro to using a tongue scraper is reducing bad breath by a lot, so you won&#x27;t scare off potential mates (if your looks didn&#x27;t already do that). The only con is that it&#x27;s pretty gross what comes off your tongue, especially on the first use. You&#x27;ll just have to grow some though, cause life is full of disgusting things that come from your body.  I totally recommend it for overall better oral hygiene, whether you like to use your mouth for dirty things or not.</li>
    <li> High quality, works great as a tongue scraper. I highly doubt this thing will ever break, it&#x27;s built to last!</li>
    <li> Easy to use - triggers the gag-reflex much less than other &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; style tongue cleaners.  Feels like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Use gently, I think my toothbrush does just as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for several weeks and love it!!  After brushing and flossing my teeth, I use this scraper daily and it&#x27;s get off plenty of goop.  Sometimes I have to rinse it in hot water to remove the disgusting residue from the stainless steel, but it comes off easily.  After this, I use the tongue gel with the tongue brush and my mouth has never felt fresher and cleaner, even better than when leaving the dentist&#x27;s office!!</li>
    <li> While this scraper does what it claims to do, I actually prefer the Breath Rx scrapers.  They&#x27;re plastic and don&#x27;t last as long, but I feel like they do a better job at ridding the ol&#x27; tongue of nasties.  Nothing terribly negative to say about this product but won&#x27;t be getting it again.</li>
    <li> Took a few times using it for its worth to become apparent. Had a plastic one with small teeth and had been looking for similar; this has no teeth but it works as well or better and reaches better.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 2 months and it seems to slight work but does not really clean as expected</li>
    <li> This one replaced one I had used for years.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and it was identical the the one I wore out after 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to other.</li>
    <li> Came in as described...5 stars does the job.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve brushed your tongue before, you know that the stink in your breath comes from the back of your throat. This is something you&#x27;ll want. It&#x27;s easy to use and it will get all the smell out. I use this in addition to brushing my tongue still. Always leave the bathroom with fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> My daughter insisted I buy one of these.  I bought a plastic one at Walmart and she got on to me and said, &amp;#34;no, you have to get the stainless one on Amazon.&amp;#34;  I did and there is no comparison!  It does such a good job; my mouth has never felt cleaner!  It is very easy to use and clean.  The plastic one did not do a good job and seemed to hold all the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; on it.  This is a great product; I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Works as indicated.  Gereat, simple, no frills product and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The human tongue is filthy! I had no idea how much gunk was on mine until I started using this. I was brushing my tongue, but apparently it made no difference. Like some other users I also had white gunk on my tongue. This tongue cleaner pulls everything off the tongue! It is painless and quick. I scrape about once a day, and have noticed that I have less halitosis, food tastes better, and my tongue feels smoother. Be forewarned, once you start using this little tool, you won&#x27;t be able to stop!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool once you master the gag reflex.  It does help with cravings as it wipes away traces of the food from your tongues, toothbrush cannot. Bought it for a client who uses it creatively?  Have to find out more about that.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It works very well.</li>
    <li> very good, actually clean my tongue.</li>
    <li> Good product. Cleans my tongue better than plastic scrapers. Easier to clean too. I need to be a bit gentler using this as the steel is edgier and harder than plastic and can irritate my tongue if I am too aggressive with it. Time will tell how it holds up. I usually get a couple years out of a plastic scraper before they break. Theoretically, this one should last longer as it is made with more durable materials.</li>
    <li> easy, fast and effective</li>
    <li> Works great and is really easy to use. Makes my mouth feel so much cleaner than just brushing and flossing!</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve bought something cheaper, maybe plastic. What was I thinking!&lt;br /&gt;Get something cheaper. The product is good, but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner - it works like a champ. You have to be ok with metal in your mouth though - it feels a little weird at first.</li>
    <li> The stuff that comes off your tongue when you use this the first time will disgust you the first time. But it is all about cleaning your body! Food tastes SO _______ GOOD now. I have experienced far fewer instances of bad breath since I have started using this tool. I also have learned that the film on your tongue is a way that parasites in the body can control your food cravings. I have been enjoying the nuances of bitter food now such as kale, raw cacao beans and other dark green vegetables. Many people have experienced the sweet side of the spectrum, but this tool opens up the other side for fascinating exploration.</li>
    <li> I got this today and can already tell it&#x27;s going to be a life changer. I have had a white tongue for as long as I can remember and nothing has seemed to help. After using this for the 1st time I can already tell a durastic difference. This will definitely become part of my daily routine. I&#x27;m really looking forward to not being embarrassed and self concious about my tongue anymore!</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other 5 star reviews. This scraper cleans my tongue better than any other scraper ever has. I use it daily and have a pink tongue that actually looks healthy! LOL</li>
    <li> cleans tongue very good.Gag factor reduced compared to over tongue scrapers. This my 6 Dr. Tongue. Great for oral hygiene</li>
    <li> It works great! Gets all the gross stuff outta your tongue and it is very easy to use. Although you might gag a little when it hits the back of the tongue, but thats every tongue cleaner. Thanks Dr. Tung!</li>
    <li> Works very well, you would be surprised at what lies on your tongue even after brushing...only complaint is if not used correctly it can really hurt your tongue and cause soreness, you have to be very gentle when scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to, holds up well, I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year now and my dental hygiene is much improved.</li>
    <li> I scrape my tongue every morning with this and it is holding up fine.  I should have purchase this 20 years ago!</li>
    <li> works wonders, who would have thought a bent piece of wire could sell for more than $5 but this has helped kill my coffee breath and now i get compliments from Super Models all day. Why Hello Megan Fox!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s designed to do. Done and done!</li>
    <li> I echo the other positive reviews here. This is a GREAT purchase. You don&#x27;t realize how much you have on your tongue until you use the tool -- even promotes better breath and a healthier mouth. The tool is painless and easier to use than other metal tongue scrapers. Wish I bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> this is the best tongue scraper i&#x27;ve ever found hands down.</li>
    <li> Greater than even the iphone or macbook pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gf says my breath doesn&#x27;t smell no mores.&lt;br /&gt;And i&#x27;m like ; D</li>
    <li> Excellent. I can&#x27;t believe I lived without this for so long. It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my breath and overall mouth health.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a product that does exactly what it says.  I&#x27;m a major gagger with tongue brushing but this is much gentler.  My mouth feels better in the morning and the scraper itself is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Quick and easy oral care. Needed a couple of uses to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Between tongue brushing and Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner my tongue has never been cleaner, pinker, of my taste better.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this and told by my dentist that it wasn&#x27;t necessary, but after much peer pressure I tried it and love it! My mouth feels so much cleaner and fresher</li>
    <li> Mine works well and I purchased this for family member. Metal scraper is dull enough to be easy on tongue.</li>
    <li> Love it, Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> No complains.....do the job easy, handles are made of plastic but cleaning is easy....</li>
    <li> It DEFINITELY gets my tongue waaaaaay cleaner than any toothbrush ever has.  However, it still can irritate my lil taste buds (which it claims NOT to do).  There is definitely a gag reflex issue with this, though, so be warned.</li>
    <li> Does its job but as a beginner, don&#x27;t scrape your tongue too hard as you will injure it and sometimes it leaves a metal aftertaste. Of course it is metal though. Should put a warning label not to scrape too hard.</li>
    <li> These work very well.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re intimidating at first because it is metal, but the metal part is thick enough to not &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; your tongue as I have thought.&lt;br /&gt;I found it working better than plastic/rubber ones with &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;; feels much cleaner using this one.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind the metal is very malleable so you can easily stretch or bend out of shape on accident.</li>
    <li> A huge improvement in keeping one&#x27;s breath fresh. I use it every time after brushing my teeth, I was baffled by the gunk that is scraped off even after I thoroughly cleaned my mouth. It definitely helps with improving one&#x27;s breath, I can&#x27;t imagine my oral hygiene without it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  The stuff that comes off your tounge is mind blowing.  I have tried the plastic ones but they just do not work.  A must buy if you are serious about good breath!</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Stainless steel is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Wow. I was skeptical first about this product, but after a couple of uses, I have to say this product is great. Mouth feels more cleaner and smells better. Recommend it, especially for coffee drinkers.</li>
    <li> My wife had been complaining that my breath was smelling. Even though I brush twice a day, floss and brush my tongue it was becoming a chronic problem. Sometimes even after I brushed my breath would still smell and I would need to brush again. I meet a lot with clients and I was really worried that my breath would smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about the orabrush, but didnt like the idea of having a disposable tongue scraper so I decided to try this one first. I scraped 4-5 times on the middle of the tongue and the sides. Solid white stuff came off, but eventually the scraper just pulled off mostly clear saliva. I have tried lots of different tests to make sure the scraper really works, including not brushing, waiting until my breath smells, then scraping. If my breath smells and I scrape, it immediately becomes neutral smelling. Right now I scrape twice a day then brush. I scrape until no solid white stuff comes off which is still 4-5 times (I guess it builds up fast?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the orabrush just to try it out and it isnt nearly as good which is surprising because of the reviews. For my tongue the stiffness of the steel  of the dr tung makes sure everything gets scraped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best products I have ever used because it is simple, inexpensive and completely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may still try to go a week using the orabrush as a test and I will update results here.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the cheap plastic one my dentist gave me.  Also, this feels pretty rough on my tongue.  It does a bad job and does not feel good.  Very Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, and I&#x27;m happy to have added it to my daily routine.  The design makes any gag reflex issue virtually nonexistent while the stainless steel does a great job of getting the tongue clean.  It&#x27;s really amazing what this thing can clean off!</li>
    <li> tl;dr- The product did not work.  It was a bit uncomfortable/painful when cleaning the back of my tongue.  And upon re-inspection after continued cycles of use in one cleaning session, there was still residue on my tongue that I&#x27;d remove using my toothbrush, my old standard method.  I&#x27;ll elaborate below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is advertised as being better at cleaning your tongue than a toothbrush.  Well, why is it that, after using Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner, I find myself using my toothbrush to remove any residual &#x27;white stuff&#x27; off of my tongue that the tongue cleaner missed?  And using the two in combination does not improve the clean, the tongue cleaner has made no improvement and had no positive benefit for my oral hygiene routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, maybe this product just doesn&#x27;t align well with the shape of my tongue.  When I stick my tongue out, there tends to be a depression down the middle of my tongue, from front to back, similar to a ravine.  Any residue in this area does not get cleaned.  So, I do my best to flatten my tongue out to get a thorough clean.  I should mention that a majority of this residue, in my case, is located near the back of my tongue, and this is where larger taste buds are located.  So, when I flatten my tongue and reach to the back to scrape it clean, the tongue cleaner roughly scrapes against these taste buds and it is quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to wearing uncomfortable clothes for the &#x27;sake of fashion,&#x27; I figure I&#x27;ll endure the slight pain/discomfort for the &#x27;sake of hygiene.&#x27;  I finish, close my mouth, and then open it again for a final inspection, and about 30% of the residue is on my tongue again.  This occurs whether I use the tongue cleaner before or after brushing my teeth.  Maybe this is caused by some freak phenomenon that only occurs in my mouth, because this product has such high ratings.  It was the ratings that let me put faith in buying the product.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  At least it wasn&#x27;t tooexpensive...</li>
    <li> I have an aweful gag reflex. This solved it. Love it and works great. Never knew what could come off your tongue. Have bad breath, this will solve it.</li>
    <li> I read through the reviews before I bought this.  I echo all the positives - the handles are easy to grip and use.  You don&#x27;t have to use much pressure to get a great cleaning.  No negatives to write about.</li>
    <li> I have used a plastic tongue cleaner that feels better than this stainless steel one.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner, and i don&#x27;t have that nasty morning breath anymore. Dont know why i didn&#x27;t know about this sooner. I always brushed my teeth twice a day, and used mouth wash, but my breath still kicked, and in the morning that breath tasted so nasty, it was horrible, after using this every night before i got to sleep, everything is great now.</li>
    <li> As described, quick shipment, works perfectly for the purpose for which it was intended.</li>
    <li> This thing tears bacteria off my tongue like nothing else. It also tears my tongue off my tongue a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said this is the big thing to do to help with bad breath. More important than mouth wash. So far he&#x27;s been right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be amazed at the nasty booger-looking stuff this pulls out of your mouth and into your drain.</li>
    <li> THANKS TO DR.TUNG&#x27;S TONGUE CLEANER I WILL NEVER KISS ANYONE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to remove all of the white stuff on my tongue, but I suppose that white stuff is stuck in the crevices of my tongue. It removes all of the superficial gunk on your tongue and it&#x27;s easy to use. I noticed the metal looks a little aged, there are some small little scratches on the sides. My tongue is still has white stuff, but I suppose my issue is more severe for this tongue cleaner to handle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because bad breath just grosses me out. I also cant stand a &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34;looking tongue. This thing is great, my breath stays fresher longer and I just feel cleaner. Only thing I would warn you about is to be careful, any more than a few gentle passes will actually leave you sore for a few days.</li>
    <li> Great product, its disgusting to see how much GUNK is on your tongue. It definitely does what it promises. .Only reason why I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because it can sometimes leaves my tongue feeling dry.</li>
    <li> like everyone else, loveee this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other tongue cleaners before - namely the plastic ones that bend and have plastic tines or &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on them to scrub your tongue.  I was suspicious about this one since the metal is flat - that it wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; as well as the teeth one I&#x27;ve used before.  But it works amazingly well - much better than anyone I&#x27;ve used before.  It scrubs more per swipe and cleans better and quicker.  I use the tongue scraper every night - and I&#x27;m extremely glad I bought this one.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own one of these. Stop brushing your tongue with your toothbrush. My dentist told me that will only help create problems. Use this instead.</li>
    <li> It works very well and is easy to hang on to. My previous one was plastic and this work so mch better,</li>
    <li> The metal part is stamped out and has rough edges...not good for scraping your tongue!  I used some emery cloth to smooth it down, and now it&#x27;s fine.  You&#x27;d think that they&#x27;d take the ragged edges off before they package and sell it though...sheesh!</li>
    <li> If the idea of scraping your tongue grosses you out, this is the tongue scraper for you. It&#x27;s easy to use and gets as far back on your tongue as you need it to go. It&#x27;s made of stainless steel, so it isn&#x27;t going to become a harbor for hidden bacteria like a plastic scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, most importantly, it is dead simple to clean up. You just hold it under running water for 2 seconds and it looks brand new.</li>
    <li> First if your tongue is not used to it..it hurts but in less than 2days u get better n it works great</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. However I have noticed that the medal on this stainless steal tongue scrapper has cut my tongue. But that can be fixed with more delicate gestures. Other than that, this product really helps to keep my breath fresh.</li>
    <li> good tongue cleaner, does the job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful for me!</li>
    <li> Very simple and very effective. Seems to clean easily too.</li>
    <li> Too sharp.  Too inconvenient.  TheraBreath toothpaste does a much better job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the tongue scraper I was using before. I never gag and it cleans all the way to the back of my throat.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product the one complaint I have is that it feels a little to wide but that might just be a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I use this tongue cleaner to freshen my breath. It is very easy to clean.I have had mine for well over a year and it is still in good condition. When I can remember to clean my tongue before a meal it improves my taste sensitivity. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using different type of tongue scraper for years now...This product is soooooooooooo much better and does an incredible job in shorter time!! hurray, VERY HAPPY!</li>
    <li> My family has a problem with coated tounges. Don&#x27;t know what it is, but despite my father being a dentist and trying lots of other tongue scrapers that helped little, my family just accepted it. I&#x27;m the most particular with my dental health out of my family, so when I saw this and the great reviews I decided to try it. I&#x27;m glad I did! Man does this thing do the trick!! Just be careful not to over do it (a habit I got from using lesser tongue scrapers). If you do, you&#x27;ll just have a day or two slightly sore tongue. I rinse it after use, but also can throw it in the dishwasher with the silverware to get it extra clean when it needs it :) I recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought this product b/c of the great reviews and it was worth it. It&#x27;s a great product and it really does clean your tongue. You will be surprise the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> Throw away that crappy plastic tongue cleaner and use this!  It is sharp (but not too sharp) and will really get EVERYTHING off your tongue! I LOVE the design and its so comfortable to use!!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it works better than a toothbrush cleaning the tongue. This stuff is not too sharp where it would cut your tongue, and yet not to blunt where it wouldn&#x27;t work well. The great part is that its stainless steel, so it wont rust, and lasts long as long as you keep it clean and stored in a hygienic environment.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this from my dental hygenist.  I get dry mouth from some medications which gives me stank breath sometimes.  What I really like about this product is the scraper is metal so I&#x27;m never grossed out since it cleans off really easily.  If it was plastic or some other kind of porous material, I&#x27;d be worried about bacterial growth.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tongue cleaner out there. I have been using this product for years and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I have used many tongue brushes so far but this is the easiest to use. It reaches way back and cleans real easily. Good price too.    UPDATE 09-2014 : The brush stills works fine, but some time ago the plastic handles started to split at the top allowing scum to accumulate there. yuk. Will have to replace. If they made the handles sturdier these would last for years and years.</li>
    <li> A very good product! It&#x27;s affordable and actually works! I highly recommend it to anyone who cares about their dental hygiene</li>
    <li> Gentle but effective. When I first used it, my tongue seemed a bit sensitive but now I use it about once a week and it works good.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I see a huge improvement I the way my breath \\&quot;smells\\&quot; when it&#x27;s inside my, but when I breath my boyfriend says he can longer smell anything unless I don&#x27;t use the scraper for a couple days!</li>
    <li> Excellent...tongue clean and mouth smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> If you do not feel you have the money to spend for this, I suggest using the side of a spoon which will provide approximately the same result.</li>
    <li> Feels sharp on the tongue however it does get the grime off your tongue. It&#x27;s an amazing tool and breathe is fresher!</li>
    <li> Getting a tongue cleaner may not normally be high on your priority list for dental hygiene, but it works surprisingly well and is very gentle on your tongue. I am using a mouth wash that has a somewhat bad aftertaste, so I figured I&#x27;d get a tongue scraper to wipe my tongue off rather than using my fingernails. This is a great little gadget for just that purpose, however I was surprised at how great my tongue felt afterward and how pink it is now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try for yourself - it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive. I&#x27;m recommending them to all my family and friends (most just look at me funny, sigh!).</li>
    <li> Once you use these types of tongue cleaners you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> good oral tool&#x27; glad i ordered it</li>
    <li> Not sure why this is so highly rated - I wanted to like it since I bought it for use in my 2nd bathroom downstairs.  Not only did it slightly cut my tongue drawing blood during first use, it is not nearly as effective at removing the undesirable stuff even after multiple passes.  If I push down any harder, the tongue will hurt or probably bleed again.  Contrast this with an unremarkable plastic scoop-type of scraper that I&#x27;ve used for a very long time that gets it done in 1 or 2 passes.  The only benefit to using this over the plastic scoop is you can get this in deeper on the tongue, but what good is that if it isn&#x27;t as effective to begin with?  Giving 2 stars for the design idea, but otherwise disappointing.</li>
    <li> Gets stuff off my tongue, but when its all said and done I did not really find much of a difference compared to when I used my toothbrush to brush my tongue. I still use it every day before I brush just because its nice to see all that stuff come off and not mix with my toothbrush anymore. If this cost $10+ then I would probably call this a waste of money, but for $5 its a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I should add, don;t scrape your tongue too hard, I did that when I first began using it and my tongue was really sore for a few days and I could not taste well, so go easy on your tongue.</li>
    <li> It is pretty simple and works great.  Use it several times a week. Easy to use, easy to clean.  I like simple and easy.</li>
    <li> I love this tongue scraper, it is the best one on the market for sure.  I will never buy a plastic one again.</li>
    <li> I like how easy it is to clean compared with my old plastic tongue cleaner. It also does a better job cleaning, most likely due to the edge of the stainless steel and the larger area of the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34;. The rubber handles are also pleasing and secure to hold on to.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have owned.  While traveling the USA this summer on a 10 week camping trip, I lost mine.  I bought another brand and was disappointed.  This removes all the excess gunk on the tongue.  Use to be no matter how many times a day I brushed I would still notice an odor that others were kind enough to tell me.  Once I started using this, no more odor!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I  never  used  a  tongue  scraper  before  so I  have  nothing  to compare this  with  but  it  does  a  good  job.  I  was  surprised  by  how  much  goop  came  off  my  tongue .</li>
    <li> Want to see something disgusting? Use this product on your &amp;#34;seemingly clean&amp;#34; tongue. When I did, I accumulated quite a layer of what I call &amp;#34;Tongue Cheese.&amp;#34; Ya ... it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Simple, solid, sturdy design&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Chicks digg kissing me (and this product helps for sure)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT CHEAPSKATE</li>
    <li> Does what it says. I like the grip, seems pretty decent quality. Thanks, Dr. Tung. (words to meet minimum requirement)</li>
    <li> I have used various plastic tongue cleaners in the past, but they just didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have liked; the plastic was not very effective in cleaning the tongue, and many of them were poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this thing today and have so far used it twice. My tongue feels cleaner than it has in a long time. Don&#x27;t press at all on the first pass; if that feels comfortable you can gradually increase the pressure. Personally, I press about as hard as I do when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: After you&#x27;re done scraping, dip your toothbrush in a little mouth-rinse and gently brush your tongue; it leaves you with a nice fresh feeling and helps to kill any remaining bacteria that you might have missed.</li>
    <li> This product is great and easy to use. I use this about once a day at night and you can definitely tell it scrapes alot of bad \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; off your tongue. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very odd, but nothing came off my tongue but spit. i was looking forward to cleaning my tongue. i thought for sure it would be covered in gunk. i stroked over it several times and NOTHING. i have never cleaned my tongue before with any other cleaner, not even a toothbrush. odd, odd, odd.</li>
    <li> Dr Tungs tongue cleaner is by far the easiest way to throughly get rid of the bacteria coating sticking to your tongue, It glides smoothly, scraping off the layers of goo.&lt;br /&gt;Scrape, rinse, repeat and your tongue is pink and healthy again&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the tongue brushes</li>
    <li> Pretty standard tongue cleaner - gets the job done for sure! Lots of colors to choose from and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t hurt your tongue. Would order this product again. Recommend it if you need a cleaner for your tongue.</li>
    <li> I like this metal tongue scraper much better than the plastic variety. I always had trouble with the handles cracking on the plastic ones (just call me The Hulk!). I sure don&#x27;t have that problem with the metal.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. It bends such that the entire tongue won&#x27;t be cleaned. I spent over two weeks using this everyday and saw no difference. My wife didn&#x27;t notice any difference either. I bought it based on the good reviews and while I don&#x27;t hate it, I definitely didn&#x27;t like it nor see it as effective for me. It may work for others, but my rough and ready tongue was resilient to its charm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much into accessories of any kind so I buy things when I think it&#x27;s absolutely necessary for my routine. After feeling my tongue would appreciate a good cleaning I decided to buy a metal cleaner instead of a brush because 1) brushing seemed to require more pressure on the tongue and offset the gagging reflex more 2) stainless steel just seemed more hygienic. I&#x27;m loving these steel cleaners, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend scrapping the back of the tongue too strongly because the bigger glands will hurt and make you feel like you have a sore throat. Otherwise, it does a great job and making you realize how gross your tongue has been for so long. I use it 2 a day and still, there&#x27;s some funky things that come out.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend using a tongue cleaner and if you decide a metal scraper is for you, this specific one if great.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s easy to get over-enthusiastic and scrape your tongue a little too hard, which can cause bleeding and oral bacteria to enter the bloodstream. do it gently but with more repetitions for best results</li>
    <li> Does not work very well, I would recommend tongue scrapers instead of this it&#x27;s OK at best. I prefer reg tongue scapers.</li>
    <li> It can reach the back without triggering gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works very well, disgusting scrapings show how much food and bacteria trapped on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tongue is getting nice pink color again.</li>
    <li> I had to add to my review because I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now. This tongue cleaner makes your tongue feel fresh when you use it. Before, i used to be a self-consious about my breath because it felt as if I had bad breath. Now, my tongue feels fresh and I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath anymore.</li>
    <li> Best tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used so far! Thanks!</li>
    <li> definitely a great health item</li>
    <li> Reboot your Oral Hygiene. You are not special, your mouth is just a bacterial dumping grounds and you refuse to admit it. Clean it up with this industrial solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has improved my oral health to the point where I feel pathetic that I did not own and use one every day for the majority of my adult life. Live and learn. No more stinky breath, no more waking up with a mouth that is like a chemical war zone. Worth $7 all day.</li>
    <li> Very durable for price. Works great, doesn&#x27;t induce gagging. Cannot believe how much came off my tongue from the first few scrapings.</li>
    <li> I had just gotten my teeth cleaned and they were so white and pretty, that I wanted to keep them that way.  So I bought whitening toothpaste and rinse. After using both for a week, because of all the hydrogen peroxide, I got black tongue.  It&#x27;s gross.  I got rid of the rinse and started brushing my tongue to get the crap off...which was making my tongue angry.  I got this after looking up remedies.  It&#x27;s wild and got rid of the black strings without aggravating my taste buds.  I have noticed since using the scraper, that it helps when you are sick (scrapes that gross coating on your tongue that you get).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I have to still learn is how to not gag.  It happens from time to time.  I highly recommend and think dentists should recommend more often.</li>
    <li> This scraper is very sturdy, and very convenient to use. It can be held with both hands or just one, and works equally effectively. It is strong enough to be able to apply as much pressure as you choose, but it is also thin enough to reach far back into the throat without affecting the gag reflex too much. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and store.</li>
    <li> What an excellent concept and product. It is effective at thoroughly cleaning the tongue in a way that brushing simply cannot approach. I&#x27;ve been using mine daily for several years now, and the rubber handles are starting to wear and discolor a bit. I may replace it soon-ish (with the exact same one). I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using a tongue scraper.  I don&#x27;t have bad breath problems or anything, but I kept reading in articles that it was really recommended for oral hygiene, so I figured why not.  I didn&#x27;t want to get one of the gummy bristle types because it seems like those are just inviting bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to do the trick; it has scraped off weird gray sludge and left my tongue pink after, so I suppose it&#x27;s done something.  A very solid product, I&#x27;m sure it will hold up for years to come - unlike all those plastic disposable tongue cleaners out there.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Paleo breath no more!</li>
    <li> WOW--I&#x27;ve never had a cleaner tongue.  There have been reviews that suggest this cleaner cut their tongues.  I have no idea how this is remotely possible as it&#x27;s not at all sharp.  I use two hands as it makes it easier to control it all the way to the back of my tongue.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does its duty well. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does its job so well!</li>
    <li> Not the miracle worker that other reviewers claim but still a good tounge cleaner</li>
    <li> I love this scraper! My mouth has never felt cleaner and more ready to be dirtied.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner is far superior to the plastic version. It is much more effective and gets the job done. My only gripe with this product is that it has a tendency to build up grime. However that could be due to my neglect. Regardless this is an excellent product and made my tongue red like the Russian flag</li>
    <li> No matter how many times I go over my tongue, with both light and medium/hard pressure, it&#x27;s still white. I do see it removing a lot of bacteria and gunk and I love that I am able to spit it out and wash it away VS brushing it with a toothbrush and spreading it. My mouth and tongue also feel clean and I don&#x27;t have bad breath but I am so used to seeing my tongue pink after using my toothbrush. This is my first time using this type of product. I used to use a regular toothbrush but now I brush my teeth with my Oral B 4000 and rinse with Listerine. Any recommendations?</li>
    <li> This is my first tongue scraper so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others, but I can tell you that since I smoked until about a year ago, my tongue has been anything but appealing, and definitely did not have a soft, pink, muscly look.  But now it does.  But I&#x27;m not trying to brag about my sexy tongue.  It is just proof to me that the layers of \\&quot;whatever\\&quot; which were accumulated on it have been stripped off in just a few days normal (GENTLE) use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found is that this scraper doesn&#x27;t give you as much gag as say, your finger, but it definitely DOES give you a gag if you try to stick it on the very back of your tongue.  However, spitting seems to pull the stuff from the back to the front.  Not the fire a loogie type spitting, more like when you spit that last bit of toothpaste into the sink.  This pushes the mucous and \\&quot;whatever\\&quot; forward so you can easily grab it with another swipe of the tongue, starting about halfway back.  Repeating this process over and over (maybe ten times), you find that you are no longer pushing the stuff to the front of your tongue anymore and your tongues looks quite healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job quite well.  Your tongue may need to get used to the feeling of the smooth steel pressing on it, but BE GENTLE and work your way up to hard scrapes and for heaven&#x27;s sake you should not be drawing blood.  Good luck and healthy tongues :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird to write a review for something as mundane as a tongue cleaner, but I have to say that this one really works! I&#x27;ve tried other plastic ones with really so-so results, and have tried the toothbrushes with the tongue cleaner side only to feel like my tongue was rubbed raw. When I came across this I figured I might as well drop my $7 and give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the steel makes this sturdy, yet it&#x27;s gentle enough to use daily. A couple of swipes does the job and now I have a pink tongue and fresh breath everyday. To top it all off, this little tool should last for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy - I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have a terrible gag reflex when brushing my tongue. Product made it easier, and definitely works. My tongue thanks this product. I&#x27;m sure there are other ways to go about brushing your tongue, but this product works and has made my morning routine bearable.</li>
    <li> I got this thing because my spoon give up on me. Just kidding, there&#x27;s a difference between using this and a spoon. I love this because of 1 things, it feel good after i scrape my tongue. :-P&lt;br /&gt;I literally just want to stick my tongue out and show everyone how pink it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really describe the difference between this and a spoon, but definitely use this, and it&#x27;ll lesson the gag reflex. If you&#x27;re sick of using your spoon and want to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Mouth feels fresh after brushing and cleaning the tongue with this cleaner. It is a good habit to use this regularly to avoid all the plaque collection!</li>
    <li> I had been cleaning my tongue with a soft regular toothbrush. The reason for purchase was to try this bizarre looking product. I found it ineffective and could potentially scratch/bleed the tongue. Going back to the old way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping....received as stated</li>
    <li> works better than plastic ones, and washes well.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I am impressed by how well this product works. There&#x27;s not much to it but it is far better than a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Construction seems durable, I expect it to last many years.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few days ago and got a very prompt delivery only 4 days later. I don&#x27;t have much to say but that I&#x27;m quite disappointed in this product. The most-helpful reviewer probably wrote his review to show off his skills with writing rather than the actual effectiveness or quality of the product. I only have this much to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s essentially a thin metal bar bent into a U shape and is quite flexible and can be bent as wished.&lt;br /&gt;2. A small, cavernous metal spoon can do the same job this product can if you can find a spoon small enough to fit into your mouth completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it yesterday and today, I found out that while it got rid of the white goo on my tongue, once I cleaned off the goo, the hairs on the tongue were still white no matter how much I rubbed this thing on my tongue. I even rubbed until I made my tongue bleed at one point and it was still as white as before. So, while this may work for some people, this is definitely not for me. And also, I do not have geography tongue and this product may have been designed for those with geography tongue.</li>
    <li> if you love your spouse get this its the best thing out their for your mouth.. its also very healthy for you</li>
    <li> Does the trick. Buy a stainless steel tongue cleaner NOT the plastic kind. I would also do away with the plastic handle. I have another Tongue Cleaner that is 30 years old wider in back and with a simpler and easier to handle because the entire shaft is one-length stainless steel. With this one I have to take several swipes and it doesn&#x27;t get the sides of the tongue as well. Still use a tongue scraper to remove bacteria as a part of your brush, floss, (water pik - use an Oral Breeze water cleaner which connects to faucet directly and not the huge, expensive, clunky, noisy, electric connected device)</li>
    <li> Little pricey good product would recommend it</li>
    <li> The tongue cleaner is constructed well and easy to clean. The overall design is just good and makes cleaning your tongue a snap.</li>
    <li> For years I have tried to find a way to brush my tongue, but my gag reflex is horrible!  I noticed these here on Amazon with good reviews so got one for myself and my adult son.  Yes!  Finally a tongue cleaner than doesn&#x27;t make me gag!  On 1-23-13 paid $5.90 each with free shipping.  Would absolutely buy again, although they seem to be of great quality, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll have to!</li>
    <li> you have to be careful otherwise you will hurt your tongue, other than that if used as described will help you get your tongue pink....</li>
    <li> This product effectively cleans my tongue. It also improves my breath. As a coffee drinker, I get a nasty yellowish hue on my tongue. It also makes my breath smell bad. I use this ting to scrape my tongue and it gets rid of the yellowish residue from my tongue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a tongue cleaner before, but I think this one works really well. I use it daily and it has seemed to help!</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Doesn&#x27;t hurt when I scrape my tongue. First tongue cleaner ever!</li>
    <li> This cleaner works great.  I&#x27;ve had challenges in the past with bad breath as tastes used to stick to my filliform papillae.  With this device I&#x27;m able to really clean tongue as I&#x27;ve tried numerous tooth brushes.  If your tongue papillae is like carpet and thick - I recommend this device as its a great tool to rid of all unwanted particles, coating, debris, etc.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this product does indeed make your tongue look cleaner, takes off the white film. But the metal is a bit harsh on the tongue. Also, you do have to scrap it more than once.</li>
    <li> This product works great!</li>
    <li> You guys can flame me if you want. I bought this two years ago and left it in the cabinet this whole entire time. Through out the entire time I was just using my electric toothbrush. I guess I find it more faster you know. Brush teeth, head straight to tongue after, and rinse. Well guess what? My toothbrush died after three years. Then I was using a manual brush so I thought hmm I&#x27;ll give Dr. Tung tongue scraper a try. OH boy, I was blown how amazing this thing cleaned! Much much better than my toothbrush. The only thing different between this and my toothbrush is the after taste. Dr. Tung left metal taste which one last for few minutes and my brush left a toothpaste taste. Anyways, this product rocks.</li>
    <li> Lately I have been having a problem with buildup on my tongue.  I have recently quit smoking and unfortunately (and a bit scary) for me this seems related to my smoking in some way.  I had been using disposable plastic floss picks with a tongue scraper with limited success.  A dentist recommended a real tongue scraper.  I decided to give this one a try.  The instructions state to run the tongue cleaner over your tongue 3-4 times.  I like to run it firmly over my tongue at least 5 times.  Unfortunately, with repeated use I have found that this causes my tongue to bleed.  If I do not run it over my tongue hard enough, it removes very little.  If I run it over too hard it often causes my tongue to bleed.  In either case, after using this product for months, I just do not see it being better than just brushing your tongue well, because after you use this product you have to brush your tongue anyway.  I originally gave this product 5 stars, but have since found that at least for me, this product is only effective at removing excess amounts of buildup and is not particularly more useful to me than using my toothbrush alone.  I think that a dedicated tongue brush would be a better option for myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this tongue cleaner and its the best tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve ever use. Used to be a loyal orabrush fan, but its wasn&#x27;t effective like dr tungs tongue cleaner.Just started using it and I cant believe that there was a lot of gunk on my tongue... Personally I thought Orabrush was doing its job, but its wasn&#x27;t. Thank you Dr Tung, You&#x27;re the best and took a lot of Gunk on my tongue.. Shame on you Orabrush and Your Pyramid Scam. All this time I was wasting my money on good for nothing tongue cleaners like Orabrush. P.s You don&#x27;t have to replace Dr tung every three months and you can use it for years.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how good this thing works.  I also cannot believe how gross my tongue is.  The stuff I get off of with this thing is shocking.  It is a great little tool and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like this for ease of use. Keep one at home and one at the office for after lunch, especially if you brush after eating</li>
    <li> Well, maybe not for some of you. But still, it&#x27;s really gross. It peels gunk off your tongue like week old roadkill. Does a great job of freshening your breath ofter a few uses though. I dig it.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. Scrapes my tongue. Cleans my tongue. Tongue, scraped and clean, in my mouth.... in my mouth, my tongue is clean. Thank you Dr. Tung.</li>
    <li> this item most definitely did the job,  it really removed all of the plaque that I had on my tongue... I would recommend this to you!!!! however my daughter bought one and it caused her to gag.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Someone recommended that I get a METAL (not plastic) tongue scraper instead of brushing my tongue and I have to say, I can&#x27;t believe the difference!  I&#x27;ve had bumps on my tongue for as long as I can remember and always assumed they were just part of my tongue.  NOPE!  Used this every day for a week or two and they are gone!  I will never go back to brushing alone.</li>
    <li> Quite a bit more impressive than I had expected. Very simple and effective machine. I&#x27;ve tried other methods of removing the white gunk on my tongue and none have worked even nearly as well as this tongue scraper. Really, really happy that it doesn&#x27;t make me gag and tear up like rubbing a toothbrush on my tongue does. Be careful - don&#x27;t get too carried away as I did my first time using and my tongue ended up bleeding a bit. But this haven&#x27;t happened since then, so it isn&#x27;t a concern of mine.</li>
    <li> One reviewer commented that it has no bite and I have to agree.  I get better results from the plastic $1.00 scraper I bought from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Bought this to improve my breath and digestive system, really seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;Fast and efficient, leaves your tongue sparkling clean!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from halitosis for years until I used this tongue cleaner. It is handy &amp; practical after every brushing &amp; flossing.</li>
    <li> works just as described and its alot better than using a toothbrush to clean your tongue. I couldnt believe how much junk was on my tongue after using this. Id recommend this to anyone that likes to have a clean tongue</li>
    <li> For years I barely brushed my tongue because it always made me gag. Only thing I could use to clean my tongue was mouthwash. This product has now allowed my tongue to know what it is like to be truly clean. After eating something dark like chocolate, it&#x27;s pretty disgusting to see what was still left in your mouth even after brushing.This is a simple product that does it&#x27;s job right and effectively.</li>
    <li> Best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve ever used so far, it really does the job and I really like the fact that isn&#x27;t plastic so you can pretty much keep it as long as you wish.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is the best tongue cleaner ever invented.</li>
    <li> Why had I never found this tongue cleaner before. It is AWESOME!!! Used others that were awful, but this one is tongue scraper on steroids. FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> I started using the tongue cleaner and immediately my breath started smelling fresher. No more dragon breath for me!  I use this in conjunction w/ brushing, and rinsing with special mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dentist and highly recommend this tongue cleaner. A lot of the bacteria that causes bad breath is on your tongue. This does a great job at scraping it all away. It&#x27;s a little gross actually to see how much bacteria you can scrape off the tongue even after you&#x27;ve brushed it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this after my Tongue Sweeper Pro was lost. This is just as easy to use, works just as well if not better. It doesn&#x27;t look like a cool dental tool, but that&#x27;s just a trifling aesthetic concern.</li>
    <li> I had been using a plastic tongue cleaner before but thought I&#x27;d try this one and I am so glad I did! This tongue cleaner is amazing. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good one. It always makes me wonder why everyone isn&#x27;t using one. They are really missing out on fresher breath and a really clean feeling mouth!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, although by the time I got it I had also purchased a water pick with a tongue cleaning head.  I use this thing every once in a while but it feels odd having to rinse it with alcohol from time to time then throw it back into the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product I bought two of this product one for my wife and for me she thinks it&#x27;s a great product as well. Thank you for these.</li>
    <li> Once you use this product, you will never be able to live without it. This may seem like a bad thing, but your significant other will thank you ;) 80%+ of bad breath can be fixed by cleaning your tongue.​</li>
    <li> One of the best on the market - I&#x27;ve tried other Tongue Cleaner&#x27;s but Dr. Tung&#x27;s is the BEST.  Appreciate the Stainless Steel quality &amp; design...</li>
    <li> Well I got hooked on this thing pretty quickly! It&#x27;s part of my routine now and if I forget to use it, it&#x27;s like forgetting to brush my teeth. I&#x27;d never used one before I got this so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but this one does the trick just fine. I&#x27;m not sure if it *really* helps with anything, or rids of toxins or whatever - I mean I&#x27;ve lived my whole life just fine for 46 years until I tried this (unless never scraping my tongue is what gave me MS!!?).  It does, however make me feel cleaner - I mean, brushing, flossing and using this - what else can you do to clean your dirty mouth?  :)</li>
    <li> Really great product that gets the bacteria out of your mouth. Its metal and not plastic so that is a great thing right there..Just dip in in hot water and its sanitized for the next use. You can use one hand or two..Gives you a clean mouth if you throw it in with your dental hygiene regimen</li>
    <li> Great product! Super fast shipping! This is a wonderful tool for detoxing. Highly recommended. It arrived super fast and I was able to use the product right away.</li>
    <li> These are the best most durable tongue cleaners.  These clean deeper and dont break every year like those cheap pieces of crap. Cher forced Miley Cyrus to buy one.</li>
    <li> Purposely purchased this for the color so that my husband and I would have different colors.  Color that arrived was blue.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and met my expectations. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used plastic tongue scrapers in the past. I thought they were the best! When I saw this on Amazon I decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t regret! Such a useful tool. 85 % of the bacteria is on the inner side of the cheeks and tongue, and not on the teeth, so its important for these to be cleaned on regular basis. I prefer this tongue scraper so much more than the plastic ones, that I needed to change often. It cleans better than them too.  Would never replace it with another type now~</li>
    <li> The back of my tongue collects bacteria. Bacteria that smells like dog-breath.  Mouthwash can mask it, but once that wears off, that dog-breath comes back with a wagging vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tongue cleaners help a lot if you can reach far back enough.  The cheap plastic ones tend to make me gag, maybe because they are much thicker than this metal one.  This metal cleaner works great, the gagging doesn&#x27;t start until the 3rd or 4th scrape, and by that time I&#x27;m done anyway. So I&#x27;m very happy with it and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who doubt the effectiveness of a tongue scraper:  eat some chocolate.  Then brush your teeth.  Think you&#x27;re all clean and fresh?  Well now go scrape that tongue, reaching as far back as you can:  see all that chocolate saliva come out?  It takes a good 3 or 4 scrapes to get most of that saliva to start turning clear.  If you don&#x27;t scrape, think of all that bacteria that accumulates there and starts smelling...</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Cleans your tongue better than just brushing alone.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I have cut my tongue several times using this.  I know you will say, &amp;#34;well stop scraping so hard moron&amp;#34;.  haha.  But, I just prefer a plastic one.  The steel is to rough for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned my tongue as part of my regular oral hygiene process since I was a child.  My mother taught me to use my toothbrush to brush my tongue.  It wasn&#x27;t until about 13 years ago that I discovered plastic tongue \\&quot;scrapers\\&quot;.  Then I discovered Dr. Tung on a trip to Hawaii (I believe it&#x27;s manufactured there).  The best product by far.  In addition to its simple and superior design, it is stainless steel - so for those concerned about BPA exposure from plastics, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> This thing is great, so much better than the cheap tongue cleaners they sell at Walmart, and wayyyy better than the ones on the back of your toothbrush. It&#x27;s a whole different ballgame with this little guy. Easy to use and leaves your tongue refreshed and clean!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as often as I should, but I like it and it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Rarely do I really come back and actually write a review, but wow, thing thing has literally changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone 30 years of my life having the worst breath known to man. I would brush and brush, and within 20 minutes I&#x27;d be back to the same. I never knew how to get rid of it. I tried other tongue scrapers - scraped all the way to the back of my tongue, barely any result. It has had a profound crippling effect on social interactions and my personality. I have always shied away from talking at a close distance or even carrying on a conversation with others because I would be able to smell my own horrible breath (yeah, that&#x27;s how bad, really.) Not to mention talking to the opposite sex and thinking about how to get through a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to do more research on the subject and dig deeper into the actual causes of bad breath. I finally decided that tonsil stones were the culprit and that I would probably need surgery. During a tad more research, I came upon this little item on Amazon. I decided to give it a try because I figured I&#x27;ve tried everything else. I really had no expectation it would do anything, until I received it and tried it out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, just, wow... I couldn&#x27;t believe how much crap this thing was pulling off my tongue. Just as others on here have said it&#x27;s gross to watch but at the same time it&#x27;s amazing. I followed up with some mouthwash rinse (and of course flossed and brushed prior) and saw how long it would take for the crappy breath to come back... it didn&#x27;t!!!!! Better yet, the next food I had throughout the day, I could taste EVERYTHING. It was like my taste buds were a newborn&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you have suffered from bad breath, give this a try, you will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to Dr. Tung, my hats off to you for making this product. You literally have changed my life, and for that I am very grateful. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Dr. Tung&#x27;s Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner works incredibly. Definitely would buy again if I had the money. It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use, yet works great.</li>
    <li> The tongue scraper does the job. I prefer the stainless steel over plastic one--sturdier and more sanitary.</li>
    <li> I was using the plastic Tongue Cleaner for quite a while, but those would eventually break.  Switched to this one and have been reasonably pleased.  You do have to be a bit more gentle when using this one as you could scrap/cut your tongue if you use too much force.</li>
    <li> I would give this a 10 star if I could. Surprisingly simple and easy to use but works. Excellent convenient cleaning. My tongue has never been this clean ... Ever! Thanks to Dr. Tung. Would highly recommend to someone in the market for similar product.</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue cleaner - long lasting, easily kept clean steel, with comfortable &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t beat a thin, smooth-edged steel to scrape the tongue. Forget plastic!</li>
    <li> sturdy, well constructed. Lasted a few years and still going strong. It is a good brand. Does not fall apart easily.</li>
    <li> Never rusts; cleans phenomenally; and the grips are super comfy.  These tongue cleaners are not abrasive and don&#x27;t cause your tongue to bleed or anything.  I have been using them for over 8 years and love them.</li>
    <li> I come from a family where we all naturally have bad breathe..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and so I thought the answer was mouth wash, mints, and etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all kinds of mints...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and my breathe still smelled like horse @#$%^&amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I gave this a try with a lil skepticism but thankfully since I have received this tongue scraper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has worked extremely well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no longer do i have to worry about bad breathe when trying to \\&quot;pull game\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a tongue cleaner before but my dentist recommended it.  I was amazed how simple and great it works.  My tongue has never felt cleaner and my breathe the same.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I use it every morning and I have to say I did not expect to have so much debris on my tongue, yuck! You feel like your tongue is clean after using this that a tooth brush cannot do.</li>
    <li> I had found one of these at my local WalMart years ago, and I used it every day. It was amazing. My tongue had never been so perfectly pink. If I went more than a day without using it, I could feel the buildup on my tongue, and I could taste my breath. It was awful. But then I moved, and it got lost somewhere in between houses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I&#x27;d to go WalMart and pick another one up. They didn&#x27;t have any. I checked every store I could think of, and all anyone had was the Orabrush. So I figured it would be better than nothing. It worked alright, but if you wanted a rigorous clean, it would end up being painful. So I could only really get a small fraction of tongue gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went looking on Amazon and voila! Here it is. This came along in a safety razor package I ordered, and on the very first use I scraped off enough gunk to make me a little nauseous. The Orabrush doesn&#x27;t even come close to how clean this thing can make your tongue, and after just one use. You don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. This is one of my absolute must-haves for my daily routine. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of a gross procedure, but the before and after is definitely noticeable. This particular version looks and feels like it&#x27;ll last forever, and is exceptionally easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always tried brushing my tongue but it never really go anything off. For a while my solution was a salt rinse to get rid of tongue gunk. (you know the one... it&#x27;s especially prominent after eating sugar!) This thing is fantastic, I couldn&#x27;t imagine my nightly routine without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review where someone cut themselves with it... I was careful when I first got it and didn&#x27;t put too much pressure on it just in case, but now I can do it one handed and I don&#x27;t think that even if I put a lot of pressure on it, that I could easily cut myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to wax poetic about a tongue cleaner - this is a small, relatively sharp-edged instrument that when dragged across the tongue scrapes off what&#x27;s on it...  It would take an impressive degree of incompetence to mess it up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using at least once a day in the morning before or after shower and have been trying to do before I sleep and I do see a great difference from the crap on my tongue so that makes me feel better about myself. I also have been drinking more water along with using this so I hope to have a clean fresh breath within the next 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, very sturdy construction. Ease of use, effortless with one hand despite two handles. Very pleased about stainless steel.</li>
    <li> non gimmick and durable.it&#x27;s a great added tool to my everyday regiment. it does what it says it does. Period.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do Easy to clean, easy to use. I have had no issues so far.</li>
    <li> So far this product works as described. The only downside to it is that I now have an extra step when I brush my teeth. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I buy a few of these at a time? Stainless and easy to sanitize. Indispensable addition to oral hygiene around here!</li>
    <li> uncomfortably sharp - was much happier with the cheap plastic one I had previously</li>
    <li> Gets rid of all the gunk in less than 30 seconds. Keeps breath smelling clean.</li>
    <li> had some trouble with the order...item was missing...first time around but second time i received.&lt;br /&gt;i find the product works very well.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and I can easily tell the difference in my breath and the taste of food!  It took some getting used to at first, because it felt like my tongue was being rubbed a little raw, but that went away by day two or three.  I need to order a couple more for my office and gym bag.  You would be amazed by seeing just how much gunk comes off your tongue and seeing the natural color of your tongue!</li>
    <li> Works so much better than a toothbrush. I hate when tongues are white. Gross! Love how it leaves my mouth feeling cleaner, too.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  I changed my oral health for the better just using this simple device once or twice daily.  It is portable, painless and will give you a much cleaner feeling tongue and improve your sense of taste and much more.  A great investment in your dental well being!</li>
    <li> Good product- unfortunately the actual package was not sealed.</li>
    <li> Your money is worth and it will come for couple of years and works great. I loved using it !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Someone reviewed that after using this tongue is pink for the first time in a long time. Can&#x27;t say the same, I had used it ever day for a week still have a lightly coated tongue, and really have a gagging problem. Of course it is not this cleaners problem, I have had the gag issue always, does not take much for it to happen.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it just in case it is working, just can not insert it to far back into my mouth.</li>
    <li> You will never be more please and disgusted with what comes off your tongue after you use this. Get one.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I can taste my food now!</li>
    <li> Does an OK job; however, it simply was not my &amp;#34;cup of tea.&amp;#34;  Too difficult for me to hold due to arthritis in my hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been trying to get rid of the whiteness on my tongue. I thought that perhaps my tongue was just naturally like that. I had heard of tongue scrapers but didn&#x27;t think they would make too much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning on getting my tongue pierced but didn&#x27;t want to have a disgusting tongue when I went. I decided to just go ahead and try it because it could potentially help me and I was willing enough. I ordered it and it showed up a few short days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unpacked it and I noticed it was extremely simple-looking. It&#x27;s a fairly thin bent piece of metal with grips. That&#x27;s it. I was sure at this point there wasn&#x27;t anything this product could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. Completely. It thoroughly scraped all of that gross whiteness right off my tongue. Something to note: People seem to think you just drag it once across your tongue and that&#x27;ll do the trick. For me, I had to do some pretty intense back and forth motions to get it to come up. Gently pulling it across wasn&#x27;t working but when I tried to do it harder I started seeing improvement. I did it for probably five minutes to reveal a nice pink and healthy tongue. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, while it somehow didn&#x27;t make my gag reflex act up, it was much more sore on the back of the tongue. I scrubbed that raw, since it had the most build up. It looked as if I actually scraped off minimal taste buds (three small ones that I saw). Just be aware that this could happen if you try this product.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a fantastic product that I&#x27;ll definitely be using, probably not daily for me but perhaps twice or thrice a week. It does what it says, and does it well!</li>
    <li> For me this tongue cleaner works much better than scrubbing with a toothbrush. I was surprised by how much &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34; it got off and how much better my mouth tasted after its use. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Works as well as everyone else says.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Careful not to press too hard as it could damage your taste buds. The bendable function is nice to reach the very back of your tongue.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works effectively.</li>
    <li> Does a great job cleaning your tongue. Be sure to scrap lightly, it is all you need and will allow you to make sure you only take the bad parts off of your tongue. Works much better then the back of the tooth brush style tongue cleaners. Tends to last for about six months before it shows signs of needing replacement (with every other day usage).</li>
    <li> looking for an alternative to my old tongue cleaner and found this product. read a few of the reviews posted on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;thought I would give it a try. Great product. everyone should try one!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really need or use it;.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know what a tongue cleaner was for most of my life, but I went with this after discovering them to get rid of bad breathe. It works well enough. It takes me like 10 passes to get my tongue mostly clean. I can never get my tongue completely clean with this. It doesn&#x27;t hurt. I would buy this again for sure, because it does get rid of bad breathe like a toothbrush never could.</li>
    <li> Does the job! I love this type of cleaner rather than the plastic generic one.</li>
    <li> You brush your teeth, but don&#x27;t forget about your tongue!  This is a great little gadget.</li>
    <li> I have been through multiple tongue cleaners that are plastic, and they have two things in common: they miss spots on the tongue, and they BREAK.  This one gets ALL the tongue and are solid and easy to use and WILL NOT BREAK.  It really is stainless steel!  I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one for my travel kit.  Buy this tongue cleaner and you will be happy and save money.  I rarely write reviews, but this tongue cleaner merits my taking time to tell others.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to any friends or family. I am very very happy with it. Just an all around great product!</li>
    <li> Definitely makes a difference in terms of how your mouth feels, however it didnt get me that super pink tongue I hoped for.  It does defintely help get a lot of goop off your tongue.  If your a smoker like me, youd be suprised at what you see come off lol.</li>
    <li> You know how sometimes you brush your teeth but your mouth still doesn&#x27;t feel clean?  This fixes that feeling.  I normally brush, scrape my tongue and then use mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Removes the gag reflex very well! Can reach the very back of my tongue without making it uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> better than the plastic scrapers</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Well made.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one of these! Highly satisfied. I use this twice a day, everyday. My mouth feels so much cleaner! LOVE!</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase.  It works.  I taste everything more intensly when I use it before eating.  My first lasted about 2 years Then the plastic ends began falling apart.</li>
    <li> Scrapes crud off your tongue!  Easy and very effective.  You just need to do it every few days or whenever you have some white gunk on your tongue.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and makes for a good filler item if you want to pad your shipment for free shipping.</li>
    <li> Really helps with mouth and dental health and breath.  Use this once a day.</li>
    <li> Far superior to what I was using before. Does a really good job.</li>
    <li> works better than any others</li>
    <li> Something so simple to do, brings about such good oral health. Got a whole bunch for the extended family as stocking stuffers. What better way to close off a year and bring in the next?</li>
    <li> I was using a plastic scraper from a dentist.  Wow, what a pleasure this scraper is after using one of those.  It reaches to the back of my tongue so much better and is very gentle feeling.  My kids have tried it too and liked it as well.  This tool makes tongue scraping seem easy to continue to do in my routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always felt that a metal stainless steel tongue cleaner is the best. This product is simple and easy to use. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is ok--but actually brushing my tongue and rinsing my mouth well after brushing works just as well. No big deal.</li>
    <li> Got one for my boyfriend and I. It really does get a lot of gunk out. I was really surprised and a little grossed out lol.</li>
    <li> Makes a huge difference. Can really scrape good and far back but be careful to not do it too hard.</li>
    <li> this tongue scraper/cleaner works pretty well.  no problems using it, and it does&#x27;t get rusty, which is obviously a good thing.</li>
    <li> As a first time tongue scraper, I was appalled at what came off my tongue and every day am still amazed when I use this thing. You think brushing and flossing, brushing your tongue is enough? Afraid not my friend. Try this out it will blow your mind!</li>
    <li> I have used the special toothbrushes with the textured backside and the plastic scrapers.  This is STEEL and it SCRAPES.  Looking at the crap it scrapes off makes me want to gag sometimes, but i&#x27;m pleased to get it off my tongue in the end.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> This is great and simple. My bad breath has subsided and I use it twice a day. They sent me a blue one which I have no complaints. Just FYI.</li>
    <li> Does the job!&lt;br /&gt;But a little bulky and difficult to stow &amp; travel with.&lt;br /&gt;I´ll stick with the tongue cleaner company one!</li>
    <li> I have never tried a tongue cleaner before, but I am very happy with this.  It seems very durable, and it is certainly effective.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> This seems to work well. Scrapes off some wonderful looking bacteria and keeps my mouth very clean. I use it before brushing my teeth.Would recommend to anyone looking to complete their oral morning and evening program.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d never know what a funky garden of muck you&#x27;re growing on your tongue unless you scrape it off regularly!  Use this cleaner - it&#x27;s really effective.  It takes some trial and error to get the angle/draw/pressure right, but once you do you&#x27;ll be able to get your tongue clean enough to eat off of!</li>
    <li> This product in great.  Does exactly what it says it does.  Very easy to clean, very easy to use.  I never knew I needed to do this, but I thoroughly enjoy using this product daily.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a tongue cleaner until my hygienist recommended it.  Ordered it and love the results.  Only takes a few minutes to use and you can see immediate results.</li>
    <li> One use, two cuts on my tongue.</li>
    <li> Wanted something other than my toothbrush to clean my tongue. After some research, I found a ton of great reviews on Amazon from many people about Dr.Tung&#x27;s Tongue cleaner and it was very affordable, so decided to give it try.  It&#x27;s a pretty simple design, but very effective.  The only other tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used came with Sonic electronic toothbrush, and it was plastic with three or four ridges on a flat surface.  When used with the Sonic vibrating toothbrush base, it made me gag nearly every time.  In comparison, I hardly ever gag with Dr. Tung&#x27;s device, and this cleans so much more.  I highly recommend this cleaner.</li>
    <li> It is disgusting to know and to have white Tongue Cheese, a gunk at the back of your tongue. This removes it well enough. Other items are brushes you need to replace that can be costly. Nonsense. Scrape as many times as you like... for 5 min if that is what you desire. Then brush your tongue with a good electric toothbrush vigorously while brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why these aren&#x27;t as common as toothbrushes and dental floss. It works and it makes your mouth feel great. I&#x27;ll never be without one again.</li>
    <li> Helped decreasing bad breath.  Hard to believe GUNK on the tongue !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel, well made to last.  Rinse off, ready for next brushing.</li>
    <li> i bought a tongue cleaner because i have read that brushing alone is not enough to clean your tongue.  while i still brush it, i use this cleaner as an added bonus.  it doesn&#x27;t seem to be scraping off any weird scum like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, but after scraping, my tongue does feel clean.  it seems to be working.  i also like that this one is stainless and not plastic.  it has a nice edge on it for scraping.</li>
    <li> i use this everyday to get the mouthwash off my tounge and it works grea, i would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Works well. No danger of hurting tongue. Be careful when opening the package. The tongue scrapper metal is thin, as it needs to be, and it is easy to bend it when you are opening the package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tongue brushes, scrapers, etc before. I guess I was trying to find the best tongue cleaner for me, i naturally have a little bit of white coating on my tongue, but this takes it right away. i use it twice a day, very impressed and wont need to try another brand again.</li>
    <li> So far so good. You can feel the difference I your tongue after use.</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else, have to agree on how nice this is.  Works well, it&#x27;s easy to use, but pretty gross.  It says on the package to rinse after 3-4 wipes, personally I rinsed it after each wipe, just seemed gross to me otherwise.  Highly recommended, I don&#x27;t write reviews pretty much ever, but worth it for this.  It&#x27;s cheap, works well, and will last for years.</li>
    <li> Tried several. This is by far the best out there.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! I was amazed.</li>
    <li> this is painfree, and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Works really well, no gag reflex like when i used to use my toothbruth</li>
    <li> Works great! 5 stars all the way. Love the way my tongue feels afterwards!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! Really cleans my tongue!</li>
    <li> Ok, while the whole concept is kind of gross, scraping your tongue really does make a difference when it comes to curbing bad breath and contributing to a wonderful clean feeling in your mouth.  This scraper is a quality product and does its intended job quite well.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner pretty much does the job when it comes to cleaning.  I would highly recommend it to those who have the chronic yukmouth.</li>
    <li> The best I have tried.  I do not like brushing my tongue so I bought this and it does the job...plus no gagging.</li>
    <li> It feels weird to use. It scrapes my tongue. But I have no idea if it works better than just using my toothbrush on my tongue.</li>
    <li> clean tongue helps make a clean mouth.Brushing tongue with toothbrush doesn&#x27;t do it all,so the tongue cleaner is a good device to help with bacteria and fresh breath.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years. This brand lasts forever. They are definitely effective and easy to use. Dishwasher safe.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent addition to my oral hygiene routine. The product is well made.  I used it when I was sick with a cold. After watching the tongue cleaner do its job scraping off bacteria heaven stuff from my tongue, I felt I stopped the cold from lingering. My breath smells fresher.</li>
    <li> I love that the tongue cleaner comes with a cloth carrying case for travel, or just to tuck away when you&#x27;re not using it. This tongue cleaner has become almost a sick obsession for me but it&#x27;s an obsession that makes you healthier! If you&#x27;re not sure whether you &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;want&amp;#34; this little product - trust me, you do.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a gagger this product is for you. I can actually use it!!!</li>
    <li> everyone should own this tongue cleaner. it should be recommended by dentists and doctors as an important part of everyone&#x27;s dental hygiene. it&#x27;s so necessary for keeping your mouth clean and healthy and your breath fresh. i recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those crazy OCD people with my teeth. I been out on the hunt for a good tounge scraper and thought this was the solution. WRONG! It does do it&#x27;s job somewhat in terms of cleaning/scraping. Not the best or worst I used. BUT as some have said it is much too harsh and actually caused me to have some tounge &amp;#34;trauma&amp;#34;. So I would not buy again and only recommend if you like inflicting injury and pain.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t terrible, but you could get the exact same results by simply brushing your tongue with your toothbrush. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. It really cleaned my tongue after a few minutes, and got easier once i got used to it.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner was exactly what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s easy to use, effective, and does not induce gag reflex (at least for me).  The price is quite reasonable.  I bought five, one each for the entire family.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Good but can be harsh on the tongue tho</li>
    <li> What a quality.... Great piece.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the answer, friends:&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several of the tongue cleaners sold here on Amazon, including Dr. Tung&#x27;s.  They all work pretty well, but I wanted more.  Then one day, while in the shower using a pair of exfoliating bath gloves (that you can also find right here on Amazon), the thought crossed my mind that the way the gloves felt on my body was the feeling I was looking for on my tongue.  Jumped out of the shower, wiggled my right hand into a new exfoliating bath glove, wet the fingers of the glove with water and dumped a little plain ol&#x27; baking soda on the first two fingers of the now-wet glove.  Started scrubbing away on my tongue and couldn&#x27;t believe how well and how quickly my tongue was prettily pink and clean.  Rinsed out the glove and now use this method 1-2x daily.  Sure beats all the tongue cleaners I purchased here.  I tried cutting the fingers off the glove just to make it a little easier, but you don&#x27;t get the fit that makes it easy to clean your tongue.  One glove usually lasts me 2-3 weeks, and would probably last longer if I worked harder at cleaning them.  Give this a try, hope it works as well for you as it does for me!</li>
    <li> This product did what it said it would do. I have had other tongue scrapers and I thought they did a good job until I purchased this product. After using this product I really felt like my tongue was clean. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works better than the other tongue cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;I had a fear that the metal would have damaged my tongue but I hardly feel it as it glides over my tongue. I use it twice a day and make sure its dry so it wont be damaged.</li>
    <li> Not sure on this.  I was thinking it would really scrape gunk off my tongue like one user said it did but all it got was some saliva.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t have anything to scrape off in first place?</li>
    <li> It works pretty good, much better than using a toothbrush. Be careful not to scrape too hard.</li>
    <li> I have been using this device for 3 weeks now, and I think I have FINALLY found the cure for my dreaded tonsil stones. I have always had exceptional oral hygiene: brush at least once a day with my Sonicare, floss x2 a day, and use mouthwash in the evening. I also used a tongue scraper on the back of my disposable flossers. Little did I know, these were NOT cutting it. This makes my tongue feel weightless, and my mouth oh so clean. Sometimes I only use one hand to get different angles. Anyway, it&#x27;s been 3 weeks and not a single tonsil stone! I usually have to irrigate them every 2 weeks. I also love the little bag it comes in. Very discrete, and great way to store it.</li>
    <li> Best ever! Really cleans the tongue and helps eliminate bad breath.. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap plastic ones that you can buy at the store.. This one will outlast all of those since it&#x27;s stainless steel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d not tried a tongue scraper/cleaner before.  It amazes me that even after I brush my teeth (and tongue) &#x27;stuff&#x27; still comes off when I use this.</li>
    <li> Wowzer, want a clean tongue.... Then this is your tool to clean it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and like vacuuming, you see results immediately. I think dentists should hand these out when they clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> I always brush my tongue but it never seems as clean as I want. I bought this scraper bc it seems durable. I love it. It scraps very well and is sturdy. When your tongue is clean your breath is fresh and you feel clean. I think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Easy to master.  Easy to get way back and shaped perfect for the job.  Ordered two and they sent two different colors.  I&#x27;m impressed with that, whether coincidence or not.  Saves us from regrettable outcomes.</li>
    <li> I used to have a plastic scraper but it broke. Decided to try metal so it would last longer. I did cause some bleeding the first use because I didn&#x27;t realize how little pressure it requires. It does a good job of getting most of the white gunk off. Would recommend over plastic scrapers. Shipping time frame was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Best TOngue cleaner I have ever used. I really feel like it easily scrapes off everything. Its pricey but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I used to use one of those plastic, triangle-shaped tongue cleaners and it was...okay, but it never really got the job done. This product, on the other hand, is amazing. It gets most of the surface of the tongue with just one swipe. I have pretty bad morning breath and my tongue is really white in the mornings, and this product does an amazing job. After using it, my tongue is pink and I don&#x27;t have bad breath. When I used my old tongue cleaner, the bad breath would return midway through the day and I would have to use mints and lots of water to conquer it, but I noticed that after using this one, my breath stays fresh throughout the day. Also, my tongue would get irritated with the old tongue cleaner because it was fairly small and I had to keep running it over the tongue many times to get everything off. Since this product is big, I usually have a clean tongue after only two or three swipes. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Being a dental assistant your oral hygiene is very important. I never used a tounge scraper I always used my toothbrush to clean my tounge. When I asked my hygienist about bad taste in my mouth in the mornings and bad breath in the mornings she told me to use the tounge scraper. No lye, the first day I used this product I saw and tasted instant results!. I no longer have that bad taste or breath in the morning. This thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will say. My oral hygiene is excellent, I brush and floss 2x a day, I get my teeth cleanings every six months and I have no cavities. So in my case I only needed this tounge scraper to help get the bacteria off my tounge that my toothbrush couldn&#x27;t get. Now If you do not see your dentist regularly and have gum disease or cavities this product will not help much with bad breath. You will need to see your  dentist for other methods to help your case. I hope this info was helpful.</li>
    <li> This is so effective. I am a little worried that it removes good germs in my tongue.</li>
    <li> Best Kept Secret for Fresh Breath!</li>
    <li> It took a while to grow on me, but I do now love it. My friend suggested this last year, I bought it this year and looked at it for a few months. Finally started using it. It did take a while to grow accustomed to the sandpaper feel of my scraped tongue. Now I love it and my tongue is pick and healthy.</li>
    <li> Works well.I wish it could clean up my cursing.</li>
    <li> its good!&lt;br /&gt;to be honest i have suffer from bad breath because there is alot of bacteria on my tongue and stuff like that&lt;br /&gt;this s*** removes everything and its pretty good&lt;br /&gt;just clean it well and ull be fine&lt;br /&gt;did the bad breath go away?&lt;br /&gt;no&lt;br /&gt;but this product helped me alot and it made my mouth feel super super clean&lt;br /&gt;i believe that the cause of bad breath is something more bodily than just bad breath&lt;br /&gt;do i recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;yes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned three different tongue scrapers, but this one is the best! Threw the others right out!</li>
    <li> Great tongue cleaner. When I first got this my tongue was really sore after use, but I was using too much pressure because my old tongue scrapper kinda sucked.</li>
    <li> The best one I have ever bought</li>
    <li> Love this tongue cleaner... works very well and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Scrapes your tongue. Does the job. Plus it&#x27;s metal so it cleans easily and won&#x27;t get gross like the plastic tongue scrapers.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner is well made and simple to use. It gets my tongue clean and makes me feel fresher.</li>
    <li> I thought all the gushing reviews by previous purchasers had to be exaggerating but, now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I have to agree with them. You know how it is when you&#x27;ve been wearing glasses for a while and you absent-mindedly take them off and clean them on the hem of your shirt and when you put them back on you&#x27;re like, &amp;#34;Holy cow! Everything&#x27;s so much clearer!&amp;#34; That&#x27;s what this is for your tongue.</li>
    <li> Great product! You can see results instantly! All excess film was gone.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I used this with a brush and gel to keep my tongue clean but it was a little too forceful for my liking.</li>
    <li> 2016-01-15 EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I left my original review below, for posterity.  But I have changed my mind about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit it doesn&#x27;t work magic, but for what it is, it is actually very good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to use.  These are both key facts with what I have discovered is &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; usage.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to just scrape a few times and be done with the job.  I find that I have to do repeated scrapings, sometimes 10 or more, just to get all the crud off of my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t be afraid to really get into the back of your throat.  The base of the tongue is where the worst filth is!&lt;br /&gt;And this tool makes that way easier than other, makeshift devices.&lt;br /&gt;I have become very satisfied with this gadget.  My tongue still is not a beautiful pink like most lucky folks, but it isn&#x27;t a white abomination anymore either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2015-08-28 ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I read the glowing review for this product (that everyone else has probably read by the point of getting to my pitiful review right here), and it gave me hope that my tongue could truly be cleaned by some miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;This is no such miracle product.  It literally is just a band of metal.  You could scrape your tongue the same with your teeth, a butter knife, or a spoon... Or practically anything else, and get the same &amp;#34;effect&amp;#34;.  The effect being?  Nothing.  No magic improvement.  Tongue still covered in white.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure why I gave it 2 stars.  I guess because it wasn&#x27;t a piece of flimsy junk.  Just not useful at all for me.</li>
    <li> The taste of metal on your tongue and it&#x27;s very stiff and doesn&#x27;t contour to the shape of the tongue.  Would not recommend and will be throwing this out.</li>
    <li> This is my first tongue cleaner, and I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is just right, with soft and easy to hold rubber handles, and the &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34; is polished and smooth and very gentle yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done!</li>
    <li> I bought a cheap all plastic tongue cleaner at my local grocer and it worked. But I kept hearing about how much better these were. So I bought one and yeah, these really ARE better. And being stainless steel, I know they&#x27;ll last as long as I need them too. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Simply the best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve ever used.  You can&#x27;t find something more durable than a solid strip of stainless steel!  I was hesitant, thinking that the steel might be too rough, or uncomfortable to use, but was wrong.  Very comfortable and enjoyable, comfortable handles too.  Using this has also improved my breath dramatically I would say.</li>
    <li> I really like this product works really well, its actually pretty gross how well it works. But don&#x27;t press too hard it will make your tongue bleed and that&#x27;s no fun.</li>
    <li> Works quite well. Very useful design, can be used with one or two hands. Metal part seems quite durable.</li>
    <li> So gross how much this cleans off, but my mouth feels so much cleaner. Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought one for me and the hubby and we&#x27;ve only had to replace one since he bent his. Other than that they last long and do the job.</li>
    <li> I am writing a review of another review wrote by Stew Clyde - this guy should write a book.  It is amazing how he described his tongue got cleaned.  Maybe he should start to write 50 shades of Tongue.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product. Takes bad breath away and your tongue feels clean after every time you use it.</li>
    <li> works great, wish I would have found earlier</li>
    <li> just what I needed got here on time what more could you ask for</li>
    <li> This is a great tongue scraper.  Sturdy construction ensures your poop encrusted tongue gets fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This tongue scraper works ok. I did think it was &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; like some of the other reviewers found it.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> It works especially great, my tongue always feels better after I use it. If you dont like brushing your tongue, this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I read somewhere that brushing your tongue is nowhere near as effective as scraping it, so I browsed scrapers. The first one I got was \\&quot;The Tongue Scraper.\\&quot; It was plastic and had a big wide scraping surface. But it didn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job. I used it for a couple of weeks, long enough to confirm I wasn&#x27;t satisfied. Then I came back and browsed again, and bought one of these Dr. Tung jobbies. This is more like it. The scraper being metal and narrow makes a big difference, way more effective.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gets in the vertical ridge.  durable, simple design.  My breath is better, mouth feels cleaner, and it only takes a couple of minutes to use.</li>
    <li> Works well! I was surprised at how much stuff I got off my tongue after using this. Gross I know!</li>
    <li> Product accurately described and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Not much to say but it&#x27;s a tongue cleaner and more hygenic than the plastic ones. The plastic cleaners break overtime so this one will be on the sink much longer.</li>
    <li> Great idea! And it WORKS!! I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review for a tongue cleaner but it actually does get rid of the gross white stuff and give you back your lovely, purely pink tongue! As some reviewers have said be careful of over doing it the first time and doing it too hard... Use it as directed and you&#x27;ll absolutely see an improvement!</li>
    <li> This is a life saver. I have one at work and at home. It you&#x27;re prone to bad breath, have eaten a smelly meal, and/or are on a paleo/keto diet, this tool will help your breath and improve the overall health of your mouth.</li>
    <li> Great product. Was used to using similar products in India. The soft handle at the bottom makes this comfortable.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing tool and well done which I am using for years.  I recommended to my friends and they are happy with it also.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time was as described.</li>
    <li> Average, nothing special. Comparing to similar products think it costs bit more then others.&lt;br /&gt;Product is not bad though.</li>
    <li> This is my first tongue cleaner. I&#x27;ve always brushed my tongue before. With this product, I can clean the back of my tongue. It works well and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> It works better than a spoon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review this product without grossing people out but I think the truth needs to get out.  There is some nasty stuff on your tongue that a toothbrush cannot remove, especially in the back.  This thing allows you to remove it easily without gagging yourself by trying to shove a toothbrush down your throat.  I was definitely surprised the first time I used it how much materiel I removed and yes this stuff smells bad.  After that first time I couldn&#x27;t get anywhere near as much off of my tongue which tells me that the materiel had been there a while.  My breath is noticeably better now.  My tongue is much more abrasive than most says my dentist which makes it conducing to holding this materiel I removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very simple tool and it cleans up well since it&#x27;s just a piece of stainless steel and rubber handles.</li>
    <li> The tongue cleaner is easy to use and easily cleaned up.  I believe that it is more effective than using my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> A simple product that does what it is intended to do, thank goodness. I have a sensitive gag reflex so brushing my tongue has always been more of a chore than it should be, but this tongue cleaner makes it a little more bearable. If I feel the need to get the back of my tongue, one or two quick swipes will do the trick. I still have a bit of a reaction due to my sensitivity but it is nowhere NEAR as bad as with a toothbrush. So happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I would write a review on this, but it&#x27;s great. I bought this over a year ago and still use it frequently. It has held up to a lot of traveling and constant abuse. There has been no rust at all. It&#x27;ll bend occasionally if I stuff it into my luggage the wrong way, but it&#x27;s easy to bend it back.  Update 7/14/15: I accidentally left my tongue scraper at a hotel on a business trip,  so now I&#x27;m back to buy another one. I&#x27;ve been using a spoon, but it&#x27;s not as effective and looks weird to leave in the restroom.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Nice and sturdy, does what it supposed to.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner, scrubs all the visual particles from the tongue. You can bend it to fit any mouth.</li>
    <li> Simply works, its really hard to have a problem with such a simple thing&lt;br /&gt;Obviously don&#x27;t scrape the tastebuds out of your mouth (other reviewers)&lt;br /&gt;NICE</li>
    <li> Very good product I would recommend it anytime</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  The stuff this thing took off with the first use, YUCK! I didn&#x27;t know all that was even there! I highly recommend this as part of your oral hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, simple, and effective. A small price for a quick and easy way to tackle bad breath and improve oral health. I will continue using once or twice a week and will be confident when talking to others. I&#x27;ve already got a few people in mind to recommend this to specifically...</li>
    <li> Breath now smells like carnations milk....sweet ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and this truly works! it keeps the tong clean and helps freshens your breath by effectively removing the sulfur producing bacteria that causes bad breath</li>
    <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t go the cheap route and buy a plastic tongue cleaner. This thing works and it works well!</li>
    <li> i have one of these in each bathroom !</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with deposits on my tongue causing bad breath for a long time. This product is fantastic! A couple scrapes and my tongue is back to its pink glory! Tat said make sure you do not scrape too many times as you can make your tongue bleed if you push too hard or too many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this product is stainless steel. I keep mine in the shower for morning use and then brush afterward. I have even noticed better tasting coffee after scraping away all that gunk from my taste buds!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Doesn&#x27;t scratch my tongue like the other one I had.</li>
    <li> After trying all the rest, I tried this.  I threw out every other type that same night, and have been using this every few days since for months now.  It&#x27;s a simple little device, but well made, and works extremely well.  If you&#x27;ve never used a quality tongue scraper, you will be shocked/disgusted at what comes off after a firm scrape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with Dr. Katz mouthwash, which I use right after, this stops bad breath DEAD in it&#x27;s tracks.</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue cleaner ive used!  It really gets your tongue clean!  Ive used lots of others and the stainless steel tongue cleaners are the way to go!  Those plastic ones just dont cut it!</li>
    <li> Cleans my tongue as you might suspect. Been using it for 3 years now and no rust or anything has developed.</li>
    <li> OK, here&#x27;s a product you&#x27;ve probably never realized you need---but you do! Brushing, flossing, and mouthwash are not the only tools you need to combat bad breath apparently. I bought just 1 of these scrapers to try out, but immediately came back and ordered more for the rest of the family once I saw the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hold the scraper with just one hand, but I found it easier to use with both hands. At first I had trouble getting my tongue to stay in the right &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; for scraping (it kept curling up on me!), but after using it several times I got the hang of it. The stuff this thing takes off is gross...but great, right? Don&#x27;t forget to do the sides, that&#x27;s where I had the most buildup. Don&#x27;t go crazy the first time---this thing is sharp and you should exercise a little restraint until you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your tongue will look, feel, and even taste different after just a couple of uses. Clean tongue, clean breath! This scraper eliminates even stale morning breath. Just get one, you need this thing!</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  I have used tongue scrapers in the past.  This is better than all of them.</li>
    <li> Excellent, and I use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I was using a plastic tongue cleaner and decided to look into something more durable. This thing is great, it cleans my tongue really well and it is a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that sometimes it hurts more than the plastic one did and it&#x27;s hard to know when to stop cleaning.</li>
    <li> I use this tongue scraper every night and it definitely works.  The metal is flat so it doesn&#x27;t cut up your tongue while still removing 90% of that nasty build up.  I have a medium sized mouth and the size and shape of this cleaner fit perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I bought one for me and one for my wife, we both use it regularly and are amazed and what was remaining on our tongues before! We love this product and the price is great for how clean it makes you feel!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Just be careful not to make tongue bleed.</li>
    <li> Works suuuuper well and the item came quickly so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> it is durable, hygienic and does the job. best tongue cleaner i have ever owned. perfect when used before mouth wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been scraping my tongue for two decades. Looks good to see a pink tongue, flossed and whitened teeth. Everything I eat tastes better.</li>
    <li> This was really good until I lost it. Got the gunk out really well. I would Highly recommend getting this product</li>
    <li> I bought this because of that famous review. lol It does work, but not as miraculously as stated.</li>
    <li> It is amazing what collects on the tongue.  Use it first thing in the morning.  Mouth much fresher.  Seemed a little sharp at first but&lt;br /&gt;lost that quickly.</li>
    <li> This gadget really cleans my tongue and makes my mouth feel much cleaner.  Its easy and comfortable to use.  I find that I only need to use it every couple of weeks to keep the yucky crud build-up in check.  I tried other tongue cleaners and they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything meaningful.  I love my Dr. Tung tongue cleaner!</li>
    <li> This product works, and its built really sturdy. I expect it to last.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has complimented my breath recently. I guess that&#x27;s all I need to say here.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, this works great, without tongue discomfort and no gagging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simultaneously disgusting and cathartic to see the layers of fuzzy filth cleaned from your tongue. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product, my breath is fresher and my tongue is finally a nice shade of pink.</li>
    <li> Perfect for scraping that tongue.</li>
    <li> I use it after dr. tung&#x27;s tongue gel and brush for the extra clean feeling. By itself, it doesn&#x27;t clean properly and hurts if I am not super gentle with it. It removes all the excess gunk on your tongue. I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Works well!  Who knew?</li>
    <li> The handles are a lightweight material so very light over all. Product does what it should. It&#x27;s pretty pricey for a tounge cleaner but treat it with care and clean it and you should&#x27;nt need another for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several types of tongue cleaners and, after reading all of the wonderful reviews about this one, I wanted to try one out for myself.  My opinion in a nutshell?... It works as intended.  What do I mean?  Well, it&#x27;s a good product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Compared to the other types and brands that I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I found this one to be a viable alternative though not nearly as amazing as others have claimed.  I wonder if many of the other stellar reviews have come from people who have never used a tongue cleaner before.&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, I found this product to be effective, although I could critique that the design hardly seems to improve it&#x27;s performance versus other types of cleaners I have used.  The handles provide a good grip and the stainless steel band does it&#x27;s part to clean.  A good product but not good enough for me to rave that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;• Price (a bit high for such a simple design)&lt;br /&gt;• Design (large and colorful)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;• Effective (works as intended when used properly)&lt;br /&gt;• Quality (well made)</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well-made product that function exactly as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first however, after a long realization of how I would always see a white glob or whatever color it would like to turn to depending on what I ate. And as well as the dragon breath that I typically have in the morning even with proper flossing, brushing and mouthwash this seemed to be a expense was worthy to try out.  I have used some of the tongue cleaners on the back of toothbrushes before, although they were not very effective. I had to dig a bit deeper on Amazon and other online retailers for something and a lot of plastic ones showed and I found this one and decided to give it a show that it was a metal based one and seemed more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a year with this product and I have no regrets and it does everything I wanted it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes the white/pink/colored appearance of the leftover food left on the tongue and my breath has been significantly fresher and no longer am I experiencing the dragon breath anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> You will be surprised how much gunk you scrape from your tongue, and any little advantage in cleaning your mouth, you should take it.</li>
    <li> Metal and plastic is not part of my health routine. For tool i use on my body everyday I am going to spend a few more bucks and find a Copper scraper.</li>
    <li> Your tongue will thank you after a heavy meal. Morning breath is essentially eliminated when you use this, brushing, flossing and mouthwash. Highly recommended to everyone I know</li>
    <li> Really good at scraping things like tongues.</li>
    <li> Love this tongue cleaner, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one and I found it with this one. thank you</li>
    <li> Started using this with Xlear Spry Dental Defense Oral Rinse Spearmint about a month ago and FINALLY my bad breath seems to be gone. This is great news for my wife, friends, and the people I greet at church!</li>
    <li> Got this because no matter how much I brush my teeth and tongue and floss  I cant get rid of this unpleasant smell in my mouth.  This didn&#x27;t workk</li>
    <li> Well constructed tongue cleaner.  Looks like it will be durable but I have only had it for a month.  Not as thin and flexible as some stainless steel tongue cleaners I bought in India.  However those were long and got bent when I put it in my travel toilet case. This tongue cleaner looks like it will withstand the abuse in my travel case.</li>
    <li> Good tongue cleaner. Can be kind of abrasive and drying for sensitive tongues.</li>
    <li> It works, but I was expecting something a bit more based on the rave reviews. Tongue is still tinged with some whiteness after each nightly used (using on and off for 2 weeks now). The whiteness is quickly replaced after each meal, so unless you use multiple times per day, I&#x27;m not sure what the value is besides getting rid of the whiteness and a slightly fresher breath. Probably would stick with toothbrush if I didn&#x27;t already have it just because I&#x27;m cheapo.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much stuff comes off my tongue. It&#x27;s easy and effective. My two year old even likes doing it. Teeth brushing was always a struggle but she has taken to this little device.</li>
    <li> this is possibly the best tongue cleaner out there. durable and very reasonable. Just perfect. If you are looking for a long term tongue cleaner this is it.</li>
    <li> It works well for cleaning your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;A couple scraps of your tongue, from back to front, and it removes residue resulting in a cleaner/fresher tongue. Ahhh!</li>
    <li> I honestly don’t remember if this product arrived on time but it was will packaged and I could tell the item was new.  I had Dr. Tung’s tongue cleaner before so I am aware of the quality of the product and the price was excellent too.  I am very pleased with the seller in terms of the care and detail that was taken in ensuring that I received the package without incident.</li>
    <li> Not sure why I bought this.  Must have been the some of the crazy reviews that I read and the low price.  Been using it for a couple of weeks and really do not see much benefit.  Although, if you are in to the tongue cleaning thing, this is the one you want.  It is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Amazing what comesboff early in the AM! Does a great job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s initially surprising how much you can get off of your tongue with this.  I was being conservative at first, only scraping what I could see.  Then I started moving back past the vallate papillae (gigantic taste buds) at the back of my tongue and it was like DUN DUNAAAAA Secret treasure trove of nasty.  Hurts a bit more due to the texture back there but totally worth it for the breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to just brush my tongue but this is far more effective.</li>
    <li> I brought this for me and my husband&lt;br /&gt;I love it ..He hated it..&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my breath has been better..people had spoken about an almost instant pink tongue I didn&#x27;t have that same experience.&lt;br /&gt;My husband didn&#x27;t like it because of the gag reflex.</li>
    <li> Works very well, I like the style, was a very good purchase!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again if I need it.</li>
    <li> I have discarded all other cleaners and kept my Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner. It cleans the rear and sides of the tongue with ease. In addition, it is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> THE BEST TONGUE CLEANER!!</li>
    <li> Cleans the tongue nicely. The finger grips are nice and the metal is strong and sturdy. Easy to clean and store away as well as take with you for traveling. The product is of great quality for the price. I can see this product holding up for years if it is taken care of well.</li>
    <li> This tongue scraper, or mouth zamboni as I like to call it, is extremely effective at removing that gross scum which settles upon the tongue.  It even comes with a discreet cloth cinch bag in the event that you are ashamed of your good oral hygiene.  It blows away the competition, I used to have a plastic scraper which promptly went in the trash after this arrived in the mail today.</li>
    <li> Love this tongue cleaner in conjunction with the fresh breath system.</li>
    <li> Seems to do what it was meant to do, scrape that nasty stuff off your tongue, an it does it well.</li>
    <li> Use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Scary how much junk is on your tongue. I scrape 3-4 times before it it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result- less congestion, coughing, throat-clearing.</li>
    <li> Very helpful.  Not uncomfortable and easy to clean.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tongue scraper. I have tried many and this is my favorite. Easy to clean and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.... I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Great product and extraordinarily easy to use</li>
    <li> Love it! Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Really amazed at the amount of stuff that this scrapes off. Seems to be very durable. Just FYI but I received the Periwinkle grips.</li>
    <li> I have never used another one of these so I cant compare it. I really like this, it helps me with bad breath. A had a dentist told me I had a geographical tung when I was a kid, which is a nice way of saying I had an ugly tung. I bought this because I smoke and hate the breath it gives me. It not only helped with that but my tung is not so ugly any more and to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t make me gauge as much as just brushing my tung. Good buy. I hope it never rusts.</li>
    <li> The holy grail of tongue cleaning (which more people should care about).</li>
    <li> had one before that i lost, This tool cleans your tongue better than anything else and last forever</li>
    <li> Very useful! Reaches all the way to the back of your mouth to help scrape all that nasty gunk off. A must buy for anyone interested in dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Wow. This product was a HUGE disappointment, There are so many great reviews on it that I thought it would certainly work. Do NOT listen to those. Instead, pay more attention to the negative reviews. This MAY have taken off a very small amount of the white off of my tongue, but it is not noticeable at all. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> Tough construction, will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used  a plastic tongue cleaner before deciding to try this one.  This is so much better than the plastic ones.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend&#x27;s halitosis isn&#x27;t as bad anymore. things are looking up for her in regards to me.</li>
    <li> item is wonderful and get it on time</li>
    <li> This Steel TC actually does what it says it does! Enough said!!!</li>
    <li> Great! This is the key to getting rid of bad breath!</li>
    <li> This is the thing you never knew you needed. Get it; it will change how clean your mouth feels and looks!</li>
    <li> Lord knows how long ago I should have invested in this product.  All my short life of 29 years, I have wondered why my breath smelled terrible.  I brushed my teeth every morning and every night like a good little boy.  However, I was still plagued with noticeable rank breath and a white layer of what looked like fuzz on my tongue.  I did brush my tongue occasionally with the toothbrush, and sometimes even took a butter knife to it, but that never seemed to be a lasting solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visits to the dentist always yielded the comments that my teeth were healthy.  So what gives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the tongue!  If you think you&#x27;re genetically predisposed to having a white tongue, think again!  2-3 scrapes of this thing and you&#x27;ll be gagging just like I was when I first got this thing.  Take a whiff of it, if you dare, and you&#x27;ll see where that smell was coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let me tell you the full-proof way to get great breath.&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush every morning and every night.&lt;br /&gt;2. Floss every night.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use this thing (2-3 good scrapes) every other day.&lt;br /&gt;4. Profit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An occasional swish of mouthwash wouldn&#x27;t hurt, but it&#x27;s not fully necessary if you brush, floss, and scrape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girlfriend now wonder&#x27;s where my horrible cheese-breath has gone.  It won&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> My mouth can&#x27;t feel clean without using this tongue scraper, which I&#x27;ve been using for years and years and years. I&#x27;ve tried other ones, made of plastic, but nothing beats this particular brand - it&#x27;s flexible, the metal is thin, and the handles are comfortable. Because all the other ones are too thick and ridged, his is the only kind I can use without it initiating my gag reflex.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one of these! I bought one for each member of my family.  Great solution for bad breath!</li>
    <li> After a course of antibiotics my tongue turned green!  The doctor&#x27;s advice did not work nor did salt water.  I tried a tongue cleaner from CVS but it could not reach back far enough.  Plus it made me gag.  After reading the reviews I decided to try this one.  It didn&#x27;t make me gag and I gag easily!  I could reach farther back to clean off the nasty stuff.  I think everyone should have one of these on hand just in case.</li>
    <li> Best tongue cleaner ever! It&#x27;s metal so it doesn&#x27;t bend why you apply pressure</li>
    <li> Feels good and does is job. It&#x27;s the best I have used so far.</li>
    <li> I recently got this item and I have to say it does make a significant difference to my tongue. It is kind of gross the first few times you use it as it will pull a large amount of &#x27;stuff&#x27; off of your tongue. In the past, I always had a bit of a whiteness to my tongue, but after using this product it has become much pinker and cleaner. For the price, I can say I see nothing wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> This works great. It always takes a bunch of gunk out of my tongue and leaves my mouth and breath feeling fresher. It doesn&#x27;t taste like metal while using it, which is excellent. It&#x27;s easy to use and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My dentist used to give me those tongue cleaners made by hard paper as gifts, which naturally didn&#x27;t last very long. Since I bought this metal piece, I won&#x27;t need to worry about its durability at all. It does its job as well as paper ones, and it&#x27;s easier to clean. I like it.</li>
    <li> Not a sophisticated design but works very well.  Pulls all sorts of junk off the tongue.  Easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have a brand new tongue! Love it!</li>
    <li> It is cheap, it does what it is supposed to do, but it took literally months to get here, with no explanation as to why.</li>
    <li> The stainless steel is what got my attention for cleanliness and germs. I just use it once a day but it really works nicely. I would suggest using this for good hygiene. Good Luck !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always brushed my tongue clear down into my throat, but my dentist told me that a metal tongue scraper works better. I haven&#x27;t tried a different type, but bought this one because of good reviews and the lower price. It works very well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tongue scrapers before but none seem to work as well as this one.  The stainless steel definitely seems more hygienic than other plastic ones you find at the store.  Just don&#x27;t be shocked from the gunk you find on your tongue after you first use this.</li>
    <li> Sturdy with just enough grip on the tongue surface. Coated handles help to grip it. Well made and serves its function.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing and a mandatory part of my dental routine both before going to bed and morning time. I was traveling recently and forgot to take my tongue cleaner along. Boy it felt weird to not have this thing which made me wonder how i had gone without it for this long? .. meaning before i bought it. As far as I am concerned, this goes with you your toothbrush, floss and mouthwash as part of your complete daily oral care regiment.</li>
    <li> After reading so many amazing reviews, I needed to try out Dr. Tung&#x27;s Tongue Cleaner.  I&#x27;ve had a few plastic tongue scrapers, and was curious how this different design would be an improvement.  It barely is.  I&#x27;ve had similar results from plastic tongue scrapers.  It does work well, but that is true of the others.  (I&#x27;ve used http://www.amazon.com/Tongue-Cleaner-W2070-The/dp/B000WM1DZW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1425004077&amp;sr&#x3D;1-8&amp;keywords&#x3D;tongue+scraper and http://www.amazon.com/GUM-Tongue-Cleaner-colors-vary/dp/B00008CMPY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1425004077&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;tongue+scraper)  The important thing is to use pressure, go over your entire tongue, and clean well after use.  I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my other tongue cleaner, but it may go into my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I have used this practically every day since I received this great invention! I added this to my dental routine and I have less bad tastes and odors in my mouth. As I have gotten older, I have become more paranoid about my breath and this definitely alleviates my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I did not really come across in other reviews, is that I scraped a bit too vigorously at first which made my tongue a little sore. I have used plastic tongue scrapers in the past that I could scrub my tongue and not have this issue; however, this product is more effective than the plastic alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this tongue cleaner to replace a different kind that I used before. I have had problems with bad breath and drymouth. This tongue cleaner is easy to use, comfortable, and really made a difference. My dentist suggested it and I&#x27;m glad he did.</li>
    <li> No complaints! Works as advertised. Ordered another for my wife.</li>
    <li> Anything that properly promotes good hygiene is always worth checking out in my opinion. This makes the cut. Cleans your tongue well.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  Bought it for my parents.  It works amazing!  I would highly recommend.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tongue cleaners and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, great product. highly recommend! thank you.</li>
    <li> This works quite well for cleaning after brushing my teeth. Would recommend to anyone interested in tongue health. one more word.</li>
    <li> Studies have shown that tongue scraping is better for one&#x27;s overall health than even brushing one&#x27;s teeth.  You will bleed at first, but it will become addictive, as you see what it pulls off.  Does not compare to the &amp;#34;tongue cleaners&amp;#34; on traditional toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I always tried scraping my tongue with a spoon, and it did not get off all of the residue. It was effective, but not highly. A toothbrush makes you gag and barely does anything. I saw an Orabrush commercial and realized I really wanted a tongue scraper. The problem I saw was that the Orabrush was pricey, and it was made out of a plastic/rubber material. They said you need to replace it ever 3 months like a toothbrush. I thought that was stupid, who wants to buy an expensive plastic tongue scraper every 3 months? A quick search on Amazon showed me this, and I am so glad it did. I was immediately pleased to see it was stainless steel, because that&#x27;ll just last forever. Also, not only is it not pricey at all, but it looks like a pretty nice product. I bought it that very minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this in the mail I was already ripping open the package to use it. I really hate that terrible taste you get in your mouth even when your teeth are clean, and that taste IS from the residue on your tongue. I brushed my teeth, cleaned out my mouth, and started using it. You can go pretty far back (although I have to be careful because I have some swollen taste buds on the back of my tongue that this tongue cleaner can painfully latch onto). I noticed some women in the 1 star ratings of this product saying it was just a saliva scraper. To use this product properly,try not to close your mouth while scraping. First, it&#x27;ll just scrape off a little residue and a lot of saliva. If your mouth is left open, you&#x27;ll get off the saliva in a couple swipes and then just be scraping off residue. It&#x27;s very simple. I am able to get off ALL residue with this product and have never been so pleased with my oral cleanliness in my life. I wished more people would use these, bad breath is terrible and this is a major part of the solution. I use this each time after I brush. If you use it this frequently, you only have to scrape for about 15 seconds because there&#x27;s barely any residue to take off because you&#x27;re not leaving any to build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Do not go harder than you are comfortable. You can get off almost all residue with a gentle amount of pressure. I had gone a little too hard at one point and a couple taste buds got cut and bled lightly. Do not be scared though, this should only happen if you&#x27;re scraping WAY too hard.off because you&#x27;re not leaving any to build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Do not go harder than you are comfortable. You can get off almost all residue with a gentle amount of pressure. I had gone a little too hard at one point and a couple taste buds got cut and bled lightly. Do not be scared though, this should only happen if you&#x27;re scraping WAY too hard.</li>
    <li> This product is of good quality, is very durable and gets the job done.  It is very easy to clean and simple to use.  Recommended for anyone who wishes to practice proper oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from a &amp;#34;tongue cleaner&amp;#34;, but this one seems to work fine.  It removes that white film that builds up on my tongue, but I don&#x27;t really feel like my mouth is much cleaner afterwards.  Mouthwash probably does more in the long run ;)</li>
    <li> WOW! Totally impressed!</li>
    <li> Works great. I love this product.</li>
    <li> My fiancée and I had not ever heard of this tongue cleaner,but it works!</li>
