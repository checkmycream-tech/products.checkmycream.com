      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet because I have acrylics on</li>
      <li>Applied by itselft makes the nails look a bit off, however, you can apply a color coat of your favorite nail polish and keep reapplying NAIL ENVY throughout the rest of the week.</li>
      <li>I have been using it as a top coat since then.</li>
      <li>I love Nail Envy.  </li>

      <li>On top of that I wore acrylics for years, until I just couldn&#x27;t get to a nail salon , and I ordered this.</li>
      <li>After a week of treatment, most of these problems were resolved.</li>

      <li>I bought this at the recommendation of a friend because my nails peel, chip and break so easily.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that my nails would stay strong without it, so</li>
      <li>Strong nails in no time.</li>
      <li>Otherwise you&#x27;ll get bubbling (which will happen whenever you apply too many coats of polish too quickly).  </li>
      <li>I tried few nail strengtheners but this one is the best.</li>
      <li>thought for those of you out there who are gluten free you&#x27;d want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
      <li>Someone on Pinterest recommended this, and I have to say it does a fantastic job.</li>
      <li>Goes on so easy and drys quick</li>
      <li>&amp; she absolutely loves it; it has made her nails very strong.</li>
      <li>i first purchased this product about a month or maybe more</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>For the first time in many,many years I&#x27;m in love with my nails.</li>
      <li>A must, you have to clean up and start over after a week.</li>
      <li>I really like Nail Envy and am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>i am thank full.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and evenly.  </li>
      <li>even if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time, you can put a couple of coats on quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have not used the product yet, but have heard many great things on youtube as well as other social media.</li>
      <li>It works well, but I was under the impression that it was absorbed into the nail not a polish.  </li>
      <li>I do have strong nails, but this product protects them from housework and frequent gardening.</li>
      <li>but after using this product for a month my nail is back to its healthy non peeling or splitting state and my nails are stronger than ever.</li>
      <li>I had a nail that was damaged almost 23 years ago from me wearing tips, my nail would grow but peel and split at a certain length</li>
      <li>It really does strengthen your nails.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had tons of people ask me if these are my real nails....</li>
      <li>It dries really fast, so</li>
      <li>Really strengthens my nails.</li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t beat this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I tried Sally Hanson &amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34;, which was nice, but peeled off after a few days.</li>
      <li>So far, my nail look better; I only tried it one week, then I went on vacation</li>
      <li>My nails are long &amp; strong.  </li>
      <li>Nail Envy helps my nails grow long and strong.  </li>
      <li>My sister uses this religiously and she has super long and strong nails.</li>
      <li>since my transition from arylic on my  nails to natural nails were fine for a couple of months then all of a sudden</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>After a few months, I actually had nice looking natural nails for the first time in my life.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a life long nail bitter and this stuff made my nails too strong to bite!</li>
      <li>When Nail Envy is on, it just looks like a clear polish, not thick and gloppy like Essie&#x27;s Grow Stronger.  </li>
      <li>After using this product my nails now are so strong and grow so fast I actually have to trim them down.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;m on my 3rd of maybe 4th bottle in a couple of years, and I&#x27;ll definitely keep on buying it as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
      <li>You can use a double coat for extra strength -- just make sure to let the coats dry thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>I am trying to get through my other basecoat, but for the price and quick shipping</li>
      <li>Nail Envy gets rid of the white spots and really strengthens nails.</li>
      <li>it turned her nails into soft cracking, breaking nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product that works for really crappy nails.</li>
      <li>so, I made sure to apply it on my nails as soon as I could, especially on the trouble nails.</li>
      <li>The only time I&#x27;ve ever had long nails is when I&#x27;ve either paid for them or when I was pregnant and taking prenatal vitamins.  </li>
      <li>I found the cure for my weak, peeling and easily breaking nails!</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon as it was only half the cost of what I could find locally.</li>
      <li>It is helping my rather fragile nails to grow to a decent length.  </li>
      <li>Makes a great quick dry base coat, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>When I decided I would no longer do acrylics or gels, I tried every nail strengthening product out there, including the popular, expensive ones used in all the nail salons.</li>
      <li>I think it would work especially well for people who have weak nails that break easily.</li>

    <li> I tried few nail strengtheners but this one is the best. I use it for 3 days applying layer by layer and i can see the difference! I found the cure for my weak, peeling and easily breaking nails!</li>
    <li> This  is the best thing for those of us who no longer want to use acrylic nails. Nail Envy gets rid of the white spots and really strengthens nails. I was glad to find it on Amazon as it was only half the cost of what I could find locally. I love the results for my nails.</li>
    <li> Awesome! This product recovered my weak nails. They used to peel and break quite often due to a lot of hand washing. Now there&#x27;s none of these issues anymore! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This did exactly what it was supposed to do LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Can be worn under your nail polish or alone. Really strengthens my nails. Can&#x27;t be without it. Goes on so easy and drys quick</li>
    <li> This item does a very good job of protecting and improving my nail condition.  Especially after removing artificial nails it works well.</li>
    <li> My nails have also chipped and peeled. Nail Envy helps my nails grow long and strong.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have paper thin nails that spilt break and peel. On top of that I wore acrylics for years, until I just couldn&#x27;t get to a nail salon , and I ordered this. It&#x27;s been a month and I&#x27;ve only broken one nail, and even repaired that with tea bag paper and nail envy and that is holding as well. I&#x27;ve tried everything imaginable for 40 years and nothing has worked except this! It&#x27;s the only product that works for really crappy nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks, but I can already tell a difference in the strength of my nails. I really like Nail Envy and am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great product!. So great, in fact, my daughters&#x27; have borrowed it to the point where it&#x27;s almost gone! It stays without chipping and within a week, I&#x27;ve noticed my nails are longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a friend because my nails peel, chip and break so easily.  I was really skeptical, but it really works.  Sometimes after applying the four coats in five days, I leave it on a bit longer, but my nails are getting stronger.</li>
    <li> My nails were so weak and thin and i used nail envy for 3 weeks and they started to grow again i am thank full. Gloria</li>
    <li> This is the best nail strengthener on the market bar none.  If you have weak nails you have to try it.  One week and you&#x27;ll wonder by you didn&#x27;t try it before.</li>
    <li> This product is producing the results I was hoping for. It is helping my rather fragile nails to grow to a decent length.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I wear it every time i change my nail polish. i put it as a base coat and i really see a great improvement in my nails. they do get sturdy. i will def buy another one.</li>
    <li> Amazing since I&#x27;ve gone gluten free...how many things have wheat in them...rather they are part of the product or simply manufactured where wheat is and there is transference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not tell you it has wheat in it but once you buy it...you&#x27;ll see it does.  Now I can&#x27;t return it or get my money back and I can&#x27;t use the product.  My daughter was the one who discovered this and went ahead and tried using it to see what it did to her nails...it turned her nails into soft cracking, breaking nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought for those of you out there who are gluten free you&#x27;d want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-16-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update to the review above.  The seller since contacted me only to let me know the FDA doesn&#x27;t consider this an allergy more an intolerance; and to tell me my review was for nothing they did wrong...either way here is my point...I like to read labels before I buy something and this seller does not give you that option  on Amazon.  I would just like to see sellers listing all the ingredients in their product so the buyer can decide for themselves if this product is something they want to try.  If you buy something in a store you can read the label so why not on Amazon?  End of subject my review is to inform... not to slam this seller.</li>
    <li> This is very good nail repair product. It made my nails stronger just in one week. I had problem with peeling nails, after one week this problem was gone. I have been using it as a top coat since then. But you also can use it as a base coat and top coat. So i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do have strong nails, but this product protects them from housework and frequent gardening. I think it would work especially well for people who have weak nails that break easily.</li>
    <li> I have been biting my nails and chewing my cuticles for as long as I can remember.  The only time I&#x27;ve ever had long nails is when I&#x27;ve either paid for them or when I was pregnant and taking prenatal vitamins.  My mom got this stuff from the lady that does her pedicures.  It worked for her.  So I ordered it from amazon (for half the price) and tried it.  OH MY GOODNESS!  It works.  My nails are long &amp; strong.  I take it off about every 10 days and leave it off for a day or two.  If I leave it off any longer, my nails begin to chip an break.  When Nail Envy is on, it just looks like a clear polish, not thick and gloppy like Essie&#x27;s Grow Stronger.  I don&#x27;t wear colored polish, so this stuff is perfect.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I&#x27;ve had tons of people ask me if these are my real nails....finally, I can say yes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that truly does work. We applied 2-3 base coats on the first night and about 1 coat every 2 or 3 days after. After 2 weeks we removed all of the layers, as it does seem to discolor, and started over. Now days we put this as a base coat under a colored nail polish and it lasts for quite some time, about a week is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting nails were very weak, curled over due to weakness, and appeared transparent. After a week of treatment, most of these problems were resolved. I&#x27;m positive repeat treatment will be necessary, but if used as a base coat, it is not much more work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and strong nail wishes :)</li>
    <li> My nails are finally holding together instead of pealing and chipping and breaking. This works great. They grow so long I have to trim them!</li>
    <li> My nails have not look this good in years! It keeps my nails strong without any gel buildup and it is so easy to apply and remove.</li>
    <li> Goodbye weak, short and brittle nails! This is my holy grail nail strengthner, I love this product and will continue to repurchase!</li>
    <li> Usually like OPI, but this didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> My sister uses this religiously and she has super long and strong nails.</li>
    <li> I love Nail Envy.  It really does strengthen your nails.  It dries really fast, so even if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time, you can put a couple of coats on quickly.  I wish I would have thought about ordering this online earlier.  I&#x27;ve been buying it at the salon for $15.</li>
    <li> I have awful, thin, weak nails. When I decided I would no longer do acrylics or gels, I tried every nail strengthening product out there, including the popular, expensive ones used in all the nail salons. This is the only one that worked for me.  The others peel off my nail.  This one stays stuck.  You can use a double coat for extra strength -- just make sure to let the coats dry thoroughly.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll get bubbling (which will happen whenever you apply too many coats of polish too quickly).  After a few months, I actually had nice looking natural nails for the first time in my life.  I&#x27;ll still do a gel if I&#x27;m going on vacation and just don&#x27;t want to be bothered.  Otherwise, I use this with every manicure.</li>
    <li> My nails are pretty damaged from having artificial ones on for so long. This product has my stamp of approval already after less than a month.</li>
    <li> i first purchased this product about a month or maybe more but ive been using as directed and my nails have showen a big improvement. since my transition from arylic on my  nails to natural nails were fine for a couple of months then all of a sudden they started peeling and wouldnt stop,i started looking up diff ways to help my nails and i came across this product and ive been using it ever since. i just purchased two more bottles today, plus side is it does what it says its suppose to do but it takes time before u see any type of results</li>
    <li> It works well, but I was under the impression that it was absorbed into the nail not a polish.  So I reapply often!  Doesn&#x27;t seem to peel like reg polish either.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is absolutely the best!  I have never found anything that works as well at protecting your nails, letting them grow out, and not peeling or flaking off.  I think I&#x27;m on my 3rd of maybe 4th bottle in a couple of years, and I&#x27;ll definitely keep on buying it as long as it&#x27;s available! I have recommended it to several friends, family, and co-workers.</li>
    <li> So far, my nail look better; I only tried it one week, then I went on vacation and I needed, so, I made sure to apply it on my nails as soon as I could, especially on the trouble nails. Well, it turns out, that this nail strengthener doesn&#x27;t dry the cuticles!!! Which is a plus. Applied by itselft makes the nails look a bit off, however, you can apply a color coat of your favorite nail polish and keep reapplying NAIL ENVY throughout the rest of the week. A must, you have to clean up and start over after a week. It works better.</li>
    <li> Protects nails and helps them grow. Depending on daily activities it may be necessary to remiss and reapply before seven days.</li>
    <li> For the first time in many,many years I&#x27;m in love with my nails. This product is fabulous. I had a nail that was damaged almost 23 years ago from me wearing tips, my nail would grow but peel and split at a certain length but after using this product for a month my nail is back to its healthy non peeling or splitting state and my nails are stronger than ever. Thank you OPI for making this great product and you Amazon for selling this product.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product yet, but have heard many great things on youtube as well as other social media. I am trying to get through my other basecoat, but for the price and quick shipping I really couldn&#x27;t beat this. My nails respond well to most base coats (except CND for whatever reason, while other rave about it, it just chips away for me). Since this is a basecoat that has been on the market, and I got as advertised I expect nothing but what others have experienced.</li>
    <li> My nails have always been thin and wouldn&#x27;t grow. After using this product my nails now are so strong and grow so fast I actually have to trim them down. I recommend this to everyone I know that needs it.</li>
    <li> I needed some help for my nails after I had my acrylics removed. I tried Sally Hanson &amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34;, which was nice, but peeled off after a few days. Someone on Pinterest recommended this, and I have to say it does a fantastic job. My nails are still really thin, but the Nail Envy has smoothed them out and made them stronger. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with chipping, splitting or breaking since I started using it two weeks ago. Great product!</li>
    <li> Strong nails in no time.</li>
    <li> This product does strengthen my nails.  I don&#x27;t know that my nails would stay strong without it, so I &#x27;ll probably have to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a life long nail bitter and this stuff made my nails too strong to bite! Definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for people with brittle nails do to aging.  Dries quickly and evenly.  I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet because I have acrylics on but I had my mom try it out &amp; she absolutely loves it; it has made her nails very strong.</li>
    <li> Makes a great quick dry base coat, but that&#x27;s about it. My nails are still as weak as before, after using this for several months and following the directions pretty closely.</li>
