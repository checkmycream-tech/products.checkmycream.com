<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY TRIED THIS PRODUCT ONCE SO FAR. AND I MUST SAY I DO LIKE THE EFFECTS HOWEVER, MY SKIN DID NOT PULSATE. I THINK WITH CONTINUAL USE THIS HEALING CLAY  WILL WORK!</li>
    <li> This works! I could feel the clay pulling on my skin.  I tablespoon of clay with 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar plus water was more than enough for my face and neck area. After I rinsed off the mask, my pores looked smaller and I was able to see two large whiteheads out of my pores....gross I know but if you are obsessed with clean skin then buy this. It will last you a long time and you can divide the jars with a friend.</li>
    <li> My cousin and I tried this out exactly as the directions said on the back. With the exception that we didn&#x27;t put it on as thick as it said too. It took about twenty minutes to dry as it is. When first mixed the apple cider vinegar and the clay powder fizzed and bubbled but this is totally normal. I put it on thinner than the instructions called for because i didn&#x27;t want chunks breaking off. This was a very good thing as little pieces still broke free because my cousin and I broke out in a fit of laughter. This mask really makes your skin feel likes it&#x27;s being pulled tight (not a bad feeling). So smiling and laughing felt very strange.  It didn&#x27;t start to pulsate or tingle until it started to dry. It felt kinda weird and I swear i could see my face twitch. But overall if felt really nice. Really had to soak it to remove it and my face was red red red! I&#x27;m extremely pale and i looked like I&#x27;d spent an hour in the sun without sunblock! My cousin who is a bit more tan than me had very little redness. My skin felt a little tender but that started to go away as did the redness after about 30 minutes (this is also common according to the back of the packaging.) All in all i really like how my face felt afterwards it was very soft and there wasn&#x27;t any dryness or anything. Definitely going to be using this a lot. Will update this post after a few more applications just to say how my skin is reacting i.e. is is cleaning out the pores, shrinking pores, helping breakouts etc. I will also be mixing this mask with activated charcoal for more blackhead clearing purposes. I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
    <li> OMGoodness...!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is superb...I tried it tonight because I just received it earlier...OMG...I used it with vinegar...after 30 seconds it starts to contract and tighten...! I was like whoa and I couldn&#x27;t really open my mouth that wide because it was that tight and that intense...!! I left it on for 15 minutes...I then rinsed it off with warm water. The feeling afterwards was Awesomesauce...!! I love it...I will be ordering it again...Oh by the way, you get 2...2!!! Awesome...! My skin feels so good and alive...!</li>
    <li> This is my second time using this product and I love it, it leaves my skin clean and soft.  I purchased 2 jars 1lb.  Each, thinking I was going run out of it fast. but to my surprise a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;You only need about 1 1/2 teaspoons,  If you&#x27;re only applying it on your face.</li>
    <li> Amazing product I really liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful mask for those looking for a more clear and clean complexion.  I mix mine with apple cider vinegar (as recommended on the label) and it feels so good when it&#x27;s on.  Of course, when it dries, it definitely feels tight but after you wash it off, you can tell an immediate difference in terms of clear pores and overall clarity.  One jar can last several months if you use this mask on a weekly basis.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Amazing deep pore cleanser. I never knew clay would make my face so refreshing. I use this every sunday night. Its super affordable and my favorite, it&#x27;s ORGANIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No chemicals, no break outs. I have sensitive skin with acne break outs from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate your skin with an ORGANIC cleaner such as Burts Bee&#x27;s products. Use the clay mask following the directions on the label. Then moisturize with your favorite product. I use Viva Labs Organic coconut oil for all of my skin!</li>
    <li> My review may not come up as a verified purchase but I did order this on amazon a few years ago. Just now getting around to reviewing because I just recently started using it and the one I put based is no longer available so it would be a waste to leave a review on that link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways like I said I bought this back in 2013 with the intention is using it to help my skin. I suffer from a skin condition called HS (won&#x27;t get into details but I sure have terrible skin) I get a lot of scars which end up accumulating black heads and it just looks terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I completely forgot I ordered this and pulled it out last month, I mixed it with Apple sider vineager as instructed and apply it with a hair coloring mixing brush in a plastic bowl. I apply it think but not quite 1/4 inch thick but it is plenty! It takes a bit to dry and once it does hopefully your in the bathroom already because if you move it crumbles and moves off making a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on my face, neck , arm puts, breasts, thighs and I am happy with the product. I feel very clean, my skin is fresh and the next day my complection is so much better. I have used it 3-4 times in about 6 weeks but I&#x27;m going to try and do it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have more than 3/4 of my jar with the uses.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s doing something other than scare me when the mrs applies it.... Skin is looking near flawless again</li>
    <li> I have never tried a facial mask that did everything it claimed on the first try..until now. I used the bentonite clay as instructed: 2 tbs apple cider vinegar in a ziploc bag to 2 1/2 tbs fine clay powder. I mashed the bag until it was a good muddy consistency and turned the bag inside out to spread on my face. It worked so well we did it with my 10-year-old daughter too. It was fun looking like tree people and playing mario bros together. We found it doesn&#x27;t take much and you can leave the excess in the ziploc for later use. I&#x27;ve added my old mudmasks into the bag and have mixed them to finish them off before switching to bentonite clay permanently. You can use it as a base for any mask and it cleans out your pores better than any chemical! I&#x27;m throwing out my 6-year Proactiv subscription!! You can feel your skin tighten and if you have the patience..you can watch the dirt climb out of your pores. I use Nubian Heritage Shea Butter Salve with Neem and Indian Hemp to moisturize afterward because it also is an antibacterial, anti-inflamatory, and Shea with black seed fixes everything. Your face continues to eject dirt and clogs for hours afterward and the neem/shea seem to amplify this effect. I haven&#x27;t tried it as a tub soak yet because I like the plumbing in my house...but will have to try it after a day in the garden this spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warnings:&lt;br /&gt;Careful how much you put down the drain...it is clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage will dry skin...it is clay...so moisturize (Shea, cocoa butter, Nubian Heritage lotion/salve is great!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pain and pulsing occurs during dry time so be prepared and hold out until it dries completely and turns your face a beautiful shade of sunburn-red</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a face mask 2-3 times a week per the directions. I have seen some improvement of the skin issues I had crop up recently. Definitely helps to reduce oil and tighten the skin for a day or two right after application.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure magic! Whether used in a bath or as a miracle exfoliating, skin cleansing, detoxifying, deep pore cleansing and refreshing earth blessing, it has served me enough to a point that I am very glad to three of them at the moment.</li>
    <li> Works great for controlling acne and improving the skin&#x27;s texture. Also great for detoxing the body. I used this for body wraps while wearing a sauna suit for an hour. Depending on heat and movement you can lose a lot of inches or a few.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mask that truly pulls out the impurities in your skin for a long time. After long research I came across this mask on Amazon and read all the positive reviews so I thought I give it a try. I never had acne till 6 months after I had my second child and it has been horrible. Big red pimples all on my cheeks and jaw line which is hormone related. I&#x27;ve been using the Indian healing clay masks for about 2 months now and it has truly helped my skin. I use it twice a week and you literally feel your skin pulsate and pulling out the impurities. I&#x27;ve tried so many different masks and nothing compares. Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> along with the raw apple cider vinegar this stuff really works...its like a spa treatment. good stuff</li>
    <li> Wow. You can really feel this stuff getting the blood moving in your face. Almost to the point to when it dries, it hurts, but it really does leave your skin feeling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest mixing the clay with apple cider vinegar in a plastic sandwich baggie to eliminate crazy mess. Apply an nice past-like consistancy to your face and let it dry. LET IT DRY. It&#x27;s going to itch. It&#x27;s going to be uncomfortable. It&#x27;s going to pulsate. Just suck it up, and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, use WARM WATER to remove the mask. Don&#x27;t try and peel anything off (unless you want to actually lose layers and layers of skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful of sensitive drains. This stuff can clog easily!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really love the way this makes my skin look/feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference already and only used it twice! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my second tub of this mask so I obviously like it!  I only use it about twice a month because my skin has a tendency to be a little sensitive.  That being said, this mask leaves my face totally smooth and radiant!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!! I loved the price for two!  I use it everyday that I don&#x27;t want oil to take over my face and ruin my makeup.  I completely takes away the shine for at least 8 hours.</li>
    <li> The product shipped very quickly and the mask works like magic. It pulls out grime from your pores and you can feel it pulsating when applied. I will use this product for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Amazeeeeballllllssss this is so necessary in your skincare routine but you need the braggs vinegar to mix I got mine at target for 5$ so worth every penny. The deal is great 2 for like 9$ ? Awesome</li>
    <li> It did pulsate my skin  and I did notice my pores getting smaller I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I had very positive results, it has helped immensely with her moderate, yet deep acne. I am glad I bought a two pack. Mixed the Aztec secret with ACV.Afterwards utilized thayers alcohol free rosewater witchazel, then applied fragrance free moisturizer &amp; vitamin E afterwards. (I also used a small bit of e.v. cold pressed coconut oil.) A little bit of this goes a long way, so I would recommend mixing half the recommended amount.</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  Prompt delivery time</li>
    <li> My skin feels wonderful after one of these masks!</li>
    <li> This mask is great, the price was great as well. arrived on time, This clay mask is easy to make, you can also add tea tree oil and aspirin to help with acne!</li>
    <li> Thanks, works great for my skin. I have sensitive skin and most acne treatments break me out worse or make my face swell up, this product makes my face feel wonderful directly after using it and keeps my skin clear. Also works great for tightening stretch marks</li>
    <li> Several people had recommended I try bentonite clay and I am glad a friend gave me a chance to try this product. As a first warning do not mix this clay onto something metal, it will decrease the effectiveness of the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this clay for a few things now. Initially I bought it to heal a burn that left a red mark, a pretty large red mark. It&#x27;s been working on that. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my chin which has helped with the discoloration and blackheads that i thought were permanant dark marks of pores that constantly got blackheads. My chin is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a foot detox as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best though, I used this on a boil, and it drew out the gross stuff right away. This will be my go to for boils, as well as bug bites. This works way better than calamine lotion on bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info about bentonite incase you don&#x27;t know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Mountain Rose Herbs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Bentonite, also referred to as Montmorillonite, is one of the most effective and powerful healing clays. Bentonite can be used externally as a clay poultice, mud pack or in the bath and, in skin care recipes. A good quality Bentonite should be a grey/cream color and anything bordering “pure white” is suspect. It has a very fine, velveteen feel and is odorless and non-staining. The type of bentonite offered by Mountain Rose herbs is a Sodium Bentonite.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite Clay is composed of aged volcanic ash. The name comes from the largest known deposit of Bentonite Clay located in Fort Benton, Wyoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Bentonite is a swelling clay. When it becomes mixed with water it rapidly swells open like a highly porous sponge. From here the toxins are drawn into the sponge through electrical attraction and once there, they are bound.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite clay carries a strong negative charge which bonds to the positive charge in many toxins. When it comes in contact with a toxin, chemical, or heavy metal, the clay will absorb the toxin and release it’s minerals for the body to use. Bentonite also helps get oxygen to cells as it pulls excess hydrogen and allows the cells to replace it with oxygen instead.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest reviewthe toxin and release it’s minerals for the body to use.

    <li> Product arrived on time! My teenage kids and I have used it, product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Works great. It does have a bit of a weird smell but for the price I can get over that. There is a bit of a learning curve to mixing it properly to get it without lumps, but all in all I am completely pleased with this product. I mainly use it for face masks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists and tried every facial cleanser available, and it helps but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 21 year old guy, and my skin makes me look like I&#x27;m 16. This reduces redness and prevents most breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but this makes my existing redness a lot less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> You will never have to buy another anti wrinkle cream again. This mask is amazing even my husband loves it. And he is a very macho tough guy..he would be mad if he knew I posted this.. ha ha. Anyway it removes all the blackheads, reduces the size of your pores and makes your skin more taught! I love it. We use it once a week.</li>
    <li> This is a top notch product.  I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s raw apple cider vinegar. And you don&#x27;t need much. Sometimes I will use more and make it thick for a heavy treatment. Most of the time I make it a bit thinner consistency. It is a bit uncomfortable the first few times you use it, it really tightens as it dries and tightens your skin. DO NOT try to remove it without wetting it or you will be in pain.  I only use it before I shower. I actually leave it on about 30 mins, then get in the shower and let the warm water run on my face, then gently start to rub my face in small circles with my fingers. It takes a few mins to get off, don&#x27;t try to rush it.  Skin feels great after. I would not recommend doing anything else to your face except using a moisturizer immediately after your shower. I use a goat&#x27;s milk lotion and it works fine. You will experience some pimples at first because it is getting all the dirt out.  Oh and also, when it is on, DO NOT move your face! It will hurt, try to keep your face as still as possible.</li>
    <li> I have only used this one time and it really seems to be working. I left it on about 40 minutes which was way too long so my face was irritated for about 2 hours after I took the mask off. It made my skin feel very smooth afterwards and the day after my face feels hydrated, but not oily like it normally is. Love this product so far!</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> works just the way it is advertised. this item was well worth the price. I have problem skin so I did not leave it on the full time suggested.</li>
    <li> This product is awful,  period.&lt;br /&gt;After applying this Aztec clay my skin started breaking out like a teenager.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter bought this Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay and loves it! Having been on every treatment under the sun, including Accutane, to treat her cystic acne I was a bit sceptical the first time she threw it in the basket saying, \\&quot;Kirsten swears by this!\\&quot;  Her refusal to ever use Accutane again even though it is the only thing that had EVER really worked for her, I agreed that this clay was cheap enough to try even though grocery-store products to me seemed a bit ridiculous after what we had been through since she was 11.  It works!  Of course she still has the normal hormonal breakouts, but not the painful cysts she once had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently she left her Aztec behind when she returned to college 6 hours away so I gave it to her sister in hopes she would benefit from its healing powers....  Not one to follow a protocol, her sister brought it BACK to me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;m getting ready to plant wildflowers......Because removing this clay is about as easy as removing the top two layers of skin, I decided it would work well in SEED BOMBS.  Sure enough!  I had fun rolling these seed bombs, but even MORE fun shooting them into my enormous \\&quot;yard\\&quot; using my youngest daughter&#x27;s slingshot.  My manicured grassy area is only around the immediate area of my house.  Beyond that is natural rangeland so wildflowers are wonderful in Spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I have a complicated complexion: oily T-zone, large pores, acne and abundant black heads. This product is helping make it less complicated. I used it 3x a week with my usual facial products, it prevents breakouts and hastens the healing process of pimples. I&#x27;ve tried mixing with a 1:1 ratio in water, white vinegar &amp; apple cider vinegar--ACV is the best, IMO. Make sure you do slather it on. You can feel the &#x27;pulsating&#x27; faster with ACV.. It dries like cement, so just keep it for a maximum of 20mins, even if it doesn&#x27;t completely dries up--wash it off, i find that wiping it off with a soaked towel helps before washing it off completely. Your skin will be red for a few minutes to an hour after you wash the mask off, if you do have sensitive skin--do a spot test first, you shouldn&#x27;t feel any itchiness, but you may feel it &#x27;pulsate&#x27; (the pulsating is a normal sensation that a majority of reviewers and I felt). From other reviews, they said it clogs the drain--I&#x27;ve never experienced this so far. I&#x27;ve used it with spot treatments and it works well.</li>
    <li> I am an avid beauty junky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the top skin care stuff to the drugstore products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This make my skin GORGEOUS and you feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week with apple cider to mix NOT water.  Its amazing how soft my skin feels with out any irritation (I have sensitive/oily skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using it at night as it can cause a bit of redness and to use an oil free or light moisturizer if you feel you need any not to clog up those newly purged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(my boyfriend loves this stuff too!)</li>
    <li> It irritated my face just not for me but i haerd it was a very good product not saying don&#x27;t buy it my face may be different from yours...</li>
    <li> This healing clay is very effective.  I can feel the clay pulling the impurities from my skin while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally for the cool label and the reviews.  It was a good purchase.  You have to mix this powdery stuff with water, but the positive side of that, is that it doesn&#x27;t go bad in the tube, like other masks.  It performs well.  It gets itchy at the very end of the drying process.  It does a remarkable job of reducing pore size and giving the skin a clean glow.  A+</li>
    <li> I finally tried it over the weekend, it&#x27;s really good, I had a little bit of trouble mixing it at first, but finally got it at the right consistency.  I had a blackhead that I couldn&#x27;t get rid off and after using the mask, it&#x27;s now gone.  I believe that if I use it regularly, I can have the clear skin I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> Great mask. Leaves my face refreshed and firms it. Pores look smaller.</li>
    <li> My son swears by this stuff to calm down his skin after a close shave.  I love that it leaves my face feeling so clean...and doesn&#x27;t make my skin too dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Makes my skin look and feel great. I will order this forever!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. It eaves my face feeling refreshed, clean, and so soft. I am always hesitant to apply anything to my face and try to stay natural. Be sure to follow the directions and add ACV. I attempted it once without, and it left my face red and blotchy. I love the great deal I found here on the 2 pack. This stuff makes for an excellent detoxifying foot mask as well, just be sure to have a plunger around to help push it through the drains.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Clears my face and tightens pores and makes my skin so soft. I use it 2-3 times a week</li>
    <li> Buy it you&#x27;ll like it. I bought the 2 pack since it is a great value. I also bought some for my daughter since she LOVED it when I visited her with mine and my sister also got the two pack from me since my daughter couldn&#x27;t stop telling her how much she loves it. I also buy the \\&quot;real aloe\\&quot; I mix my clay with that. FABULOUS.</li>
    <li> It is ok but not as i expected</li>
    <li> Strong face mask, I really like it. Gives your face a pulsating feeling and all my friends love trying it and like how clean their face feels after</li>
    <li> Not as good as everyone makes it out to be, but still works well.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I have been struggling with acne for probably 5 years now, and in the last year it turned really nasty and cystic. Granted it&#x27;s gotten a lot better, it&#x27;s still far from \\&quot;normal skin\\&quot;. I have tried literally every topical ointment, cream, pill, scrub, lotion, acid, anything, even birth control pills. I gave up dairy- gluten- breaded foods, fried foods, sugar, chocolate, everything except for basically asparagus and spinach and broccoli- and still I had these cysts forming on my jawline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started taking a fiber supplement- colon cleanse by Yerba Prima every morning in water, zinc, and a probiotic along with doing this mask every night, and I must say in the week that I&#x27;ve been doing this- my skin has gotten A LOT better. My problems areas are around my cheeks and jaw line, although I do get acne on my forehead. This mask has cleared that up- pulled out literally all the black heads and my nose area- those areas are actually shiny and clean looking- not oily but nice and fresh. My cheeks are getting better, I just seem to have one or two bumps and the red marks left behind by old pimples. And it has flattened out the cystic bumps that I do have left on my jaw line, and has even drawn some others closer to the surface- all in ONE WEEK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I think worth mentioning though are:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are using this for cystic acne or acne in general- there is something internal that is causing your flare ups and no cream or face wash is going to solve that, hence the fiber. I read a lot on this topic and they say acne can be caused by an over growth of unhealthy bacteria in the digestive tract, mainly the colon. This bacteria is trapped in biofilm, which is a thick sticky coating around clusters of bacteria that make it almost impossible to break down. You need something that can help regulate your colon so that these things get passed easily and don&#x27;t build up in your system. I never would have believed this upuntil about 3 weeks ago when I started this powder and I can go back to eating dairy and gluten without any new bumps or giant cysts forming! The bottom line is that you need to take care of your inside and heal the acne from the inside out- don&#x27;t expect this mask to prevent any new cysts/ pimples from forming, that is your diet. BUT- for the junk that is in your skin and is underneath deep down- the existing junk- this really helps to bring it out so your skin can start to heal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When they say it pulses- IT PULSES. I actually find it relaxing and sometimes nod off while wearing it, but towards the end of the drying process- it does get a little intense and the mask get REALLY tight. Your face is paralyzed and sometimes it can hurt- or it kind of just feels like your stretching your skin off- if you move your face too much. For sensitive acne skin, this can be kind of rough- but it&#x27;s manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It is a PAIN IN THE BUTT to get off. I literally only do it at night time and then just shower and let warm water stream over my face in the shower for a good 5 minutes for it to soften then I use a wash cloth to get everything else off.&lt;br /&gt;I also did it once before going out- and my foundation and make up was substantially less oily and I didn&#x27;t have to use as much! Crazy! - but it took 20 minutes to take off lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Your face will be red  after you take it off. I kind of like to think that this signifies that it is actually working. It fades in about 20-25 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. You will need to moisturize afterwards. My absolute favorite moisturizer ever that also is known for healing acne scars and pulling out impurities is tamanu oil. It smells really funky, but paired with this mask before bed time, I wake up and the cysts are pretty flat and any old pimples are pretty much just flat without the swelling, maybe a little red. It&#x27;s pretty crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. They say it clogs your sinks, but I wash the dish I use for mixing in acontinuous flow of warm water and have not had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Don&#x27;t use metal anything to mix it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think over all- this mask is maybe 8$ although you can find it for cheaper and the apple cider vinegar is like, 4$. This is so very reasonable compared to what I used to pay for acne treatments. I&#x27;ve maybe wasted 1000&#x27;s$ on stupid things. I&#x27;m glad I found this because it can be used in all stages of skin life- including when the acne finally stops and you can take care of wrinkles and things like that with this! It is definitely something that I am going to continue buying and using regardless of how it works for my acne, because I can only imagine how amazing it would be on clear skin! You&#x27;d be glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Looking for something that clears your face and gives you that at home spa facial feel? this is the stuff for you!</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it with lemon and ACV, and apply a thin layer twice a week.</li>
    <li> Because it is a powder you can mix and make as much or as little as you need, a single tablespoon is perfect for a single facial. It can be kept in the bathroom closet for years and not go bad, in fact my last container has been lasting over 3 years.  I keep it on until it is almost completely dry and feel my face pulsating, when I&#x27;m done my pores have never felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> Mixed with some organic apple vinegar and made into a paste, it works wonders when used on your face. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this mask, I am so pleased with the result.  It really does rejuvenate the skin and if you have any issues like pimples or whatever, it does heal them.  I swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> This clay works very well to lighten sun damage on the face and hands. Used every other day you&lt;br /&gt;will see a noticeable difference in your skin tone. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for reducing redness and evens skin tone. Add some sea kelp, jojoba oil, essential lavender oil and water or acv for a luxurious experience.</li>
    <li> For years I have had bad acne. I get scars that can last for weeks because of it and I feel as though I have tried about a thousand products and not one could do Anything!!! But I found this and saw some great reviews and I figured why not, and I am so glad I did! After using it just once the next day most of my scars and blemishes were gone. I was amazed. The only thing is that it dries your skin out a bit and my skin is already dry to begin with but if you put lotion on afterwards you should be fine. If you can get ahold of it Neal&#x27;s Yard Remedies Frankincense Hydrating Cream works super well.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and shipping was quick and simple</li>
    <li> love the ay its working</li>
