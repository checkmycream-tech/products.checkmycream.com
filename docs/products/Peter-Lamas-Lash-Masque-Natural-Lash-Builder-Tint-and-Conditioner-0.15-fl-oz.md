      <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>

      <li>I think it&#x27;s even better!</li>
      <li>Helps with gaps between tinting, and works on its own as well.</li>

      <li>This is a natural wonderful product..</li>

      <li>I have very light lashes and brows--</li>
      <li>Seems to be a very light brown.  </li>
      <li>Loved it from first application!  </li>
      <li>I have chronic uveitis and it has prevented me from wearing mascara for more than two years.</li>
      <li>This reminds me of Neutrogena&#x27;s Lash Tint with more staying power.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any advantage to using more than one coat.</li>
      <li>I put on more than one coat..</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that my lashes are any nicer or more nourished or whatever, but that&#x27;s not the reason I bought</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t give you caterpillar lashes, if that&#x27;s what you like, but it is buildable and lengthens and separates better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but some smudging under eyes.</li>
      <li>Also seems more prone to flaking this time.</li>
      <li>I know there is better out there</li>
      <li>All of these are better than the results I had Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>And while the price is more than Neutrogena was, I am more pleased...</li>
      <li>I like this even better.</li>
      <li>See a difference in my eyelashes for the better.</li>

      <li>All in all, I use it way more on my eyebrows then eye lashes.</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>this product did nothing more than water would do.</li>
      <li>but they changed the formula to more of a mascara</li>
      <li>This product is more mascara like rather than tint...</li>
      <li>Am waiting for the paraben free product!</li>
      <li>Downgraded to 4 stars from my original 5 star review, to be honest</li>
      <li>This product gives lashes a &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; of color, great to lengthen for a natural look or use under mascara.</li>
      <li>ok for when you want light no makeup feel and look.</li>
      <li>Great for work when I want to just look alive.</li>
      <li>It may be good for your lashes, which is why I am continuing to use it, but I really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>This is especially effective on eyebrows as the brush raises the natural arch whilst imparting perfect natural lookng colour with only one sweep.</li>

      <li>It is comfortable on my eyes all day and is easy to take off at night.  </li>
      <li>Rec&#x27;d quickly &amp; BNIB!  </li>
      <li>This stuff really is making my lashes better!  </li>
      <li>But for what I wanted, this is perfect for everyday wear.  </li>
      <li>I hope this product will always be available.</li>
      <li>over priced .does not build but does lightly darken light lashes .</li>
      <li>I just could never be comfortable wearing it because I was always stressing about the racoon eyes.</li>
      <li>I have light eyelashes</li>
      <li>It is better than a pencil because it doesn&#x27;t leave distinct lines.</li>
      <li>It really does separate the lashes nicely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well for me as I am not looking for mascara, but rather something to naturally darken and lengthen my lashes. Does not rub or cry off.</li>
    <li> A disappointment.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I was tired of gooey, clumpy mascara.  I like the more natural look.  The natural lash builder darkens my lashes perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! I do not like for mascara to be obvious and this is amazing at just simply darkening the lashes and brows with a tint rather then caking them with black goop. It is great for also shaping eyebrows in that it acts like a type of gel. I 100% recommend this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This down not add a lot of color to lashes however I have noticed significantly healthier lashes since using this product in combination iwht my usual mascara</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly to condition and strengthen my thinning lashes..Since it is also a tint, that was a plus..  I have tried tints before, and really had no opinion one way or the other..they are what they are, and they are definitely not like a mascara..The thing I did not like about this particular one, was that it is very liquid, and runs and smears..I tried it twice, and had it all over my eyes..kind of a waste of time, money and product..</li>
    <li> I have chronic uveitis and it has prevented me from wearing mascara for more than two years. Another patient in the waiting room at my doctors office recommended I try a lash tint. So I found this on a Google search and gave it a shot. I love it! Darkens my lashes yet it&#x27;s lightweight and flexible and does not irritate my eyes whatsoever. 10 stars!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. It seemed dried out and my lashes were sticking together. I was expecting it to be easy to put on. I do like the ingredients though. I still use it but not as much.</li>
    <li> See a difference in my eyelashes for the better. So glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a conditioner but you can definately wear it instead of mascara.  I have used it both ways and it works well either way.  It does tint your lashes so they aren&#x27;t \\&quot;fake\\&quot; colored.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> If you want a lash builder use Orgins or something that is half the price and does a way better job! -- It appears there is barely any product in the tube and I will get several uses out of it before its dried up and I have to throw it out  No way worth the money - its like a cheap dime store brand - I can barely see a difference - you still have to apply mascara if you want any color or thickness to your lash</li>
    <li> Looks natural, doesn&#x27;t flake. Good for those of us with blondish lashes, no one else will see any difference.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. We recently acquired a wood furnace and I learned the hard way that fire and mascara don&#x27;t mix. But I missed my long lashes and this works beautifully. It won&#x27;t give you caterpillar lashes, if that&#x27;s what you like, but it is buildable and lengthens and separates better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not as good as other similar products on the market. Clumps and runs</li>
    <li> This is something I use in the morning when I don&#x27;t want to wear a lot of makeup.  It gives a nice subtle tint to your lashes and works great to darken your eye brows.  I have very light lashes and brows--which is why it shows up on me.  (Don&#x27;t confuse it with a dark mascara)</li>
    <li> Lash Masque contains a small amount of mascara but it darkens  eyelashs without clumping and,it&#x27;s semi permanent, so it comes of when you wash it of. Lash Masque may also be used to color eyebrows; I use it replace of mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was sick of regular Mascara&#x27;s leaving little dried up broken bits all over my cheeks.  So I thought a lash \\&quot;tint\\&quot; would be great.    However, I can put this on, and on and on, and on....which I do....  and it never shows up.  It is completely invisible.  Seems to be a very light brown.  It is much like the \\&quot;clear\\&quot; mascara&#x27;s that, unbelievably, some people buy.    If you have long lush lashes in the first place, this might be a viable option as it will BARELY add a HINT of color, and I mean BARELY....and no, it does not leave little pieces on your cheeks.      You can wipe the brush on your finger, and yes, it looks dark...however, you cannot transfer it to your lashes.  It has no \\&quot;stickiness\\&quot; needed to make it transfer from the brush to your lashes.  The human eye cannot even tell there is anything on the lashes.  That&#x27;s the thing right there.....the \\&quot;formula\\&quot; is more of a \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; and your lashes will be soft and smooth, therefore no dried up pieces to fall.  However, the soft and smooth conditioner also is incapable of showing up on your lashes.    So it was a good premise, but fails.    When I look in my 10X magnifying mirror, I can see that the lashes have some perceptible color to them.  But it does no good when it&#x27;s not apparent to the unaided human eye.    If you have short invisible lashes in the first place, like I do, they will remain that way with this product.    It&#x27;s a joke for $16.95.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. You really do BUILD the tint on your lashes, so it takes more than one coat to make a very dark look. Even one coat provides a very natural looking enhancement. The fluid itself is wonderfully NEVER clumpy, and does a great job showing up the very thin long tips to your lashes, both top and bottom. I especially like this on my bottom lashes, since in my mid-50s, I don&#x27;t want a harsh eyeline or lash look, just an emphasis to make my eyes pop in a more natural and soft way. Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive compared to other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit late 2015: I was quite disappointed with my second tube of this product. It seems thicker, much more prone to clumping especially with the still-needed repeat application. Also seems more prone to flaking this time. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy again. Sad because I had thought this was the answer to my quest for naturally enhanced lashes. Downgraded to 4 stars from my original 5 star review, to be honest I considered making it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> what a waste. i got it tried it and didnt do anything for my eyelashes. i read up on it before i bought it was so sure it would work.. disappointed !!</li>
    <li> I like this lash tint because it makes my lashes that are blond on the tips look longer and darker without looking like I&#x27;m wearing mascara.  There&#x27;s no clumping and it doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge off (a problem I have with regular mascara, even the ones that say they don&#x27;t flake or smudge.) The tint lasts a long time, I often find my lashes still look dark the next morning, but it washes off easily enough.  It also seems to make my lashes curl slightly. The only problem I have found, it takes a little longer to dry. One other note the mascara tube is not as pictured, but does seem to be the same product.</li>
    <li> Loved it from first application!  Dark rich black.....makes my long light colored eyelashes visible.  No stiffness/flakes as noted by others.  I prefer a natural look and therefore I HATE mascara....the clumps, the racoon eyes, the horrible obviousness etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect.  Looks as natural as possible.  Applied once three days ago.  Can still see evidence of the tint.....no running, no flaking.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes burn. Not using it</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara substitute. It&#x27;s dark enough for me. I have naturally long and full lashes and just need a little bit of definition. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smudge, flake, clump or feel heavy on my lashes. I should probably stock up because every time I find a mascara I like, it get discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 now and although I have very long lashes and plenty of them, the tips have become almost invisible over the years. Mascara is not something I like to use. This product is simply fabulous. One layer darkens all of my lashes so beautifully and I use it on my eye brows as well. Looks and feels completely natural. Love it. Thanks Lamas Beauty.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how close to a mascara it was.  Gave my lashes bulk and was very dark.  I am allergic to mascaras so I have been searching for something I can wear.  Alas, I got a reaction after wearing it a few times.  Oh well, the search continues...</li>
    <li> This mascara provided average coverage on my lashes that was neither lengthening nor volume enhancing.  The smell of the product was off and slightly unpleasant.  I doubt I will buy this product again, and may be hesitant to buy this Lamas brand again.</li>
    <li> This has lasted me 2 years and it hasn&#x27;t dried out yet! I recently have been using it again for holiday parties where I don&#x27;t want to put on too much makeup, and I noticed my lashes became longer and thicker after using it... It has definitely gotten me excited to use it more often and I was thinking of buying another one to last me another two years.</li>
    <li> Discovered the Lash Mask many years ago and just love it. Don&#x27;t expect this to be a mascara  - it&#x27;s not. I use it at night to condition and protect my lashes and it looks super - very subtle but adds a little zing to your eyes.  Tip: if you want to give your lashes a break from mascara, or just want a more natural look you can use a lash primer and then add this over to colour your lashes.</li>
    <li> Color is very light and hardly shows on lower lashes but actually good on eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I often dye and tint my lashes, the look of mascara is too dramatic for me.  I&#x27;d rather have a more natural look.  For me this product delivered.  I apply only one coat and it works similar to a die in that the translucent tips of my lashes are darkened.  The results do not last as long as a permanent die, only a few days with most lost during the first night.&lt;br /&gt;No problem with breakage for me, but I have somewhat oily skin.  If you must remove this product prior to wearing off over time, use of a waterproof makeup cleanser is needed.  I think attempting to use this product with more than one coat to build volume would create a sticky stiff result, one coat is perfect and natural.</li>
    <li> This is a good halfway point between mascara and bare lashes. I have sensitive eyes and regular mascara tends to cause issues. I&#x27;ve had zero problems with sensitivity, with this product. If you want full, fake looking lashes then look elsewhere. This gives them just a touch more definition then bare. Another reviewer called it &amp;#34;camping mascara&amp;#34; which I agree with wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump going on, even after several applications, so looks natural in a way that most mascaras don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  When I want to look like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup but like I have great lashes, I wear this.  And if I want to have a great mascara day, I wear this under my mascara.  It really does separate the lashes nicely.</li>
    <li> really like this stuff</li>
    <li> This is especially effective on eyebrows as the brush raises the natural arch whilst imparting perfect natural lookng colour with only one sweep. Lashes reqiure two or three coats but noticeably enhance appearance &amp; give the wow factor if followed by mascara but for a daytime natural look isn&#x27;t necessary. Definitely one to keep on hand!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mascara that does not come off easily, and I came across this mascara.  I read all the reviews, so I knew it was not going to be a dramatic mascara.  I am happy with it.  I have very light eyelashes, so the subtle tint to this mascara is nice.  If I want dark lashes, I will use a different mascara.  And the mascara does not come off on my skin as much as other brands do, so I&#x27;m happy with that, too.  I don&#x27;t know that my lashes are any nicer or more nourished or whatever, but that&#x27;s not the reason I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is a very subtle mascara, and doesn&#x27;t readily come off on your skin.</li>
    <li> Product made my lashes very stiff, and I saw no discernable darkening of my lashes even after applying three coats. My eyes are seldom product-sensitive, but my right upper lid started tingling and then burning shortly after applying.  I was not at all impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of Neutrogena&#x27;s Lash Tint with more staying power. Didn&#x27;t survive 4 days but 1 to 2 days OR a nice long shower/bath. It colors lashes and brows decently which is what I wanted. Not much added volume or length. If you want a natural, low to no makeup look this is great. Also great if you&#x27;re camping or outdoors. If you don&#x27;t want the hassle of makeup but still want a little eye enhancement that wont run everywhere, this is a very good option.</li>
    <li> This product is more mascara like rather than tint... It promoted natural look without flaking or smearing but it smears and wears off leaving ur lashes no different. Product states conditions, darkens and lengths but other less expensive tints I have used in the past worked better. Their tint dried quickly and actually darkened the lashes with no rubbing off or smears and looked natural .. I suggest save your money!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say it, but this product does not deliver anything it promises. It&#x27;s like applying a thin coat of water based sheer (very sheer) color.  I am not at all satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this product years ago. I like mascara but it&#x27;s always been a problem for me. My skin is oily and the mascara would always smear or smudge or flake. I just could never be comfortable wearing it because I was always stressing about the racoon eyes. And it would irritate my eyes with the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is different. No chemical smell or irritation, goes on easily, dries quickly, does NOT smudge or flake or smear. It&#x27;s not as dramatic as a true mascara but it&#x27;s perfect for the daytime when I want to look nice without looking madeup.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results from this. No really visible tint or thickening of lashes. It did make my lashes feel silky after I had washed it off. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this  &#x27;Peter Lamas Natural Lash Builder, Tint, Conditioner&#x27; after reading the reviews &amp; knowing full well it probably was NOT a true &#x27;lash tint&#x27; &amp; rather more likely a mascara-like tinting conditioner. I was right. I tried it out as soon as it arrived &amp; wore it over night. It did NOT last the night! But! I gave it 4 stars because; I can&#x27;t wear mascara! I&#x27;ve tried every single type out there, gave it up! I use those &#x27;Lash Builders&#x27; &amp; then use &#x27;clear mascara&#x27;. Colored mascara clumps on me, plain &amp; simple. I always, every single time-end up taking it off. This stuff-not a clump to be found anywhere! AMAZING! While it is nowhere near a long-lasting &#x27;tint&#x27;, it is definitely a wonderful, non-clumping mascara! YAH! As far as the &#x27;builder&#x27; &amp; &#x27;conditioner&#x27; part, that remains to be seen, but it has now become my one &amp; only favorite mascara of all time! TYVM, Peter Lamas! :)</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this.  I can&#x27;t even see that anything is in the tube.  Maybe there&#x27;s a bad batch of empty containers.  Not worth hassle of returning but will NOT purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is great as a weekend tinter, but it&#x27;s much lighter then expected. I have very blond lashes, with very blond eyebrows, and very blond hair. It&#x27;s all also very fine so they get weighed down easily. this is great for just a little color if I&#x27;m going without makeup, or with very little. I also use it on my eyebrows. Its the perfect shade for them. All in all, I use it way more on my eyebrows then eye lashes.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. Some people say it&#x27;s a mascara; I disagree with that. It is not waxy at all and doesn&#x27;t build up volume or length. It seems to stay on most of the day, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any flaking or making dark circles under my eyes (and haven&#x27;t noticed anyone laughing and pointing, either). It does color your lashes with just one coat so they will appear longer since the tips are now darker. I haven&#x27;t seen any advantage to using more than one coat. This is nice to wear on days when you&#x27;re not glamming it up and just want your lashes to be visible. I like the conditioning aspect but haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference from using it in that regard. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very natural look. Not heavy or made-up looking. Also good on eyebrows. Highly recommended---especially for mature women looking for some conditioning/enhancing without a fake, over-done look. I have purchased this 4 or 5 times and plan to continue as long as the product is offered (hopefully for many years to come!)</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It has made my lashes darker and helped them to grow longer.  Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I like this , it seems  to work well. My lashes get blond at the ends so the dark tint is all  I want on there.</li>
    <li> This goes on like glue, sticky and clumpy. Awful to work with. I will go back to my other conditioner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing mascara.  I wear very little makeup.  When Neutrogena Clean Lash Tint was discontinued, I was very disappointed.  Another review mentions this as a good replacement.  I think it&#x27;s even better! The natural ingredients seem to nourish my lashes and the black tint is very subtle.  This light formula picks up even my tiniest lashes, making the overall impression that I have fuller lashes, not in the way that mascara thickens and lengthens.  I have also applied to my brows and find the results better than using a pencil for filling (just be careful not to pick up the tiny hairs around the actual brow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some problems with dry eyes.  When I use eyedrops or rub my eyes, there is no running, smudging or smearing.  And no flakes anywhere.  I&#x27;ve even left it on overnight and did not wake up with raccoon eyes.  My lashes feel softer and nourished, not brittle or stiff.  All of these are better than the results I had Neutrogena.  And while the price is more than Neutrogena was, I am more pleased... and it&#x27;s certainly less expensive than my favorite \\&quot;actual\\&quot; mascara, Chanel.</li>
    <li> This product gives lashes a &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; of color, great to lengthen for a natural look or use under mascara.</li>
    <li> I liked this mascara because I don&#x27;t like a heavy look, it stays on all day and removes easily with my normal facial cleanser.  If you like long lashes, this product won&#x27;t make you happy (reason for 4 stars). It gives me a little color on the upper and bottom lashes. If I want to reapply and refresh during the day, the lashes will not clump. I prefer a natural look which this mascara gives me, without clumping and easy application.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that tint is so much lighter than mascara.  I have blond eye lashes and I thought this would help my lashes look naturally brownish blond, but it really doesn&#x27;t help me look more alive.  Going back to using mascara.</li>
    <li> Contains &amp;#34;Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein&amp;#34; !!  May cause serious irritation if you&#x27;re sensitive / allergic to this.  Very disappointing as the color &amp; consistency were nice, I just had to stop using this because of bad irritation &amp; wasn&#x27;t eligible for a refund because I waited too long.  I thought it was allergies to something else but once I actually read the long list of ingredients &amp; stopped using this lash masque my eyes felt &amp; looked better!</li>
    <li> Does nothing at all, as far as I can see.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but some smudging under eyes.</li>
    <li> I kinda like this stuff. I know there is better out there but for the price it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I hate mascara (it cakes, it runs, it smudges and doesn&#x27;t stay put).  This product stays on your lashes and conditions them.  My lashes are actually healthier, thicker and longer since I&#x27;ve been using the product.  It won&#x27;t give you that dark &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; like mascara, but if you want something more natural looking that&#x27;s actually good for your lashes this is for you.</li>
    <li> So far this is doing exactly what I wanted it to do - darken my lashes.  First caveat is that I hate most mascara.  They can say they don&#x27;t clump or whatever but they end up doing just that.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from the most expensive to the cheapest.  I also seem to have slightly different eyelash textures on my eyes.  The right eyelashes are finer in consistency and whatever I put on them goes on differently than it does on the left.  My bottom lashes are the same way on both eyes, very fine and almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Hard Candy Lash Ink but they changed the formula to more of a mascara and so I was looking for something that did what it used to do.  With this product, I can get dark eyelashes that look pretty symmetrical in terms of appearance and I can even get my bottom lashes darkened which I sometimes have a problem with using mascara (at least without making a mess).  I&#x27;ve been using a lash conditioner for several months so my lashes are fairly long (although not false eyelash or mascara long) and with this product, I can get them to hold a curl pretty well so the look I get is exactly what I want - longish, dark lashes that look natural.  No spider leg eyelashes for me, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your lashes are already dark this might not do much to color them.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks so I can&#x27;t comment on the conditioning aspect.  But for what I wanted, this is perfect for everyday wear.  If I want something a little more dramatic I put this on first and then put just a small amount of IT Cosmetics black lash primer on the tips to give me more length.</li>
    <li> I like it. It darkens lashes without goopy clumps. Great for work when I want to just look alive. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you have naturally long, thick lashes like i do, then this is a great alternative to regular mascara. This product is all natural, which is what i love about it! So if you&#x27;re lazy &amp; dont remove your eye make-up, you dont have to worry about it taking out your lashes. Because it&#x27;s all natural, it has good things in it, that will condition your lashes. I put on more than one coat..build up, so that it gives a more dramatic look.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I was running low on the one I received over a year ago and am so glad Amazon has this in-stock now. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference! My eyelashes appear darker, thicker and longer. It&#x27;s great that this doesn&#x27;t flake or dry out in the tube. It looks natural, but still darkens your lashes, like mascara. This does not clump when applied. I&#x27;ve also used this on my eyebrows to slightly darken them and keep them in place. :)</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this; and so far I am liking it.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes crunchy not soft.  It adds tint but I prefer a conditioner that leaves my lashes soft.</li>
    <li> This product met my exact needs.  I am fair skinned with hard to see lashes and find mascaras make my lashes dry and brittle- and was looking for a product to darken my lashes while keeping them healthy- and this product does that perfectly.  It is comfortable on my eyes all day and is easy to take off at night.  This is a great everyday lash tint- I would not suggest it for a dramatic eyelash look and it does take longer than mascara to dry but is well worth the wait!!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product for eyelashes--it adds color but there is NO clumping or flakey residue you get with any mascara.  Sometimes its hard to find, so I buy two and store one!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I don&#x27;t use it on my lashes though as the name implies. I have found that it is absolutely the best eyebrow filler out there! It is very light weight but keeps your brows in place. The color is perfect for my hair color which is a dark brown. It is better than a pencil because it doesn&#x27;t leave distinct lines. As a mascara it is very light weight and almost sheer on most dark lashes, it provides a very natural but finished look. It also lasts for a long time in the bottle. I use it daily and can get almost a year out of one tube!</li>
    <li> I have short, blonde lashes. I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup and I dislike the heavy and unnatural look of mascara. This stuff makes my lashes look naturally brown instead of blonde. It doesn&#x27;t add volume, length, or weight, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> The product smuges. It does darken the lashes some.  Am waiting for the paraben free product!</li>
    <li> this product did nothing more than water would do. it is useless and I regret buying 2 tubes at once.</li>
    <li> I used the product in the picture and liked it a lot. What I got this time is more like a mascara--it can smudge and really needs to be removed at night.</li>
    <li> Went on easily, but needed a base to have any weight.  And did not last so the &#x27;tint&#x27; aspect was short-lived.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It gives a natural color to the brows and lashes.  It is not heavy just light and very covering.  I hope this product will always be available.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a mascara it&#x27;s lash builder, I think it works hard to tell however, I keep applying it under my real mascara.I gave it 4 stars because I can&#x27;t tell if it works or not.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d quickly &amp; BNIB!  :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a faulty product; but when I inserted wand  to get product onto the wand, hardly anything comes out. I even tried to brush it on my hand and had to press very hard to get any color at all on my hand.  Very disappointed with product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 2 weeks ago and the quality of what&#x27;s in the tube is not very good. I can hardly get anything onto my lashes, I think I might have been sold an old bottle or something.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! No flaking, no need to reapply. Keeps me from having to get my eyebrows dyed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s us no different from any drugstore mascara. I was hoping for an actual tint, without clumps, but this stuff is clumpy and I can&#x27;t imagine it would enhance the growth of your lashes. Not worth the price at all.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I misunderstood what this product was supposed to be used for.  I ordered it as a mascara, however, there is little to no color.  You can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;ve applied it.  It may be good for your lashes, which is why I am continuing to use it, but I really don&#x27;t know.  I would not order this again for a mascara.</li>
    <li> This Lash Tint applies easily. However, I barely notice any improvement in the volume or color of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it a longer trial period before I decide whether or not I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot even though it&#x27;s difficult to apply because it&#x27;s so &#x27;gloppy&#x27; and way too much of the mascara comes out of the tube when you remove the brush. Because of this a lot of it is wasted...but it&#x27;s worth it anyway!</li>
    <li> Product is a bust. Lots of hype and ultimately disappointing. Not a stain and not even particularly good mascara. :(</li>
    <li> This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve purchased that I actually love. Normal mascaras feel so heavy and itchy that I always end up rubbing it off, and they all clump, no matter what they advertise. I already have fairly long and dark lashes, so I only wanted a product to darken the tips, but still look natural. The closest product I had found before was Neutrogena lash tint, but it appears to be discontinued. I like this even better. It does not clump at all, looks completely natural and doesn&#x27;t itch, but still darkens and defines my lashes. From reading the other reviews, this seems to be a love it or hate it product. If you are looking for a natural looking lash tint, this is perfect, but if you are looking for dark/thick mascara, this will probably disappoint.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is making my lashes better!  I like the tint because it isn&#x27;t too much.  I&#x27;ve been using it almost every night to help my lashes with conditioning and to prevent breakage.  I also use an eyelash serum that I got with Amazon and the combination is really working great!  I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money. Terribly disappointed that it didn&#x27;t perform as indicated. It was just like any other mascara. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of most mascaras available, but the Natural Lash Builder Tint and Conditioner is a really good product for those women who want their lashes to look dark and natural.  There is absolutely no clumping or build-up with this product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any smudging and no irritation.  So glad I went on Amazon and found a product that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for my lashes.</li>
    <li> This is a natural wonderful product..it is non irritating at all.for me anyway..no more paying yo have my eyelashes tinted...I like this natural product so so much... to be honest with you..I don&#x27;t think about reapplying it!  It does the job...and does NOT irritate my eyes...I really don&#x27;t like that Heavy &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; feeling of mascara.  I&#x27;m sold on this for life!</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s very liquidy so it takes a long time to dry. If you have light eyelashes and all you want is to not look like a zombie on the days that you &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want to wear makeup&amp;#34;, then you&#x27;ll be disappointed. I have light eyelashes and this mascara would give the natural look I desire IF it could get to the root of my eyelashes. But it doesn&#x27;t. At all. And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried. So it looks obviously fake and just terrible if I&#x27;m not wearing it in conjunction with eye liner that does darken the roots of my eyelashes. Which makes it useless to me.</li>
    <li> I was asked if I had my lashes tinted and i really like this stuff, can make my eyes a little sensitive if they&#x27;re watering a lot, but overall I recommend it</li>
    <li> Love love love. Obsessed with tinting my lashes, not so obsessed with paying to get them done twice a month. Helps with gaps between tinting, and works on its own as well. So easy to put on quickly before bed, especially if you&#x27;re previously already putting serum on your brows or lashes like me. Will continue to replenish, great product.</li>
    <li> this is nice  and after using once, It is what I expected.  All I wish is color and that&#x27;s what this is.  It does take a bit to dry so if you want to buy this and wear glasses...wait a about 5 minutes before you put your glasses on or you will get this mascara on your lenses!&lt;br /&gt;I will decide if I will buy it again when I use it more times</li>
    <li> this does not dye lashes, it comes off when you wash it off. ok for when you want light no makeup feel and look. great for eyebrows! wish it came in brown or auburn!!!!! i would use this everyday for eyebrows if it were brown.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really make my lashes grow or tints them but it makes and excellent mascara.  I would try something else if you want extra growth</li>
    <li> Because of Blepharitis, an eye disease that at times is not noticeable and a other times a real pain, manifesting in various odd ways over time, I gave up using mascara well over 10 years ago.  My lashes had become too dry and brittle, and my eyes too sensitive.  I&#x27;d tried various &amp;#34;clump resistant&amp;#34; mascaras, but they all got crusty and clumpy, a mess, on my lashes. You may be disappointed in this if you&#x27;re used to wearing mascara, but I just wanted to be able to condition my lashes and emphasize my eyes a little while keeping a natural look and feel.  It&#x27;s subtle, but my lashes now look and feel conditioned, smooth, and the product doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t a good fit for my lashes as mine are short and blonde.  But i do use it for my eyebrows and I really like it for that</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  I never wore much mascara to begin with.  Will work great for everyday or once a week.  It&#x27;s good for your lashes too!</li>
    <li> My lashes are getting healthy again.  When I do wear Mascara, I can see the difference.  I wear this every day alone and it does enhance your lashes.</li>
    <li> I had hope this would give my natural lashes a little more color, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much for that.  It is definitely not a replacement for mascara as it is very thin and barely shows on my lashes.  I did notice a slight change in my eyebrows if I applied and wore overnight, but very subtle.  I have blonde eyebrows  growing in with my darker ones and hoped to color those a little.  I&#x27;ve seen a very slight change so I probably wouldn&#x27;t go to the trouble to apply nightly after this is gone.</li>
    <li> I only use this and not mascara and it&#x27;s the best way to have dark lashes without the gross mascara gunk. I&#x27;m fair-skinned, with brown hair and brown lashes and this makes my lashes dark brown/almost black. Regular mascara dries my lashes so much they fall out, but this stuff has actually helped my lashes grow. I also use it on my eyebrows and it&#x27;s nice because unlike a pencil it doesn&#x27;t get on your skin or look fake. I usually don&#x27;t spend a ton on cosmetics, so $20 was a bit much for me, but I&#x27;ve had this one tube for a year and it&#x27;s still wet and not at all clumpy, so it was well worth it (might not be the most hygienic thing to use the same brush for a year but I haven&#x27;t had any problems!)&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when I want a more dramatic night look I put regular mascara on top of it, but by morning I have raccoon eyes no matter how much I tried to get it off the night before. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I suggest going for it. The worst that could happen is it doesn&#x27;t make your lashes dark enough and then you still have a good conditioner/base to put reg. mascara on top of if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.  Maybe because my lashes are already long.</li>
    <li> over priced .does not build but does lightly darken light lashes .</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for several years. Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Over priced doesn&#x27;t really tint lashes</li>
</ol>
