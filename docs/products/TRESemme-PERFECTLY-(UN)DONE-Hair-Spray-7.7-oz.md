### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>TRESemme Expert Shampoo is an excellent shampoo.</li>
      <li>great shampoo and perfectly complimented by the conditioner.</li>
      <li>The end result was good, though!</li>
      <li>I had a great conditioner on hand.  </li>
      <li>I think it doesn&#x27;t work great at washing styling products from your hair.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great.</li>
      <li>I think this would be a great shampoo for oil hair.  </li>
      <li>and she replied, &amp;#34;The shampoo and conditioner are great.</li>
      <li>Very nice product.  </li>
      <li>Tresemme makes great products, so I knew this one would be equally good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is very pleasant and more like a salon smell, that&#x27;s not too fruity or</li>
      <li>I like this brand, good product.</li>
      <li>Maybe it will be a good thing for her.</li>
      <li>But then I have more fly away hair with it too.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels nice.</li>
      <li>It rinses nicely and leaves no residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash with, lathers up nice, and has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That being said, my hair looks nice and is more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>but it is clean and pleasant one.</li>
      <li>If you have more normal hair types make sure you have an excellent conditioner to use afterwards.</li>
      <li>It smells great and it leaves my hair smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, healthy, no split ends and has moisture.</li>
      <li>and they are both satisfied with the quality of the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>What I like about this most is the quality for value.  </li>
      <li>love the smell</li>
      <li>It had a nice light sent so if you are sensitive to smells this would be good for you.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easily and has almost no scent.</li>
      <li>She also uses a conditioner so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it is the shampoo or conditioner that leaves it easy to work with.</li>
      <li>I found the scent to be strong</li>
      <li>Also to someone with fine, oily hair.</li>
      <li>This is a clear shampoo that has a light, pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is a huge fan of TRESemme products.</li>
      <li>I saw that it was silicone free.  </li>
      <li>My wife who has frizzy hair, especially in the summer, says this is a great help in getting rid of the frizzies.  </li>
      <li>They make my hair clean and light feeling, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Works great for my oily scalp and long hair.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is a clear gel which foams nicely and leaves hair feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>This shampoo made my hair feel clean and manageable.</li>
      <li>It washed my hair to a &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo cleans it well and it feels soft and smooth afterwards, kind of like when I travel someplace</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fairly unremarkable but the price seems fairly low.  </li>
      <li>Overall we are very satisfied with this shampoo and will be buying it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice big bottle</li>
      <li>The price is great especially for such a large bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to try TRESemme products for some time now, and am glad to finally get the chance.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I want a shampoo to do.</li>
      <li>I picked this up for my daughters to use but wanted to try it myself first.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair super clean but not dry</li>
      <li>This clear shampoo quickly got all that stuff out leaving  my hair feeling soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>It cleans nicely and although the smell is a little stronger than she likes</li>
      <li>daughter is rather picky, so this counts as a real endorsement.</li>
      <li>It does and she really loves it.  </li>
      <li>My wife really likes this shampoo and used it just as soon as we opened the box.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it to my daughter because her hair is straight and oily.</li>
      <li>As soon as you pour some of the Tresemme Expert Selection Weightless Silicone free shampoo, you wont believe your eyes as you expect the shampoo to come out of the bottle, but you already have it, only its transparent.</li>
      <li>it paired with a very deep conditioner to make it silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>hair is fairly light and kind of thin.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it is a nice addition to the current bevy of products.</li>
      <li>Well, it works good in cleaning, but it leaves a weird NON clean feeling to my hair, almost like a film on it.  </li>
      <li>A nice surprise, guys, for the little lady in your life!</li>
      <li>It is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
      <li>That might take away from some of the benefit of using this particular product as I didn&#x27;t notice any particular difference in brushing out my generally straight hair after showering.</li>
      <li>fragrance is nice but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>She likes using this shampoo and finds that it leaves her hair soft, shiny and ready to go.</li>
      <li>Seems like a straightforward shampoo other than the looks.</li>
      <li>I wish they did the thing other companies do and make the top of their lid flat</li>
      <li>that has soft water.  </li>
      <li>I sit near people who are sensitive to fragrances and none of them have commented on the smell of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I turned it over to my adult daughter</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to validate its claim to waviness since I don&#x27;t have the conditioner, but the shampoo leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Here is another product from a long time company which keeps the quality high and the prices low.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry my hair out, nor does it make it feel like straw.</li>

<li> It does not dry my hair out, nor does it make it feel like straw.</li>
<li> I had to work out how much I needed because it doesn&#x27;t lather as much, and then I had to adjust the amounts of some other products to account for the fact that this isn&#x27;t as heavy as some other shampoos.</li>
<li> The only negative is the bottle, it is huge and heavy.</li>
<li> At this price point, no reason for me to stock up at a wholesale club, this will last a long time for anywhere between $5 and $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My wife has short hair and my daughter has very long hair</li>
<li> If you have dry hair do not use this as it is similar to a clarifying shampoo.</li>
<li> I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t lather as much as my typical shampoo (bedhead).  </li>
<li> I really like how much this just cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave behind things that&#x27;ll weigh hair down, but it is a bit of an adjustment.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s perfectly clear, and lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Rinses totally clean in cold water.&lt;br</li>
<li> so it lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
<li> The smell and texture are quite similar to other TRESemme products.</li>
<li> I only need to use a small nickel size dollop.</li>
<li> If they made it half the size and perhaps sold it as a two-pack I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
<li> However I felt it dried out my hair after using it for a few days.</li>
<li> it is not overwhelming.  </li>
<li> My hair literally feels like hard straw.</li>
<li> This shampoo does have a subtle scent</li>
<li> I have been using a sea salt infused shampoo and spray to give my hair that &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look of which I had become tired.</li>

    <li> It made my hair super clean but not dry and I had no tangles or shedding. My hair feels nice. Next time I will try the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. However I felt it dried out my hair after using it for a few days. I think it doesn&#x27;t work great at washing styling products from your hair.  I would recommend. this to someone who doesn&#x27;t use hair spray. Also to someone with fine, oily hair.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  I have been using a sea salt infused shampoo and spray to give my hair that &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look of which I had become tired. This clear shampoo quickly got all that stuff out leaving  my hair feeling soft and clean.  This shampoo does have a subtle scent but it is clean and pleasant one.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo only a handful of times, I can already tell that I like it. It&#x27;s hard to validate its claim to waviness since I don&#x27;t have the conditioner, but the shampoo leaves my hair smooth and silky. It&#x27;s easy to wash with, lathers up nice, and has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to try TRESemme products for some time now, and am glad to finally get the chance.</li>
    <li> Tresemme makes great products, so I knew this one would be equally good. It smells great and it leaves my hair smooth and clean. What&#x27;s not to like? I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Here is another product from a long time company which keeps the quality high and the prices low.  My wife really likes this shampoo and used it just as soon as we opened the box.  She was looking forward to this because she had heard it was with Kelp that would help her hair.  It does and she really loves it.  A nice surprise, guys, for the little lady in your life!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. My hair tends to be oily and I shampoo daily. This cleans it well and removes all the oil and hair spray. It does not dry my hair out, nor does it make it feel like straw. I only need to use a small nickel size dollop. The only negative is the bottle, it is huge and heavy. If they made it half the size and perhaps sold it as a two-pack I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I picked this up for my daughters to use but wanted to try it myself first.  I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t lather as much as my typical shampoo (bedhead).  It had a nice light sent so if you are sensitive to smells this would be good for you.  When I was done rinsing the shampoo out my hair felt like straw.  Thank goodness I had a great conditioner on hand.  I think this would be a great shampoo for oil hair.  If you have more normal hair types make sure you have an excellent conditioner to use afterwards.</li>
    <li> I really like how much this just cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave behind things that&#x27;ll weigh hair down, but it is a bit of an adjustment.

The end result was good, though!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this a month ago to try a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; shampoo for curly hair.  I saw that it was silicone free.  Well, it works good in cleaning, but it leaves a weird NON clean feeling to my hair, almost like a film on it.  That being said, my hair looks nice and is more moisturized.  But then I have more fly away hair with it too.  So its a mixed bag... I like it paired with a very deep conditioner to make it silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fairly unremarkable but the price seems fairly low.  It&#x27;s a nice big bottle so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice but not overwhelming.

    <li> TRESemme Expert Shampoo is an excellent shampoo. It rinses nicely and leaves no residue. The smell and texture are quite similar to other TRESemme products. Overall, it is a nice addition to the current bevy of products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair feel clean and manageable. Big deal. I am a man and my hair is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I turned it over to my adult daughter and she replied, &amp;#34;The shampoo and conditioner are great. They make my hair clean and light feeling, and moisturized. I&#x27;ll probably buy them when I run out. I wish they did the thing other companies do and make the top of their lid flat so they can be rested upside down.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is rather picky, so this counts as a real endorsement.</li>
    <li> What I like about this most is the quality for value.  At this price point, no reason for me to stock up at a wholesale club, this will last a long time for anywhere between $5 and $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasant and more like a salon smell, that&#x27;s not too fruity or feminine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfectly clear, and lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Rinses totally clean in cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would consider replacing my more expensive shampoo and making this my every day shampoo</li>
    <li> My daughter is a huge fan of TRESemme products. She likes using this shampoo and finds that it leaves her hair soft, shiny and ready to go. She also uses a conditioner so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it is the shampoo or conditioner that leaves it easy to work with. I found the scent to be strong but she likes it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a clear gel which foams nicely and leaves hair feeling smooth. It washes out easily and has almost no scent. I didn&#x27;t have the conditioner from the same product line to test, so I simply use a different TRESemme conditioner with it. That might take away from some of the benefit of using this particular product as I didn&#x27;t notice any particular difference in brushing out my generally straight hair after showering.</li>
    <li> I like this brand, good product.</li>
    <li> I use this with tresemme naturals moisture conditioner. My hair is shiny, healthy, no split ends and has moisture. The scent is clean. If you have dry hair do not use this as it is similar to a clarifying shampoo. Works great for my oily scalp and long hair.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the house loves this product. My wife who has frizzy hair, especially in the summer, says this is a great help in getting rid of the frizzies.  It cleans nicely and although the smell is a little stronger than she likes it is not overwhelming.  My wife has short hair and my daughter has very long hair and they are both satisfied with the quality of the shampoo.  The price is great especially for such a large bottle. Overall we are very satisfied with this shampoo and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is a clear shampoo that has a light, pleasant scent.  It washed my hair to a &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  Very nice product.  It does exactly what I want a shampoo to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this @ WM, &amp; I am giving it 1 star for the scent and amount of lather. I don&#x27;t know if this makes sense, but it cleans TOO well. While rinsing, I can&#x27;t move my fingers through my hair at all. My hair literally feels like hard straw. I have wavy hair already, and this shampoo (&amp; matching conditioner) actually made my hair straighter. I&#x27;m giving it to my daughter because her hair is straight and oily. Maybe it will be a good thing for her.</li>
    <li> As soon as you pour some of the Tresemme Expert Selection Weightless Silicone free shampoo, you wont believe your eyes as you expect the shampoo to come out of the bottle, but you already have it, only its transparent. It lathered well and cleansed the hair. Seems like a straightforward shampoo other than the looks.</li>
    <li> great shampoo and perfectly complimented by the conditioner. love the smell</li>
