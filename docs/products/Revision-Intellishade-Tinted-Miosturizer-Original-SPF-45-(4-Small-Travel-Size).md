      <li>Great coverage.</li>
      <li>happy</li>
      <li>Of course the product inside is great.</li>
      <li>Love this product and great size for air travel</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years, and absolutely love it, but would NOT recommend that you buy it from this seller!  </li>
      <li>I would have liked a bit darker shade</li>
      <li>It has very light coverage.</li>
      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>Also, they are not sealed but seemed to be okay if that doesn&#x27;t bother you.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So its my favorite tint.</li>
      <li>but it covers ok-</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>so I need something more.</li>
      <li>You may be better off buying the full sized from another seller.  </li>
      <li>My milia have greatly diminished and my under eyes seems much younger looking and moisturized!</li>
      <li>I use it every day and then wear a light powder on it.</li>
      <li>They are labeled &amp;#34;Not For Resale&amp;#34; and are, in fact free samples, NOT travel size as the seller has labeled them.  </li>
      <li>:) I upped my lippies from 1 to 3 since I still would not use it on my whole face ever again.</li>
      <li>I bought these samples so I could decide whether or not to buy the full size product.</li>
      <li>Really streamlines my travel routine!</li>
      <li>The samples had more than enough in the tubes for me to use them for 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>The product itself goes on oily at first, but seems to soak in.  </li>
      <li>I love this tinted moisturizer and use it daily - really evens out my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>They are clearly trying to make money off of some old free samples.</li>
      <li>Mission accomplished from these samples.</li>
      <li>I am very appy with it.</li>
      <li>However, the normal size tube is large for my travel bag</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>You would need 6X more, or 24 little tubes for it to be near the same cost as a full sized tube.  </li>
      <li>When I received the product, it was not sealed, as the normal 1.7 oz size always is, which I found to be unsanitary.  </li>
      <li>The tubes are clearly labeled NOT FOR RESALE!  </li>
      <li>Love the shade, but size is too small</li>
      <li>It really reeks of sunscreen, like a bottle of Banana Boat, only no banana or coconut</li>
      <li>/&gt;Either the tubes I got were old or they were...</li>
      <li>Guess I did not look closely at the size when I ordered, but these are small samples that are distributed for free by retailers.</li>
      <li>One of these tubes may be stretched to two days of application so doesn&#x27;t really save much packing space for  week long trip.  </li>

<li> My bad that I did not look at the fluid ounces, but these are definitely samples!</li>
<li> Like the small travel size</li>
<li> they are small .</li>
<li> so I purchased these small tubes for my cosmetics bag.  </li>
<li> Was not expecting these tubes to be as small as they are.  </li>
<li> The package even says, &amp;#34;not for resale.&amp;#34; Not sure why they are being sold for $15 ...a rip off.</li>
<li> Yes, the size is small.  </li>
<li> The only thing about the product that was disappointing was the lack of pigment.  </li>
<li> I know these are sample sizes, but there is plenty of product in them to go for probably 5 days at least of use.  </li>
<li> /&gt;They are sample sizes and not a good value.  </li>
<li> This is an expensive brand</li>
<li> Sent wrong product when all paperwork and receipts showed correct product..</li>
<li> Does not look chalky or fake.</li>
<li> wrong?...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the shade, but size is too small</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Wonderful product for any skin type</li>
    <li> Unlike some other reviews, the product met my expectations. I bought these samples so I could decide whether or not to buy the full size product. I wanted to test the coverage and moisturizing chops. The samples had more than enough in the tubes for me to use them for 2 weeks. On some days I even reapplied at lunchtime in case I was going out to grab lunch. I am a diehard sunscreen user so this is part of my routine. Mission accomplished from these samples. The only thing about the product that was disappointing was the lack of pigment.  It has very light coverage. I have rosacea so I need something more. I applied foundation over this if it was a day that I needed to wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Great to take with me. I have been using intellishade for a couple of years and did not take the big tube in my purse.</li>
    <li> My bad that I did not look at the fluid ounces, but these are definitely samples!</li>
    <li> Much much smaller than I realized.  But I do like the product.</li>
    <li> Good tinted moisturizer ! I use it every day and then wear a light powder on it. Holds the look all throughout the day. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best thing you can do for your skin. It was recommended by my dermatologist .  I love it it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing any makeup, but there is a sheer coverage which gives a luminous glow.</li>
    <li> Was not expecting these tubes to be as small as they are.  Was looking for a smaller tube for travel.  One of these tubes may be stretched to two days of application so doesn&#x27;t really save much packing space for  week long trip.  Will just pack my larger tube for future trips and save my money.</li>
    <li> Used on my whole face this product stays very greasy and shiny, covers nothing  and breaks me out horribly. I decided to try it as an under eye concealer since I ran out of my regular one and I love it. My milia have greatly diminished and my under eyes seems much younger looking and moisturized! not to mention it&#x27;s spf 45 :) I upped my lippies from 1 to 3 since I still would not use it on my whole face ever again.</li>
    <li> Guess I did not look closely at the size when I ordered, but these are small samples that are distributed for free by retailers. The package even says, &amp;#34;not for resale.&amp;#34; Not sure why they are being sold for $15 ...a rip off. Of course the product inside is great.</li>
    <li> These tubes are tiny!  They are labeled &amp;#34;Not For Resale&amp;#34; and are, in fact free samples, NOT travel size as the seller has labeled them.  When I received the product, it was not sealed, as the normal 1.7 oz size always is, which I found to be unsanitary.  The consistency of the product was also too thick, like it was old or something.  I have been using this product for years, and absolutely love it, but would NOT recommend that you buy it from this seller!  They are clearly trying to make money off of some old free samples. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful mosterizer and tint. Gives you a glowing look to the skin. The spf in is a plus. GOT HERE ON TIME. THE TUBES ARE AS BIG AS THE PINKIE.Although they are small . The price is great and quality. This is an expensive brand so Id rather buy the samples. They have enough in them. So its my favorite tint. Love it.</li>
    <li> I had to return at my expense even though the listing leads you to believe each one is .2oz which is not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sample sizes and not a good value.  You would need 6X more, or 24 little tubes for it to be near the same cost as a full sized tube.  Also, they are not sealed but seemed to be okay if that doesn&#x27;t bother you.  You may be better off buying the full sized from another seller.  The product itself goes on oily at first, but seems to soak in.  The tint doesn&#x27;t really cover anything but makes it appear a little less white on your skin.</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Does not look chalky or fake.</li>
    <li> If this was supposed to be a pack of 10, I only got 4!  Yes, the size is small.  Each tube is probably 2 applications.  It really reeks of sunscreen, like a bottle of Banana Boat, only no banana or coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the tubes I got were old or they were...wrong?...I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who let me use the Intellishade she purchased at Ulta.  It was thin and went on smoothly.  This was REALLY thick (like putting on zinc oxide) and hard to smooth in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy I purchased the cheaper sample and not a full-sized tube.  Think I&#x27;ll go to Ulta to get it instead.</li>
    <li> I know these are sample sizes, but there is plenty of product in them to go for probably 5 days at least of use.  Works perfect for an extended weekend.</li>
    <li> i love this product. use it almost everyday for sunscreen and it evens my skin tone out.</li>
    <li> Sent wrong product when all paperwork and receipts showed correct product..</li>
    <li> This is no way travel size.  The tubes are clearly labeled NOT FOR RESALE!  These are sample size.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Great stuff...I would buy it again...</li>
    <li> This size is just what I need for traveling around.  I am very appy with it.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> Great product to carry in your purse for sunny days, always prepared!</li>
    <li> I love this tinted moisturizer and use it daily - really evens out my skin tone.  However, the normal size tube is large for my travel bag so I purchased these small tubes for my cosmetics bag.  Really streamlines my travel routine!</li>
    <li> One of the tubes totally split.</li>
    <li> I would have liked a bit darker shade but it covers ok- not what I was hoping for.  Like the small travel size</li>
    <li> Not sure it is same as I got at dermatologist&#x27;s office; seems dried up.</li>
    <li> Love this product and great size for air travel</li>
    <li> The wife says, &amp;#34;great product, great price&amp;#34;</li>
