### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Since they are &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t expect a perfect match,  but these aren&#x27;t even in the ballpark.</li>
      <li>These clips are  awesome!</li>
      <li>Great find!</li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>I got these as replacements &amp; they work great!  </li>
      <li>These work great with Babybliss pro.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find replacement clips for my Remington curlers.  </li>
      <li>These work great.</li>
      <li>… Work great on my rollers.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find these on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Good to know I can always get these whenever I lose my pins.</li>
      <li>Worked well price good</li>
      <li>seems to say that these wire clips are superior to the superclips, complaining that the superclips leave &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>wife uses them, dunno if they are wonderful, but the price was worth a try.</li>
      <li>I have jumbo curlers and know how wonderful a hot  curler set would be</li>
      <li>These are great, and worked fine with my curlers, which were Remington.</li>
      <li>These WOULD be great if fit.  </li>
      <li>basically, I would say buy at your own risk.</li>
      <li>fast ship and great item!!!</li>
      <li>But nice quality</li>
      <li>I have Remington rollers and the fit wasn&#x27;t as good as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Amazon does a great job getting products out quickly.</li>
      <li>They hold the rollers in place very securely, and I have not had one instance of a roller falling out.</li>
      <li>since I lost 1 clip for my rollers, I looked on line for more.  </li>
      <li>you are clipping for a better hold with these.</li>
      <li>This product was ok, not the sturdiest, but for the money, it will do.</li>
      <li>THIS kind of pin WOULD work well IF they fit your curlers.  </li>
      <li>They may be ok.  </li>
      <li>I was most concerned about.</li>
      <li>Company was great and shipping was fast and easy.</li>
      <li>good replacement for hot rollers</li>
      <li>These clips fit my large ( 1 1/4 &amp;#34;) rollers perfectly.</li>
      <li>The order process was quick and simple and the product quality is excellent.</li>
      <li>These are better than the clips that came with my hair setter as they are longer than the original clips</li>
      <li>(which is easy to do)</li>
      <li>Good variety of sizes, decent quality.</li>
      <li>Quality is just fine.</li>
      <li>Tips tend to either come lose, catching your hair when you pull the clips out, or the very tip breaks off, leaving the end of the wire exposed, as the amount of plastic(?)</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t fit either.</li>
      <li>but they won&#x27;t give the secure hold</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit well at all.</li>
      <li>inches and these don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>They are of good quality as far as the material used and the workmanship is concerned.  </li>
      <li>Very useful</li>
      <li>I like these better than the clips that come with the hot roller set.</li>
      <li>The quality looks fine and the seller shipped them quickly, though.  </li>
      <li>Love my new clips!  </li>
      <li>Quick to ship.</li>
      <li>I feel so lucky to have found replacement clips for my electric curler set.  </li>
      <li>The clips worked very well better then the snap on that came with hot roller set.</li>
      <li>Clips fit the old electric curlers just fine.  </li>
      <li>If youre on a budget well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The clips work perfectly, even though they are not exactly the same as the set of clips that came with my curler set.</li>
      <li>Slips right out.</li>
      <li>Heck, the price was right.</li>
      <li>I like the Spilo hot roller clips because they are long, and can easily hold the rollers in place, but the rubber on the tips comes off fairly easily.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find them so easily on Amazon since I couldn&#x27;t locate them anywhere else.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed but I will have to order another package in order to curl my hair.</li>
      <li>These hot roller pins are just what I needed.  </li>
      <li>The rubber tips came off within the first couple uses.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t do that with the ones that come with hot rollers.</li>
      <li>I bought these to replace some clips that I lost for my Remington hot rollers.</li>
      <li>Fits my hot roller purchased years ago.</li>
      <li>These pretty much match the originals and certainly do the job!</li>
      <li>No real complaints so far, they just does nt feel particularly good quality.</li>
      <li>Very durable &amp; they hold to the rollers very well!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really figure out how to use these wire clips properly so the roller stays secure.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>so they hold the roller very well.</li>
      <li>I dont &#x27;recall&#x27; the Free Shipping option about 2 months back.  </li>
      <li>Clips (pins really) are longer than the originals and for some reason don&#x27;t grip hair as well</li>
      <li>If they&#x27;d even last a year I would be happy, but to last two or three uses is just not reasonable.  </li>
      <li>The new clips that you get when you buy a new set of hot rollers do not hold your roller in place.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered these electirc roller hair clips because so few are to be found.  </li>
      <li>There is a new set for sale thru Sally&#x27;s here.  </li>
      <li>The red clips almost fit the &#x27;big&#x27; rollers..</li>
      <li>These clips were properly sized replacements for my Vidal Sasson Hot Rollers set.  </li>
      <li>I recently tried hot rollers for the first time, and the Conair set came with the big &amp;#34;superclips&amp;#34; for securing the rollers.  </li>
      <li>But hey, it still is too much money for the VERY LIMITED FIT for Conair, Remington, and the older heat rollers, of several decades back!  </li>
      <li>Clips fit tightly the way I like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find roller clips, so I was glad to find these.  </li>
      <li>I have been trying to find these for my mother in law who visits us frequently and does not like to transport all her toiletries with her.  </li>
      <li>They may work fine for you if you use small rollers.</li>
      <li>I needed extra pins for my extra large electric rollers, as the clips sometimes leave a dent in the hair.  </li>
      <li>coating the wires is not well applied, is not uniform, and there&#x27;s not enough to actually cover the very end of the wire where it is sharpest, so it works its way through the coating and breaks off.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t fit anything current today, wasted money.</li>
      <li>Only place I can find this product is on Amazon, had to replace my pins as they have slowly disappeared and was pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>These are very hard to find and the clips that they put with the hairsetters now are not satisfactory but these hold much better.  </li>
      <li>how no crimps in hair would show up if I could use these pins.... and how tight this kind of hair pin (cilp-not) would hold all - but they are just to small.  </li>
      <li>How hard is it to manufacture pins that actually fit the jumbo curlers???????</li>
      <li>Though they would not fit jumbo hot curlers.</li>
      <li>I used to blow dry my hair any old way and add a few hot rollers here and there.</li>
      <li>Having fine and thin hair, my life is a nightmare trying to get electric rollers to stay in.  </li>
      <li>I paid WAY too much for WAY too little.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I wanted !!!</li>
    <li> There chips won&#x27;t hold rollers after obły one use!</li>
    <li> These clips fit my large ( 1 1/4 &amp;#34;) rollers perfectly. Would buy again if needed</li>
    <li> Fits my hot roller purchased years ago.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would work with my jumbo hot rollers, but they are too small.  They may work fine for you if you use small rollers.</li>
    <li> These hot roller pins are just what I needed.  The order process was quick and simple and the product quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> These work great. Been looking for them for a long time</li>
    <li> I like the Spilo hot roller clips because they are long, and can easily hold the rollers in place, but the rubber on the tips comes off fairly easily. At that point, they have to be thrown away because they cause hair breakage and are painful to the scalp.</li>
    <li> No real complaints so far, they just does nt feel particularly good quality. If youre on a budget well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Only place I can find this product is on Amazon, had to replace my pins as they have slowly disappeared and was pleased with the product.  Need to order two packages though if you need just the larger sizes.  They should eliminate the small ones, don&#x27;t know anybody that uses those tiny hot curling rods</li>
    <li> Having fine and thin hair, my life is a nightmare trying to get electric rollers to stay in.  These clips are  awesome! They hold the rollers in place very securely, and I have not had one instance of a roller falling out. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered these electirc roller hair clips because so few are to be found.  They are of good quality as far as the material used and the workmanship is concerned.  However, I was disappointed about the size of the smallest clips.  They were too small for my smallest rollers and they were the ones I was most concerned about. I have Remington rollers and the fit wasn&#x27;t as good as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t fit anything current today, wasted money.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find these for my mother in law who visits us frequently and does not like to transport all her toiletries with her.  I could not find them in the stores.  Great find!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find replacement clips for my Remington curlers.  Heck, the price was right. I was not happy with these, however for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. Clips (pins really) are longer than the originals and for some reason don&#x27;t grip hair as well so they fall out with the rollers all the time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Small sizes are useless because there are no rollers in the set that size.&lt;br /&gt;3. After a small amount of use, the plastic tips came off the clips (pins) and the bare metal is painful on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;So basically, I would say buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> These are great, and worked fine with my curlers, which were Remington. Good to know I can always get these whenever I lose my pins. (which is easy to do)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find roller clips, so I was glad to find these.  Since they are &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t expect a perfect match,  but these aren&#x27;t even in the ballpark. I have two different sets of rollers from two different manufacturers and the clips didn&#x27;t fit either. I&#x27;ll  still use them because there&#x27;s nothing else to be found but they won&#x27;t give the secure hold I&#x27;d like. I</li>
    <li> Like them.  Very useful</li>
    <li> The metal on these was not smooth and pulled on my hair as I inserted them.  I threw them away!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed but I will have to order another package in order to curl my hair. Quality is just fine.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work with  my curlers.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find.  Ordering from Amazon was efficient.  The clips work perfectly, even though they are not exactly the same as the set of clips that came with my curler set.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected!  Quick to ship.</li>
    <li> works well with other roller sets too!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping… Work great on my rollers.</li>
    <li> These are very hard to find and the clips that they put with the hairsetters now are not satisfactory but these hold much better.  Thanks</li>
    <li> since I lost 1 clip for my rollers, I looked on line for more.  I have Revlon rollers and this product is not suitable for that brand.  The clips do not stay in.</li>
    <li> Pins are not smooth and pull hair when placing them to hold curlers!  Do not like at all!</li>
    <li> Didnt work with the sizes j had</li>
    <li> Purchased several of these packets.  Wires are sturdy though could have been a bit thicker.  Tips tend to either come lose, catching your hair when you pull the clips out, or the very tip breaks off, leaving the end of the wire exposed, as the amount of plastic(?) coating the wires is not well applied, is not uniform, and there&#x27;s not enough to actually cover the very end of the wire where it is sharpest, so it works its way through the coating and breaks off.  Disappointing, considering the older style hair clips of like design have not had this problem.  If they&#x27;d even last a year I would be happy, but to last two or three uses is just not reasonable.  Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the ones that came with my Remington travel electric rollers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had them a month and the tips have worn off already - YES, they are longer and hold the hair but they are very poorly made...</li>
    <li> This product worked with my rollers.  Of course I recieved a variety of sizes and only needed on of the variety,  but the product resolved my problem.</li>
    <li> I am a left over from the disco period. I used to blow dry my hair any old way and add a few hot rollers here and there. The new clips that you get when you buy a new set of hot rollers do not hold your roller in place. These do. They are hard to come by so I was happy to find these on Amazon. Mark my words big hair will be back soon.</li>
    <li> The rubber tips came off within the first couple uses.  VERY cheaply made and disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> Love my new clips!  They work perfectly.  I will recommend this product to friends and family.  Amazon does a great job getting products out quickly.</li>
    <li> The clips worked very well better then the snap on that came with hot roller set.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough, but there were only 3 each of the large and medium and 2 small, so when I do my hair I have to do some, take it down and then do the rest.  That&#x27;s the only downside though.  Clips fit the old electric curlers just fine.  I was surprised to find them so easily on Amazon since I couldn&#x27;t locate them anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Lost 2 of my clips and they were there in no time and work prefectly.</li>
    <li> I got these as replacements &amp; they work great!  Very durable &amp; they hold to the rollers very well! Definetly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Worked well price good</li>
    <li> Clips fit tightly the way I like. Though they would not fit jumbo hot curlers.</li>
    <li> These are better than the clips that came with my hair setter as they are longer than the original clips so they hold the roller very well.</li>
    <li> Not the diz they were described. But nice quality</li>
    <li> wife uses them, dunno if they are wonderful, but the price was worth a try.</li>
    <li> I feel so lucky to have found replacement clips for my electric curler set.  The curlers are anchored, but, over the years, the clips had flow the coop.  These pretty much match the originals and certainly do the job!</li>
    <li> I recently tried hot rollers for the first time, and the Conair set came with the big &amp;#34;superclips&amp;#34; for securing the rollers.  I watched several youtube rollers and everyone seems to say that these wire clips are superior to the superclips, complaining that the superclips leave &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I can&#x27;t see any lines in my hair from the superclips  (maybe because I have thick hair?).  I can&#x27;t really figure out how to use these wire clips properly so the roller stays secure.  The quality looks fine and the seller shipped them quickly, though.  I&#x27;ll keep using the superclips.</li>
    <li> fast ship and great item!!!</li>
    <li> Does the job well. Not much else to say as its a simple use product.  I like these bc they don&#x27;t leave marks like the plastic ones do.</li>
    <li> Rating a 4 because they pull the hair a bit</li>
    <li> I dont &#x27;recall&#x27; the Free Shipping option about 2 months back.  But hey, it still is too much money for the VERY LIMITED FIT for Conair, Remington, and the older heat rollers, of several decades back!  Seriously. The red clips almost fit the &#x27;big&#x27; rollers..(they aren&#x27;t ever big enough for hair past your ears). Yeah the red clips slip off, they ARE long as other say.. which means they get in the way of other rollers. I paid WAY too much for WAY too little.  There is a new set for sale thru Sally&#x27;s here.  They may be ok.  At least you have a shot at not loosing a fortune in shipping, wasted money, and more return costs, if you have money to burn.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Perfect!</li>
    <li> I am editing my 2 stars down to 1 after using these for several months. Now ALL of the rubber tips have come off of the ends and the clips do not maintain their shape well. They have gotten stretched out.</li>
    <li> They are a little long, but they work. I have been looking for these for a long time. I bought curlers off ebay and they didn&#x27;t come with clips.</li>
    <li> good replacement for hot rollers</li>
    <li> These clips were properly sized replacements for my Vidal Sasson Hot Rollers set.  The metal is sturdy enough to probably get lots of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace some clips that I lost for my Remington hot rollers. They don&#x27;t fit well at all. They may work for other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is only for the product. Company was great and shipping was fast and easy.</li>
    <li> These just don&#x27;t work well for my hair.  Slips right out.</li>
    <li> These work great with Babybliss pro. I like these better than the clips that come with the hot roller set. You can hook to the roller behind the roller you are clipping for a better hold with these. You can&#x27;t do that with the ones that come with hot rollers. These clips hold tighter.</li>
    <li> I have thin long hair. THIS kind of pin WOULD work well IF they fit your curlers.  Mine are 1.5 and 2.&amp;#34; inches and these don&#x27;t fit.  I tried to bend and force them on and ended up with a lumpy mess.  I have jumbo curlers and know how wonderful a hot  curler set would be - how convenient- how no crimps in hair would show up if I could use these pins.... and how tight this kind of hair pin (cilp-not) would hold all - but they are just to small.  How hard is it to manufacture pins that actually fit the jumbo curlers??????? The hiar &amp;#34;clips&amp;#34; (the ones that look like scissor comps-clamps)- clasps that come with these new jumbo curler machines are useless on fine thin long hair. These WOULD be great if fit.  Please make them a size up!!!</li>
    <li> I needed extra pins for my extra large electric rollers, as the clips sometimes leave a dent in the hair.  This product was ok, not the sturdiest, but for the money, it will do.</li>
    <li> Too small and hard to work with</li>
    <li> These were longer in length than expected</li>
    <li> Good variety of sizes, decent quality.</li>
    <li> On time and as expected, thank you.</li>
