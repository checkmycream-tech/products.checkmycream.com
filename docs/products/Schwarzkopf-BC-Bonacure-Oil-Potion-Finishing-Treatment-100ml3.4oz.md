      <li>It also smells great which is a plus.</li>
      <li>Excellent user of this hair line for many years swear by it.</li>
      <li>Amazon had the best price:)</li>
      <li>;  It contains alcohol, which is a drying agent and has undone all of the good things the oil had done for my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got a sample from my Barber &amp; loved it.</li>
      <li>and I had loved it.</li>
      <li>I loved the sample I received from my hairdresser</li>
      <li>I also use Kerastase products and I found them to be equally good, but they did not have the Miracle Oil spray.</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love how silky and shining my hair looks with this!</li>
      <li>Love this in my hair!  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product &amp; not just for your hair.</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this in a nice glass bottle.  </li>
      <li>It smells like a warm nutty cocoa butter amber like smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is very strong on the day you apply it and a hint of it remains on your hair till your next wash(no residue which is excellent).    </li>

      <li>I love the smell of this product-</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;, which is ok for controlling frizz, but your hair will not absorb moisture, and will feel &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; all day.</li>
      <li>Throw away the Moroccan oil, this is so much better.</li>
      <li>There must be a better product than this out there....</li>
      <li>I am sure the replacements would be just as wonderful as I expected.</li>
      <li>great Product, need just a small amount for a great result.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of unruly hair makes it smooth and easy to finish hairstyling</li>
      <li>It works well to smooth frizz and add shine and softness.</li>
      <li>It is light and non-greasy so does not reduce the &#x27;bounce&#x27; in your hair   </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work that great on my coarse wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>The light scent dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t give it a true rating.  </li>
      <li>Lighter, better scent, never heavy!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a distinct smell of vegetable oil; fragrance is way off.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a distinct smell of vegetable oil; fragrance is way off.</li>
      <li>This oil adds moisture to my hair without being greasy and it washes right off my hands too.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>Simply using this product on semi-dry hair makes the hair seem very light and shiny</li>
      <li>Update: The first bottle I bought from the seller \\&quot;Go</li>
      <li>then I spray it first with a product from Amway, then add about a tablespoon of this.</li>
      <li>Used first at a salon  but did not buy at the much higher price.</li>
      <li>Also it smells like pure baby oil.</li>
      <li>I have short, fine, brittle hair that  responded well to just a teensy dab of this.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a change with this product.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>a tiny amount rub between your palms and lightly run your hands through your hair  -apply from the ends of your hair  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!    </li>
      <li>I really like</li>
      <li>Softer, more manageable, and less frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like the shine it gives to my hair after washing it.</li>
      <li>but it is mainly a finishing treatment.</li>
      <li>I have short curly hair and its the perfect light treatment for me because I hate when my hair is crunchy or when I can feel the product in my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist first used this lightly fragranced oil on me, &amp; I was amazed how little she used!  </li>
      <li>Good product especially for those of us with thick and curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Still not sure, I do love the way it dissipates in the hair</li>
      <li>Non-greasy oil that can be used at any time for dry skin or dry hair, &amp; controls those little fly aways as well.</li>
      <li>I love this product because when I put it in while my hair is wet then blow dry my hair</li>
      <li>Seriously bleached hair is my particular problem, but I used this in smaller quantities before my maniac stylist charred my hair, and I really liked it then, too.</li>
      <li>Large blobs of white stuff floating all around.</li>
      <li>So far, that routine (I also use Deva Care no poo) is the only combo of products that makes my hair reasonable to deal with.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it really impacts the product, but thought I should mention it as if you got the sample you might be expecting something a bit different.</li>
      <li>The resulting shine tames frizz &amp; looks natural.  </li>
      <li>Not heavy or sticky.  </li>
      <li>My hair is sooo soft and i haven&#x27;t had a relaxer done in about 3months.</li>
      <li>The smell does not appeal to me and I suspect the product I bought here is out dated as mine developed an off smell and floating particles in a clouded suspension.</li>
      <li>The product seems old.  </li>
      <li>not touch your scalp/hair near your scalp till</li>
      <li>My hair is dry, course and air dries frizzy, but with this in my hair it allows my hair to air dry completely soft with absolutely no frizz and nice soft curls.  </li>
      <li>I use this and the other one for fine to normal hair and it is doing wonders for my hair and hav suggested it to other people.</li>
      <li>Was sitting on the floor in front of my boyfriend when he strocked my hair and asked if I was doing something different because it felt so soft... and no frizzies!!</li>
      <li>Gorgeous\\&quot; was great, but the second bottle I bought in Apr &#x27;14 from the seller \\&quot;BeautyAnd\\&quot; seems like a fake product!</li>
      <li>The product I received is not the same professional product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am on my fifth bottle of this great product!! It truly gives your hair a finished look and makes my hair look luxurious.</li>
    <li> It reached in time great experience</li>
    <li> I love how silky and shining my hair looks with this!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work that great on my coarse wavy hair.  Didn&#x27;t see much of a change with this product.  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Definitely not like the sample of oil i got from my buddy!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist had used this product during a hair spa treatment and I had loved it. Bought it here, and the product is same as the one used in the parlor. Simply using this product on semi-dry hair makes the hair seem very light and shiny (I have thick hair, and have had rebonding done thrice in the last 2 years). Plus the hair smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. Highly recommend!    Update: The first bottle I bought from the seller \\&quot;Go Gorgeous\\&quot; was great, but the second bottle I bought in Apr &#x27;14 from the seller \\&quot;BeautyAnd\\&quot; seems like a fake product! Large blobs of white stuff floating all around.</li>
    <li> Not really. If you look at the ingredients, its got a lot of elastic polymers in it that &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; your hair. In other words, it pours like oil, but it is basically a wax. When you rub it in, you&#x27;ll know what I mean immediatly. It makes your hair &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;, which is ok for controlling frizz, but your hair will not absorb moisture, and will feel &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; all day. This is a very small bottle and will probably only last you a month using it sparingly. Also it smells like pure baby oil. There must be a better product than this out there....</li>
    <li> My poor, sad, dried out, burned up hair has to be highly moisturized. I towel dry it then I spray it first with a product from Amway, then add about a tablespoon of this. So far, that routine (I also use Deva Care no poo) is the only combo of products that makes my hair reasonable to deal with. Seriously bleached hair is my particular problem, but I used this in smaller quantities before my maniac stylist charred my hair, and I really liked it then, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product Ilove the silky feeling that it leaves on my hair.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I loved the sample I received from my hairdresser but I believe the 2 bottles I got were rancid.  I should have returned it for an exchange but didn&#x27;t my fault.....now I can not find it.  I am sure the replacements would be just as wonderful as I expected.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist first used this lightly fragranced oil on me, &amp; I was amazed how little she used!  Use one small drop in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together, &amp; then rub your hands through your damp hair.  Then style as usual.  The resulting shine tames frizz &amp; looks natural.  Not heavy or sticky.  I have short, fine, brittle hair that  responded well to just a teensy dab of this.  You can also reapply to dry hair if nec.  My stylist pays $25 a bottle at the beauty supply store.  This bottle should last  years...assuming you DON&#x27;T DROP it on the floor.  Although plastic, it broke on the tile, so wipe your hands again before handling the bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this product because when I put it in while my hair is wet then blow dry my hair I can&#x27;t feel it in my hair hardly at all! My hair is smooth not frizzy and has a healthy sheen to it! I have short curly hair and its the perfect light treatment for me because I hate when my hair is crunchy or when I can feel the product in my hair. It also smells great which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Still not sure, I do love the way it dissipates in the hair but it does not really maintain shine. So, I am not sure... I really like but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Throw away the Moroccan oil, this is so much better. Lighter, better scent, never heavy!</li>
    <li> Did not care for the smell and it had chunks of what looked like fat... it is kinda gross</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!  I went against some other reviews and thought MAYBE they got a bad batch. BUT NO, this is not an authentic product and or it has gone bad. There are specks of things floating in it. DO NOT USE! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Good product especially for those of us with thick and curly hair.  I particularly like the shine it gives to my hair after washing it.</li>
    <li> I paid $42 for this at my salon. Will never do that again. It&#x27;s a great product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product multiple times from my salon (at almost twice the price). The product I received is not the same professional product. There&#x27;s a distinct smell of vegetable oil; fragrance is way off. Also, the oil is cloudy/milky with little floater friends. This is definitely not the advertised product. I might save to cook with for my enemies.</li>
    <li> I purchased 7 bottles at a time, and now they all have white things floating in them..and they stink..DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way I discovered. Was sitting on the floor in front of my boyfriend when he strocked my hair and asked if I was doing something different because it felt so soft... and no frizzies!!</li>
    <li> This oil adds moisture to my hair without being greasy and it washes right off my hands too. My hair is sooo soft and i haven&#x27;t had a relaxer done in about 3months. My hair is very thick, coarse, frizzy and extremely DRY!!!! Finally a product that actually helps with my dryness without making my hair clammy and gross!!! I&#x27;m totally hooked!!!</li>
    <li> The product seems old.  There is a cloudy film throughout the bottle and there are little white pieces floating in the oil.  I have used this product before and it did not look that way.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a change in formula or there is something wrong with it.</li>
    <li> My hair is bleached to death, dry and frizzy. This oil, which I apply after blow-drying, leaves it soft and sleek without being greasy or heavy. The light scent dissipates quickly. I also use the Bonacure BC Oil Miracle spray before blow drying. Using both may be too much for people with finer or less dry hair. I met a Schwarzkopf rep who suggested putting some of the oil on my hair before applying the hair color to protect it, I passed that on to my stylist and she did it and it worked and she now does it all the time. I also use Kerastase products and I found them to be equally good, but they did not have the Miracle Oil spray.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a week ago so I can&#x27;t give it a true rating.  Will update after about a month use.</li>
    <li> Love this in my hair!  My hair is dry, course and air dries frizzy, but with this in my hair it allows my hair to air dry completely soft with absolutely no frizz and nice soft curls.  Never has any product done this to my hair...I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent user of this hair line for many years swear by it. Great for hair extensions as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few years now. I used the bottle I received- I did not find any difference except that it looked bad this time.    I love the smell of this product- It smells like a warm nutty cocoa butter amber like smell. The smell matches the gold of the serum. The smell is very strong on the day you apply it and a hint of it remains on your hair till your next wash(no residue which is excellent).    It makes your hair soft and easy to comb through. It makes your hair feel like silk. A very small quantity is enough. It reduces fly-aways and stray hairs. It is supposed to help to heal and protect your hair. I use this as both serum and finishing treatment, I use it before blow drying/ironing and after as well- but it is mainly a finishing treatment. It is light and non-greasy so does not reduce the &#x27;bounce&#x27; in your hair   -don&#x27;t apply a lot at once.   -Take a tiny amount rub between your palms and lightly run your hands through your hair  -apply from the ends of your hair  -do not touch your scalp/hair near your scalp till only the hint of oil is left on your hands</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, course, and wavy.  I wash it twice weekly and can manage it by blow drying and hair straightening.  But with this product, there is a noticeable difference in the texture.  Softer, more manageable, and less frizzy.  I only use a small amount before blow drying, so it should last for quite some time.  I will definitely buy this product again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product &amp; not just for your hair. Non-greasy oil that can be used at any time for dry skin or dry hair, &amp; controls those little fly aways as well. A must have!</li>
    <li> I got a sample from my Barber &amp; loved it. Amazon had the best price:)</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in a nice glass bottle.  Made the product seem nicer somehow.  I bought this and it is in a plastic bottle.  I don&#x27;t think it really impacts the product, but thought I should mention it as if you got the sample you might be expecting something a bit different.</li>
    <li> I use this and the other one for fine to normal hair and it is doing wonders for my hair and hav suggested it to other people.</li>
    <li> The product presented here which was what we wanted, was not what we got.  The product we received is similar, from the same company, but is an atomizer which you spritz on your hair called &amp;#34;Divine Polish.&amp;#34;  It contains alcohol, which is a drying agent and has undone all of the good things the oil had done for my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to try it for a couple of weeks and see if it worked like the oil potion...it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have written to the seller and received no response.</li>
    <li> great Product, need just a small amount for a great result. I have a lot of unruly hair makes it smooth and easy to finish hairstyling</li>
    <li> My wife has purchased this product multiple times from her salon (at almost twice the price). The product I received is not the same professional product. There&#x27;s a distinct smell of vegetable oil; fragrance is way off. Also, the oil is cloudy/milky with little floater friends. This is definitely not the advertised product. DO NOT BUY! I went against some other reviews and thought MAYBE they got a bad batch. BUT NO, this is not an authentic product and or it has gone bad. There are specks of things floating in it. DO NOT USE! DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Used first at a salon  but did not buy at the much higher price. It works well to smooth frizz and add shine and softness. The smell does not appeal to me and I suspect the product I bought here is out dated as mine developed an off smell and floating particles in a clouded suspension. I still use it as there seems to be no difference in performance but it is not very appealing to look at. Maybe salon purchases are fresher?</li>
    <li> me gustó mucho el producto y llego a tiempo , según lo acordado y comprado, gracias por el servicio. pilar</li>
