      <li>corn didn&#x27;t just come off, it left more of a scar.</li>
      <li>Everything is good with this, but it starts gelatinizing after a few days!</li>
      <li>Greatly helped me by taking out a stubborn painful corn from bottom of my right feet thumb.</li>
      <li>Works like no other...</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty long, so long that I gave some to my mother.</li>
      <li>For price, I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.</li>

<li> Takes a little longer to work than what it is advertised on the packaging (at least for me it did) but its a terrific product nonetheless.</li>
<li> and this little bottle did the trick.</li>
<li> So if you have a small callus don&#x27;t buy this, because you have to dump 3/4 of it.</li>
<li> it took few days for it to take out the corn though!</li>
<li> they are hardly noticeable now</li>
<li> seriously you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
<li> I was going through very uncomfortable pain</li>
<li> terrible tears of your skin on your feet</li>

    <li> This product was unusable after one use. It began to solidify once it had been opened.</li>
    <li> Stays on great and they work.</li>
    <li> It takes longer than 2 weeks to work, but it&#x27;s worth the wait. I would definately buy this again. :)</li>
    <li> I I have excess callus,s on my feet?  this works fine &amp; I,d recommend to others w/feet callus problems pain!</li>
    <li> my mom painted this on her toes 2 times a day wrapped the bandaid on it at night and in 3 days the whole thing just peeled right off at once!!!</li>
    <li> Removed my callus on the feet quickly! Love it! Now, it doesn&#x27;t hurt me any more when I walking. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these callus on my feet and boy did this get the job done and then some. I was going through very uncomfortable pain and this little bottle did the trick. Don&#x27;t let the size of the bottle deceive you. It lasts pretty long, so long that I gave some to my mother.</li>
    <li> Seems to work all right.</li>
    <li> Mosco is less aggressive17 % salicylic and takes a little more time to work but the result looks good. Stay away from 40% circle pads they leave like a hole on the top if your foot. Mosci oeel away over 10 days.</li>
    <li> I think this product made my corn worst.&lt;br /&gt;The corn didn&#x27;t just come off, it left more of a scar. For price, I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.</li>
    <li> Works like no other... Eats away at area without harming your skin. Used cocoa butter to help heal the dryness it caused. I put it on at night. Cant wear outside with sandals during the day on darker skin because it will show on skin ans appear ashy. Took only  afe days to work for me.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy temporary solution. Corns are a bone problem, not a skin problem.</li>
    <li> This product worked well. I would recommend this product to family and friends. It is a described.</li>
    <li> Everything is good with this, but it starts gelatinizing after a few days! So if you have a small callus don&#x27;t buy this, because you have to dump 3/4 of it. Instead go for a strip one. If you have a huge callus this is good.</li>
    <li> Great product! Got rid of a callus between my toes within one week and no pain and it never grew back! Both thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Takes a little longer to work than what it is advertised on the packaging (at least for me it did) but its a terrific product nonetheless. Corn was removed painlessly and did not discolor my toe like other products do. I definitely recommend this product over other brands.</li>
    <li> Seller prompt this product is amazon seriously you can&#x27;t go wrong I have my nice feet back!. PRICE GREAT!.. BUT IT!!! It works as it says</li>
    <li> terrible tears of your skin on your feet I had to go to the doctor becausethe skin peeled off</li>
    <li> Works well I have 3 corns and I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of them this product is really good they are hardly noticeable now but it is a long process with great results</li>
    <li> Greatly helped me by taking out a stubborn painful corn from bottom of my right feet thumb. it took few days for it to take out the corn though! very good product. I&#x27;ll use it again if I have the similar problem,</li>
