      <li>this product is excellent for natural hair;I am loving it.</li>
      <li>great stuff, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an all natural, great for the environment type product this is NOT it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really love the way my curls are since they have a mind of their own</li>
      <li>my hair is all natural , i wasn&#x27;t able to control it or have it look the way i wanted it until this product!!!</li>
      <li>The upside is that my curls didn&#x27;t come out crunchy and it did a better job than putting nothing in my hair, but I still had more frizz than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>My visit to the Hair Rules Salon has proven to be a pleasant &amp; positive [learning] experience as we11!</li>
      <li>I love Kinky Curly Curling Custard (for it&#x27;s ingredients and for the job it does on my hair) but that product tends to get crunchy and it also flakes.</li>
      <li>I love how my curls look.  </li>
      <li>I love my hair because of this product.</li>
      <li>best part is the next day or two.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Finding a product I like is a challenge, but I really do love this one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure that this probably works wonders on some people&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair looks after using curly whip.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Usually 2nd day hair is best because the curl has loosened a bit, all you do is re-wet (spritz) and go.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better for your scalp and hair.</li>
      <li>My curls aren&#x27;t spiral, more all over the place.  </li>
      <li>But there are cheaper styling puddings and custards with better scents and moisturizing ability.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve tried everything out there, but I sure have tested a lot of things on my hair.</li>
      <li>thanks HAIR RULES!!!!:)</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m out-of-the house and looking great and feeling EVEN MORE confident about wearing my hair naturally!  </li>
      <li>I was able to successfully control my Fro&#x27; during my most recent [very hot and humid] Caribbean vacation!!!  </li>
      <li>Looks best when I apply it on my wet hair after washing it.  </li>
      <li>This gives gives my hair big beautiful curly waves and ringlets.</li>
      <li>BUT...if you are looking for a product that will make your 4b/c hair look fabulous then this is it.</li>
      <li>Overall the smell is great</li>
      <li>It made my curls defined and even after the first day I was able to manipulate it.</li>
      <li>The Hydrating Finsihing Cream is great for touch-ups on dry hair.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is rather strong, but not suffocating.  </li>
      <li>the hair feels great not weighed down.</li>
      <li>I have short, dry, curly-kinky hair and the Curly Whip is THE BEST syling product I have EVER used!!!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is so worth the cost.</li>
      <li>but this brand, Hair Rules is by far the better choice for my hair texture.  </li>
      <li>but I have also had good results with other brands and the curly whip.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a very busy professional and DO NOT have time to spend more than 20 minutes on styling and managing my hair!  </li>
      <li>I really wish natural hair care companies would invest as much time into creating great products for natural hair as they do marketing.</li>
      <li>So the less touching the better.      </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different styling products for curly hair, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>but I found the routine to have too many steps so back to Curly Whip.</li>
      <li>but I twist my hair in a towel first just to remove some of the excess water, before application.  </li>
      <li>I love a product that doesn&#x27;t require a daily do-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s how much I like it!</li>
      <li>This did exactly what Anthony Dickey said on my 4C hair.</li>
      <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t frizz and and keeps a consistent curl pattern.</li>
      <li>I first found out about this product when I went to visit the Hair Rules salon.</li>
      <li>I choose this rating because no product has ever made my hair as healthy and grow as long as this one.  </li>
      <li>In an hour, I&#x27;ve got a head full of soft, shiny curls.  </li>
      <li>With curly hair, the more you touch it or dry it, the frizzier it becomes.  </li>
      <li>My hair is super bouncy, my curls are soft and formed.  </li>
      <li>I re-wet certain spots that I slept on and the curl re-appears.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use on soaking wet hair and really rake it through using your fingers.</li>
      <li>I had too much product</li>
      <li>As soon as I applied this product to my freshly washed, natural hair, I washed it out.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product based on tutorials I have seen.</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t like applying it to soaking damp hair, I just use my towel and gently squeeze my hair once before applying the curl whip.  </li>
      <li>but I may have used too much of the product.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely do more wash and wear styling due to Dickey and his products.  </li>
      <li>and I would have all this white buildup making my hair look like it&#x27;s full of lint or something.  </li>
      <li>I have a brand new bottle if anyone wants it.</li>
      <li>It is prone to frizz, and I live in the South where it is very humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this product has given my curly hair more structure and less frizz.      </li>
      <li>Highly highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>Price is to high for what it offers theirs other products that work much better and are way cheaper.</li>
      <li>It would save us natural girls a whole lot of time and money.</li>
      <li>The only person who doesn&#x27;t like me using this product is my stylist because I no longer buy her products (smile).</li>
      <li>My hair was not hard or crunchy afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time this morning and have been left with soft, tamed and bouncy curls since.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s clear</li>
      <li>Leaves my curls soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair but needed a product that would turn my waves into curls and not leave it frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It just looks shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that I discovered Dickey&#x27;s common sense approach to texture care.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t advise any natural girl to buy this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old</li>
      <li>I think finally this is the real thing that my curly hair has been needing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t define my 4A curls nearly as well as Eco Styler Gel, Ms Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft curls, Ms Jessie&#x27;s Coily Custard, or even just homemade flaxseed gel does.</li>
      <li>Was delivered fast but product made my hair dry and freezy and i have natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>The HAIR RULES Line is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; for styling and hydrating my dry hair.  </li>
      <li>they used it in my hair and it left it sooo soft and shiny!).  </li>
      <li>defined my curls like no other.  </li>
      <li>Also, I used too much product, thinking that this would be like other leave-ins.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is really expensive for what it does. (Or in my case, what is doesn&#x27;t do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that this probably works wonders on some people&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve watched the video that Hair Rules has on their site showing how to use this and it does look great on their models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t define my 4A curls nearly as well as Eco Styler Gel, Ms Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft curls, Ms Jessie&#x27;s Coily Custard, or even just homemade flaxseed gel does. Also, Hair Rules Curly Whip has fewer natural ingredients than these other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really a fan of the scent either. It&#x27;s not overbearing, but it smells a little like fabric softener sheets.</li>
    <li> I first found out about this product when I went to visit the Hair Rules salon. I loved how my hair came out after my salon visit but I was skeptical to see if I could mimic the results. I ordered curly whip on Amazon and tried it after washing my hair. It looks like I just left the salon! Great, Great, GREAT product! Make sure you use on soaking wet hair and really rake it through using your fingers. Shake your hair out and let it dry. Voila!</li>
    <li> I have long hair that&#x27;s wavy to curly, in layers.  It&#x27;s not kinky, is very thick, and is about average in terms of coarseness-- neither course nor fine. It is prone to frizz, and I live in the South where it is very humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a product I like is a challenge, but I really do love this one.  In the shower, I wring my hair out, then apply the product--a quarter-sized dollop, then comb it through with a wet shower comb to re-wet as directed.  After applying, I often end up wrapping my hair in a towel after I get out so my hair isn&#x27;t soaking, and I have not noticed this affecting my outcome.  In an hour, I&#x27;ve got a head full of soft, shiny curls.  There&#x27;s no frizz, no tangles, no flaking, and no stickiness.  And you&#x27;ve got volume at the roots-- no slicked down, weighed down, crunchy roots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the next day or two.  If I twist my hair up in a bun and go to sleep, I will get a different look in the morning-- looser waves, still soft and touchable without the greasy roots or weird stiff hair that other products give you.  I love a product that doesn&#x27;t require a daily do-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with the 2 oz size to try out (I&#x27;m jaded when it comes to hair products), but I will be moving up to the 32 oz now-- that&#x27;s how much I like it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading about it in a magazine.  I have naturally wavy hair but needed a product that would turn my waves into curls and not leave it frizzy.  This product works great.  I love how my curls look.  I apply a quarter-size amount to my damp hair. The directions say that you shouldn&#x27;t towel dry your hair before using it but I twist my hair in a towel first just to remove some of the excess water, before application.  Then I use a diffuser to dry it. Turns out great every time!</li>
    <li> this product dose just what it says, i love my hair!! my hair is all natural , i wasn&#x27;t able to control it or have it look the way i wanted it until this product!!! and i&#x27;m so happy to have found it!!!!!!! thanks HAIR RULES!!!!:)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an all natural, great for the environment type product this is NOT it! BUT...if you are looking for a product that will make your 4b/c hair look fabulous then this is it. I love the way my hair looks after using curly whip. I love Kinky Curly Curling Custard (for it&#x27;s ingredients and for the job it does on my hair) but that product tends to get crunchy and it also flakes. I haven&#x27;t had that problem with the hair rules Curly Whip. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curl Whip for about 2 years now.  My hair is thick, frizzy, coarse and curly.  My curls aren&#x27;t spiral, more all over the place.  I don&#x27;t really love the way my curls are since they have a mind of their own but this product has given my curly hair more structure and less frizz.      While I don&#x27;t like applying it to soaking damp hair, I just use my towel and gently squeeze my hair once before applying the curl whip.  I usually absorb a little of the wetness so it&#x27;s not dripping all over my back.  With curly hair, the more you touch it or dry it, the frizzier it becomes.  So the less touching the better.      My hair is shoulder length and I use a little less than a quarter size from the roots to the tips and just shake out the curl.  For a little added softness I add a drop of Olivina oil all over the ends, avoiding the scalp (yes its a body &amp; leg oil, but when I was at Lake Austin Spa they used it in my hair and it left it sooo soft and shiny!).  I shake my hair out and sleep with it wet.      The next morning, again I shake out the curls because they do end up being a little tight, but formed.  My hair is super bouncy, my curls are soft and formed.  I re-wet certain spots that I slept on and the curl re-appears.  It&#x27;s not crunchy, not wet looking, flat or anything else.  Just bouncy curls.  Usually 2nd day hair is best because the curl has loosened a bit, all you do is re-wet (spritz) and go.  So simple.     If you&#x27;re not sure if this product will work for you, they have a smaller travel size.  The smell isn&#x27;t all too great, but it goes away.  The oil I add loosens the curl a bit too.  I would definitely recommend this product to curly hair people!  The perfect leave in styling tool without all the hardness or crunch!</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a hair. It made my hair feel and look very dry. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and I have thick, curly, unruly hair. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve tried everything out there, but I sure have tested a lot of things on my hair. In all honesty, I have not found anything that truly works as this stuff does. I used it for the first time this morning and have been left with soft, tamed and bouncy curls since.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent for natural hair;I am loving it. however, it is above the price as compared to other product I tried</li>
    <li> Great product!  It keeps the curl and is enriched with moisture.</li>
    <li> Was delivered fast but product made my hair dry and freezy and i have natural curly hair. Price is to high for what it offers theirs other products that work much better and are way cheaper. Wont purchase again</li>
    <li> This stuff is so worth the cost. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a over a month and the results are noticeable.  Your hair is soften and doesn&#x27;t have the crunchy feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used countless other products such as Kinky Curly, Shea Moisture Curling Pudding, Just as I Am Curling Jelly etc but this brand, Hair Rules is by far the better choice for my hair texture.  I&#x27;m not completely natural, I do have a texturizer in my hair because my hair is EXTREMELY course, a texturizer makes it softer and manageable; the equivalent of a &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; kit back in the day.  Hair Rules Curly Whip builds the coil definition and adds moisture without weighting my hair down.  The other problem I had with other products was when I apply scape oil or &amp;#34;hair grease&amp;#34;, the other products would cake up and I would have all this white buildup making my hair look like it&#x27;s full of lint or something.  I hate that!  With Curly Whip I don&#x27;t have that problem...great stuff, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product based on tutorials I have seen. But there are cheaper styling puddings and custards with better scents and moisturizing ability.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Leaves my curls soft and shiny.  The fragrance is rather strong, but not suffocating.  I&#x27;ve used many different styling products for curly hair, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> I must say it does hold a curl. Looks best when I apply it on my wet hair after washing it.  I don&#x27;t like the sticky feel on your hands when you apply the product. Overall the smell is great the hair feels great not weighed down.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because no product has ever made my hair as healthy and grow as long as this one.  I like that it&#x27;s clear and I can leave my hair wet and walk out the house if I want.  It just looks shiny and soft.  I would recommend this product to all African American women that want a natural look that is soft and curly as oppose to hard, dry looking and wiry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is pass my shoulders.  It has never been this long.  I love my hair because of this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried KCCC (leaves hair crunchy and needs lots of maintainance between application), hair gel (as a daily wash-n-go) and then I found THIS. I  went to the salon as recommended by a friend and learned how to apply it. I use it to set my hair under a hood dryer or as a wash-n-go, or just air dry and I ALWAYS get great results. Hair doesn&#x27;t frizz and and keeps a consistent curl pattern. I don&#x27;t run from humid weather and my curls come out different depending on the humidity if I air dry it -but never frizzed! I wash and reapply every 3 (as instructed) to 5 days (when I&#x27;m cheating). I recently went to Miss Jessie&#x27;s bc a friend told me their styling products last a week but I found the routine to have too many steps so back to Curly Whip. A 32 oz bottle lasts me approx 6 weeks - I have 3C hair. I used to use the Hair Rules shampoo and conditioner but I have also had good results with other brands and the curly whip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please resume carrying the 32 oz bottle!</li>
    <li> I have very curly frizzy hair.  I have been using Curly Rule products for two years and swear by them. My curls are now defined and last for days. Highly highly recommend this.  The only person who doesn&#x27;t like me using this product is my stylist because I no longer buy her products (smile).</li>
    <li> Nice smell (grapefruit like) and smooths well.  No flaking or buildup.  You have to use hair gel or spray to get firm hold in addition to product.</li>
    <li> I have short, dry, curly-kinky hair and the Curly Whip is THE BEST syling product I have EVER used!!!  I used the Curly Whip for curl definition and it controls frizz (especially during the summer).  I finger-comb a generous amount it IN THE SHOWER on my sopping wet hair and let air-dry.  I&#x27;m out-of-the house and looking great and feeling EVEN MORE confident about wearing my hair naturally!  I am a very busy professional and DO NOT have time to spend more than 20 minutes on styling and managing my hair!  I was able to successfully control my Fro&#x27; during my most recent [very hot and humid] Caribbean vacation!!!  The Hydrating Finsihing Cream is great for touch-ups on dry hair.  The HAIR RULES Line is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; for styling and hydrating my dry hair.  My visit to the Hair Rules Salon has proven to be a pleasant &amp; positive [learning] experience as we11!</li>
    <li> It made my curls defined and even after the first day I was able to manipulate it. I have 4b and 4c hair. I was preparing myself to be disappointed but I wasn&#x27;t. Ecostyler and curls unleashed curl gel only lasts a day on my hair</li>
    <li> This product was definitely not for me. I have curly hair, but it&#x27;s not for people with curly hair, it&#x27;s for people with &amp;#34;kinky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; hair.  I just need a product to separate and define my curls, not to tame the typical &amp;#34;kinky&amp;#34; wiry hair.</li>
    <li> This gives gives my hair big beautiful curly waves and ringlets. Other products make my hair shrink up and lay flat with no volume. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product completely dried my hair out. I bought it not really paying any attention to the ingredients. After it started to dry my hair out on day 2, I read the label and realized it had all chemicals and nothing nourishing for the hair. I wouldn&#x27;t advise any natural girl to buy this product. If your hair needs moisture, don&#x27;t buy this. I have kinky curly hair (4a), this product&#x27;s target market. I really wish natural hair care companies would invest as much time into creating great products for natural hair as they do marketing. It would save us natural girls a whole lot of time and money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a curly hair product to enhance my curls and cut down on frizz. This product was not impressive. The consistency is a very thick gel. When it dried I had white flakes on my hair and the product built up on my hair and scalp. The upside is that my curls didn&#x27;t come out crunchy and it did a better job than putting nothing in my hair, but I still had more frizz than I would&#x27;ve liked. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. Go for moroccan oil. It&#x27;s better for your scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> This did exactly what Anthony Dickey said on my 4C hair. I will be wearing wash-n-go styles and no longer dreading detangling thanks to his simple advice to conditioner-rinse no more than 2-3 days apart. This is the only product that I have used that gives my hair weight and body. Also, I used too much product, thinking that this would be like other leave-ins. It was totally different. I had too much product and I didn&#x27;t have any product buildup whatsoever. That has never happened. My only complaint is that I have to order online and it&#x27;s no longer sold in Target. I don&#x27;t like having to pay shipping fees on hair products. My rating is still a 5 because the products was everything that it is supposed to be for my hair type. My coils are the same diameter as a spring in an ink pen to give you an idea of how tiny my coils are. Coils as tight as mine also equal dry hair, but co-washing so frequently doesn&#x27;t allow it to become over dried and brittle. I am glad that I discovered Dickey&#x27;s common sense approach to texture care.</li>
    <li> As soon as I applied this product to my freshly washed, natural hair, I washed it out. This product smells like a weird chemical, and I was afraid of what something that smells so badly would do to my hair. I have a brand new bottle if anyone wants it. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing product.  defined my curls like no other.  it took a while to dry but I may have used too much of the product.  My hair was not hard or crunchy afterwards.  I used it in conjunction with the hair rules daily cleanser and quench conditioner.  I will definitely do more wash and wear styling due to Dickey and his products.  This man KNOWS of what he speaks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a styler that works on my 4C coils.</li>
    <li> I have tried a thousand products and always come back to this one it is light and the smell is great</li>
    <li> Description does not do the curl whip justice.  I have been looking for a product to keep my hair from looking fuzzy and dried out --but everytime I think I found something I&#x27;ve been disappointed.  I think finally this is the real thing that my curly hair has been needing. Hoping Amazon will keep this in stock because I have not found this locally.  I will be trying the shampoo and conditioner next.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Just put it on wet hair and go. The curl stays in the hair for days without reapplication. Will buy other products from this company.</li>
    <li> Hair rules us all I use each day on my hair!</li>
