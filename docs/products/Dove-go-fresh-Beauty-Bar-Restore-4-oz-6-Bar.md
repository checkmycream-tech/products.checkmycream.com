      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>This is a nice clean smell.  </li>
      <li>Dove works great for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>The scent is very soft, not over powering.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t like other dove soaps that leave your skin feeling soft and smooth though</li>
      <li>... lather really well :O)</li>
      <li>Not floral like so many other Dove options, but definitely not masculine either.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used other dove products and have been satisfied with the way they clean and moisturize, but I&#x27;ve found most of their scents overpowering. Unlike the plum &amp; sakura blossom scent (which is way too sweet for me) and the cool cucumber (which I just don&#x27;t like), Restore smells is clean while still being slightly fruity. It has the potential to be a men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s soap bar, but is still leans towards a feminine scent in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine overtones of lever 2000 soap combined with a citrus-y pomegranate smell. Overall, great product. Lathers, moisturizes, and cleans well. Highly recommended.</li>
