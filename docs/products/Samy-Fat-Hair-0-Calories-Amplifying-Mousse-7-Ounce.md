    <li> Great for fine hair and thickens too!  Wonderful with hair spray!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, fine and very short. After shampooing I blow dry my hair,  apply a small amount of mousse throughout and blow dry again. Perfecto!</li>
    <li> The Samy Fat Hair \\&quot;0\\&quot; Calories Amplifying Mousse is greasy and does not add volume to the hair.  I would recommend a pass on this product.</li>
    <li> I like all the Samy Fat Hair products. The amplifying mousse gives my thinning hair some much-needed body.</li>
    <li> will not buy again, push the button and it only makes noise or drips liquid</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it, volume extraordinaire, my fine locks are thicker and curly and tamed beyond belief, very satisfied customer, will order again.</li>
    <li> Maybe I used too much of the product, but my hair felt heavy. I still use it, but sparingly.</li>
    <li> This product helps stop the frizzies and protects against humidity in the air. It also gives my hair volume.</li>
    <li> The product is great however you only get 10% of the product out of the can and the aerosal quits working.  I have thrown two cans away now because they were 90% still full but quit working!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, but was only able to use it four times.  Can stopped working.  It is probably still three-fourths full.  Wrote to company and have heard nothing.</li>
    <li> I have thing hair and this seems to really make it somewhat hicker. than without using it.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Sane as always..like it</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My hair is very fine and pretty lifeless, and this product definitely gave me noticable volume! It didnt leave my hair greasy at all (which lots of products tend to do since my hair is so fine) and it lasts all day! My hair also does not feel weighed down, but it does feel much more volumptuous and I couldn&#x27;t recommed it more. If youre in doubt, I say go for it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic hair mousse that smells kinda fruity and kind of spa. It has the cute gimmicky &#x27;no calorie&#x27; thing but.dont let that deter you, this is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mousse itself comes out as a liquid them foams up and you do not need a lot depending on your hair style and length/thickness. The nozzle is somewhat flimsy though and i ended up breaking mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volume this gives is pretty good! My hair felt and looked fuller after nlowdrying it, it was a bit dry though so make sure to condition well. I do not use conditioner so my hair was a bit straw like but still i loved the poofyness of it with this!</li>
    <li> Love this product and the ease of getting!</li>
    <li> I have used Samy Fat Hair in the past and I always like the way it works.  It helps lift my fine hair at the roots and gives a really nice volume boost and thickness.  I was super disappointed when I opened this new can to use it and found it had a new fragrance added.  I am sensitive to scents and the old Fat Hair didn&#x27;t have fragrance or at least one that was not too strong or that bothered me.  This one does.  To be fair, I want to note that it probably isn&#x27;t a terribly overwhelming scent for most people, but I do notice it and do not want it in my hair product that I have to smell all day.  Does anyone know of a really good root boosting, volumizing mousse that is unscented?  If you do, please comment!</li>

    <li> This product is great for thin hair.  have been using it for years and it gives my hair the body I need</li>
    <li> my hair is thin and has no body at all, after&lt;br /&gt;fat Hair application, I can style my hair for&lt;br /&gt;two to three days without it looking drab and flat.</li>
    <li> The best mousse out there for volume by far!!!!!Have tried all of them and keep ordering this one since it is hard to find...For people with thin hair I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it after I wash my hair.  It does make a difference in the feel of my hair.  The hair seems thicker when I style.  I would recommend this product for anyone but especially for women with fine or thin hair.</li>
    <li> i have used this product off and on for about 6 years.  I have a side part that leaves the side with less hair looking super flat.  when i put a small amount into the roots and blow dry the hair in the opposite direction, INSTANT VOLUME! it is amazing.  just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will feel weighed down and sticky.</li>
    <li> The foam is lush and creates lots of heallthy looking volume! The scent is light. This product is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Good volume for fine hair</li>
    <li> This product used to be great - they changed the formula and while it now has a pleasant scent, it does not do the job it used to do.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is nice but i think it can get a bit sticky so don&#x27;t overdo it. It definitely gives texture and volume. use with a shine serum.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it will do!</li>
