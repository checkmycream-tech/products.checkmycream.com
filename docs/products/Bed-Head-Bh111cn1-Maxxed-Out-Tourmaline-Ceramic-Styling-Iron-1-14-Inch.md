      <li>It does do a good job curling, it&#x27;s just way more work than it should be.</li>
      <li>This thing would function better as a paperweight than a curling iron.</li>
      <li>LOVE these bed head curlers because they don&#x27;t have to be used with a glove and they hold the end of your hair while you curl it.</li>
      <li>Mini clamp leaves my curls kink-free at the ends :)</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>

<li> she noticed the iron portion (the part that gets hot) was too heavy and rested on the bathroom counter, heating it up.  </li>
<li> As stated, it&#x27;s a larger diameter curler and heats up quite well, so be careful.</li>
<li> Terrible it has a small clamp that it&#x27;s not the greatest.</li>
<li> Creates tight, big curls and doesn&#x27;t burn hair.</li>
<li> The clip of the handle is a little short</li>
<li> so you have to be careful with it.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make them last long though because my hair is very long and thick.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t get past my bangs to finish my hair when I decided I was going to send it back.</li>
<li> That short little clip on the wand!!</li>
<li> There is a little black O ring that is supposed to make the iron clamp the hair.</li>
<li> I bought this curling iron as a gift for my little sister, I thought being Bed Head</li>
<li> It no longer grips hair, which of course makes it impossible to curl hair in the first place.</li>
<li> If I could give this curling iron less than one star, I would!</li>
<li> Curls my hard to curl pin-straight hair.  </li>
<li> This curling iron doesn&#x27;t stay hot very disappointed it stays blinking</li>
<li> It made it very hard to grip a section of hair in order to curl it.</li>
<li> Shortening that clip was pointless!!</li>
<li> I can not return or exchange it...very disappointed</li>
<li> This is the WORST curling iron I have ever used!</li>
<li> If I could find an email address for their customer service, I would tell them what a piece of CRAP this iron is!</li>

<ol>
    <li> Constantly turning it back on because it turns off every time you pick it up. I&#x27;ve tried this with a couple of the same iron and they all have this glitch.</li>
    <li> A little cheap but I like the clamp</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift for my daughter, &amp; she used it for the first time today. She likes it. Her hair looks very nice with big swooping curls in it. She did a good job.</li>
    <li> LOVE these bed head curlers because they don&#x27;t have to be used with a glove and they hold the end of your hair while you curl it. I use these everyday &amp; this is my favorite size barrel for my long hair (I have 3 size barrels). Creates tight, big curls and doesn&#x27;t burn hair. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron as a gift for my little sister, I thought being Bed Head it would be a high quality product.  After she received it and used one time she noticed the iron portion (the part that gets hot) was too heavy and rested on the bathroom counter, heating it up.  If the handle had been proportional weight to the iron then it would have worked not problem.  We quickly sent the items back to Amazon since the item was pretty defective in my book.  I do not recommend this iron unless you are ok with damaging your bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Terrible it has a small clamp that it&#x27;s not the greatest. Now I have another tool under my sink since I bought thru amazon I can not return or exchange it...very disappointed</li>
    <li> This iron gets very hot so you have to be careful with it.  But it creates beautiful curls in just a few minutes. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is easy to use and makes fast amazing curls.  The clip of the handle is a little short but this prevents unwanted creases in the curls.  Great manufacturing and sturdy, I see no reason why this product shouldn&#x27;t last forever.  Great gift idea for any woman in your life.</li>
    <li> A bit of an adjustment with the short clamp, but I really like the curls it gives me. I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make them last long though because my hair is very long and thick. So probably better results and longer lasting with thinner and mid-length hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it! I would definitely recommend this item as a gift.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. One thing to be aware of is that it has a short clamp on it, as opposed to what I more commonly see where the clamp extends the full length of the iron. My girlfriend views this as an advantage as she doesn&#x27;t have to open the clamp to continue wrapping her hair. As stated, it&#x27;s a larger diameter curler and heats up quite well, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Love!  Curls my hard to curl pin-straight hair.  Easy to use.  Mini clamp leaves my curls kink-free at the ends :) Best curling iron I&#x27;ve used to date!</li>
    <li> If I could give this curling iron less than one star, I would! This is the WORST curling iron I have ever used! There is a little black O ring that is supposed to make the iron clamp the hair. It never stays in place! I have to stop &amp; pry it apart &amp; work the O ring back into position with every lock of hair I attempt to curl! I also accidentally hit the off button over &amp; over when using it! It does do a good job curling, it&#x27;s just way more work than it should be. If I could find an email address for their customer service, I would tell them what a piece of CRAP this iron is!</li>
    <li> Was not the barrel I wanted cannot find 1 1/2 in barrel but it will do !!!</li>
    <li> I love this. Works very well and it heats up quickly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to because of the short clamp, but I love this curling iron.  Gets hot really fast and doesn&#x27;t leave crimp lines in your hair.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product is designed with half of a clamp, which was actually a disadvantage despite what the packaging said. It made it very hard to grip a section of hair in order to curl it. As I used it more, I was a little more able to understand its quirks. But then last week, after only 8 weeks of use, something with the spring that enables the clamp to grip happened. It no longer grips hair, which of course makes it impossible to curl hair in the first place. This thing would function better as a paperweight than a curling iron.</li>
    <li> That short little clip on the wand!! I need to curl my bangs, not possible. Didn&#x27;t get past my bangs to finish my hair when I decided I was going to send it back. The traditional wands with the full size clips work just fine and do not leave any marks in my hair. Shortening that clip was pointless!! The search will continue for a high quality curling iron!!&lt;br /&gt;On a good note; Amazon service absolutely ROCKS!! Lightening fast delivery. When I packed it up and dropped it off at my local UPS location, I had an email the following day saying that my refund will show up on my acct within a day or so. Well done Amazon. You have me as a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This curling iron doesn&#x27;t stay hot very disappointed it stays blinking n turns off .</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife.  Received quickly and just as described</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s true that you have to be careful when you set it down but I have a heat proof holder from a straightening iron I&#x27;ve had before so I set it on that when I use it. The curls are easy to make and so quick and they look beautiful! I totally recommend this product!</li>
