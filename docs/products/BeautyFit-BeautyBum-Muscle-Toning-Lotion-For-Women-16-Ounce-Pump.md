      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love my beauty bum!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>If you use this product as much as I do, the pump is very handy and is a great value.</li>
      <li>This product works excellent but you need to be pretty lean for it to be most effective.  </li>
      <li>Love, love this product!</li>
      <li>I say for sure that Beauty Bum caused it?</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>

      <li>and it leaves my skin smooth and silky!</li>
      <li>Interesting.</li>
      <li>Overall great product for figure competition prep.</li>
      <li>it works best with rubber shorts and a waste wrap.</li>
      <li>marked reduction in cellulite, looks so good.</li>
      <li>I love the warm feeling you get when you first apply it, but I would not suggest it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>stars because I do believe the product works to reduce the appearance of cellulite, but one star because I think it thinned the skin to the point it made old scars very bright and obvious.</li>
      <li>but the important thing is that the difference is very noticeable.</li>
      <li>Right now I will not give stars.</li>
      <li>the lotion activated well, with a hot sensation leading me to believe it was working in some way</li>
      <li>Actually, when using it on my body it made blemishes appear more</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the statement, thinking it was maybe the room</li>
      <li>You need to wash your hands (and wrists) immediately and thoroughly after using but it has really smoothed things out and my skin is even softer.</li>
      <li>I can absolutely tell a difference since I have been using it.</li>
      <li>It really works..</li>
      <li>If your body fat is high and your not exercising or watching your diet do not expect miracles.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I just read an article about what plastic surgeons recommend to their friends, and it said that the cellulite reduction techniques that are new</li>
      <li>Product shipped quickly and works as expected.</li>
      <li>Wow</li>
      <li>These are very old stretch marks that have long since faded into my skin tone, and so this brightening was VERY noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, my diet has not changed, the lighting in my rooms have not changed, and I highly doubt I aged so much in two months that the skin changed that drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It definitely gets hot and makes your skin very red.</li>
      <li>really are expensive and don&#x27;t work that well aren&#x27;t that safe, for the money.</li>

    <li> I just ordered this one... But I been buying the 6 onz one... This one will be my 3rd bottle...&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is that, I love my Beauty bun I cant workout anymore w/o this... It really works.. I use it for legs, NOT for glutes (using something else for glutes).and that works really good for me&lt;br /&gt;My cellulite is not too bad but still...  So if you want to try it... DO IT!!!  AND CHECK IT OUT IF THIS WORK FOR YOU....</li>
    <li> im on day 3..hope it helps!</li>
    <li> Worn with anti cellulite pants such as Zaggora or Delfin, this is the ultimate workout cream.</li>
    <li> VEry good still need good diet and exercise ..</li>
    <li> Great for helping to tighten skin (when your already lean).  This product works excellent but you need to be pretty lean for it to be most effective.  If your body fat is high and your not exercising or watching your diet do not expect miracles.</li>
    <li> Love, love this product! It works - that&#x27;s for sure. I zapped off &amp;#34;cottage cheese off my belly. I put it on twice per day, during exercise and at night.</li>
    <li> i use it all the time when i work out, was recommended by my trainer. I use a water belly band for max results</li>
    <li> If you use this product as much as I do, the pump is very handy and is a great value.</li>
    <li> Feel the burn but notice the difference of the appearance of your skin. I used it while in a sauna.  Helped heat my skin up quicker.</li>
    <li> Giving three stars because it works, BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month into using this product, my husband mentioned that my stretch marks looked &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;. He was unaware I was using any product on my butt/legs. I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the statement, thinking it was maybe the room lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month later (two months into using the product), I personally noticed that several of my stretch marks were brighter/whiter. These are very old stretch marks that have long since faded into my skin tone, and so this brightening was VERY noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I say for sure that Beauty Bum caused it? No. However, my diet has not changed, the lighting in my rooms have not changed, and I highly doubt I aged so much in two months that the skin changed that drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars because I do believe the product works to reduce the appearance of cellulite, but one star because I think it thinned the skin to the point it made old scars very bright and obvious.</li>
    <li> I love my beauty bum! Works wonders! It&#x27;s a definate must have for all women. Wouldn&#x27;t try anything else! 😄</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! It definitely gets hot and makes your skin very red. You need to wash your hands (and wrists) immediately and thoroughly after using but it has really smoothed things out and my skin is even softer. I like to put this on my tummy even and then wear my waist cincher. Great buy!</li>
    <li> BeautyBum reconditions your skin and increases your water loss as you sweat.  it works best with rubber shorts and a waste wrap.</li>
    <li> love the burn and already seeing results after 2 weeks. I put it on before.bed and wrap myself.in seran wrap.  Also put it on before.working out.All i can say is amazing!</li>
    <li> still trying to figure this out?  not sure as the stinging and or burning concern me.  I need to look at the ingredients to see if this is really good for the skin and or tru</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me (after I suggested it) and it arrived before the expected date. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I can see the difference already. I love the warm feeling you get when you first apply it, but I would not suggest it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> marked reduction in cellulite, looks so good. does take a few weeks. hang in there. I just read an article about what plastic surgeons recommend to their friends, and it said that the cellulite reduction techniques that are new (ie: lazer etc.) really are expensive and don&#x27;t work that well aren&#x27;t that safe, for the money. Interesting.</li>
    <li> Same exact product I was told to get by my coach from a different website at half the cost!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I wear it every time I do cardio.  Noticed a difference in my trouble areas but it takes time.</li>
    <li> I did not see any results from using this product.  I can only imagin that it requires long term use.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  It works!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;m a fitness competitor and I use it before each cardio session. It&#x27;s part of my training!  I apply it on my abs, butt and thighs and it makes me sweat a lot and it leaves my skin smooth and silky! I recommend you buying this!</li>
    <li> This product by itself will not help you lose weight and tighten up problem areas. However it does help my reduce my problem areas with a combination of diet and weight training. I apply it before my workouts to my thighs and wear my compression capris. Wow what a difference. Love it! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review to tell you that it works. Well, I do squats routine at the same time...so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this lotion or the squats but the important thing is that the difference is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> Right now I will not give stars. Order arrived today. I paid for the 16oz and received a 6.5 oz tube. Not sure of this can be fixed. I do hope so. Well I had to give a star to submit this.</li>
    <li> I did not see any change when using this lotion.. the lotion activated well, with a hot sensation leading me to believe it was working in some way but it never did. Actually, when using it on my body it made blemishes appear more and that was discouraging. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I can absolutely tell a difference since I have been using it. I wear this with my neoprene waist wrap. Excellent combo!!! Great price!</li>
    <li> the lotion was broke and spill all over inside the box when i opened my package</li>
    <li> will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I am not happy  with this product. It never stopped burning and my legs looked like a lobster.  I am going to see if I can return it.  I had to wash it off it was so painful and it still burned for awhile after washing it off.</li>
    <li> Product shipped quickly and works as expected. The pump mechanism itself could probably be wider because the lotion is thick. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after application (as the instructions say.) Overall great product for figure competition prep.</li>
