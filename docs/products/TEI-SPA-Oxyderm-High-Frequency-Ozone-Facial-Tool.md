      <li>I will say that it is NOT painful at all.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have not seen any improvement in my acne, or blemishes, or skintone.  I&#x27;ve been using this tool daily for 3 weeks so far, and my optimism for this product has seen a steady decline. It had no effect on my breakouts or general skin appearance. Am I missing something?...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and still getting breakouts. This devices clears up any breakout before it develops into anything big. It is also getting rid of little white bumps I have on my chin. It is evening out my skin tone and fading brown spots. I have been using it for a month now. It is well worth the money. You would spend more than this for one good facial. I highly recommend it! Definitely, five stars.</li>
    <li> Nice presentation. Comes with a bag to store the tool. I Still cant say if it really works. Will make a future review.</li>
    <li> First off I would like to mention that I am a licensed Esthetician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This high frequency came very well packaged, and I love that it has a storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You turn the dial to \\&quot;I\\&quot; to \\&quot;warm up\\&quot; for 30 seconds. It does NOT and is NOT supposed to get warm/hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you test on your hand....you will feel a static electricity feeling, but it is very light. You can turn the dial up two more settings. This was designed for at home use so if you follow the directions you shouldn&#x27;t be able to hurt yourself with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a piece of unfolded gauze over your face, it will help guide the electrode smoothly over your skin. It is what we do all of the time in spas. You can either roll over your skin, or you can tap trouble spots with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***It is totally normal to smell or even taste metal when you use this. It is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used the TEI Spa for the first time, and I think it will work well. I will do an update when I see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use alcohol to clean this product, or alchol products on your face before using. You&#x27;re using an electrical current, could be a fire hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few days since I started using this product, and it totally works!! I have hormonal acne, and this thing is getting rid of some painful cystic type acne nearly overnight. I am very impressed with this product.....WAAAAY worth the money to me.</li>
    <li> This is such a brilliant product. Excellent at helping to keep my hormonal spots at bay. Much better than using all different creams that just get messy etc. 1 negative is that the bulb is extremely fragile... I dropped my first tei spa and it smashed. The bulbs cannot be replaced so make sure you store and use it carefully. Luckily I have a new one now and I can&#x27;t imagine not having one now. Such a quick and easy solution!</li>
    <li> Wow!!!!  Excelent for zits, breakouts. Took care of my acne rosacea without hurting my skin. Very easy to use. (video in you tube) Not time consuming.  Three minutes a day does the job.  Great for sensitive skin, just remember to apply locion after so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this item. It does exactly what it says it does. I use it every single night. Easy to use. I bought my first one over two years ago and am going to buy my second one today. The cord has given out due to DAILY use for over two years. I think I got my money&#x27;s worth out of it!! Time for a new one :))</li>
    <li> I bought this on December 14, 2014.  Opened it about a week later.  Bulb broke January 29, 2015.  My daughter and I both had been using the Oxyderm twice a day each.  We both liked it very much and although it didn&#x27;t clear up her acne, I think it helped to some degree.  As for my skin, I actually think it helps keep small skin tags ay bay.  Having said that, each and every time we out the protective cap back on the bulb, it would fall off.  Did it everytime, put it on the bulb, falls off onto the floor.  On the day the bulb got broken, I placed the cap on the bulb, and as I was coiling the cord, the cap fell off (again) and the plug in part flipped up and nicked the bulb, breaking it.  So I called the company, hoping that they would replace the item due to the fact that their &amp;#34;protective &amp;#34; bulb cover just wouldn&#x27;t stay on, causing the bulb to get broken.  Had the cap actually been able to stay on, the plug in would have bumped that and not the bulb and I would still have a working tool.  Well, the customer service rep seemed to understand, but the director said since it didn&#x27;t fall under their warranty, they could or would (not sure which) not replace it, but they would give me 30% off to buy a new one.  So I clarified with the rep that it is normal for the cap to continuously fall off and if that was the case, then I would certainly let any prospective buyer know that they should be leery about purchasing this.  So to wrap this up, the tool is great, I really lik(ed) it.  But why on earth would I pay for another one just to have a poorly designed cap put me at risk of the bulb breaking?  We wouldn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t.  My daughter and I couldn&#x27;t have taken any better care of this item and it still got broken.  We will purchase a different brand and take our chances with them.  Just be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very careful with it.  And if you can&#x27;t be that careful, then steer clear.</li>
    <li> I started using this tool about 3 weeks ago to help with acne, scarring, redness, and oily skin.  It has helped tremendously with healing existing, active acne spots and it seems to also be helping in preventing new spots forming.  Along with life style changes, supplements, and a good topical program, this tool has made a big difference in the health of my skin.  You will feel a slight electrical current against your skin, it is not painful, but until you get used to it a bit strange.  My skin feels refreshed after use.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. This really helps with deep painful bumps on the skin. Use a piece of gauze over the bulb to keep it clean and help maximize ozone build-up (says my esthetician).</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t see any results at all with this product.  Now, 60 days later, it is NOT working and the window for returning it has past.  Save your $$$  NOT worth it.</li>
    <li> I think this works great! Though I do need to keep up with it. I see a huge difference when I use it regularly and dont slack off. This thing does have a feeling of tingly static electricity. Even in just a few days use my bad black head areas are much smaller, and my skin is clearer. I am also sure to use it if I feel a deep pimple brewing, then it just goes away. This will be great for the weeks before my wedding!</li>
    <li> Cheap! Do not waste your money. These are store mall quality straighteners. You&#x27;re better off buying a Chi and spending a little extra money.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best gadget I&#x27;ve bought. My skin breaks out within a day or two of waxing and this has ended that cycle. Make sure to do a gentle test at the lowest setting, first lest you give yourself a good jolt.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oxyderm Facial Tool and I must say that it really works! I love it! I also have a Dermwand but I really think that this works better when it comes to clearing up your skin. I broke my old one though when I accidentally dropped it on the floor and its glass broke. :-( After that, I was thinking about not buying a new one anymore, until my skin broke out. After a few months, I decided to buy a new one. I started using it again and only after a few days, my face is already clearing up. I am asian with yellow skin tone. I get occasional breakouts, but not really acne. I tend to prick my own skin when I get irritated wiyh my pimples, which always leaves my face with dark red marks. My face is super oily as well. This tool really helped my skin become less oily and it makes my skin tone even out faster. Sometimes, it tends to dry out my skin though, but it&#x27;s manageable. It also works well with my skin care regimen. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Accidentally purchased on ONE CLICK.&lt;br /&gt;However this is the stupidest device on the planet.  If you hate your spouse and just want to spend money randomly, this is it... you found &#x27;the gizmo&#x27;.  But trust me, this will not erase ugly by any means.</li>
    <li> i feel that i need to use this product my pimples a long!!!! time!!! in order for this to get rid of pimples. Just change your diet and have good hygiene and you will still see a difference, even though this product does make a big difference in the feel of my face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for everyone. I even have my teenage son using it and it helps with his acne more then the meds the dermatologist puts him on. It events skin tone and makes your skin look great.</li>
    <li> The aesthetician who performed my first facial used a Tei Spa on me and when I left I asked her about it.  She told me the brand and I purchased.  She recommended Tei Spa above all other products out there.  I was really glad to find it on Amazon, however quite pricey.  She did forewarn me that there may be cheaper brands but she loved the Tei Spa.  I did not use my Tei Spa yet but I have no doubt that it will do just fine.</li>
    <li> waste money.. My wife does not like it at all...</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I broke the glass on my first one and luckily the company that manufactures the product sold dm one for a very discounted rate. Definitely worth it. It has helped with my acne so much and those pimples that come out of nowhere.</li>
    <li> Esthetician recommended this to me for my stubborn acne. It really does help. It&#x27;s working against my hormonal acne. Gets rid of large pimples/cysts fast. Skin has cleared up significantly.</li>
    <li> This product does not do anything. Do not waste you money on it. Saw no improvement or change in my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, do not buy.</li>
    <li> Its a great product.  It works well and its easy and convenient to use.  I use it every day and it controls the oil in my skin and keeps it very clear.</li>
    <li> I feel like I can see a difference.  My mom said she can tell.  :)</li>
    <li> I am 28 years old women. Light skin, green eyes, brown hair - Caucasian. My skin is oily and sensitive. Clogged enlarged pores, spider veins around the nose, brown sun spots under eyes, black heads. The look of my skin is very pale and tired.&lt;br /&gt;I have been useing this item for like a 3 weeks now. Every morning and evening after I clean my face (before applying the cream)I use the item for at least a minute (depends how much time i have especially in the morning). I noticed slight improvement after 4 days already. Skin gets brighter!!! After 3 weeks of using this product i see great improvement. My pores got smaller what makes my skin look younger and healthier. Because the pores are smaller, they don&#x27;t get clogged. I haven&#x27;t been using any new cosmetics so this is definitely the product that helped me!&lt;br /&gt;My friend has a similar item at home that works same way just different brand. It had been in her draw from the time she finished cosmetology school. Once she started to use it her face noticeably improved. It is brighter less acne and everyone is telling her she look great, asking her if she died her hair lol. She has horrible roots though already :) that is not her hair it is her face! She still has acne scares but elasticity and tone of her skin is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item costs $100.00 it is not a lot but not cheap neither. I bought it in order to try out and kept it because it works. It doesn&#x27;t do the miracles but improves your skin %80.00. But keep in mind that this is the item that you will have forever. It is not an expensive cream that you will run out of in a month! That is why i decided to spent $100.00 and i think i was very good purchase. Give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniela P., Westwood NJ</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t exactly understand the concept behind how this thing works, but I can tell you that IT DEFINITELY WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical initially.  I&#x27;ve got to be honest.  I expected this to be a waste of money (like the xeno), but I read so many good reviews I figured I would give it a shot.  So, here&#x27;s how it goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have acne or significant rosacea, just little red bumps on my \\&quot;t-zone\\&quot; and ugly red \\&quot;spider\\&quot; veins where my nostrils meet my cheeks.  I am VERY fair, so everything is pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a significant and *positive* change IMMEDIATELY after using it one time!! The redness I typically had on my nose (especially at the sides of the nostrils) and cheeks almost vanished entirely.  My little red bumps became significantly less noticeable and within 3 days of use were entirely GONE - when normally, they&#x27;re always present.  I mean, allllways.  and right now there are none at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually making my pores appear smaller and therefore, making my skin look younger (I am 32 years old) and I was guessed to be 25 today, when just last week people were guessing 35!).  People actually noticed and asked me what I&#x27;ve been using!  I have been able to stop using concealer - and I have only been using it for 5 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it might sound a bit over-the-top, but it really has been absolutely wonderful for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 things I would like to mention.  I couldn&#x27;t find any answers on the pain involved before purchasing so I was very nervous trying it the first time.  I will say that it is NOT painful at all.  It&#x27;s a weird sensation, but definitely not anywhere near painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound it makes when on your skin is a bit disturbing (a bit like a mini Tesla generator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - the reviewer below who mentioned smelling/tasting metal while using it was definitely speaking the truth!!  Very weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - IT WORKS.  I would have paid A LOT more for this!!!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! My skin is clearer now and I stopped using any topical cream for my acne all I use now is the Tei spa twice a day and it keeps my skin clear ;)</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and I have terrible adult acne and rosacea. This product helps heal my acne and take the redness out of my face. Worth the investment, great company. The product shipped to me super fast. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> my face was completely dry everytime i use this, but i can only use it on my chin, at the lowest setting, and putting it on my nose and forehead would create terrible stings. and my pores seem to be getting bigger, not smaller, and i&#x27;m secreting even more oil than usual! really disappointed</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  I&#x27;m in an esthetics program.  I love using this.  Wish I could take it to school and use it instead of the 1920&#x27;s model we have in lab.</li>
    <li> I love this product its simple to use and it has helped with my face. I have Rosacea and it also helps with the Rosacea. This is not a cure but a great addition to a more natural approach to acne. However there are times I just need to take more traditional course. This machine helps with cauterization and faster healing of pimple areas</li>
    <li> i like this product, but it hasnt helped me quite yet..the product pumps oxygen into your skin which helps sanitize skin. it smells exactly like the high frequency machines at my old esthetician school so i know its similar in effectiveness. i think my stress level is just too high to see results yet.</li>
    <li> This is first time ever that I&#x27;m written a review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;treat my acne well! I don&#x27;t break out anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve using this from last December till today, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Visibly reduced the occurrences of mild acne.&lt;br /&gt;+Reduced the oil being produced on my T-Zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Pricey (as of this writing the price has gone up since my purchase)&lt;br /&gt;-Does not have any benefit against cystic acne&lt;br /&gt;-The bulbs are fragile and can not be replaced if broken (Note: The box it was received in was a cause for concern after reading the warnings about the bulb)&lt;br /&gt;-There is a slight uncomfortable feeling in my mouth on certain teeth when the product is near my mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed if I was using my computer while using this device (multitasking), the mouse would freeze and skip. Its an odd situation and wont happen to 99% of users but don&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
    <li> GOT THIS THE SAME DAY I ORDERED IT!!&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost...I am 40 years old and had always had a great complexion. However, over the past year I have been experiencing these crazy breakouts around my jawline..must be hormonal, who knows!!  Anyhow...you name the products, I&#x27;ve tried it! I have spent hundreds and hundreds of $$$$ on cleansers, creams, prescriptions, and monthly facials and NONE had worked.&lt;br /&gt;This little hand held tool in one evening was a miracle!! I woke up this morning and the little culprits were gone....YAY!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my son&#x27;s doctor.  We avoided prescription drugs with it&#x27;s use!  Great product and I&#x27;m so glad we purchased!</li>
    <li> The product claimed to help with pimples and help skin glowy. I don&#x27;t see that with my face after I used it for about 2 weeks. But a few days after I used it I can see the different that my face is less oily which is great for this summer coming up. I think I will order chemical peel to help with the result.</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low for products to help with my hormonal acne and rosacea, I have only been using this tool for a week now but I really feel like it does make a difference. I am happy with my purchase and the results it has given so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and I&#x27;ve been suffering from cystic acne since I started college. My aesthetician and dermatologist used high frequency tools during my visits. This is a cheaper option that going to them every month. This device is easy to use and easy to clean. I use this on my chest, back, and face and I saw great results. My chest cleared up significantly and my back breaks out less; I&#x27;m also using this in conjunction with the Proactiv body wash. For my chest and back I saw results in the first week. As for my biggest problem area, my face, this tool decreases the size of my cystic acne faster than my prescription product alone. That is, the cystic acne would be gone by 2-3 weeks with little to no scars. In reality, I would rate this a 4.5 because I wish it were more powerful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s make your face clear and health!!!</li>
    <li> I have a multitude of facial skin problems (acne breakouts and small scars on my chin, large pores on my nose and cheeks [on top of where my sinuses are] wrinkles underneath my eyes from years of sleeping on my side with my face smashed into my pillow, 2 wrinkles between my brows, some tiny tiny broken capillaries on my cheeks, along with some very very small and light-colored age spots) *sigh* I&#x27;m only 27. I was taking birth control to help with the acne, and it worked wonders for my face, but I would get headaches and become nauseous (every day). Plus, other than to treat my acne, I was not in need of birth control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this is hopes that it would be an elixir, but I was wrong. My pore size did not decrease, nor did my scars, broken capillaries or age spots. THE GOOD NEWS is that I DO think it works for acne, and it may have helped the wrinkles between my brows. If you are using it for acne, you should prob use it every night or every other night. It gives off smell that reminds me of the way your clothes smell after you have been working/sweating outside on a cold day. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, though it SOUNDS like it should hurt, and what little pain I feel makes me think it is working. The closest thing that I can relate the sensation to is the &#x27;pins and needles&#x27; feeling when your foot goes to sleep, but not even to that extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with some kind of gel that you can apply afterwards, but I don&#x27;t use it. I put on a moisturizer (you can experiment to your liking) like Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion (yeah, I know it sounds odd to use body lotion on your face, but I think it conducts the electrical current better). Also, it is best to hold the bulb just a few millimeters away from your face (just enough to conduct the current, otherwise I don&#x27;t think it works) and it also seems to conduct better when I use the sides of the bulb rather than the apex. Another person mentioned putting a cotton pad on the target area and then rubbingthe bulb over the top of it, which works too if you are having a hard time keeping it just a few mm from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the wrinkles between my brows, they are still there, they just aren&#x27;t as apparent. But maybe it&#x27;s a trick of the mind or the light...When I was working on my brow wrinkles (and I worked on them for a good hour, but you won&#x27;t need to do that if you are using it for acne), after I was done, it looked red like a sun burn for about a day and then flaked off like dry skin in the winter. No such luck on my other wrinkles though ;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for redness and usage, I have used this little machine for over and hour before, and it did not cause any adverse effects on me.  After one session of about 10-15 minutes, the redness is usually gone within the next hour, max 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main thing to take away from this: If you can&#x27;t feel it working (pins and needles) you&#x27;re either not doing it right, or it&#x27;s broken.</li>
    <li> Been using this every morning for a couple of months or more. .. no results other than my face getting a bit dry.&lt;br /&gt;went to see an esthetician and man, can I feel the difference in the high frequency device she&#x27;s using.&lt;br /&gt;much,  much more powerful.</li>
    <li> This tool is a form of oxygen therapy that puts ozone directly in the skin. I received mine today and used it for the first time. Results were immediately noticeable. My pores shrunk and the pink inflamed skin of my face returned to a healthier natural color. If you have teenagers who are prone to breakouts you MUST buy this for them. It will  dramatically reduce their breakouts and improve their self esteem &amp; confidence immeasurably. If you take any type of oral (acne) medicine it passes through the liver damaging the body. Some creams and ointments work to a much lesser degree but are messy and obvious. This ozone tool has no side effects. Don&#x27;t take my word for it, read the literature and more importantly try it for yourself. Your own experience will be the only proof you need.</li>
    <li> Last year, I was battling cystic acne, which was very painful, so I was desperate to find something that could help.  When I first learned about this beauty gadget, I laughed. However, shortly after learning about this product, I had a facial.  The girl used a tool that delivered high frequency to my cystic acne.  The instrument she used was new and she said her clients were seeing positive results. A few days later, I noticed my acne shrink. After a couple of YouTube tutorials and finding a good price, I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this as an acne preventative and as a spot treatment.  First, you can use it all over your face, which is supposed to destroy bacteria that would lead to acne.  The second is focusing the tool on a specific problem area so that it can deliver concentrated frequencies for a longer period of time.  The Tei Spa comes with very clear instructions, which should be followed prior to using it.  To get positive results, you really have to take your time to make sure you&#x27;re delivering the charge evenly on your skin and by spending enough time on your problem areas.  When my skin care specialist was working with her instrument, she used a slow and deliberate technique all over my face and then would actually stop on any cystic acne and leave it on for a few seconds (I don&#x27;t remember how long exactly).  So when I was reading instructions for the Tei Spa, they seemed to correspond to the technique my skin care specialist used, so that is when I knew this tool had potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I can report great success with this product.  However, the main con is that you have to take your time, so it is not something I reach for as I am always rushing around when I get ready.  However, whenever I get the occasional cystic acne breakout, I make time to use this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  10/11/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s been a year and it still works great!  I keep it stored in the cute pouch it came with and of course follow the directions.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t use it as much as I should...I really need to make more time for this, as it really does a great job.w the directions.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t use it as much as I should...I really need to make more time for this, as it really does a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks and I can definitely see the results. It really helped my face clear up and for all the swelling to go down.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great! Even my boyfriend likes it :)</li>
    <li> I Order this item for next day delivery and paid £96 to be delivered in UK. Whilst I was ordering I did not come across any information that this product doesn&#x27;t work in UK. Item was delivered on time but it did not work. I went to local electronic store called MAPLIN in UK. Electrician told me that this product manufacturer have not specified the voltage therefore I need to contact manufacturer. I did phone TEI SPA and they told me that this product does not work in UK so I should return this item and supplier will refund me. Therefore I did return the item as per the guideline on Amazon. Post office staff told me that item will be delivered within 4 working days. However it has been now 8 days but I have not received the refund. I will not recommend this supplier to anyone. This is fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001NM85Q0 TEI SPA Oxyderm High Frequency Ozone Facial Tool]]</li>
    <li> Was curious to test it out, and it&#x27;s been fantastic!  I was getting a zit, and I used this on it for 2 days, and it disippated before breaking though.  I did have another blemish when it arrived, and post-treating with this, it never progressed to a nasty red mess.  The only drawback I can say it has is that it does give an odd smell, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming, and definitley doesn&#x27;t make this a bad item.  Will definitely buy another if/when the bulb on this one wears out.</li>
    <li> my friend advised me to buy this product-she said it was a miracle and she loves it, so i decided to give it a try&lt;br /&gt;after 1,5 weeks i noticed that my skin is still very oily but the actual breakouts mostly gone&lt;br /&gt;even if i have few and i am \\&quot;fixing\\&quot; them they do not get worse like before because of second inflammation, seems like ozone really have antibacterial effect&lt;br /&gt;so i am using it and my skin looks way better</li>
    <li> This is a great oxyderm. Easy to use great case and great serum. Very powerful start in 1. Must have for a home facial!</li>
    <li> Works really good. Have to use it everyday but I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this facial tool for my 17 year old son who had been battling severe acne for years. We had tried everything. I happened to read an article about the TEI SPA Oxyderm tool and decided to try yet one more thing. Unbelievable results!&lt;br /&gt;the very next day his face was markedly less red and inflamed looking. His skin improved by the day. It took approximately 8 weeks to pretty much clear up, with just some scarring remaining. And now, 6 months later, even the scarring is gone. He continues to use the tool 2-3x per week to maintain his skin and if he does get an occasional zit, just increases to everyday and pays special attention to the affected area for a few days and its taken care of! This has changed his life and attitude for the better.As anyone who has suffered from severe acne can attest to, self esteem can really take a hit. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; and is still struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> This device is very uncomfortable, it actually hurts. I bought for my sons &amp; I, you can feel it in your teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this item - my skin has never been this clear!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as an alternative to going to the spa to get pimples zapped. I was very skeptical that it would be as effective as the ones found in spas, etc. Well, IT WORKS!!! If I use it at the highest setting as soon as I feel a pimple come on and it will disappear overnight. I am starting to use it before I suspect a pimple is coming, and that seems to help as well:-) It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> This tool kills the bacteria before it has a chance to form into a pimple, unlike other acne zapping gadgets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. I can definitely feel the tingling deep into the layers of my skin, so much so that I have to avoid some places around my chin and nose.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s made a difference in my acne, however.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and update this review when I see a definite difference.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE skin care product! You will NOT be disappointed in the amazing results you achieve with this hand-held Oxyderm!</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing all the positive reviews,  and I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking brighter and healthier when I use it consistently.  When i feel (cystic) acne coming on I use it in the spot and it works great as a preventative.  If I fail to do it,  and it has snuck out,  using it helps clear it up in a matter of a day or two rather than it hanging around for weeks.  I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this product and would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that when you start it should be done at the lowest setting and then gradually work your way up.  I have sensitive skin and I seem to get the best results at a 2 so I don&#x27;t go any higher than that.  Also, make sure your face is clean and dry and go in circular motions- for the acne you have to &amp;#34;spot zap&amp;#34; it.  There are youtube videos which help demonstrate.</li>
