      <li>Well made, protective tips, nice addition to hair care tools collection.  </li>
      <li>effectively detangle and style my monster hair.  </li>
      <li>nice.</li>
      <li>it did and this pick came in handy.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality pick, perfect for lifting your hair and blending parts/sections from braid outs or roller sets.</li>
      <li>This type of pick is very easy on the scalp and lifts the hair as desired.</li>
      <li>perfect, changed my 10 year old afro wearing son&#x27;s life.  </li>
      <li>My favorite pick and the best pick I have owned so far, I&#x27;m planning to get one or two more</li>
      <li>i need to order like three more.</li>
      <li>I am so glad we found this pick.  </li>
      <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite pick.</li>
      <li>Because it is longer than most picks, combing is easier.  </li>
      <li>I love the way the tines are heavier than most hair lifts...</li>
      <li>I might buy a couple more</li>
      <li>Most of the time, it stays in purse/ backpack so that I have it nearby when needed.</li>
      <li>and I love the coating on the ends so that it doesn&#x27;t stick in my hair or pull the strands of hair when I go to remove the tool.</li>
      <li>are great for hair longer than 3 inches and is great for thick hair like mine.</li>
      <li>The metal poles come out easily as well.</li>
      <li>but this glided through easily</li>
      <li>Most certainly worth your money.</li>
      <li>The Diane Fan Pick glides through the hair smoothly and provides the lift that you seek from a pick.  </li>
      <li>and I agree, gentle on my hair, nice comb, I will tell people and show them the comb.</li>
      <li>This pick is fantastic and it never gets caught in my hair or hurts my scalp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy; I don&#x27;t forsee it breaking any time soon :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;The quality is on par with the original fan picks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad this product&#x27;s about hair and not silly pride that can be offensive to others.</li>
      <li>love the comb, it is gentle on the hair, I bought two and gave one the my older son who&#x27;s hair is just awesome and is down almost to his waist</li>
      <li>i have a giant afro, its amazingly helpful</li>
      <li>the black tips you see in the picture is nothing more than cheap paint that comes of EXTREMELY easily once you scratch it or put it in your hair.</li>
      <li>:) its good the black tips would fade a little but its still nice to use to pick out your hair.</li>
      <li>big problem, the black-painted-tip for the pick is cheap and peels after a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;The metal underneath the paint is just fine, so it still works</li>
      <li>The handle&#x27;s exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>With that said, I like that this has good length (about an inch shorter than the conventional metal \\&quot;Black Fist\\&quot; picks), has great width for larger afros, and is durable.</li>
      <li>The design actually picks much better than straight picks.</li>
      <li>And most importantly its the only pick with the length and geometry necessary to comfortablyand</li>
      <li>one thing I liked about this one as opposed to the others I&#x27;ve used would be the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;black power fist\\&quot; as the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For an individual with long, afro hair, a good pick makes all the difference to styling/detangling.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t expect my hair to grow so fast, but</li>
      <li>It really is well made.</li>
      <li>The pins (bristles) are holding very well in the plastic grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This makes absolutely no sense and will keep me from ordering more.</li>
      <li>Makes the task off blowing out your Afro much quicker.</li>
      <li>Compared to the old plastic picks I&#x27;m used too this actually works better.  </li>
      <li>The only thing (a small gripe at best) that I found discouraging is that the plastic coating on the tips wears away quickly; this however is a minor setback as the teeth are rounded at the ends, and therefore not sharp to begin with.</li>
      <li>It is large and not hard to misplace or lose.  </li>
      <li>May have to get a few more.  </li>
      <li>Long metal picks arranged in the fan style are superior to short metal picks or regular metal picks in the &amp;#34;square style&amp;#34; if you have long hair or a large afro.</li>
      <li>You will not be disappointed I surely was not!!!</li>
      <li>, this thing is so large It only fits in my cargo pants.</li>
      <li>I use it to lift and conceal the parts in my natural twist-out hair style.</li>
      <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely was worth every single penny.</li>
      <li>I recently went natural this year</li>
      <li>I have big natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how long picks are supposed to last, but I am going to buy a few more to save for later.</li>
      <li>I had to mention durability, because there is nothing more frustrating than having a metal pick, and in the midst of combing your hair, the metal teeth begin to come out.</li>
      <li>The black tips are essentially useless, but all in all, the pick does a great job.</li>
      <li>I am a little skeptical about all things manufactured in China, but this seems like a great product.</li>
      <li>I recently ordered a Diane 12 count fan pick, and I have to say that I was a little worried if it was going to have the same quality as some of the older ones I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s almost identical with the exception that the ends are coated with a smooth black substance to prevent injuring yourself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and ive used dozens of picks in my decade of having long (six inches when held straight,  usually been an afro) very curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing my hair natural in an Afro and it has gotten too long for a regular pick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Im a mixed but predominantly  black male and ive used dozens of picks in my decade of having long (six inches when held straight,  usually been an afro) very curly hair. The build is tough and the tines arent pieces of crap glued into holes on the handle. And most importantly its the only pick with the length and geometry necessary to comfortablyand effectively detangle and style my monster hair.  Im writing this review well over a year into owning this product and i can say from a durability standpoint no different than the day i bought it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;12 Count&amp;#34; refers to the number of individual picks on the fan, which is misleading and isn&#x27;t used as a way to count the size of a pick anywhere else. You&#x27;ll only receive 1.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to get a metal tooth pick because of prior bad experiences with pulling.  However, based on the reviews this pick received, and my interest in the fan shape, I decided to take a chance.  I am glad that I made this purchase because this pick does a great job.  The teeth are coated, which eliminates the pulling and instances of getting stuck in the hair as you attempt to prevent breakage and pain.  The Diane Fan Pick glides through the hair smoothly and provides the lift that you seek from a pick.  I recommend this item and will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This does the trick. I have thin curly hair and this gives me lift right at the root. Just what I bought it for. If you want to go really big with your hair or get a picked brush out look this will do the trick!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PICK I HAVE EVER USED, MY AFRO LOOKS FIERCE WHEN I USE THIS PICK! THANK YOU :D</li>
    <li> Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A metal pick for people with afros like me. The metal is fairly flexible and rust proof. The ends of the teeth are rubber to avoid scrapping your scalp. It is fairly big so you shouldn&#x27;t carry it around in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice. It gets the job done and the rubber teeth don&#x27;t scrape or hurt. It has been months and there are no signs of deterioration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A+</li>
    <li> Well made, protective tips, nice addition to hair care tools collection.  I use it to lift and conceal the parts in my natural twist-out hair style. It was a good price and shipped timely.</li>
    <li> Says twelve Count....only one in the order. needs to be updated, this is misleading, ordered because i thought it was going to be an amazing deal</li>
    <li> It met my requirements... so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will last for a long time and not lose any of the teeth.</li>
    <li> I love the way the tines are heavier than most hair lifts...I have very thick, heavy hair and end up bending the tines to most hair lift items. This one is really solid and I love the coating on the ends so that it doesn&#x27;t stick in my hair or pull the strands of hair when I go to remove the tool. This is great!</li>
    <li> My husband is great a losing all his picks all the time!!!  I am so glad we found this pick.  It is large and not hard to misplace or lose.  May have to get a few more.  The kids want one too, smiles.</li>
    <li> perfect, changed my 10 year old afro wearing son&#x27;s life.  i need to order like three more.</li>
    <li> Compared to the old plastic picks I&#x27;m used too this actually works better.  The design actually picks much better than straight picks. Makes the task off blowing out your Afro much quicker. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.  Because it is longer than most picks, combing is easier.  The black color on the tips seems unnecessary.  The black color comes off with handling and use but this doesn&#x27;t appear to affect performance.  This is my son&#x27;s favorite pick.</li>
    <li> Please change this title from &amp;quot;12 Count&amp;quot; to 12 rods or 12 spokes, even. There are not 12 picks with this purchase. There is one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, however. The black tips are essentially useless, but all in all, the pick does a great job.</li>
    <li> I love this pick! Most of the time, it stays in purse/ backpack so that I have it nearby when needed. I use it to add volume to my braid and twist outs. Be careful to ONLY pick at your roots, or else you&#x27;ll end up will less definition and/ or frizz. It&#x27;s pretty sturdy; I don&#x27;t forsee it breaking any time soon :)</li>
    <li> looks like picture. haven&#x27;t lost any teeth in the pick so far and it doesn&#x27;t scratch my scalp too hard</li>
    <li> i have a giant afro, its amazingly helpful</li>
    <li> the black tips you see in the picture is nothing more than cheap paint that comes of EXTREMELY easily once you scratch it or put it in your hair. The metal poles come out easily as well. Can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good at-home afro-pick, not for travel.&lt;br /&gt;One big problem, the black-painted-tip for the pick is cheap and peels after a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;The metal underneath the paint is just fine, so it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;But when the paint peels, you will find black paint flecks in your afro.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this thing is so large It only fits in my cargo pants.</li>
    <li> My favorite pick and the best pick I have owned so far, I&#x27;m planning to get one or two more</li>
    <li> Does the job as hoped.  Great pick.</li>
    <li> love the comb, it is gentle on the hair, I bought two and gave one the my older son who&#x27;s hair is just awesome and is down almost to his waist and he loves the way it does&#x27;nt pull his hair and I have long hair and I agree, gentle on my hair, nice comb, I will tell people and show them the comb.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Coating&amp;#34; on the tips comes off within 3 days of use</li>
    <li> very good hair pic, good for my type of hair for afro&#x27;s :) its good the black tips would fade a little but its still nice to use to pick out your hair.</li>
    <li> I would just like to say that these picks are great. I have brough picks through this company for a long time becauze they picks are great for hair longer than 3 inches and is great for thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing my hair natural in an Afro and it has gotten too long for a regular pick. I needed a pick like what I saw my barber using. This was it.</li>
    <li> Works great. You will not be disappointed I surely was not!!! Definitely was worth every single penny. I might buy a couple more</li>
    <li> Someone suggested that i get a pick to elongate my 3C/4A textured hair that shrinks when wet. But I don&#x27;t quite understand how ti use this for that purpose. However, it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I have really thick natural hair that is in the &amp;#34;awkward stage&amp;#34;. I usually have a hard time picking my hair but this glided through easily and my fro looks amazing.</li>
    <li> misleading title here, I just opened the sleeve it was shipped in...one pick.....too late to file a complaint, damn my package hoarding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly losing combs so I usually purchase bulk quantities.  I held off ordering a bunch of these until I could confirm the quality.  This might be the best afro pick I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The flared design detangles my kinky hair in a way no comb has ever done.  The rubber tips prevent scalp scarring.  My only complaint is the shipping costs.  Order one and the shipping cost is $1.99.  Order 10 and the shipping costs balloon to $19.95.  It&#x27;s as if each comb is being shipped in a separate shipment (they&#x27;re not).  This makes absolutely no sense and will keep me from ordering more.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a Diane 12 count fan pick, and I have to say that I was a little worried if it was going to have the same quality as some of the older ones I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s almost identical with the exception that the ends are coated with a smooth black substance to prevent injuring yourself.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is on par with the original fan picks. The handle&#x27;s exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I liked about this one as opposed to the others I&#x27;ve used would be the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;black power fist\\&quot; as the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this product&#x27;s about hair and not silly pride that can be offensive to others. I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I have big natural hair.  My last pick was plastic and I started to notice breakage at my roots because the plastic pick had seams. This pick is fantastic and it never gets caught in my hair or hurts my scalp.</li>
    <li> Metal picks are superior to plastic picks. Long metal picks arranged in the fan style are superior to short metal picks or regular metal picks in the &amp;#34;square style&amp;#34; if you have long hair or a large afro. My afro looks best when I use this Diane Large Fan pick.</li>
    <li> This type of pick is very easy on the scalp and lifts the hair as desired. It really is well made.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality pick, perfect for lifting your hair and blending parts/sections from braid outs or roller sets. The ends are coated and it just works great!</li>
    <li> Although I like the Pick, as soon as I started using it the black protective ends disappeared immediately.  Therefore, the reason I purchased the Pick (for the protective ends) didn&#x27;t serve its purpose.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I waited a month to write this review to ensure durability. I have a pretty thick afro at 4.5&amp;#34; long and bushy. This pick is showing only minimal signs of wear, i.e. the black plastic tips (seem only cosmetic). The pins (bristles) are holding very well in the plastic grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my friends (less than a week old) black fist pick and broke two pins (bristles) after 35-40 strokes. I am a little skeptical about all things manufactured in China, but this seems like a great product. I don&#x27;t know how long picks are supposed to last, but I am going to buy a few more to save for later. I paid $9. Great deal! $2.50/pick and $4 s/h.</li>
    <li> I recently went natural this year and I didn&#x27;t expect my hair to grow so fast, but it did and this pick came in handy. It&#x27;s really nicely spaced so I can effectively comb my hair without fear of breakage.</li>
    <li> For an individual with long, afro hair, a good pick makes all the difference to styling/detangling. With that said, I like that this has good length (about an inch shorter than the conventional metal \\&quot;Black Fist\\&quot; picks), has great width for larger afros, and is durable. I had to mention durability, because there is nothing more frustrating than having a metal pick, and in the midst of combing your hair, the metal teeth begin to come out. The only thing (a small gripe at best) that I found discouraging is that the plastic coating on the tips wears away quickly; this however is a minor setback as the teeth are rounded at the ends, and therefore not sharp to begin with. Most certainly worth your money.</li>
