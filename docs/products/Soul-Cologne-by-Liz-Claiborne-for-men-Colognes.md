<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the price was great and this scent smells very good</li>
    <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments on the smell of this cologne. I had never heard of it, or smelled it before ordering. I asked a friend one day for some good scents, and this is one that she had mentioned. It is inexpensive for the quantity I would say. I like the smell of it also, I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Fast, quick delivery. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this for my ex when we were together . But he liked it anyway and wants more. But he has to buy his own now. Over all the real deal. Small bottle but it was a tester.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this fragrance and wears it for an every day after shave. Six more words are required of me.</li>
    <li> Changing tastes-- I now find this cologne a bit harsh, and have heard the same from a friend.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this I get compliments left and right! It starts off sweet in the morning and gets better towards the end on the day with a leathery musk smell  :)  hella worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He usually likes the original curve scent. But we wanted to try something new. So I got him this. I cannot stop sniffing my husband. Incredibly manly smell, sexy. If you want a great cologne for your husband or boyfriend, I would highly recommend this. Although, be warned... you may have random people coming up to you trying to sniff you :)</li>
    <li> Great product.. Fast shipping. I would definitely buy again.</li>

    <li> This is it. The scent I have been looking/smelling for. I finally found it. After trying Curve, cool water, D&amp;G, Paco Roman. I can see myself wearing this one everyday as my signature scent. I can smell the woodsy and spice, but more of the sweet leather scent. Also this got here next day. Be sure to check where you buy and if the seller is local you can expect it sooner than later. Again, this is an awesome cologne one that is now my staple and signature scent. Now I am going to buy a bigger bottle because I got a 1.7oz for my to keep with me everywhere I go. The bigger one is to stay in my collection.</li>
