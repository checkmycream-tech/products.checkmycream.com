<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great and not so great. I love this product, I really love the way the matte looks. But, it works terribly under water! It gets white and slimy and I really don&#x27;t like it at that state.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great matte top coat.</li>
    <li> I am going through a matte phase..i love matte makeup, lipstick, and now nails..I was amazed at how a topcoat could totally transform your nails into something new and different..love the product and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Makes my polish flake off and chip so easily.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly and as described, thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> This was exactly the color I was looking.</li>
    <li> I love this matte top coat! It works great and looks amazing. I would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> Super Fast Delivery, The Price of the Product is Nice and The Product is Awesome! For me is the best Matte Top Coat! 100% Recommended this seller!</li>
    <li> I love this so much! It does a amazing matte top coat on any nail polish! It dries fast too! Its worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Best of all the matte top coats!</li>
    <li> I love this matte top coat the only thing is it lasts probably 2 days. It starts to chip and crack very easly. I used it with my OPI trend on ten set, really brings out the colors!</li>
    <li> Fast drying, quick shipping and does what it&#x27;s bought to do :) Will recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Exact look that I am looking for on my nails!!</li>
    <li> Received broken bottle.</li>
    <li> it is so matte.  i don&#x27;t know if I really like it but it does what it promises.  It is super matt and it&#x27;s is OPI  which is always good.</li>
    <li> Fun polish.  Makes any color look different.  Drys quick and looks good.</li>
    <li> I really do like this top coat, but it does not stay on very long. It&#x27;s stays matted for a bout 4 days.</li>
    <li> I have tried this over a few kinds of nail polish (OPI, Sally Hansen, Revlon, Rimmel, Nicole, &amp; Nails Inc.).  Regardless of the kind of polish I use, when I put this top coat on, it pulls the color off my nails, &amp; then the brush gets stained.  Thus, unless I run out of nail polish remover,  this stuff is useless.</li>
    <li> great, looks like i have a leather finish, love it</li>
    <li> Matte finish doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
    <li> This matte top coat is seriously amazing! I love the look of white nails but I felt a glossy finish just wasn&#x27;t doing it so I decided to give this OPI matte top coat a try. I am so happy I did because the results are beautiful! It dried super quick and the gives your nails a classic matte look! It&#x27;s amazing and every one should own a bottle :)</li>
    <li> Love how matte my nail polish looks!</li>
    <li> Works great! I use this polish primarily to get that matte black nail polish look that&#x27;s so popular these days. 2 coats needed for an overall even look.</li>
    <li> Gift for sister. She enjoyed it; seems to work perfectly well, I saw it after two days of wear and there was no issue with chipping or wear.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It made all my nail polish matte!</li>
    <li> Better than all the other matte top coats i&#x27;ve used on my nails (UO brand, essie, etc).</li>
    <li> Love the matte polish for the first few days but it does turn the polish back shiny soon.</li>
    <li> It fall down when i open it and it was broken!!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Funny to put just a matte tip on a shiny nail!</li>
    <li> works really well, but shows all the flaws in your paint job</li>
    <li> Bottle was half empty and the rest was old think jelly-like substance. It went from the package straight to the garbage.</li>
    <li> Perfectly turns nail polish Matte - absolutely love how it looks!  Provides something different than the typical shiny top coat!</li>
    <li> This nail polish did what&#x27;s stated and lasted a lot longer than I thought it would, I&#x27;m super happy to add it to my collection!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for the new trend in nail polish. It doesn&#x27;t alter the matte color and look of matte nail polish. I love the new look. I have had manicures and pedicures for many years and came across the Zoya matte color line. Now I alternate between the two looks. The matte colors chip more easily so a matte top coat is essential. These new products are easy to touch up and then use top coat to finish the repair. I love change and Zoya has good, intense true colors. It doesn&#x27;t thicken and need replacement.  It lasts a long time, all Opi and Zoya nail products. Worth the few extra dollars to have high quality nail polish and top coat to protect your color.</li>
    <li> Arrived pretty fast can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> This works GREAT!! I would recommend it to anyone ! It dries fast and is definitely matte :) I love it and will purchase again in the future .</li>
    <li> Great product one of the best Matte Top Coats on the market. I used Butter London Matte Top Coat for quite awhile but the $18 price tag for it kept me from wanting to buy another bottle. OPI&#x27;s Matte Top Coat is just as great and half the price</li>
    <li> Love love love this matte top coat. Definitely does the job and well. Best of all it does not take FOREVER to dry like most top coats I have bought.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t last as long as glossy polish, but definitely lasts longer than any other matte topcoat I&#x27;ve used. Use it over glitter, ice, holo, jellies for some amazing depth and blingy effects! Added a photo of what OPI Matte Top Coat looks like over one coat of Wet &#x27;n Wild Hallucinate. Looks like natural nails with a subtle rainbow sparkle!</li>
    <li> I have never tried this before but glad I did. I absolutely love it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this matte!! I recently had one from China glaze and when it would dry it would look streaky and I didn&#x27;t like it at all so I gave up on matte top coats. But buying this one was not a mistake, it smooths out on its own and looks perfect and even. I love it!! Definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and in great condition! works really well as a matte top coat!</li>
    <li> This stuff s AMAZING!!!! Actually, amazing doesn&#x27;t even cut it! I LOVE this matte coat. It looks so beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Came a day late, but was absolutely worth it! It was wrapped very nicely and securely and the bottle hadn&#x27;t broken!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MATTE TOP COAT!  It came fast, and its great.  It does as it says.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. The shiping was good too and packaged well it also came a WHOLE day before it was supposed to. The matte top coat works really good and drys really fast. Mine drys in like 30 seconds so i got everything i wanted and even better than what i expected</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to take forever to arrive but it got here so fast and it was neatly packed. I love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> When I got the product it was broken and they don&#x27;t accept returns for this! I didn&#x27;t want to have to order it again but I did, its a gift now a late one.</li>
    <li> The best matte top coat ever.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the &amp;#34;takes forever to dry&amp;#34; issue other people have had - for me, this achieves the matte effect and dries very quickly. You do have to work quickly and cleanly to avoid visible streaks, but on the flip side, I find that this top coat does a good job of hiding flaws in the original polish. The effect starts to noticeably wear off after 3-4 days, but it&#x27;s gradual, so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re suddenly back to a typical glossy finish on Day 5. As a bonus, this makes my polish much more durable and chip-resistant than what I usually get with my fast-dry OPI and Essie top coats (though that could just be saying something about those other top coats).</li>
    <li> Amazing dries quickly and only needs one coat no reapplying it</li>
    <li> Great topcoat. Just remembert that it takes long to completely dry.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, totally works! It even dry&#x27;s quickly, and that&#x27;s a plus. Totally worth  the money! (;</li>
    <li> Dries pretty fast! I love this matte top coat. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> My nails came nice. Only takes one  Coat to Matte !</li>
    <li> My daughter was so happy to have a good matte top coat.  She loves it and lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I love OPI and the matte finish, it works instantly. However, I feel as though the polish doesn&#x27;t last as long with this top coat, maybe it&#x27;s just me? I still like it though.</li>
    <li> The top coat dries very quickly but matte manicures don&#x27;t last very long and they crack, it&#x27;s noticable with light colors but other than that, perfect! Must buy</li>
    <li> Not a look I like, but my daughter does.</li>
    <li> love this nail polish! super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth and looks great :)</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love matte! And OPI is by far the best nail polish brand</li>
    <li> Ok. When I ordered this stuff I was very excited to try it. Who doesn&#x27;t love a matte look every once in a while? So I watched a couple YouTube videos on how to apply &amp; was psyched about it. Until I tried it. I used an Essie undercoat, waited until my nails were completely dry before painting the OPI matte nail top coat. And it looked really cool. For about an hour. The stuff made my normally very long-wearing Essie polish (Turquoise in Caicos ) chip like the Dickens. I mean it looked like a week-old manicure in a matter of hours. So. In my opinion, not worth it unless you have time to redo your nails every day. (I don&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> Love the matte finish!!</li>
    <li> great for a man&#x27;s manicure, or if you just want a natural nail look</li>
    <li> This is a true Matte top coat!!! I&#x27;ve tried China Glaze, Essie, and Orly versions of matte top and this one is definitely the best performing one in terms of transforming a polish into a matte finish. I&#x27;d say it takes quite awhile to dry fully, though. I guess I&#x27;m used to fast-dry top coats.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged, goes on matte just like it says!</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish it&#x27;s my favorite brand! It dries quickly and smooth and gives a matte finish to any nail polish.  Definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> Good product n seller. it met my expectations</li>
