    <li> This perfumed powder exceeds my expectations! Love it!</li>
    <li> No talc and a very light but not overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells so good!!</li>
    <li> Lovely container.  I used this as a gift for my mother-in-law who doesn&#x27;t like to wear perfume, but likes scented powder.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave this to me for Christmas and I love it so much I am ordering another as I ran out.  It is a very subtle fragrance so I can dust it on before I go to bed &amp; it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm my senses.  I am sensitive to fragrances but I love them &amp; wear them all the time.  I have not tried the spray fragrance yet but if it smells as beautiful I will be wearing it all summer.  It is a light &amp; powdery floral scent.  The puff is very fluffy &amp; will outlast the product.</li>
    <li> I love the scent...so light and airy. I now have made this a part of my morning and evening routine!</li>
    <li> I am so very happy with the gel and now the powder. I feel refreshed and wonderfully calm whenever i use the gel or powder.</li>
    <li> Powder is not a lubricant. That is why opening this box becomes a very strenuous job. Spilled a lot powder while I was struggling with tight lid. May be I am too finicky?</li>
    <li> I use this every day, and just love it.  No talc to breathe in and a gentle scent.  I&#x27;ll look for this again.</li>

    <li> Love everything about this powder except the fact that the wonderful scent does not last on the body</li>
    <li> Love this product .. Wish I could have afforded to buy more than one</li>
    <li> Nothing special but has a pleasant odor to it. Definitely overpriced for the amount of powder.</li>
    <li> This is my least favorite lollia scent. It&#x27;s strong. Just too in love with the others.</li>
    <li> i love the fragrance and the rice powder, feels so great on skin in the summer time here in the humid south...best i have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;and no talc.....</li>
