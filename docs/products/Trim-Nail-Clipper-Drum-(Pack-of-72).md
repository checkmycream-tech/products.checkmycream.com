      <li>They are very well made and a great value for the price.  </li>
      <li>I was able to cut seven of my fingernails before the clippers broke.</li>

      <li>Im ready to drop $20 on a good pair.</li>
      <li>Most of them had mismatched \\&quot;teeth\\&quot;, so you couldn&#x27;t get a clean cut.  </li>
      <li>They all worked just fine, the components worked and the quality is just fine.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t mind because they were so cheap.</li>
      <li>I bought this pack because it was cheap.</li>

      <li>so you cant get a clean cut across the nail either.</li>

      <li>Good Deal, Just Not That Sharp</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m proud that we used these - people deserve good things when they are down, not cheap stuff.  </li>
      <li>right here!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>These clippers were exactly what we needed.  </li>
      <li>but I took one off the top, the middle and at the bottom.</li>
      <li>These are reasonable quality and very inexpensive when purchased by the half-gross.</li>
      <li>Bought the whole set and they suck.</li>
      <li>Nice and heavy with file &amp; chain.  </li>
      <li>I was unaware that they were ever made in Korea, my good old made in USA Trim lasted so long.</li>
      <li>The only con is there is a bar code label on each one which I am sure is for a store to use if they want to sell one individually.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and shipped very fast!</li>
      <li>He is a clipper addiction, needs them right next to him at all times.</li>
      <li>These seem to be the only clippers that feel right.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend if needed for a large project.</li>

      <li>Only this model use decent material.</li>
      <li>fifteen year old Trim clipper had a nice, sharp cutting edge, a fulcrum post hole that didn&#x27;t catch the lever and a rivet hole that allowed the clippers to freely rotate.  </li>
      <li>These clippers are exactly what I expected Thank You</li>
      <li>so I needed to buy some new ones recently.  </li>
      <li>I finally found an old set and then the difference was clear...</li>
      <li>rivet hole is too small to fit on a standard keychain and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It seems most, if not all, positive reviews involve giving, NOT using, these clippers. I have to agree with the critical reviews. the Chinese made clippers are made of thinner metal and not adequately tempered. I was unaware that they were ever made in Korea, my good old made in USA Trim lasted so long. I used it as a multi-tool, screwdriver, wire stripper, you name it. When I lost it, it was like mourning the loss of an old friend.  I had bought a new one sometime earlier as a hedge against such an event, but when I opened and used it I felt betrayed, the lever was loose, fell apart while using it, couldn&#x27;t insert my nails in the narrow slot, couldn&#x27;t cut cleanly.  Cheap piece of crap! Fool me once, I won&#x27;t make that mistake again!</li>
    <li> Yo. Quit searching for nail clippers in your house and buy this. Then spread them around like the flu so every time you ever start to think &amp;#34;I need a pair of nail--DANG here&#x27;s some clippers right here!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These seem to be the only clippers that feel right.  More expensive clippers don&#x27;t trim as well and feel too big.  Buy a drum of 72 and you will be set for life, and you will have solved your stocking stuffer dilemma!</li>
    <li> Came quickley and just what I wanted. For bags to be distributed during diaster relief.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack because it was cheap. I think it was less than $20 at the time of my original purchase. I was worried because for such a low price, the quality might be bad. Thusfar though, I&#x27;ve used about 10 of these and have experienced no problem with the clippers. I got such a large number because my house has a bunch of occupants at the moment. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find a nail clipper. I figured with so many nail clippers, it should be easy to locate one in the future.  Every room could have more than a couple nail clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are made of metal. They are fairly small. They are each about the size of a woman&#x27;s pinky.  Because they are tiny, they may be harder to clip nails with. I don&#x27;t mind because they were so cheap. They do the task.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy.  So I would say for the price and for the purpose which I intended them for, they fit the bill. I would recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> I gave this large container of clippers to my husband a few years ago. He is a clipper addiction, needs them right next to him at all times. He loved this gift</li>
    <li> These clippers were exactly what we needed.  We could buy them locally but they were at least a dollar a piece. We use these to make health kits for Lutheran World Relief. These were great.  They are very well made and a great value for the price.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was looking for bulk items for a local nursing home these fit the bill. They were exactly what I was looking for and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Trim brand fingernail clippers for over 30 years.  They used to be the only brand worth buying: very inexpensive and excellent quality.  Clippers mysteriously disappear over time (kids borrowing them, falling out of my pocket when I pull my keys out, etc) so I needed to buy some new ones recently.  I had to buy over 10 sets before I found one that worked correctly.  Most of them had mismatched \\&quot;teeth\\&quot;, so you couldn&#x27;t get a clean cut.  After finally finding a few passable sets, I had accumulated around 20 sets that were junk.  I boxed them up and sent them back to the manufacturer.  I finally found an old set and then the difference was clear...these used to be made in Korea, now they are made in China.  Unfortunately, Trim has lost a lifelong customer until and unless they start making a quality product again.</li>
    <li> Nail clippers are like socks, they disappear into a perpetual black hole never to be see again.  This drum of clippers has solved my problem (for at least 6 mos).  Now I have not got to the bottom of the drum but I took one off the top, the middle and at the bottom. They all worked just fine, the components worked and the quality is just fine. The only con is there is a bar code label on each one which I am sure is for a store to use if they want to sell one individually.  No big deal gives me something to work on when I am sitting in another boring staff meeting or lecture at school.  I give this product an A+</li>
    <li> They are being used for personal care kits that are going to Lutheran World Relief and they were at a good price</li>
    <li> Total crap. Won&#x27;t cut worth a damn. Bought the whole set and they suck. Trim used to be the go to brand, they were well made. Not anymore. Don&#x27;t waste your money. If you hit up the junk shops, buy an old US made one if you can find it. This is depressing. Where can I get a good nail clipper now?</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for a church charity project and bought in bulk.  This is the best value I have found and Trim is a name brand I would trust.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy with file &amp; chain.  We purchased these for health kits for people who have gone thorough disasters.  I&#x27;m proud that we used these - people deserve good things when they are down, not cheap stuff.  We will buy these again.</li>
    <li> That are some 12 year tha I bought one clipper like this. It cuts very well, with good finishing. Recently have been occured rust spots. I already bought 2 other \\&quot;non-TRIM\\&quot; clippers...It was loose of money. Only this model cuts in a satisfatory way. Only this model use decent material. It do not bend when you are cuttinf, like other clippes do. It do not leaves bad trimmed edges on the nail. I&#x27;m looking for this one to buy it again...</li>
    <li> I get these every few years just to keep my 35-year old son supplied with nail clippers.  He loses them all the time, but can&#x27;t be without them.  These are reasonable quality and very inexpensive when purchased by the half-gross.</li>
    <li> Fifteen years ago these would be five star clippers but now they&#x27;re terrible.  I bought a Trim nail clipper at a drug store recently and it has several problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting edge is dull so it mashes my nails instead of cutting through them cleanly even when clipping nails fresh out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hole for the fulcrum post is too wide (or the fulcrum post is too narrow) so the corners of the lever sometimes get stuck when rotating the lever from storage to use positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rivet hole is too small to fit on a standard keychain and freely rotate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fifteen year old Trim clipper had a nice, sharp cutting edge, a fulcrum post hole that didn&#x27;t catch the lever and a rivet hole that allowed the clippers to freely rotate.  Unfortunately after fifteen years on a keychain the rivet ring has come loose so I can no longer keep them on my keychain.</li>
    <li> Very good size but not the best quality clipper, not very sharp</li>
    <li> After less that three months of home use these clipper were so dull that they failed to cut... the only satisfaction I got was when I heard the &#x27;thud&#x27; as they fell in the wastebasket.  NOT recommended.</li>
    <li> These clippers are exactly what I expected Thank You</li>
    <li> Nail clipper are of good value, quality and great price. Used in care packages for disaster or storm victims. Thank you</li>
    <li> I got tired of misplacing nail clippers, so I bought this drum.  I would say 95% of the clippers are fully functional.  Every once in a while, you get a dud.  No matter - at this price, that is fine.  I actually figured that there would be duds anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do feel slightly cheaper than what I have observed with Trim clippers when bought in smaller quantities though.</li>
    <li> The nail clipper are great.  Just what I needed for a project I was working on.  I would definitely recommend if needed for a large project.</li>
    <li> I bought a pair of these at the grocery store the other day--and they suck. I was able to cut seven of my fingernails before the clippers broke. I think that Trim must be using much cheaper metals than they have in the past. This is the third pair of Trim clippers that have given out on me in a short while. I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> They seem to be okay but it&#x27;s sad that we haven&#x27;t made these in the US for some years.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t cut they are dull and they rip your nails, they are tiny so you cant get a clean cut across the nail either. I wont even buy anything from trim again. I&#x27;m so frustrated Im ready to drop $20 on a good pair.</li>
    <li> These used to be at every cash register. You can&#x27;t find them anymore! So when I found these I bought a &amp;#34;Tub&amp;#34; of 72 , I have been giving them away to everybody I know.  And I get the same reaction! I CAN&#x27;T FIND THESE ANYWHERE!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good Deal, Just Not That Sharp</li>
    <li> Ordered these for stocking stuffers and they will work perfectly. Are actually nicer then I thought they would be so that&#x27;s a plus too!</li>
    <li> we were assembling health kits and my church and these were perfect for them and a great value for the money</li>
    <li> I chose this nail clipper to use at a Men&#x27;s Conference at our church. All men like to have clippers. I bought a tiny plastic bag and put the clipper in and then stapled it to a gospel tract and put one at each seat. They were a hit. Good products.</li>
