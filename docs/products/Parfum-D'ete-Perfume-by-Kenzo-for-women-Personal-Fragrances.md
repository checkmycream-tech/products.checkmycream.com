      <li>I was very excited.</li>
      <li>that does not smell like the nice original turquoise packagEd fragrance that you are accustomed to and</li>
      <li>I bought the travel pack while we were on a cruise and my wife loved it so much I bought her more of the Kenzo line.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite scent for spring and summer!  </li>
      <li>Light floral fragrance with notes of lily of the valley, forest flowers and morning dew.</li>
      <li>Anyway, imagine walking through a botanical garden, in the Spring, after a light rain.</li>
      <li>I like the light floral smell which transports me to a floral garden in springtime.</li>
      <li>Light, clean, and springy...always puts a smile on my face and is not overpowering:)</li>
      <li>For whatever reason this does not smell like the original fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is unique.</li>

      <li>but mostly it&#x27;s just a clean, pleasant, green scent.  </li>

      <li>Thank you very much i appreciate it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance she likes my wife very much</li>
      <li>and I consistently get compliments for it.</li>

      <li>the smell (not fragrance) really makes you wonder what is in the bottle?!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny it is not better-known.  </li>
      <li>Those who love this fragrance will constantly acquire it.</li>
      <li>I pride myself in being able to have someone do a double take when I walk by and ask \\&quot;Oh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and soft, very feminine.</li>
      <li>So for half the money you get some kind</li>

      <li>If you are looking for something basic that smells nice with no real Wow Factor, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But with this one everyone guesses (VERY wrong, may I add lol) becauses it smells so familiar.</li>
      <li>Hard to find in retail stores - this is my favorite perfume!</li>

    <li> I like this product. It is smell wonderful and girls love it! my girl like it so much . Thank you very much i appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes ,love Kenzo perfumes they are always nice but are hard to get .Love that I can get Kenzo on Amazon</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite scent for spring and summer!  Buy with no hesitation if you like a fresh floral scent.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> didnt like the smelling at all, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t like sharp smelling...all is nice is just the bottle design nothing else...</li>
    <li> Light floral fragrance with notes of lily of the valley, forest flowers and morning dew. In addition, the flavor is very stable and perfectly uplifting in cold rainy days: a few clicks and you feel the breath of summer! Those who love this fragrance will constantly acquire it. Now this fragrance is difficult to buy in many countries, but it is on Amazon and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> As always my fragrance arrived as stated and very well protected to prevent breakage. The fragrance is still the same as my first bottle 16 years ago. Not a heavy fragrance but one that I have received compliments on after having on for several hours.</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife - she loves it and me too!</li>
    <li> When I was in Paris, I was in Gallerie Lafayette.   That was many years ago, and there for the first time I whiffed this particular fragrance.  Had to buy it for it always brings Paris back to me.. It is appropriately named for the season.  I use it with the soap and body cream, and it is lovely on a summer day.  Good staying power.  Original bottle was absolutely gorgeous - Sort of Lalique.  Pity they changed the bottle - lucky they did not touch the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this so much I will reorder over and over again, the best in the whole world, smells so good</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I wore it on my wedding day.  So fresh and clean smelling.  I wear this scent all year round but find myself reaching for it more during warmer weather seasons.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years and its hard to find. When I saw it on Amazon I was very excited. I did notice new packaging but thought nothing of it. I won&#x27;t say it isn&#x27;t authentic but I will say that it doesn&#x27;t smell like what I am used to. I was disappointed to have spent so much money.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason this does not smell like the original fragrance.  So for half the money you get some kind of unsettling oder that does not smell like the nice original turquoise packagEd fragrance that you are accustomed to and the smell (not fragrance) really makes you wonder what is in the bottle?! P U!</li>
    <li> This is may favorite perfume and it can be a bit hard to track down at retail stores. The convenience of having it arrive on my doorstep in lieu of having to search it out made it all worth it. Smells wonderful and I get so many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I bought the travel pack while we were on a cruise and my wife loved it so much I bought her more of the Kenzo line. The only place I could find this D&#x27;ete was on Amazon. Thank you again for having hard to find items.</li>
    <li> The fragrance she likes my wife very much</li>
    <li> Although this fragrance can no longer be found in stores, well thank goodness it can be found online! Light, clean, and springy...always puts a smile on my face and is not overpowering:)</li>
    <li> Delicious parfum!!!! Very recommended</li>
    <li> Wife has been wearing this fragrance for years.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  She loves this!!  Came super quick too.  Just in time for her birthday.</li>
    <li> I adore Kenzo D&#x27;ete and am so happy that I can still find it online (have not found any stores that still carry it).</li>
    <li> This is one of the highest quality fragrances out there. No heavy acids or alcohol are apparent. The beautiful fragrance lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Summer. Floral. Not the usual bouquet. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments about this fragrance. A keeper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this parfume off and on for more years than I can remember. It&#x27;s so light and soft, very feminine. I always get tons of compliments when I wear it. Definitely does not over power and scream: \\&quot;Here I am\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> just what the wife wanted</li>
    <li> This perfume is a winner with me.  It&#x27;s funny it is not better-known.  Kenzo&#x27;s &amp;#34;Flower&amp;#34; perfume really had its day in the sun and I remember when every other woman seemed to wear it, but I&#x27;ve always preferred D&#x27;ete, which is a subtle, green, clean, fresh scent.  I&#x27;ve never found a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; scent that beats this.  It almost has the essence of a sprouting violet to me--there&#x27;s a hint of something floral but mostly it&#x27;s just a clean, pleasant, green scent.  I sometimes layer this with either citrus or deeper floral scents to perk them up a little.</li>
    <li> Have worn this for years - it is the best.  Have had compliments from the worker putting frozen food into the freezer to people in the elevator and the men in my office.  No complaints about being too strong!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, excellent service</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance.  I wore this many, many years ago and was happy to be able to find it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been anticipating the purchase of this perfume for SO long. Once I got it...hmm. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all; I just feel as if I had smelled it before...a long time ago. The primary reason Kenzo is my all time favorite fragrance is because of how great they are at being unique. I pride myself in being able to have someone do a double take when I walk by and ask \\&quot;Oh my goodness, what is that beautiful scent?\\&quot;. But with this one everyone guesses (VERY wrong, may I add lol) becauses it smells so familiar. Like I said, it isn&#x27;t a bad scent. Very light and summery...it just doesn&#x27;t fit my desire for something different. If you are looking for something basic that smells nice with no real Wow Factor, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: MAY 2, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I am suddenly in love with this scent! It must have grown on me; at one point I was only wearing it for work and then I found myself wearing it when I went out and about. Have you ever randomly caught a whiff of yourself and was pleasantly caught off guard? Like \\&quot;wow, is that me?!\\&quot;? That&#x27;s how it happened lol I think the difference with this one is spraying it on your skin when you&#x27;re fresh out the shower versus just spraying it on your clothes. Anyway, imagine walking through a botanical garden, in the Spring, after a light rain. That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it&#x27;s aroma and it&#x27;s absolutely lovely. I hope this update provides better insight than the initial one did; I&#x27;m sorry I ever doubted you, Kenzo! lol</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and glad found</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Been using it for years. I always get asked what perfume I&#x27;m wearing when I wear it as people always comment on how beautiful it smells.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely perfume and I consistently get compliments for it. I like the light floral smell which transports me to a floral garden in springtime. Hard to find in retail stores - this is my favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Wanted something for daytime wear. Smells like outdoors on a spring day after the rain.  Bottle design is unique too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gf, and she loved it. It smells some sort of jasmine flower, and the perfume definitely hard to find. I would really recommend this item for the ladies who like flowery scents.</li>
    <li> One of the only scents that smells good always . My wife loves it  i love it.  I guess thats all that matters.</li>
    <li> HARD TO FIND ITEM. WAS VERY PLEASED THAT YOU HAD IT PRICE WAS GREAT.</li>
</ol>
