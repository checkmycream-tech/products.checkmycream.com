      <li>It comes out very quick and you dont need very much to cover your face.</li>
      <li>So, if you have sensitive skin or break out easily to products, this stuff is easy on your skin and comes right off if you wash your face.</li>
      <li>This is a nice facial tanner, recommend</li>

      <li>, I have seem to break out a bit more lately, not sure if its because the product is oily or if I&#x27;m just sensitive.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical due to the brand at first, but it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>The color of the lotion is white, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting bronze streaks in a deeper color in certain places.</li>
      <li>It gives you a natural look and doesn&#x27;t dye your skin an organgey color.</li>
      <li>not smelly, leaves your face soft and gets it tan</li>

      <li>A little goes a long ways with this, goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>I have used a couple facial lotions in the past and by far this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It was apparent they mixed it with something else.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toss up between this and Faces,  which I&#x27;ve used for years. Pleasant smell, good results. And I like the fact this lotion is white and has no cosmetic bronzer that streak.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t care for this! Works well for others just not me!</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin. Never caused me to breat out and was truly unscented.</li>
    <li> This has helped my face so much! Usually I have problems matching my face but It is handled now!</li>
    <li> Will not use anything for my face to tan with.. goes on smooth. not smelly, leaves your face soft and gets it tan.. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to earn 5 stars.  No breakouts so that&#x27;s a plus. It Smells alright no fragrance in this product</li>
    <li> I normally have a much lighter face then the rest of my body but this lotion is great! My face is close to my body color and leaves no Streaks, it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer! Alittle fine size does ALOT!</li>
    <li> I bought this and it was delivered to my house within about 2 days with standard 3-5 day shipping. I love this stuff. Nothing else will tan my face and this does wonders. I love that it is hypo allergenic. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my face breaking out after using it. The color of the lotion is white, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting bronze streaks in a deeper color in certain places. ITS AMAZING and it ships FAST!</li>
    <li> smells good and works really well in an indoor tanning bed, minimal oily residue</li>
    <li> This one didn&#x27;t really do much for me but its was a great moisturizer. :)</li>
    <li> I have  been using this product for almost a week and its great! I usually have 1-3 pimples which hasn&#x27;t change  since  I have  been using this, and it doesn&#x27;t have scent so leaves  my face feeling clean and really evens out the tan all over</li>
    <li> Always have had problems tanning my face, this is great for us pale faced people who need their face to match the rest of their body. Recommend for sure!!</li>
    <li> The bottle in the picture looks much larger than what you receive. I mean I paid for shipping and handling on a product Im sure they paid a quarter to send. Its small and not  worth the 18 dollars I paid for it. I thought it was sunless tanner too because thats what the product information said, but come to find out, I need a tanning bed to even use this product. its complete crap if you ask me. save your money.</li>
    <li> Really did do anything for me. But the product got here on time</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial tanner, recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once and it instantly tanned my face. It states fragrance free, however, it does have a slight scent. The only negative about this was how long the shipping took. I ordered it and received it 9 days later even though it said 3-5 business days. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Look at the ounces. Thought it would be bigger but a little goes along way.</li>
    <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever ordered off of amazon. Do not buy! It was apparent they mixed it with something else. The lotion itself smelled like straight nicotine. As soon as a put it on I smelled like a carton of cigarettes. The smell wouldnt come off either. It didn&#x27;t do a thing for coloration. My face was just clogged and irritated after the second time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ordered Luminary for face instead. Worst product I have ever come into contact with. Do not buy. At least not from the buyer I did.</li>
    <li> Love playboy lotions !! I&#x27;ve used this twice and see wonderful results !! Will use again !!! Recommend everyone to use this !! Leaves my face soft and smooth !!</li>
    <li> Wife does really seem to b liking this product a lot. So if u r looking for a product like this 4 your wife then look no further than here. This is the gift 4 u ..... could get u out of a bind as well. Nothing like bribing with gifts. Good product</li>
    <li> I have used a couple facial lotions in the past and by far this one is my favorite. It does not have a scent to it, so if you have somewhere to go after you tan then this one will not make you smell awful. This lotion also doesn&#x27;t break out my skin like some facial bronzers will do. So, if you have sensitive skin or break out easily to products, this stuff is easy on your skin and comes right off if you wash your face. Boost has really made my face darker to where my face almost matches the rest of the color on my body, but not to where it looks funny like a cartoon character. It gives you a natural look and doesn&#x27;t dye your skin an organgey color. I will definitely continue to buy and stay a customer. I am completely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It comes out very quick and you dont need very much to cover your face. I have been using it for a week now and my face is finally as tan as my body I love it!!</li>
    <li> Threw This Away After The 2nd Use...I Could Not Get Over The Smell. It Had A Vinegar &amp; Pickle Juice Smell. Seriously!</li>
    <li> Did not like the facial tanner. It didn&#x27;t smell the best and it caused my face to breakout.</li>
    <li> I have only had this about 1 month &amp; I tan 2 times a week, I have seem to break out a bit more lately, not sure if its because the product is oily or if I&#x27;m just sensitive. ( but it says sensitive on the bottle)</li>
    <li> Love the scent. And a little goes a very long way! On my super sensitive skin, this caused no breakouts.,</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t break you out like a lot of indoor tanning face creams. This is affordable &amp; is surprisingly my favorite yet. I was skeptical due to the brand at first, but it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t smell good, waste of money saw no difference.</li>
    <li> it is a ok tanning product.</li>
    <li> Came with the sealed cap. Love this face lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good. It smells like tanning lotion like fake tan. Would give 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the smell. A little goes a long ways with this, goes on very smoothly. Makes my face tanner than other facial tanning lotions. Yay! Great for if you need to get out of a plateau.</li>
    <li> I love this! It evens my face out with the rest of my body and I never burn! I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion today for the first time and got great results. I only tanned for 10 minutes and saw a difference! I&#x27;ll be buying it again in the future!</li>
