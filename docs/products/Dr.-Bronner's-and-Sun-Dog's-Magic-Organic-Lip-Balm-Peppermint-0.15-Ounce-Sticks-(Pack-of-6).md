      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
      <li>This is the best lip balm I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>But, it tastes good and seems to help my chapped lips!</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this brand!</li>
      <li>This is a great product as are all the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Smells great and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>The peppermint feels great.</li>
      <li>I keep ordering it because it is a great product</li>
      <li>It has a great peppermint scent &amp; taste as well.</li>
      <li>I do re-apply it throughout the day, but it is mostly because I like the shiny look it leaves and the great scent.</li>
      <li>This balm has become my favorite after buying every lip balm on the market!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
      <li>love anything by Dr Bronner&#x27;s and love that it&#x27;s organic too!</li>
      <li>Realizing that everything we use on our lips we end up ingesting, I began looking for an effective and safe lip balm.</li>
      <li>It is smooth, and healthy!</li>
      <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is perfect.....effective, safe &amp; organic/fair trade ingredients.</li>
      <li>and I love that it contains no added toxic stuff.</li>
      <li>and I truly love it.</li>
      <li>I like the scent of this a lot more.</li>
      <li>Bought a 6 pack of this and love it.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite chapstick.</li>
      <li>I love the peppermint</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price and the 6 pack bundle should last through even the coldest winter.</li>
      <li>Love this lip balm...</li>
      <li>It applies more easily than Burt&#x27;s under cold-weather conditions, and seems to sink in a bit more.  </li>
      <li>My son, who has struggled with dry lips in the winter, agrees this is the best product!  </li>
      <li>First of all, I use Dr Bronners liquid and bar soap and they are amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fine with it - it does what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>Light sheen, smooth--not waxy.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, stays on for a long time, great taste and smell.</li>
      <li>Clean peppermint, not tingly.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite lip balm!</li>
      <li>It also has staying power - even after drinking my coffee or a full glass of water.  </li>
      <li>I bought a 6 pack here for $18.86 ($3.14 each) which is a great deal compared to eBay &amp; other online sites.</li>
      <li>The lemon-lime was very mild and didn&#x27;t really have much scent at all.</li>
      <li>This is my current favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>Since the last time I bought it, Bonner&#x27;s changed the formula so there is more Avocado than Jojoba oil.</li>
      <li>In any case I find it much easier to use than the cheap stuff like Chapstick which barely applies at all (and is full of chemicals</li>
      <li>I went from Alba coconut (which is natural, smells good, tastes okay for the times I accidentally taste it, but applies super thick) to the orange ginger version of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which I thought smelled kind of bad (not awful - and the taste was okay) to the peppermint version.</li>
      <li>Then again I was never huge on the smell of ginger (taste is fine), so it makes sense that I&#x27;d like this one more.</li>
      <li>used to be able to buy this in my local Whole Foods, now I can&#x27;t find anyone in town who carries it, that&#x27;s why I bought it via Amazon.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need very much and it lasts for a long time and makes your lips look smooth and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I feel comfortable allowing my toddler to use when he sees me putting it on.</li>
      <li>The Chapstick goes on smooth, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it is greasy (leaves residue on all cups)</li>
      <li>This lip balm works about as well as most of the other thousands of lip balms out there.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The new formula coats thinner, and doesn&#x27;t feel as hydrating as the older one.</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely; not thick, sticky or waxy.  </li>
      <li>When I put it on, the balm was a nice thick coat.</li>
      <li>Expensive, but 3 or 4 of these a year (for bath, bag, kitchen drawer) is most cost effective than trying new ones that do not meet my expectations and pushing them to back of drawer.</li>
      <li>The product has the true peppermint flavor many of us like, rather than some of the other weird &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavors that come out more like menthol.  </li>
      <li>But initially it seemed pretty moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>quickly - might have been because we were using them so much or because there is less in each container than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
      <li>I have had a hard time finding Dr Bronner&#x27;s &amp; Sun Dog&#x27;s Magic Organic Lip Balm in stores with regularity.</li>
      <li>The scents I&#x27;ve used thus far: peppermint, lavender, almond, and tea tree.</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona and use it year around because of the very dry air.</li>
      <li>I will probably buy it again just because, from what I&#x27;ve seen, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are truly organic and all natural, while many other beauty products are advertised as organic simply because they have a few organic ingredients mixed in with the usual chemicals.</li>

<li> We live in remote upper Michigan and ur environment makes our lips really dry.  </li>
<li> The next on my list is citrus, but it will be a while because the 32oz bottles last for a long time (depending on how generous</li>
<li> I like the long lasting minty fragrance.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not some miracle, apply it once and never have dry lips again,</li>
<li> The peppermint is not overpowering, just enough to feel soothing after a heavy practice session&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I wish the company would have stuck with the other version.</li>
<li> I had this in the past and had bought an entire box.</li>
<li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this balm, it leaves a shiny, slightly greasy, wet look to your lips which I like.</li>
<li> I hate most peppermint things, such as hard candy, bath products &amp; the like, but this was a pleasing surprise.</li>

<li> Was pretty disappointed, especially as shipping was not free.</li>
<li> I even contacted them a few days before Christmas, but they offered no help, explanation, or apology.  </li>
<li> It also lasts quite a while on my lips but after using it for a few weeks, off and on, it seems to be drying out my lips.  </li>
<li> My whole life I&#x27;ve used Mentholatum on my lips - until my sister told me menthol is bad.</li>
<li> Absolutely no more dry/chapped/cracked lips in this house anymore.  </li>
<li> It is much better than nothing... or that nasty tasting chapstick.</li>
<li> the chapstick, it is really soft and doesnt have a bad taste at all, but I use chapstick when my lips are CHAP.</li>
<li> I feel like it applies a bit thicker than the orange ginger version, but not as thick as Alba.</li>
<li> There is the essence of mint - very subtle.  </li>
<li> I absolutely hated the ginger scent, it smelled nasty &amp; had a strange taste as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this lip balm...I keep ordering it because it is a great product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! It is smooth, and healthy! I used to use Burts Bees but when I found this one, I switched and never going back.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lip balm! Goes on smooth, stays on for a long time, great taste and smell. I have been using this product for over 2 years now and nothing compares!</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding Dr Bronner&#x27;s &amp; Sun Dog&#x27;s Magic Organic Lip Balm in stores with regularity. This is a must have item in my household at all times. I am very to happy to have a box of 12.</li>
    <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve used Mentholatum on my lips - until my sister told me menthol is bad. :-( So after using Dr Bonner&#x27;s soap, I decided to try the lip balm. I&#x27;m fine with it - it does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> The only saving grace for this product is that it is certified organic. I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and recently found this so I wanted to try it. It felt like I was putting Olive Oil on my lips and there is NO peppermint flavor at all. It does not stay on, so I am reapplying it constantly unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.    I will never buy this again, nor can I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, it&#x27;s excellent. You can&#x27;t go wrong with organic oils and lovely peppermint. It&#x27;s the only thing I feel comfortable allowing my toddler to use when he sees me putting it on.</li>
    <li> My daughter order a half dozen of these lip balms because they were recommended to her.  We live in remote upper Michigan and ur environment makes our lips really dry.  She shared them with her family and I truly love it.</li>
    <li> This balm has become my favorite after buying every lip balm on the market! I purchased the lemon-lime, ginger &amp; peppermint as any lip junkie would do. I absolutely hated the ginger scent, it smelled nasty &amp; had a strange taste as well. The lemon-lime was very mild and didn&#x27;t really have much scent at all. I hate most peppermint things, such as hard candy, bath products &amp; the like, but this was a pleasing surprise. It has a great peppermint scent &amp; taste as well. Not that I eat it, but I have a tendency to bite my lips. If you haven&#x27;t tried this balm, it leaves a shiny, slightly greasy, wet look to your lips which I like. This is not your typical waxy feeling &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34;. I do re-apply it throughout the day, but it is mostly because I like the shiny look it leaves and the great scent. I bought a 6 pack here for $18.86 ($3.14 each) which is a great deal compared to eBay &amp; other online sites. Very pleased with this brand!</li>
    <li> Silky smooth, natural goodness, flavors are not cloyingly fake, and an affordable price....what else could you want?  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a trusted name, and one that I always keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Light sheen, smooth--not waxy. Clean peppermint, not tingly. Expensive, but 3 or 4 of these a year (for bath, bag, kitchen drawer) is most cost effective than trying new ones that do not meet my expectations and pushing them to back of drawer.</li>
    <li> The peppermint feels great.</li>
    <li> This lip balm works about as well as most of the other thousands of lip balms out there. I like it but it&#x27;s not some miracle, apply it once and never have dry lips again, best thing I&#x27;ve ever used lip balm like some of the reviews on here say. I like the peppermint smell and a tube seems to last me quite awhile. I will probably buy it again just because, from what I&#x27;ve seen, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are truly organic and all natural, while many other beauty products are advertised as organic simply because they have a few organic ingredients mixed in with the usual chemicals.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! Realizing that everything we use on our lips we end up ingesting, I began looking for an effective and safe lip balm. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is perfect.....effective, safe &amp; organic/fair trade ingredients. Amazon has the best price and the 6 pack bundle should last through even the coldest winter. I live in Arizona and use it year around because of the very dry air. This is a great product as are all the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give the product itself 5 stars and the seller 2-3, so the rating is a compromise.  The product has the true peppermint flavor many of us like, rather than some of the other weird &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavors that come out more like menthol.  It applies more easily than Burt&#x27;s under cold-weather conditions, and seems to sink in a bit more.  I prefer it to Burt&#x27;s at the same price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a bunch of them one month ahead of time for Christmas, and they did not make it.  The seller gave me no kind of warning or notification that the shipment was delayed for ten days at one point in-transit.  I even contacted them a few days before Christmas, but they offered no help, explanation, or apology.  Was pretty disappointed, especially as shipping was not free.</li>
    <li> I wanted an organic Chapstick, as I tend to eat it off my lips (without trying). I thought the price was unbeatable for 6 sticks! The Chapstick goes on smooth, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it is greasy (leaves residue on all cups) and I have to reapply often. But, it tastes good and seems to help my chapped lips! I would likely buy again.</li>
    <li> First of all, I use Dr Bronners liquid and bar soap and they are amazing. The scents I&#x27;ve used thus far: peppermint, lavender, almond, and tea tree. The next on my list is citrus, but it will be a while because the 32oz bottles last for a long time (depending on how generous you get).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the chapstick, it is really soft and doesnt have a bad taste at all, but I use chapstick when my lips are CHAP. This did not help de-chap my lips in a expedited manner. I will still use it, since i bought 6 of them, but it will not be my go to chapstick when my lips are in pain, unless its my only choice. It is much better than nothing... or that nasty tasting chapstick.</li>
    <li> I had this in the past and had bought an entire box. When I put it on, the balm was a nice thick coat. I ran out, and bought this batch. Since the last time I bought it, Bonner&#x27;s changed the formula so there is more Avocado than Jojoba oil. The new formula coats thinner, and doesn&#x27;t feel as hydrating as the older one. I wish the company would have stuck with the other version.</li>
    <li> This is the best chapstick I have ever used. You don&#x27;t need very much and it lasts for a long time and makes your lips look smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love anything by Dr Bronner&#x27;s and love that it&#x27;s organic too!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand and flavor of chapstick I use. I bought it in bulk as I have to have a tube in my backpack, my purse, on my desk at work and in my room. Smells great and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite lip balm. I went from Alba coconut (which is natural, smells good, tastes okay for the times I accidentally taste it, but applies super thick) to the orange ginger version of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which I thought smelled kind of bad (not awful - and the taste was okay) to the peppermint version. I like the scent of this a lot more. Then again I was never huge on the smell of ginger (taste is fine), so it makes sense that I&#x27;d like this one more. I feel like it applies a bit thicker than the orange ginger version, but not as thick as Alba. In any case I find it much easier to use than the cheap stuff like Chapstick which barely applies at all (and is full of chemicals I don&#x27;t want).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I don&#x27;t have any intentions of even trying a different product unless this one becomes unavailable.</li>
    <li> I play a brass instrument, and I like this lip balm for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It isn&#x27;t waxy.  I can put it on and not stick to the mouthpiece.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The peppermint is not overpowering, just enough to feel soothing after a heavy practice session&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to buy this in my local Whole Foods, now I can&#x27;t find anyone in town who carries it, that&#x27;s why I bought it via Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite chapstick. I love the peppermint and I love that it contains no added toxic stuff.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t use this, but my wife LOVES them, I get her a dozen every year for her christmas stocking.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used!  It goes on nicely; not thick, sticky or waxy.  There is the essence of mint - very subtle.  It is healing, softening and smooths your lips.  It also has staying power - even after drinking my coffee or a full glass of water.  My son, who has struggled with dry lips in the winter, agrees this is the best product!  Absolutely no more dry/chapped/cracked lips in this house anymore.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like the long lasting minty fragrance.  It also lasts quite a while on my lips but after using it for a few weeks, off and on, it seems to be drying out my lips.  But initially it seemed pretty moisturizing.  I am experimenting by switching between two different lip balms before giving up on this product.  The best thing is the minty fragrance.</li>
    <li> I keep chapstick everywhere.  Bought a 6 pack of this and love it.  It&#x27;s minty but not menthol-like so it doesn&#x27;t sting.  I feel like I got to the bottom of the container quickly - might have been because we were using them so much or because there is less in each container than I&#x27;m used to.  Recommended!</li>
