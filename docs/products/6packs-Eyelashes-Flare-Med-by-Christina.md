    <li> These are a great quality..  These individual lashes are  the best ones for this price. very well packed and the shipping was fast. I like this quality instead of the 10pack they come with a top on them so that they won&#x27;t get damaged the 10pack does not. I always order the 10pack sometime they came bent or squashed so I prefer the six pack.  I hope this review help all my diva. # love my individual Eyelashes!!!!!!!!</li>
