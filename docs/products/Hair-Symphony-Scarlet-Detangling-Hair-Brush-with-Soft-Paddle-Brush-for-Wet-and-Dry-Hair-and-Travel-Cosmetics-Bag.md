<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received these brushes today , and I must say I was so impressed . The one brush really does what is claims to do. I tried it and my hair does get very tangled , it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paddle brush is designed for professional salons for dry or wet hair is no problem for this large paddle brush.Great comfort for scalp thanks to the cushion that allows the nylon pins to glide through the natural flow of your hair.The second brush safely removes knots or tangles with its flexible and carefully aligned pins that easily glide through any type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more hair loss or broken hair by rearranging the split ends and removing dead hair, having a regenerating role on hair.Kids will also love it as they will not have to bear the pains of a comb pulling on their hair and damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both these brushes work amazingly and are very attractive to boot they also come with a very attractive carrying case.I highly recommend these brushes to have for all your needs , I will not buy any other kind of brushes again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is a very attractive little brush I love the colorful bristles ad it is very comfortable to hold . There is also a added bonus of a mirror on the underside of the brush .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>

When you have long hair it can hurt like everything to brush it wet or dry. So, I was happy when I got the chance to review this brush set by Hair Symphony.The detangling brush glides so easily over my hair without breaking it. It even works great on my daughters hair as it is long and thick. The paddle brush is used by my husband as he is not as tender headed. It does a great job at brushing his hair and lets say the brush is sturdy to. We have a issue with my husband being ruff with his brushes and breaking the handles. So far, the Hair Symphony Paddle Brush has held up!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;The paddle brush is just a normal brush but I really love it...&lt;br /&gt;Now i&#x27;m impressed with the Detangling brush I have really long,thick and curly hair so every brush I had pulled my hair or just took me forever to untangle my hair. I absolutely hated untangling my hair it was a nightmare,but with the brush it doesn&#x27;t pull and it doesn&#x27;t hurt when I brush through the tangle bits in my hair. One big thing this brush doesn&#x27;t do is pull huge pieces of hair off my head I was getting scared one day I would end up bald :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> A great set of Hair Symphony Scarlet Detangling Hair Brush and Soft Paddle Hair Brush for Wet and Dry Hair. Works wonderfully on getting out the tangles and making your hair quite smooth. Plus the brushes come in a nice Travel Cosmetics Bag. Which is a nice bonus. This would be perfect for a gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 hairbrushes you receive are loved and appreciated by both women and men, kids and teenagers. You get a salon quality large paddle brush, the innovative scarlet detangling brush and the travel cosmetics bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Soft GRIP satin finish&lt;br /&gt;• Easily DETANGLE any type of hair&lt;br /&gt;• NO MORE PAIN while brushing&lt;br /&gt;• Easy to use on WET or DRY hair&lt;br /&gt;• Convenient storage in you FREE elegant COSMETICS BAG&lt;br /&gt;• EUROPEAN design high quality SALON grade hairbrushes&lt;br /&gt;• You will IMMEDIATELY see an IMPROVEMENT in the way your hair looks and feels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Great hairbrush set! They come in a great quality carrying bag, I was pleasantly surprised by it all when it arrived. Both of the brushes are great for detangling. They work well for me and my little girl. I love how they dont pull out our hair, even when its wet.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I am on a journey to reach healthier hair, and for some reason I never stopped to think that half of my hair problems might be a result from the brush that I was using. I recently started using this brush set from Hair Symphony, and I am very pleased so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the detangler brush on my damp hair. It is gentle enough for me to use on my hair when it is damp, and doesn&#x27;t break my hair, or pull on my hair. I also use this brush when I have tangles in my hair that I just can&#x27;t work out. The design of the brush makes it easy to hold and it also gives you a nice secure grip. I have used brushes like these in the past, however they all didn&#x27;t have handles on them, so using them could be tricky at times. This one is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the paddle brush, I use that on dry hair. It is large enough to cover a good amount of my hair in one swipe. Like the detangler brush, it is gentle on my hair, and doesn&#x27;t break or pull. This easily glides through my hair, and if there are any minor tangles, it safely eliminates them all with no pulling or pain. This brush works really well for spreading product around through my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final thing that I love about this set is that it comes with its own carrying case, big enough to hold both brushes at the same time. This is great for keeping your brushes clean, plus it makes travelling with them so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down I am very pleased with the Hair Symphony brush set, and give them my full recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> My 2 daughters hate it when I comb their hair because no matter how gentle I am, their hair are all tangled up specially when they step out of the shower. They would often complain when I comb their hair but that&#x27;s before I found out about detangling hair brushes. Hair symphony sent me their detangling hair brush and soft paddle brush to try and I was excited to see if the detangling brush works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hair Symphony Scarlet Detangling Hair Brush Set arrived in a black pouch which is nice so that I can also bring these on the go. The large black paddle brush is wide enough to cover a lot of surface hair area in one stroke. I like the handle which is very easy to grip and hold. It&#x27;s light as well so my daughters can use it on their own if they wanted to comb their hair themselves. The bristles are also smooth and doesn&#x27;t scrape the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample to try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.&lt;br /&gt;The red detangling brush is probably my favorite because it minimizes the pain of combing through tangled hair. My daughters still close their eyes when I use this on their hair but according to them (they&#x27;re 4 and 6), it&#x27;s much more better than a regular comb/brush. The bristles of the detangling brush is different in such a way that it&#x27;s like thin silicon strips with various lengths to ensure that the hair is detangled easier and in a less painful way. My daughters always asks me to use this instead of other comb/brushes on their hairso  I think it is effective in lessening the process of combing through their tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the handle for the detangling brush is shorter, it&#x27;s still comfortable to use and I like how my daughters don&#x27;t complain as much as when I use a regular comb. It&#x27;s effective and I like how kid-friendly this is.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive these brushes complementary for review in return for my honest opinion. The set comes in a cute black travel cosmetics bag and there is 2 brushes: Detangler and a Paddle brus.  First, these brushes looks very nice and they are very vell made.  I use the detangler brush on my damp hair. It is gentle enough for me to use on my hair when it is damp, and doesn&#x27;t break my hair, or pull on my hair. I also use this brush when I have tangles in my hair that I just can&#x27;t work out. The design of the brush makes it easy to hold and it also gives you a nice secure grip. For the paddle brush, I use that on dry hair. It is large enough to cover a good amount of my hair in one swipe. Like the detangler brush, it is gentle on my hair, and doesn&#x27;t break or pull. This easily glides through my hair, and if there are any minor tangles, it safely eliminates them all with no pulling or pain.&lt;br /&gt;I really like these two brushes and actually my son likes the red detangler brush a lot, his hair is not long or anything like that but he has super sensitive scalp so it&#x27;s a perfect everyday brush for him.</li>
    <li> I thought the Hair Symphony detangling hair brush and paddle brush set was great. The brush set comes in it&#x27;s own little bag which is great for traveling so your bristles don&#x27;t get damaged by or caught on other things in your duffle bag. It is also great for storage to keep your brushes clean from dust. I also had plenty of room to throw in my bobby pins and hair ties to keep them all together .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detangling brush is a nice contour shape that is perfect for a good hand grip. It fits comfortably in your hand and is sturdy when brushing through tangles. Trying to brush out tangles by holding a long handled brush does not give you the leverage that this does. The detangling brush worked great to get the tangles from my damp hair straight out of the shower but was very gently and did not break my hair. It also works great on dry bed head hair when I first get up. There is no need to brush with a lot of pressure. The flexible and multi sized bristles seem to do the job with very little effort and actually feel great on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the tangles are out, the paddle brush glides through my hair. I love the soft comfortable bristles that do not scrape my head. The paddle brush is also very easy to clean out the stray hairs after use. I just took a wide tooth comb and ran it through the flexible bristles and then cleaned the brush in warm water. I did this gently to make sure not to damage the round tips of the bristles, although they seem very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes provide a good non slip grip and feel comfortable and natural in my hand. I would recommend this detangling and paddle brush set if you have tangle issues or long hard to manage hair. It would also make a great gift for a girl or longer haired guy with it&#x27;s bold black and red colors and black storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Hair Symphone detangling hair brush and paddle brush set at a discount for testing.The review is 100% my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a hair type and I love it on my curls, and it&#x27;s great on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well and she&#x27;s a toddler.  I&#x27;ve only used the small orange detangle brush on both of our hair however... The paddle brush is typical so suppose that would work as expected</li>
    <li> Love, Love, love! these brushes!  Thanks! Sincerely, Dixie</li>
    <li> This detangling hair brush works really well on wet hair.  This brush lets me help the little one with her tangles without causing a big fuss.  She is very tender headed and hates to see a brush anywhere near her.  This brush lets me be gentle without pulling on those tangles she always has, I don&#x27;t even know how a little one can get so many tangles.  This brush set is really nice and it comes with it&#x27;s own carrying case too.  I like the paddle brush and so does my wife.  I&#x27;m glad we received this set to evaluate, test and review.</li>
    <li> I have extentions in my hair and wanted a wet and dry brush.  I ordered this set and the red paddle brush is great and I use it a lot.  The black brush doesn&#x27;t work as great.  The bristles are stiffer I think.  They are both quality brushes and I&#x27;d order the red one again.  It would have been great to get them individually.</li>
    <li> The detangling hairbrush still gets caught in curly hair, but definitely way better than other products. The duo is awesome, and the carrying case is perfect for traveling. Very easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for straight hair, there are no issues with it.</li>
    <li> This hair brush set comes with a paddle brush, a detangler brush and a cute bag to carry both in. On first use with the paddle brush I honestly think the brush is too big. It&#x27;s too wide and hardly any of the bristles in the brush actually touch the hair on my head. The detangler brush though is fantastic! I like its pretty shape and color and it easily glides through hair.  My hair is long and any amount of movement from just moving while sleeping to swimming to the wind blowing my hair around easily causes tangles. Most brushes pull hair when brushing it and just makes it hurt. This detangler brush is gentle and easily gets the knots out. This would be great for someone who is traveling, especially if they were involved in something active to get their hair back to great shape after their activity.  A few years ago I participated in competitive cheerleading and because I&#x27;m small was always the person thrown in the air. This set would have been perfect for those days to comb through all the mess after being thrown around and moving so much.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> The main brush i bought this for is cheap. Wont know for sure how great it works till we use it on wet hair, The big brush does seem fine,</li>
    <li> I love both of them, my 3 year-old daughter and I use them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this detangling brush. I&#x27;m transitioning and this tool allows me to detangle my thicker roots without tearing out the permed hair!!  Thumbs up for sure!!</li>
    <li> I love this combination detangling brush set from Hair Symphony! I bought a detangling brush for my daughter for her birthday a few months back and let me just say they work very well! No more snags in her hair, and pulling and hair breakage! Nice and smooth brushing. She likes to brush her hair wet, as most of us do, but the hair stylists caution against it due to breakage. With the detangling brush have no fear, smooth brush strokes and no more snagging!&lt;br /&gt;The flat paddle brush is a new favorite of mine as well. Works very well on long hair. Smooth and just glides so nicely through my hair!&lt;br /&gt;This duo comes nicely packed in a zippered bag. Great for travel or storage.&lt;br /&gt;Mine had a strong odor from the plastic packaging of the brushes and then being confined to the zippered bag, but once I aired them out they were just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I saw the promotional offer on this product so I too can now have tangle free hair with ease! Highly recommend. Brushes are well made and light weight!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on Amazon. It&#x27;s rare that I write reviews period. Something has to really impress me - either in a good way or a bad one - for me to consider taking the time to write a review. To say that I was amazed by this brush set is almost an understatement. Anyhow, here&#x27;s my review, and I hope that it&#x27;s both helpful and informative to anyone who&#x27;s on the fence about purchasing this brush set as I first was before taking a chance on purchasing this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, this is the BEST brush set I&#x27;ve EVER used. I just got it in the mail today and got through using it about ten minutes ago. My hair is down to the bottom of my butt, fine, thick, and VERY curly with a tendency to tangle like nobody&#x27;s business. Generally speaking, I have to take a detangling comb to it about three times a day in order to keep up with the tangles that form in it. Most brushes just can&#x27;t keep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detangling brush in this set outperformed both the Tangle Teezer and the one by Michel Mercier (sp?). The Tangle Teezer used to be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brush and does a fairly decent job. I&#x27;ll probably keep it in my gym bag from now on. The Mercier (sp?) was a waste of time and money and I think there&#x27;s nothing but a lot of hype behind it. This detangler didn&#x27;t pull or tug, but beautifully worked out the knots, snarls, and tangles. It didn&#x27;t matter if I started from the top or the bottom with brushing, either (though, seriously, for the health of your hair, always start from the bottom and work your way up!), the results were amazing either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the paddle brush, which I used after working out all the tangles with the detangling brush, it&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used that was so comfortable! I can see myself easily using it for a very, very long time. Even my roommate was impressed with how well it performed - to the point where it looks as thought this one is either going to be permanently borrowed or I&#x27;m going to have to order another set in order to keep the peace. Actually, I&#x27;ll likely end up purchasing two more sets - one for my gym bag (the Tangle Teezer is probably going to be a fall back brush from now on, poor Tangle Teezer!) and one for my roommate. And I&#x27;ll likely get a few more sets near Christmas to give out as gifts, for that matter.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The detangler is a God send for my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Brush bristles came bent and smashed in. it works like any other brush. Felt kind of cheaply made. But I am too lazy to return it. I&#x27;m just going to keep it for emergencies or for travel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after hearing great things about these detangling brushes. Unfortunately, when the package came it didn&#x27;t contain the actual detangling brush, just the second brush and bag. However I left a review about it and the company quickly sent me a second set. It arrived yesterday (on time) and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use the brush. My hair is pretty long, it goes past the small of my back, and this brush does a fantastic job of untangling without pulling out hairs or causing breakages. I&#x27;ve tried it so far on my hair both wet and dry, and it works just as well either way. I can only say good things about this company and their product, so if you&#x27;re in the market for a detangling brush, look no further!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST brush for little girls who have wavy and curly hair like my 9 year old Granddaughter.  Every time I brushed her hair she tole me I was hurting her!  Not any more with this brush!!!  Its a must have!!!!</li>
    <li> This set of hair brushes is very nice. They came packaged in a nice zipper storage bag. The storage bag came in handy for a quick weekend trip. I was able to bring my new brushes along and put my hair ties and comb in the bag as well. I have long thick hair. I have to brush my hair often. I go through brushes. I often wear out the bristles on the brushes I use. I need a brush that is durable and can last through heavy use. I brush my hair before going to bed and still wake up to a tangled mess. I love that I can use the detangler brush to get the knots and tangles out without damaging my hair. I can then use the paddle brush to smooth out my hair and brush my hair like normal. I find that my hair appears smoother when I use the paddle brush. I also use the detangler brush on my girls who hate having their hair brushed because their hair tangles easily too. With the detangler brush I’m able to brush their hair without them ending up in tears. I love these brushes. I can tell that they are quality brushes. The bristles are strong and sturdy and seem to be standing up to my continued use. They look like the type of brush my hairdresser uses. I like the detangler brush but I really love the paddle brush. I think the paddle brush is perfect for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Poor quality paddle hairbrush. Arrived damaged. Cheap bristles. I like the detangler brush however. Would not recommend. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the detangler brush. Would not recommend purchasing and will still have to buy another hairbrush.</li>
    <li> I love both brushes! They work great so far. And they feel nice on my head.</li>
    <li> The combs work very well.  One small gripe is that for the square shaped brush, the part containing the brush teeth tore off.  It was fixed in less than 5 minutes with super glue though, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it then since.</li>
    <li> Dad that has to do the little ones hair says thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> It really does detangle your hair without too much pain.  I usually use it when my hair is dry, but I&#x27;ve used it when it was wet and it worked fine as well.</li>
    <li> A really nice set. These brushes are nicely made and come with a case. I especially like the paddle brush. Doesn&#x27;t pull and tug on my hair like most brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter does a lot if hair brushing... 4-5 days a week she smoothed out her hair to be pony tail or bun ready for the dance studio. I was given the opportunity to test and try these brushes; I gave them straight to her. She likes both but loves the detangling brush best. She has medium thick , mid back length hair. That&#x27;s a lot of hair to smooth for dance! It&#x27;s nice that these brushes have their own carry case so she can throw them right into her dance bag.  She gives this set 2 thumbs up! Great set of brushes, great value. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The bristles start to wear out early</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the paddle brush, the bristle part comes off the brush if your hair is tangled. It seems it should be attached somehow but is not so you have to be careful when using it.</li>
    <li> I have owned of these hairbrushes for less than two months at first I love them. Then while using the standard hairbrush The entire set of bristles popped out. For me this is a big deal I have long hair and one little snag shouldn&#x27;t be a problem therefore I would not recommend the standard hairbrush but that detangling brush works quite well.</li>
    <li> (SENT FROM THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO ME)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for the feedback! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say how happy I am your girlfriend likes the brushes! It really means a lot to us, being at the start of our journey to improve hair care experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope she will enjoy the brushes a long time and get the best results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike T.&lt;br /&gt;Hair Symphony&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Original message ---&lt;br /&gt;(SENT FROM ME TO THE COMPANY)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello there Mike,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is Chris. Let me begin by saying that I was very impressed with the communication that&#x27;s taken place since the beginning of my purchase. I was very pleased to know that a company took such pride in its product that I instantly knew this was going to be a good purchase. Here&#x27;s some background information in regards to my purchase. My girlfriend and I went to the local Target and Walmart stores to go hair brush shopping. While browsing the selection at the perspective stores, she found herself unsatisfied at the available options and decided to search Amazon. That&#x27;s when we came across your set. I was pleased with the price point and reviews, and she was pleased because once she received the brushes, they held up to their reputation. This was definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made and made my job of being a boyfriend so much easier. I hope to have to chance to test any future brush prototypes. I&#x27;m sure my girlfriend will be willing to give them a full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending my best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I had ever purchased. I bought one for me and one for my daughter. I am white with blonde long thin hair and my daughter is mixed long curly black hair and it works perfectly on both of our hair. I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes aren&#x27;t that bad but feel that it&#x27;s over priced. Cheap quality</li>
    <li> Finally a brush that I can use in my hair even when dry. I have Thick curly hair which knots easily. I got the brush and ran it through my hair... no knots very impressive.</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed in the paddle brush!!!!! The tangle free brush was fine. It did the job, but the paddle brush? I could tell something was wrong with it when I first opened it. It was dented in on one side. As I was was brushing my hair the whole bristol part came out. I put it back in, which I should not have to do. Then I started brushing my hair again and the Bristol part came out again. I am so disappointed in this product!!!!</li>
    <li> My 2 daughters have long hair. Since they were little, is has been a nightmare to brush their hair because of the tangles and constant whining that it hurts. This brush was recommended to me to sample for my personal evaluation &amp; opinion. I was skeptical because nothing has worked. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! I love this BRUSH! NO MORE WHINING!</li>
    <li> I have always been curious about detangling brushes because I see beauty gurus on Youtube rave about them all the time. I have very long hair (almost down to my waist) and I refuse to get it cut short. I am pretty certain that my husband will throw a fit too, if I ever cut it short! I had no expectations when I got Hair Symphony&#x27;s Scarlet Detangling and Paddle Hair Brushes in the mail but let me tell you this...I was pretty amazed at how it worked! It&#x27;s pretty difficult to detangle my hair when I step out of the shower, so I always go for quality brushes to keep my hair looking healthy and to avoid causing any damage to the strands. This detangling brush made my &amp;#34;pricey hair brush&amp;#34; look stupid because my hair was all detangled and tame in a few strokes! Now I understand why women rave about it! The paddle brush works like a champ as well. I find myself reaching for it more often lately because I like how it feels against my scalp. Two thumbs up for these awesome hair tools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Like you see on the pictures the color is washed out and the ink. The bag is good quality. The brushes look ok too. I don&#x27;t like the red brush/ the red has spots in it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:44c9174647eecb9e349875845cee4a8b]] I am absolutely in LOVE with this set! Not only do you get an AMAZING detangling brush, but you receive a paddle brush AND case for both brushes! These are high quality brushes that have completely changed our lives. My daughter has VERY thick hair that easily gets tangled, especially when playing outside...until we received our detangling brush, our hair care routine was a nightmare! Brushing before bath time, after bath time, in the morning, in the evening...all awful :( There have been so many tears shed and detangling sprays purchased and I am so thankful to have put it all to an end! I myself love using both brushes as well! I have tangle issues as well and have found that the detangling brush is perfect for my snarls and the paddle brush is perfect for when I am fixing my hair each morning! I plan on purchasing an extra sets as I NEVER want to be without these brushes ever again, as well I as I plan on purchasing them for gifts for family members!  I love the product, I love the price and I love the great customer service and care that I have experienced with Hair Symphony! I will be sharing my review on all of my social media sites as well as Youtube to let all of my friends know that there is absolutely no reason to be fighting tangles and tears when there is such a fantastic reasonably priced product out there! If only I had known sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this set for review purposes, however, these opinions are my own and I truly love this set.</li>
