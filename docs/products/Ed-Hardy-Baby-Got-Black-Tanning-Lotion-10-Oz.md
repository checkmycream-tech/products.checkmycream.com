      <li>more then I do.</li>
      <li>I prefer a more cherry or vanilla based scent.</li>
      <li>I love it -</li>
      <li>and I love how it tans my skin</li>
      <li>I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Will probably buy more when needed.</li>
      <li>I love lotions that have bronzers.</li>
      <li>I am a first time tanner with fair skin and some freckles..</li>
      <li>Best tanning lotion I have used in a long time!</li>
      <li>I will recommend because really work and smell good..  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and the smell is very nice.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and got me super golden brown!</li>
      <li>Wonderful smell, no strong after tan smell, OUTSTANDING color results.</li>
      <li>Loaded with antioxidants and my skin feels smooth and moisturized after each use.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of the Ed Hardy tanning lotion line and this one is great.  </li>
      <li>No streaking and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>I thought I did a good job but had bronzer marks on my hands and feet the next day.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this lotion, it has really gotten me a lot darker in just a matter of one week.</li>
      <li>I can already tell a tremendous difference in the color of my skin.</li>
      <li>I was really impressed with how quick it got to me, only took about 3 days with standard shipping!</li>
      <li>Helps you get darker quickly.</li>
      <li>My advice go with the Black Elixir if your lookin for great color faster.</li>
      <li>Second bottle I have bought and will continue to I love this product!</li>
      <li>It delivers what is promises and also leaves the skin fresh and shiny.</li>
      <li>It works super fast!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to go as much!</li>
      <li>This is the first ed hardy tanner ive used before</li>
      <li>I have gone through so many different lotions</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not even funny.</li>
      <li>It has kind of a lemony scent to it, not like other lotions.</li>
      <li>The only thing I did not like about this product is that you have to make sure it goes on very evenly.</li>
      <li>but now I have a nice dark tan like I&#x27;ve been out on the beach for hours.</li>
      <li>Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>This product is a very highly dependable product and has my recommendation.</li>
      <li>But you really do See a difference every time you use it.</li>
      <li>Helpful because I don;t have much time to go anymore</li>
      <li>My only complaint (and the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars) is that it doesnt really smell the best.</li>
      <li>For the experienced tanner, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.  </li>
      <li>A little or less the service was impeccable ......</li>
      <li>so it is going to help tanners because it hydrates the skin, but I am not sure there is anything about this one that makes it better than another.</li>
      <li>I only like to tan twice a week so that could be the reason, but the Black Elixir I get an amazing color going only a couples times a week.  </li>
      <li>Good color, just be careful not to put it on too thick.  </li>
      <li>but because i live in Oregon where the sun hardly shines, im more white girl then olive toned.</li>
      <li>I just started tanning again after many years and have only been 3 times in the past 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Gets you dark fast and keeps your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>but you really have to be careful with application.  </li>
      <li>Great product &amp; way less expensive than at the tanning salon</li>
      <li>It has a great bronzer in it: I could tell a dramatic difference after using it only a few times.  </li>

<li> The only complaint that I have is that it is a bit thin in consistency, but that&#x27;s not a major issue.</li>

    <li> Fantastic smell, excellent bronzer. Helps you get darker quickly.</li>
    <li> It smells good and it improved my color after just one use. It&#x27;s what I expect from Ed Hardy tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I will recommend because really work and smell good..  I give 5 stars. the best tan lotion I ever used</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and dries quickly.  Good color, just be careful not to put it on too thick.  Great scent!</li>
    <li> ORANGEY LOOK BUT ONLY AFTER MULTIPLE USES. GREAT SMELL. WILL CONTINUE TO BUY ED HARDY LINE.</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy makes amazing tanning lotions but I was not as impressed with this one. I normally use the Black Elixir. when I ran out the receptionist recommended this one. it smells great and is very smooth but I  haven&#x27;t got a good color from it.  I only like to tan twice a week so that could be the reason, but the Black Elixir I get an amazing color going only a couples times a week.  Also this one doesn&#x27;t have the tattoo fade protection in it.  I gave it 3 stars because its a dark lotion so probably does work well if u tan more then I do. My advice go with the Black Elixir if your lookin for great color faster.</li>
    <li> Nice product but you really have to be careful with application.  I thought I did a good job but had bronzer marks on my hands and feet the next day.  Gives a great color on legs and smell is nice and mild.</li>
    <li> great product for a experienced tanner does tend to help acheive max tan i would def. recommend this to a freind</li>
    <li> Would recommend this lotion to everyone looking for a bronzer!!! Excellent!!</li>
    <li> Smell bad after tanning</li>
    <li> This product does have a great scent, it also has a lot of noticeable color difference. With the bronzed. But be careful to apply evenly!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works great. I have gone through so many different lotions it&#x27;s not even funny. But you really do See a difference every time you use it. And I know every lotion is different for everyone and this is one that doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. But you do have to make sure you rub it in good. Btw I used to be white as Casper but now I have a nice dark tan like I&#x27;ve been out on the beach for hours.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have a tan after 3 days, and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  It has a great bronzer in it: I could tell a dramatic difference after using it only a few times.  The only complaint that I have is that it is a bit thin in consistency, but that&#x27;s not a major issue.</li>
    <li> Great value and nice scent.  Gets you dark fast and keeps your skin soft and moisturized. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of baby got black by Ed Hardy because it was recommended by my tanning receptionist. I am a first time tanner with fair skin and some freckles..and it left me with an orangey hue.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell before tanning, but afterward.. Kinda stinks lol.&lt;br /&gt;It did give me noticable color after a few sessions, but it is self tanner, ive been rubbing dark spots off for a few days now.!! Left my hands and feet stained, even after wiping with baby wipes.&lt;br /&gt;Im not really impressed..&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works better on skin that is already darker then mine to begin with?</li>
    <li> Super deal!!!!! Will always buy my lotions from the same company.  A little or less the service was impeccable ...... Product is as good as it should be, which is better than a lnockoff</li>
    <li> This product is a very highly dependable product and has my recommendation. It delivers what is promises and also leaves the skin fresh and shiny.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion keeps my skin not get tried out and smells really good. It&#x27;s hard to find a lotion that doesnt leave you smelling like burnt flesh.</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy products work.</li>
    <li> Great texture and aroma. I love lotions that have bronzers. &amp;#34;Baby Got Black&amp;#34; definitely has them. Will reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> On time, over all great quality. Not watery at all.</li>
    <li> For the experienced tanner, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.  It works great.  No yellowing, streaking, tingling, etc.  Will probably buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells! It&#x27;s just a little too dark for normal people lol it leaves horrible streaks of not careful</li>
    <li> Second bottle I have bought and will continue to I love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; way less expensive than at the tanning salon</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion, it has really gotten me a lot darker in just a matter of one week.

I prefer a more cherry or vanilla based scent. Otherwise, good product.</li>
    <li> The only thing I did not like about this product is that you have to make sure it goes on very evenly.</li>
    <li> I love it - I put it with the black elixir and I get a nice color.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome and I love how it tans my skin</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Ed Hardy tanning lotion line and this one is great.  My skin feels so soft and the smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> I use just a little when I tan for my arms legs and stomach region. Love it! Def, accelerates a tan! Helpful because I don;t have much time to go anymore...holds a nice glow so I don&#x27;t have to go as much!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I have used in a long time! So cheap and works amazing! When you go once its like you went three times! The bronzers work so well!</li>
    <li> So maybe it is just me, but seems like tanning lotions all work the same in their respective categories. You have the bronzers, the tingling kind, the fruity smelling ones, etc., but I haven&#x27;t found any out there that truly makes me tan any better than another. It&#x27;s a lotion so it is going to help tanners because it hydrates the skin, but I am not sure there is anything about this one that makes it better than another.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner and I am IN LOVE with this Ed Hardy lotion, one of the best I&#x27;ve come across. It smells wonderful even after tanning it still smells great. I was really impressed with how quick it got to me, only took about 3 days with standard shipping!</li>
    <li> This smell was amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> The tanning salons charge $65 plus for this.  I will never pay that again.  And this stuff is amazing and smells great.</li>
    <li> Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;m olive skinned and I didn&#x27;t see a really big difference with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge ed hardy fan but hate this lotion! It leaves you so orange and washed away all the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; the next day</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I just started tanning again after many years and have only been 3 times in the past 2 weeks. I have olive skin but because i live in Oregon where the sun hardly shines, im more white girl then olive toned. This is the first ed hardy tanner ive used before and I LOVE IT!!!!! It smells amazing and got me super golden brown! No streaking and goes on smooth. I use makeup remover wipes to avoid that brown palm issue. I highly recomend Baby Got Black for any skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different bronzing products but find that this one meets and exceeds my expectations.  Does not burn your skin.  Loaded with antioxidants and my skin feels smooth and moisturized after each use.</li>
    <li> The bronzer in this tanning product is amazing!! It works super fast! I can already tell a tremendous difference in the color of my skin. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing, the blend of bronzers and the color tone are simply amazing. With that being said, I know alot of you want to see results right away etc, but if you do not have a base tan, this is not for you. The color blend here is not a golden brown, but rather exactly like the label states  &amp;#34;dark black bronzer&amp;#34; . Wonderful smell, no strong after tan smell, OUTSTANDING color results.</li>
