      <li>Great product, delivered as expected</li>
      <li>I did not expect much from this cream, as I think that many aromatherapy products are over-rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful scent, very powerful and long lasting.</li>
      <li>The older product, in my opinion, had more aroma and was just a bit thinner</li>
      <li>I must really like it!!</li>
      <li>It comes in a very large container</li>
      <li>I first found it at a hotel, they were giving this product as the lotion in the bathroom</li>
      <li>We had some of this lotion provided by a hotel during a recent trip and my wife fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>This is the first Aromatherapy product I tried from Bath and Body Works.</li>
      <li>I really like putting it on after a shower and use it on my elbows and even on my feet!  </li>
      <li>Energy is my favorite and it lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>It states that massaging into the skin, especially dry spots, and give great results especially after a shower or bath.  </li>
      <li>The scent says ENERGY, but it is delicate enough to spare allergies and very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Its nice to put on half way through the day to give you a scent uplift.  </li>
      <li>The scent of the cream is much lighter.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy the cologne smell of the BnB men&#x27;s line so the orange smell is gender neutral enough for me to use.</li>
      <li>in the Aromatherapy / Energy product Line, and found this cream which a scent that I love in other products I have purchased in the beauty line.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite and I always use it by everyday...</li>

      <li>As I continued working, I did not notice the same “tiredness” in my feet, they become very relaxed.  </li>
      <li>I think the plastic in the tube probably creates a chemical reaction that changes the natural ginger fragrance.</li>
      <li>Wow ...  </li>
      <li>The texture is rich -- thick and creamy.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived in a neat/secured sealed vacuum packed plastic to avoid leakage; delivery was exceptionally FAST, receiving the product before expected delivery date.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;d throw away all my other lotions and just use this.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed to  immediately notice that the lotion had a very sharp chemical/metal smell to it, instead of a pleasant orange/ginger fragance of the amber bottle product.</li>
<li> No drips here to mess up your clothes or furniture.</li>
<li> My feet actually stopped feeling tired, were not aching anymore or feeling irritated.  </li>
<li> I felt a slight cramp in my hands, and decided to use some of the cream, I noticed that my arms and hands were not aching, or feeling that usual tiredness.  </li>
<li> Sadly, it&#x27;s being discontinued and is hard to find.</li>
<li> stinks like deodorant or worse</li>

    <li> stinks like deodorant or worse</li>
    <li> Love the scent, its a great buy</li>
    <li> Smell divine&lt;br /&gt;Came well pkg&lt;br /&gt;Ordered one from another vendor smell kinda flat&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of ordering another one from this vendor</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered as expected</li>
    <li> I have reviewed the lotion before in a pump bottle. The texture is rich -- thick and creamy.  No drips here to mess up your clothes or furniture. The scent says ENERGY, but it is delicate enough to spare allergies and very pleasant.  I especially like the portability of the tube form.  I will enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great lotion  smells like summer . This is my third bottle and gave one  to a friend as well .</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent.  I first found it at a hotel, they were giving this product as the lotion in the bathroom and I fell in love with it so I came home and went to Bath and Body works retail and they did not carry it.  So I googled it and got it.  This scent is great both men and women love it. When I wear it I always get compliments or question about what this is. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice already.  Energy is my favorite and it lasts a long time.  The 8oz tube lasted me close to one year.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This cream smells delicious and is just the thing for my dry hands and feet.  I first discovered this scent from hotel amenities and just fell in love with it., the good thing about the cream is the denser formula, perfect for the hands, feet and elbows, etc.</li>
    <li> I have RA and need the boxes (packages) delivered to my front door. Due to artificial hand joints I can not lift many boxes when left on sidewalk or in driveway, which has been where I find them for the past few months.  PLEASE print on delivery label: place package next to front door on 2nd floor landing.</li>
    <li> like the scent.  lotion is pretty good.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> I kept smelling something great in my cube office.  Found out it was a girl using this.  Had to have it.  It&#x27;s on my list of favorite things to give for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Bath and Body Works Orange Ginger Body Cream that came in a glass pump bottle.  The older product, in my opinion, had more aroma and was just a bit thinner (so it would be able to be pumped out).  The product in the plastic tube is very good, however, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Need to return Bath and Body Works Orange ginger lotion. I loved this lotion in a bottle, so I ordered it in a tube so I could carry it in my purse. I was very disappointed to  immediately notice that the lotion had a very sharp chemical/metal smell to it, instead of a pleasant orange/ginger fragance of the amber bottle product. I think the plastic in the tube probably creates a chemical reaction that changes the natural ginger fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like to put it on my hands, and I recently discovered that this body cream is cheaper per ounce than the pump lotion. Since I use it for my hands, the cream format is better anyway.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had used the lotion at a Marriott hotel. The scent of the cream is much lighter.</li>
    <li> Awesome thanks. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I I would and plan to order this product again.I I truly appreciate and enjoy using this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d throw away all my other lotions and just use this. It smells great, absorbs quickly, and lasts a long time in the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product smells wonderful</li>
    <li> This is the first Aromatherapy product I tried from Bath and Body Works. I am in love with the smell. It uplifts me and gives me energy whenever I apply. The orange and ginger are a perfect mix!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent. Too orange and chemical for me</li>
    <li> This is a product I plan to continue to buy. I use it at home and work.</li>
    <li> smells great! no real energy boost though</li>
    <li> One of my favorite and I always use it by everyday...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent in the Bath and Body Works collection.  Sadly, it&#x27;s being discontinued and is hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is a nice refreshing scent. The perfect pick-me-up when you are tired but need to go a little longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent...just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> We had some of this lotion provided by a hotel during a recent trip and my wife fell in love with it.  She is now a committed user and I must say that the aroma that accompanies her use is very nice as well.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! I think its a little too strong on the smell, when she uses it before goes to bed, which mellows after a while.</li>
    <li> Wonderful item.  The scent is perfect.  I&#x27;ve always loved the Orange Ginger and will continue to purchase from you all.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I don&#x27;t feel like my energy level improves but the scent it amazing and uplifting.  I will use this daily.  Its nice to put on half way through the day to give you a scent uplift.  Love this product</li>
    <li> Gerat and energizing smell. It comes in a very large container and you don&#x27;t need a lot os that makes this lotion last a while.</li>
    <li> this is exactly the same as what was used by Marriott hotels a few years ago. I bought this for a friend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Love the aromatic fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the creaminess - just right for those extra dry areas of skin, such as heels of the feet. The fragrance is awesome - a luxurious experience every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This rich moisturizing cream goes on smooth and the scent remains for quite some time.  I really like putting it on after a shower and use it on my elbows and even on my feet!  Wow ...  I must really like it!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent, very powerful and long lasting. Just what all women needs throughout the day. Can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> The smell isnt as great as i was hoping it would be, Someone told me I smell like fruit loops...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t sleep so good....something was off about the smell. Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy the cologne smell of the BnB men&#x27;s line so the orange smell is gender neutral enough for me to use. The lotions from BnB work better than store brought brands in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing The Bath and Body Works products for some time, and never took advantage of purchasing anything in their Aromatherapy / Energy product Line.  I recently decided to purchase the Orange Ginger Body Cream, 8 oz. in the Aromatherapy / Energy product Line, and found this cream which a scent that I love in other products I have purchased in the beauty line.  I did not expect much from this cream, as I think that many aromatherapy products are over-rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this package arrived, my feet were tired, and I decided to apply some of the cream on my feet, and I noticed that my feet became very relaxed.  As I continued working, I did not notice the same “tiredness” in my feet, they become very relaxed.  My feet actually stopped feeling tired, were not aching anymore or feeling irritated.  It gave me a &amp;#34;relaxed,&amp;#34; feeling, and I was impressed.  I felt a slight cramp in my hands, and decided to use some of the cream, I noticed that my arms and hands were not aching, or feeling that usual tiredness.  I found these parts of my body becoming more relaxed.  I am convinced that something different is happening with this cream, and I have noticed the differences in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertisers state that this ultra-pampering body cream deeply nourishes skin with protective 24-hour moisture, while an aromatherapy blend of essential oils is uplifting to release tension and sharpen the senses.  It states that massaging into the skin, especially dry spots, and give great results especially after a shower or bath.  The product arrived in a neat/secured sealed vacuum packed plastic to avoid leakage; delivery was exceptionally FAST, receiving the product before expected delivery date.  I would recommend this cream to others, as well as Amazon Customers.  I am very happy with the results of this cream.</li>
