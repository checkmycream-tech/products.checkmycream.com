<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Perfective Ceuticals Eye Cream in conjunction with their Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Serum for the better part of a month. Formerly, I was a consumer of the classic department store brands and honestly didn&#x27;t expect to see the kind of results I&#x27;ve seen. These are genuinely amazing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m forty-four and my only problem areas are my eyes and neck. My other reviews cover the results on my neck, but I was even more surprised by how quickly the eye cream showed results. I had softening at the edge of the eyes with light wrinkles (very light), but I do have issues with dark circles and puffiness under the eye. A facialist once told me that this is primarily due to dry skin and that this made a good moisturizer and eye cream essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a product work so fast before. Most noticeable is the reduction in puffiness and dark circles under the eyes, but my eyelids and outer eyes look better as well. I&#x27;m a convert and will be purchasing Perfective Ceuticals again....they are pricey, but the do what they promise. How many cosmetics actually do? This was the one product I didn&#x27;t try on both my mother and myself, so no two generation results, but I have no doubt that results would be just as dramatic on the next generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the Perfective Ceuticals products feel rich and creamy and luxurious going on...you feel like you&#x27;re doing something good for yourself. This cream also absorbed quickly with no greasy feeling or irritation and I tend toward sensitive skin. A wonderful product actually worth the money and you can tell the difference even comparing to high end department store brands. Recommended, especially for those in the second half of life.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..I will buy it again</li>
    <li> The Perfective Ceuticals eye cream is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It soothes under my eyes reducing puffiness and within 4 weeks I could see a reduction in all the lines under my eyes and the crows feet at the corners. Even more impressive is that I first began using this during allergy season, when my eyes are swollen, aching messes. I had no discomfort, even when I used the cream while wearing contacts. I noticed a reduction in puffiness in about a week, the crows feet and lines noticeably diminished in four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks.  I do see a minor difference as I have those lines around my eyes from all the years of sun and fun and laughter.  I wish I had taken a photo two weeks ago as I do think the lines are not as deep.  I did take one today so I can compare as I finish the bottle.  I&#x27;m pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this type of product before or anything like it.  In fact I don&#x27;t even wear makeup.  I didn&#x27;t have any preconceived notions or expectations of Perfective Ceutical products whatsoever.  I&#x27;m not particularly gullible and have to try something and thoroughly test a product before passing judgement.  Now you can simply called me very pleasantly surprised.  Mind you, if you have deep wrinkles, perhaps you&#x27;d better pass on this one.  If you have those crows feet and laugh lines that come with age, this is a product that you may wish to add to your wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late fifties and definitely am showing signs of wear and tear.  I do like the natural aging process and dislike the look of people who have had face lifts.  Frankly I think some of them of look as if they are going to pop.  Now, what does this actually do?  I&#x27;ve been using the Perfective Ceuticals products for about a month.  I diligently applied a small amount as directed twice a day.  There was a light, but almost imperceptible greasy look to the \\&quot;Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy.\\&quot;  The other two products didn&#x27;t have that, but left a greasy film on my hands.  This washed off readily with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days I actually noticed a difference.  What was happening was that the crows feet and small wrinkles were what I would call \\&quot;softening.\\&quot;  It definitely was noticeable and I actually thought I looked younger.  Perhaps I was deluding myself, but if I felt better about how I looked, that&#x27;s all that counts.  Of course if you use one of those magnifying mirrors you&#x27;ll notice every little wrinkle, but peering into a regular bathroom mirror it was as if I&#x27;d used some sort of concealer.  No, it&#x27;s not going to work on the deep lines beside your mouth, but softens the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to slather on this product as a little dab will do it as they say.  When you use the \\&quot;Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy,\\&quot; make sure you use a flattened \\&quot;pea-sized\\&quot; amount because if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll run out quickly.  All in all, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the Perfective Ceutical products.  Actually, I&#x27;m very impressed they worked at all as my expectations were low to nonexistent.  Yes, this product does work.  If you expect that all your wrinkles will be totally erased, you need to look elsewhere.  The intent of Perfective Ceuticals is, I believe, to lessen or soften those light wrinkles you already have.  If you can settle for that, you&#x27;ll be happy.  I&#x27;ve done a bit of research on the ingredients.  The only iffy one, of course is the EGF.  Personally, I think this company did their homework.  The only drawback that I can see is the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS ... what are these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), 1-Butylene Glycol, 3-Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Palmitoyl Hexapeptide, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Trisodium EDTA, Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~  1-Butylene Glycol:  FDA approved (21CFR172.712)&lt;br /&gt;~  3-Butylene Glycol:  FDA approved (21CFR172.712)&lt;br /&gt;  The Butylene Glycols keep the product from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;~  Glycerin:  A sugar alcohol that is used in everything from toothpaste to skin care products (demulcent).

    <li> I did hit the gene pool  jackpot in a couple of  ways.  I got my mother&#x27;s hair, still nearly as thick, almost as shiny and exactly the same color as it was the day I turned 16 - no gray to be seen.  (My sisters, both younger, both gray for a decade, are livid.)  I also got my Dad&#x27;s good skin, so while I am in the middle of my  seventh decade, I am not as yet a wrinkled old crone.  Still, I have my share of lines, a couple of scars and the beginnings of a few crows&#x27;s feet around my eyes.  You might not notice them, but I do.  Sadly, I also got my Dad&#x27;s dark circles around the eyes, what he used to call his \\&quot;two hole burned in a blanket\\&quot; look, something that has become far more apparent with age, particularly if I am tired, dehydrated or straight out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago the folks at Perfective Ceuticals asked me if I would like to try some of their products.  Not long after a box landed on my doorstep containing three of their Anti-aging products -  [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]], [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] and [[ASIN:B00AYARK2C Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor ]].  Since then, I&#x27;ve been using my regular cleaning regimen, followed by the application of the Perfective products.  I must say, I am impressed.  My skin is moister and my lines less apparent,  I&#x27;ve particularly noticed a fairly dramatic difference in the scars, which have become pretty hard to differentiate from ordinary wrinkles, and the no-longer-crepey skin of my neck.  I&#x27;ve also noticed a big difference in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit of [[ASIN:B00AYARK2C Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor ]] dabbed around and under the eye goes a long ways.  While it doesn&#x27;t completely erase my \\&quot;hound dog\\&quot; eyes, the difference that it has made over the last month is readily apparent, even to my most critical eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Next best thing to an eye-lift, and the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that has made a difference in those dark circles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the list of ingredients contained in this product -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Ginseng Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Raffinose, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Hydroxyproline, Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide), Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraoctanoate, Olive Squalane, Propylene Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Ethylparabenthe last month is readily apparent, even to my most critical eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Next best thing to an eye-lift, and the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that has made a difference in those dark circles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the list of ingredients contained in this product -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Ginseng Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Raffinose, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Hydroxyproline, Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide), Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraoctanoate, Olive Squalane, Propylene Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Ethylparaben</li>
    <li> Fact is that, after her first couple of months with this product, my wife is going to order more because she&#x27;s hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received a free &#x27;for review&#x27; box of [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]] from the Perfective Ceuticals people together with the [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] and the [[ASIN:B00AYARK2C Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor]] which together make up the complete anti-aging solution. They suggested that we review the product whenever ready, hopefully after a few months of use so the results would be apparent. So... a few months have passed and the results actually were apparent after about 10 days. Not that I noticed because my wife could not possibly look any more beautiful than she does, but... you know, that&#x27;s what she said :). She is extremely happy with it and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice: follow the use instructions from Amazon&#x27;s site to the letter and you will be happy. Remember that The right order to apply the products, if you have them all would be: Serum &gt; Eye Cream &gt; Face Cream. Face cream should always be last because it locks in the other two. They recommend 2 applications daily but Ms. D only applied them once per day at night and she noticed results after only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one little note: be aware that anyone who is allergic to Retinol (Vitamin A) should not use this products.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped keep the skin around my eyes moisturized and has added firmness. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. It&#x27;s not greasy and very easy to apply.  As for fine lines and wrinkles, it hasn&#x27;t made me look 20 years younger, or even 5 years. A couple reviews mentioned they look 10 years younger. I haven&#x27;t experienced that.  But I can tell there has been a difference in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and puffiness. It&#x27;s subtle, but seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product feels great on my skin and has really helped with the puffiness around my eyes due to allergies, which I think is really helping prevent more fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is one the very best eye creams I&#x27;ve ever tried, and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;Before buying, look at the ingredients. A powerhouse of nature and science.&lt;br /&gt;Then, the packaging. Easy to use, no mess in getting the exact amount you need.&lt;br /&gt;It is low cost. Yes, you read that correctly.&lt;br /&gt;You need only the smallest bit...it will last for months. In terms of cost per application, it is a better value than similar creams. I used to use La Prarie&#x27;s caviar, I like this line and product better.&lt;br /&gt;But all of that pales when you consider how, over time, even deep lines and circles are dramatically diminished.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I am of a certain age and have wrinkles around my eyes.  I tried the Perfective Ceuticals eye cream and was amazed at how my wrinkles seemed to disappear, the skin around my eyes appeared brighter, and the lines under my eyes were no longer present.  The skin felt more resilient and younger to the touch.  This is a wonderful eye cream and I highly recommend it to anyone.  It will most likely prevent aging as well as it hides aging.  It is a cream for everyone.</li>
    <li> This Eye Therapy also is made with collagen and elastin stimulators to help fight against the four signs of aging eyes: fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This awesome product has growth factors (Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) ) in it which is why it works so well! This EGF helps to diminish the length and depth of fine lines, under eye wrinkles and crow’s feet wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4) that helps reduce eye puffiness by strengthening the elasticity of the eye skin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also inside this awesome formula is Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide) that helps under eye wrinkles and crow’s feet wrinkles to become more resilient to the aging process. Lastly, this formula has Retinol and Ginseng Extract to de-saturate dark circles,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see more radiant and wrinkle free eyes! I like it because it is Fragrance Free, which I have come to appreciate as I get older. My nose seems to find offense with scents that used to not bother me, but now I get watery eyes anytime I get a whiff of any kind of scent or I will get the sneezes. This Eye Therapy is also Non-comedogenic and Scientifically proven.</li>
    <li> This is an accelent eye cream for any skin type and it really works!!!!! It takes about I one month to see true results . The only negative site is the price.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It is light and not greasy at all. It keep my eye moist all day. My last eye cream was La-Mer but my friend recommeded me this product and it is just as good and much more affordable.</li>
    <li> I am one tired mama! With two kids under five and a baby on the way, I don’t get much sleep. That’s actually an understatement! As a result, not only does my ability to function suffer; so does my body physically.&lt;br /&gt;One huge thing I’ve noticed is dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I get the comment “you look tired” a lot! That’s why I was eager to try the Anti Imperfection Eye Therapy. I need all the help I can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just apply a little to my fingertips at night before I go to sleep right under my eyes and at the corners. I do actually notice a difference after just a few weeks. My eyes are definitely less purple and less puffy. I also worry about the long term effects my lack of sleep will have and this is supposed to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and crows feet as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I do have the appearance of fine lines, the crows feet aren’t quite complete yet! I’m hoping the Anti Imperfection Eye Therapy will be as successful at keeping them at bay as it has at reducing my obvious lack of sleep appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women need to take care of their skin, especially moms who don’t get enough sleep and need extra help in that department. Anti Imperfection Eye Therapy has been a great defense in that department for me so I’m sure it will for you as well.</li>
    <li> As someone who likes to try out different skin care brands, Perfective Ceuticals was completely unknown to me. Not any longer. Recommended by a friend, I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  Comes in a nice easy to hold bottle that&#x27;s comfortable to grasp to squeeze out that pea size drop. Its a medium, non-greasy lotion loaded with wonderful ingredients and absorbs quickly.  After a couple of minutes, the area around my eyes feel so soft and supple yet there&#x27;s a sensation of a thin film of tightness where the lotion was applied. As if the firming qualities are gently kicking in.  My skin has gotten more sensitive over the years and this eye cream has zero irritation on my skin.  My under eye area tends to get puffy during the work week and since using, its helped decrease the puffiness.  Its a winner!</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have very dry and fairly sensitive skin (menopause).  My eyes are very sensitive to creams as well.  I only seem to need a very tiny amount of this cream as it goes on smooth and covers the entire eye area.  Almost all of the other creams I&#x27;ve tried make my eyes water and itch.  This eye cream not only diminishes the fine lines and wrinkles but it also feels like I am wearing no cream at all.  It feels wonderful, absorbs very well, and my eyes don&#x27;t itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about the packaging, it is beautiful and dispenses the cream nicely. This cream is a little pricey but since I only need a tiny amount I expect this bottle to last several months.  And since it actually does what Perfective Ceuticals claims it does, it&#x27;s worth every penny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I do have hereditary dark circles under my eyes.  There is no cream that will make them go away (believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all) but it does seem that the circles aren&#x27;t as dark after some continued use.  The skin around my eyes feels very fresh, supple, and I just love how it feels.  I highly recommend this eye cream to anyone looking to reduce eye wrinkles and feel good in their skin again.  I wish I had found it sooner!</li>
    <li> *I received a sample to test for my review, as I am clearly in their demographic of &#x27;older person with wrinklage setting in&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for two months now, and I&#x27;m really impressed. If you have read my other skincare reviews, I&#x27;m kind of stuck on how well the Avon ANEW products work. Well, work(ed), since my face had a bad reaction to a cosmetic product awhile back and I&#x27;m unable to tolerate most anti-aging products any more. The Anew did what nothing else had: it actually smoothed out my rough spots and lessened the lines I&#x27;m starting to see. I gave up on finding another product that would work as well (at any price range) but I definitely have found a mean competitor to the Anew crown in this Perfective Ceuticals eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the price point almost gave me heart failure when I saw it; but 2 months out and the pump on the bottle still feels like it has plenty of product. I may yet get 90 days of use out of this eye cream, which makes the initial purchase price very competitive with even the cheap(er) Avon price point. I use the tiniest dot of product for both eyes, just a fraction of a pump&#x27;s worth. Maybe the size of say, a grain of rice. Let&#x27;s get the price point out of the way and focus on what is the most important: results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have hooded eyes like many of us get as we age? That makes eye cream sting and burn your eyes---this cream was thick enough that it didn&#x27;t go ANYWHERE. I also have problems with my eyes watering quite a bit when they get tired, strained, or dried out. This causes cream to run into my eyes and stings them. This did not happen with the Perfective Ceuticals formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream, like many, says to use it day and night. But if you&#x27;ve ever tried to put on eye cream in the daytime and had it make a greasepot out of your eye makeup, you tend to be leery about this usage. I have used it as a hydrating cream in the daytime under my eye makeup (a little or a lot of eye makeup, it all works the same) with great success. You can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s under there, as I don&#x27;t get creasing or greasing! Love that. A bonus is that I&#x27;m able to dab a little bit of foundation or concealer under my eye area and I don&#x27;t have to worry that it&#x27;s going to sink into my lines, or crease up into lines of demarcation. This cream absorbs right into the skin, and it provides a nice base for me to blend color on top of it without raccoon eyes, crinkles, or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But best of all, I have to say that I have actually noticed a general &#x27;smoothness&#x27; to my eye area that wasn&#x27;t there previously. The general texture has improved, both under my eyes and on my eyelids. There is markedly less crepey texture and definitely a reduction in roughness. If you&#x27;ve ever applied a shimmery or frosty eyeshadow and realized that it made you look like a hag by enhancing just how rough/crepy your eyelid area is---you know how much that bites. I am wearing shimmer products again, nothing disco-ball but nice Mally Saddle eyeshadow pencil and some Maybelline Color Tattoo creams; they are going on smooth and easy and don&#x27;t look like miniature elephant skins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cream plays well with the acid peels I have been using also, with no stinging or burning. (I use light peels close to my undereye and crows-feet areas)  Overall I am impressed that this eye cream has shown noticeable results and it is something I will buy when this tube runs out. Let&#x27;s face it, it works, and at my age I don&#x27;t have time to waste with eye cream that doesn&#x27;t earn its keep! The price point is comparable to what you&#x27;d pay for Lancome or Estee Lauder products (which I&#x27;ve tried with no success) so why not give it a try? So far I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the high quality skincare items they make, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that the dispensers they use are of a nice quality and don&#x27;t break down.&lt;br /&gt;Overall am very, very pleased with the results on my older skin from these products!l works the same) with great success.

    <li> It leaves the skin under and around the eye smooth and bright. It feels rich and it takes years off without spending a large fortune. It only takes a little as well, so one bottle will last a long time. It has diminished my dark circles and filled my fine lines. Very great product!</li>
    <li> I just walked El Camino de Santiago in Spain, a 500 mile hike that lasted 33 days. I was out in the sun all day, walking 5 to 9 hours daily. I wore toxin-free sunscreen every day, but my skin took a beating from the sunscreen and a bit from the sun as well. My face had aged a lot that month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially noticeable were the bags under my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home, thank God this product was waiting for me to try! I used it every night before sleeping to let it does its rejuvenation thing. Within a month I could tell the difference. The bags under my eyes began to fade, as did the subtle wrinkles. I love it! It also made my skin much softer around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that the container is nonbreakable as I often drop things, and if the cosmetic is in a glass container, it&#x27;s ruined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Expats in Cuenca, Ecuador: The Magic &amp; The Madness</li>
    <li> The claim: PC has Epidermal Growth Factor that helps diminish the length and depth of fine line and under eye wrinkles and crows feet.  The Matrixyl helps reduce eye puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? OHMYGOD! Yes!!  I&#x27;ve been using Perfective Ceuticals for 2 weeks. I am more than in love!!  I love how the PC absorbs quickly doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film. I noticed a difference in the firmness around my eyes within 2 days.  I noticed the bags under my eyes were firmer and the line under the bags are less defined. The crows feet lines are definitely softer. But I&#x27;m most thrilled with the bags being diminished!! I truly believe PC will make my eyes look even better with continued use. [...] to see my full review.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream so much that I cannot imagine switching to another eye cream! I love how creamy it is for the delicate skin around my eyes. I have seen a difference in the way my eyes look. I apply it day and night and it goes well with my eye makeup. I apply a concealer for my dark circles and this eye cream makes it go on seamlessly. This is a great product that I will definitely share with my friends!</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream as it seems to work pretty well in reducing the puffiness and dark circle around my eyes.  I have pretty sensitive skin and am so glad that it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  It applies on pretty nicely and not greasy at all and goes well with my eye makeup.  I would definitely share this with my friends!</li>
    <li> Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor is -- in a word -- amazing. It&#x27;s a highly concentrated, eye cream created exclusively for the delicate skin around the eyes. Formulated with collagen and elastin stimulators, this eye cream will battle against -- not only those dratted crow&#x27;s feet -- but also fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness. But the most important part? It really works! My wrinkles are noticeably less prominent. And, the under-eye darkness? Almost gone! 5 stars out of 5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> This Cream is wonderful. This is not only good for lines and wrinkles though, it also great for relieving  dark circles and puffiness under the eye area. I have been using the product for two weeks and the area around my eyes are smoother and hopefully over time with continuous use it will diminish the little lines I see around my eye area. I can&#x27;t wait to see what kind of results I get after a full 30 days worth of usage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and I started to look for undereye products after my sister in law made a comment about the fine wrinkles around my eyes that have started to form. Tried this product out and loved it.  I&#x27;m the type of girl that doesn&#x27;t like products that make my face feel heavy so when I tried this eye cream I was happy I did. I noticed that whenever I remembered to use it my eyes would feel brighter and lighter.  I would feel moisturized all day too where by the end of the day (even during the winter time) my eyes didn&#x27;t look tired at all.  I bought this produce 3 months ago and I have definitely noticed a difference under my eyes.  Even my sister-in-law noticed (she use to work as a beautician) that the lines under my eyes have diminished. Its only been 3 months so I definitely think if I keep using it I will see even more results.  Also there is plenty of product in just one bottle.  Using it for 3 months and I think there is still a lot left. Don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get good coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50, and have under eye bags and a few light crow&#x27;s feet. When Perfective Ceuticals asked if I&#x27;d be willing to try their products in exchange for reviewing them, I figured it was worth a try.  But I didn&#x27;t expect much.  I&#x27;ve used lots of creams and treatments, hoping to reverse some of the inevitable signs of aging, and even liked a few of them.  I like emu oil, but it sometimes caused pimples on my skin.  And it didn&#x27;t do much for the eye bags.  I liked Olay Regenerist, but I was allergic to something in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Perfective Ceuticals Anti-Imperfection Eye Therapy Cream for three weeks now, applying it to my clean face twice a day, and I&#x27;m truly amazed!  My eye bags are reduced, the small lines around my eyes are diminished, and puffiness above and below my eyes is gone. I wish I&#x27;d taken before and after pictures because this product has really made a visible difference in my skin.  Even my husband can see the improvement and commented on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had good results with Retin-A in the past, but had some redness and peeling and sun sensitivity, and couldn&#x27;t use it next to my eyes.  This cream is gentle and absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face, and gives the same type of results.  It&#x27;s fragrance free, and comes in a generous bottle which will last for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never have considered buying this product for myself because so many expensive \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams just don&#x27;t work.  But this product has taken 10 years off of my eye area in just three weeks.  I can&#x27;t wait to see if it continues to improve the skin around my eyes with several more months of use</li>
    <li> I am always eager to try new beauty products and agreed to test Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy with growth factor from Perfective Cecticals.  I have been a sun-worshiper for years, however; my eyes do not show the damage as readily as other parts of my skin.  Where I do have a problem is with water retention,which shows under my eyes, as well as a bit of a droop by the side of my left eye.  Presumably, from lack of elasticity.  After approximately 2 weeks time, I saw a noticeable difference with both trouble spots.  The puffiness under my eyes had almost disappeared and the skin around my eyes felt and looked tauter and tighter.  When I use this very pleasant light weight cream in the morning, I have that \\&quot;wide eye/good night sleep\\&quot; look all day.  I have used many eye-products and lost interest very quickly as the results did not merit my continued use and expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This amazing eye cream is a pleasure to use.  It comes with an easy pump and you only need to use a small amount.  It is light-weight and odor free,  Maybe I do not have a particularly sensitive sniffer, however; I cannot imagine anyone  finding fault with the smell.  I saw and felt my results immediately, almost like you can feel the sucking action going on deep inside your skin.  This eye cream probably costs a little more than the \\&quot;Clinque\\&quot; product I was using and a little less than the Estee Lauder I had used in the past.  I was always afraid to trust this sensitive area to an over the counter product.  The packaging is tastefully done and would make a lovely gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the results as my eyes appear firmer and more energized.  As the puffiness is almost gone, I am not as hesitant to add a little salt to my evening meal.  I recommend this product whole-heatedly and will purchase the next one without reservation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as prescribed for a little more than 2 weeks. And although I started off with very little wrinkling, the little ones I have under my eyes make me sad. Now I still have wrinkles when I smile, but those little crepe-y ones under my eyes are definitely diminishing...that makes me happy. I really feel as if this product is helping my skin around my eyes look better, maybe not younger, but healthier and more vibrant. Truthfullly, I did miss a couple of applications in the first 2 weeks(due to family issues), but I gave it a few extra days before deciding to review. And I am thrilled with the product and looking forward to using it for more results.</li>
    <li> I have always had very dark eyes. I have always felt like I look like a raccoon until I was introduced to this product. This product helped lighten my dark eyes and make them look beautiful. I am so thankful that I can be in a picture now and not worry about looking like I have a black eye.

    <li> Of the entire regimen I have been using, this is the least impressive product. It&#x27;s a good eye cream, but I have tried a number of eye creams before and there is not much difference with this one. It&#x27;s a bit gentler on your skin when you apply it and not oily like some of the others, but I can&#x27;t see much of a difference other than the fact that it spreads easily so the application process doesn&#x27;t tug at the skin below your eyes. I would recommend, but I am not ecstatic about this product like I am the others.</li>
    <li> For the past 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve had a chance to use Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; Anti-Aging Eye Cream, morning and night. In addition to my huge pores, my eyes have always been a problem area for me. I have laugh line crow&#x27;s feet, bumpy skin, under-eye deep wrinkles, and dramatic under-eye circles that I can&#x27;t seem to cover or cure enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, naturally, I was more than willing to try a product that contains Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF, means to encourage collagen under the epidermal layer of skin, to even out fine lines, wrinkles, and crow&#x27;s feet), Matrixyl (a pentapeptide that encourages skin elasticity, which reduces eye puffiness), Argireline (a hexapeptide that strengthens and moisturizes skin, to make it more resilient to the aging process), Retinol (to brighten underye circles), and Ginseng Extract (also to brighten underye circles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; straightforward, honest approach with marketing. They&#x27;re more about educating consumers, and being open with their product ingredients, than being flashy or celebrity-based. I also like that this cream is non-comedegenic and fragrance-free, as all eye care products should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They recommend using twice a day (a pea-sized amount per eye, applied to over and undereye area) and waiting 5 minutes for absorption. I found that pea-sized was too much for one eye during daytime application-- I used that amount on both eyes every morning. I used slightly more at night, but still not pea-sized per eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the cream is heavy, I found it absorbed well so long as I was patient. I also applied a small amount to the area between my eyes (on my nose) because I&#x27;m genetically pre-disposed to get a fierce deep wrinkle there (my female ancestors, and my mom, have it...it makes the face look angry and I found the beginnings of it developing earlier this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it work, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;YES.&lt;br /&gt;The wrinkle between my eyes disappeared within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The outer sides of my underye circles faded within 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My undereye puffiness disappeared within 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;The fine lines on my eyelids and my crow&#x27;s feet visibly reduced within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re patient, this cream does produce results.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using Perfect Ceuticals Anti-Aging Eye Cream.outer sides of my underye circles faded within 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My undereye puffiness disappeared within 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;The fine lines on my eyelids and my crow&#x27;s feet visibly reduced within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re patient, this cream does produce results.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using Perfect Ceuticals Anti-Aging Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and probably sensitive eyes and of course allergies too. This eye cream is gentle, and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is soft and light with and I don&#x27;t get that greasy feel after using it. It absorbs pretty well. I love the no scent and lightness feel to it.  After using it for over a month I think it has helped improved the wrinkles under and in the corner of my eye area.  The skin above my eyes is much firmer and hydrated.  I&#x27;ve searched for a long time for a new eye cream, and this one has delivered it&#x27;s promise.  I&#x27;m excited to see how much more improvement it&#x27;ll bring to my eyes later on too.  This product is definitely worth trying for those types of eye issues.  I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;less expensive&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; products and NONE measure up to this eye cream.  I would recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and was not expecting any dramatic results and boy was I wrong! After just a few uses, my dark circles and fine lines have improved significantly and I no longer look like a walking zombie, lol! I will continue to use this religiously to maintain these effects! Everyone&#x27;s skin and sensitivity is different, but for me, this has proven to be a remarkable product that has actually done what it claims to do and for that alone, consider me impressed!</li>
    <li> Great product! Super rich. Has smoothed out the superficial wrinkles around my eyes. I am applying around my lips as well now. I am really pleased with my purchase, and will continue to use this product. Thanks Perfective Ceuticals!</li>
    <li> I received some of Perfective Ceuticals Anti-Imperfection Eye Therapy with growth factor.  Now that I am in my 30&#x27;s I notice some fine lines around my eyes.  It&#x27;s not anything major, but I don&#x27;t want it to get worse.  That is where the Eye Therapy can help!  This is great for a number of eye problems.  It targets dark circles, fine lines, puffiness, and wrinkles.  This is a very concentrated product.  You don&#x27;t need to gob it on to do the job.  I personally found that if you apply a small amount under the eye and massage it in it works very well.  I notices that it did a great job smoothing the find lines under my eyes and it made them less visible.  love how it helps get rid of the puffiness in my eyes when I wake up too.  This is something you would want to use twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Therapy is fortified with Collagen and Elastin to help improve your fine lines and wrinkles around the eye area.  The product also has ingredients in it that help lessen how deep wrinkles are.  How neat!  I am very pleased with the results so far and am excited to continue to use this over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free product sample provided for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this anti-aging eye cream for two weeks, and already I consider it a miracle.  I suffer from eczema around my eyes, particularly under the eyebrows and on my upper eyelids, due to some unknown allergen.  Cosmetics, even hypoallergenic types, can trigger or aggravate my condition.  The skin on my eyelids often feels extremely fragile, as though it will rip if I rub it.  So . . . when I received this small pump bottle, I fully intended to use it under my eyes only because of my lid sensitivity; however, after having no reactions under the eye, I decided to give it a try.  This is the FIRST product out of about 20 that not only doesn&#x27;t provoke irritation but actually improved the skin.  In the two weeks since I started this, I have had no outbreaks.  The skin on my lids feels almost normal again.  It looks healthy and less tired.  Hooray!  It didn&#x27;t cure my eczema, naturally, but it made the skin less irritated and more resistant to outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a small pump container, and one push dispenses enough to cover the area around both eyes.  As with other Perfective Ceuticals products, it contains epidermal growth factor (EFG) that is supposed to increase skin replenishment and restore some collagen and elasticity.  From two weeks of use, I&#x27;d say that this does indeed improve the look of my eyes, with one exception, noted below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the one issue I&#x27;ve had has been under my eyes, and it appeared only after 10 or so days of use.  Now when I wake up in the morning, the area under my eyes is slightly puffy.  I&#x27;m considering using this only on my lids or only during the day.  The skin itself looks much better, though, so the puffiness might be due to something else.  (Note:  The manufacturer sent a sample for review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After many weeks, I&#x27;m still using this eye cream with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I have been using Perfective Ceuticals eye therapy cream for three weeks to improve the appearnace of my skin under the eyes. Overall, I like it. I see some improvement, although it is only a relative improvement not total obliteration of the fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a photo of the cream in my hand (photo can be located by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo). The cream is white and totally unscented. The delivery system is a pump, which delivers a small amount of cream and is easy to control not to use too much. Direction say to use just a small drop under each eye, twice a day. The second photo show a container next to a pen for size reference. With the cap off the container is 3.75\\&quot; tall from the bottom to the top of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream spreads nicely, leaves no shine so I can put it on and go out without worrying about tell-tell shine under my eyes. I am applying the cream twice a day in the morning and in the evening. It is totally odorless which is very important to me as I prefer fragrance free cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cream for testing and evaluation from the manufacture. Having this direct line to them I wrote to them asking the details about the \\&quot;growth\\&quot; factor mentioned in the name. I wanted to understand better what this was and whether it could have any negative effects by penetrating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an explanation that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a protein with 53 amino acids. It is very large in size and not able to penetrate into the skin topically. It is approved for cosmetic use by the FDA and there is no evidence topically applied EGF causes skin cancer cells to multiply faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EGF works by reducing the length and depth of fine lines. Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4) helps reduce eye puffiness by strengthening the elasticity of the eye skin area. Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide) helps under eye wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet wrinkles to become more resilient to the aging process. The cream also contains Retinol and Ginseng Extract to de-saturate dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Ginseng Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Raffinose, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Hydroxyproline, Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide), Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraoctanoate, Olive Squalane, Propylene Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Ethylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to my inquiry the manufacture also sent me an article published in a Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (\\&quot;Human growth factor and cytokine skin cream for facial skin rejuvenation as assessed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging\\&quot; Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Oct, 2007 by Michael H.

    <li> I have been using the  Perfective Ceuticals Anti-Imperfection Eye Therapy for around 20 days now and so far, so good! I am in my mid-thirties and do not look too bad, but have plenty of darkness around the eyes as well as some fine lines. In the past two weeks, I have noticed some lightening of the purple hue around the eye socket. Having that olive toned complexion plus child induced sleep deprivation, my circles can be pretty bad. This stuff either does work a bit or I am simply getting slightly better sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light and non-greasy, so it absorbs fairly well and wears well under eye makeup. I would be interested in the other products in this line. my only request is for them to come out with a more natural product for this hippie lady.;)</li>
    <li> When I was asked if I&#x27;d like to try Perfective Ceuticals products containing Growth Factor, I was skeptical. I am a &#x27;Doubting Thomas&#x27;.  You know &#x27;seeing is believing&#x27;. I decided I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose, so I accepted their generous offer and made it known that I would write an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought: &#x27;If this product line works, how will I prove it?&#x27;...you know &#x27;seeing is believing&#x27;. So I got out my point and shoot camera &amp; took some before pictures. Oh, my gosh, the pictures I took wouldn&#x27;t prove anything. Apparently the cameras used to take before photos are of a different quality than my point and shoot. So, I am sorry, but I will not be able to provide evidence for you to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a fair complexion which is sprinkled  with light colored freckles.  As a natural stawberry blonde, I sunburn easily. I&#x27;ve never been a sun worshiper so I don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, just  normal aging wrinkles. In my 50&#x27;s, my eyelids started getting what I call  &#x27;creepy, wrinkly&#x27; looking (just looked it up &amp; the term is crepey).  The  wrinkles looked even worse if I wore frosted eye shadow. I eventually stopped wearing most eye shadows &amp; opted instead for a natural, matte color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using  Perfective Ceutical Anti-aging eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor  for about 2 1/2 weeks now and saw results quickly. The skin around my eyes looks younger, the crepey eye lids have improved enough that frosted eye shadow doesn&#x27;t look all that bad on me now, but I&#x27;m not planning on going back to it. My crow&#x27;s feet are less defined. They&#x27;re still there - they haven&#x27;t disappeared - yet they&#x27;re not as noticeable. I  have small bags under my eyes  which have improved.  Although some days, they&#x27;re back..so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.  I never had dark circles under my eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on that claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began as instructed, by applying a pea-sized amount of lotion to my eye area twice a day. That amount ended up being more than enough for two eyes.  So I&#x27;m using less now. Being a thrifty person, I also experimented by using this product once a day. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to discover that I had much better results when I used  Perfective Ceutical Eye Cream twice a day.  So twice a day it is.  This eye cream isn&#x27;t heavy  &amp; is absorbed quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance. Although I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I experienced irritated, watery eyes when I first began using it. After emailing customer service for suggestions, I figured out that I was too careless when I applied the lotion. I was getting it into the corners of my eyes. As soon as I started applying the cream more carefully &amp; avoiding all eye contact, the irritation stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summing up, my crow&#x27;s feet are less defined, my crepey eye lids have improved a lot, &amp; on most days, my under-eye bags  aren&#x27;t as puffy. The skin around my eyes definitely looks younger now.  And actually, when I use this eye cream along with [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] &amp; [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]]  twice a day, I&#x27;ve been told that I look 10 years younger.  My wrinkles haven&#x27;t disappeared, but are less noticeable. My skin is more  youthful looking.  Just remember that my skin isn&#x27;t sun damaged and most of my wrinkles aren&#x27;t deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not store this product in extreme heat or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product guarantee copied from Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; products are designed to be sold exclusively by dermatologists and dermatology professionals.

    <li> Best eye cream ! Ever spend my money on. My eyes kids feels tighter. My Baggie eyes are better too. I&#x27;ll definitly continue this product !</li>
    <li> Purchased the eye cream to compliment the moisturizer based on the great reviews. The eye cream was rich but firm and glided under the eye area. I noticed the wrinkles around my eye area looking more firm. This product is amazing! I saw immediate results with firmness around the delicate eye area and the crows feet looked less prominent. Highly recommend. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I am 52 and have use many an eye cream but I have to say this one is the very best eye cream I have used yet .Perfective Ceuticals eye cream is very easy to use and because of it great ingredients its a power house.I saw results very quickly it works very had to undo damage and aging around the eye area. I saw that it really helped me have much younger and fresher looking eyes and I so happy I got to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The company did send me a sample but I loved it so much I did a video review for it so all my friends can really see the difference it made in the appearance of my eye area. I really love it and think you will as well, Perfective Ceuticals eye therapy cream is an exceptional eye cream that will hold up to its promises.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works or not, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t notice anything different under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 14 days in a row, applying a pea-sized amount to the over and under eye areas. I&#x27;ve been applying twice a day, once in the morning, and before bed. I can actually feel it working, very gentle to the skin, and no irritations noted. At age 62, and never using this product before, I can compare it to other eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the last 10 years. None of the other products showed good results as this product does. The pump container is light, easy to use, and stores nicely in any space. My eyes needed therapy between my age, stress, and the intense heat in Arizona. I&#x27;m impressed how fast it began to work, and have decided to use this product as my only eye cream therapy for the future. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~Disclosure: This product was sent to me by Perfective Ceuticals in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I use Perfective Ceuticals eye cream over the Perfective Ceuticals serum and then add a layer of Perfective Ceuticals cream for night time. In the morning, I repeat but add a layer of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took before and after photos three weeks apart and let my kids tell me which photos look better. I didn&#x27;t tell them which was which, but they said the after photos look better because I \\&quot;look younger.\\&quot; That&#x27;s all I needed to know that the Perfective Ceuticals line of skin care products really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream may be expensive, but just a little dab will do ya, literally. The directions to apply a pea-size amount is really too much. I describe it more as a pinhead-size for each eye. It&#x27;s lasted me more than three weeks and hopefully much longer. This is something I want to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Perfective Ceuticals.</li>
