<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are smaller than I expected and don&#x27;t give off too much of a scent. However, the ingredients left my skin feeling very soft, which I loved.</li>
    <li> These are great little bath bombs. I love the scents and love the fact that there are no dyes and dried herbs (both of which leaves the tub dirty) like there are in other bath bombs. The packaging is adorable and would make a great gift.  I think the only negative is that they dissolve very quickly, but that&#x27;s a minor thing because they smell amazing and leave my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Gave these bath bombs to a friend for her birthday. She loved them</li>
    <li> Me and my husband just got married and our house includes a tub so we really wanted to make the most of it. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the tub but he goes in almost every night to relax his muscles. But he doesn&#x27;t like the bubbles that tend to overflow so I heard about bath bombs and wanted to give it a try and he absolutely loved it. He tried the pink grapefruit energizer yesterday for the first time and we felt the difference on his skin when he got out. I would love to see more of a selection maybe some fruity flavors :) but overall I would give it a 5 star rating! Good work!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw the owners took the time to ask about my experience with the bath bombs and I have to say they were such a joy to talk to. Julie shared a beautiful story of how they came up with this product and how they made their imagination into reality. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> These are great. They smell incredible and make your skin very soft. The only thing I wish were different was that it would change the color of the water. Other than that small, minor, thing, everyone should get these!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my mom. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product and reliable service.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Will order from again!</li>
    <li> leaves ur skin feeling soft and pampered&lt;br /&gt;non dyed makes cleanup a piece of cake&lt;br /&gt;i would buy these again in a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to say a negative it would be that the box came dented and does not close...but really a box is just a box :)&lt;br /&gt;4 stars!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and very nice company.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Excellent bath bomb. This leaves my skin soft and moisturized.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I initially ordered this for a friend&#x27;s birthday. It&#x27;s natural, organic, vegan, and all that good stuff that she likes. When I received the package, I my nose was bombarded with beautiful scents. I gave it to her shortly afterwards, but I figured I wanted my own. I&#x27;ve never used bath bombs before, so I figured since I have a bath tub, I might as well add a bath bomb experience to my pampering ritual that I have every 2-3 weeks. I got this set I think about 2 months ago, but I only got around to using it last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the grapefruit one and it was amazing! I was amused with the fizzing and dispersion of the bath bomb into the water. The oils immediately merged with the water and the scent was incredible! I tried to cut the bath bomb in half since I didn&#x27;t want to use the whole piece, but after that proved to be a bit dangerous, I just figured I would buy more in the future if I liked it, and I LOVED it!!!! I will definitely be buying more in the future!!! My skin felt so soft and nourished!!! I felt so relaxed and happy! ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend. She absolutely loved it. I asked how long she was in the bath for, and she told me she honestly lost track of time she was enjoying it so much. She said they were incredibly fragrant and the essential oils left her skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Superb customer service and an incredible product.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom for her birthday and she loved them!</li>
    <li> These are simply amazing bath bombs.  They make the bathroom smell beautiful even the next day after you&#x27;ve used one.  We will definitely be reordering more.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are okay. I like the scent, but the leave an oily film on top of the water and on the sides of the bath tub. Other than that, they smell nice and fizz up well. The come packaged as the image shows, in a tin box with a clear lid so you can see inside. I sent some to a sibling for a birthday gift and it was well-received,</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; service!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!! Love, Love these bombs!! Even got my hubby hooked on them. And the customer service, OUTSTANDING!!! You can not go wrong with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was delighted with the letter I received via e-mail. I am going to give a copy to the young  friend in Indonesia that I  am giving the bath  bombs to in a few days. I am sure she will be thrilled with them.</li>
    <li> Very good service, good product, great price.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely amazing, I&#x27;ve asked Santa for many more for Christmas!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product which mae a friend very happy this Christmas. Will buy again. Seller is very eager to please and was very helpful. Lovely packaging.</li>
    <li> outstanding bath bombs, bring bathing to a new level. Relaxing, soothing and energizing all in one. Love them all. Very high quality product that I will use over and over again. Highly recommend. Seller is easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Product was better than I expected.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loved these...such a delicious way to turn an ordinary bath into a special one :-)</li>
    <li> They are very small for the price you pay!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Mother&#x27;s Day. She has two very active little boys...she didn&#x27;t wait for Mother&#x27;s Day to use one. LOL...She said she liked them. They looked just like the package photo posted online and came right on time.</li>
    <li> Great product, as this is my second time ordering. Great bath bombs my wife and kids apparently cant get enough of.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the Rejuvelle bath bombs, Mother&#x27;s day was a huge success. Every mother deserves to be pampered, and I think a nice warm scented bath should do the trick. If your mother is stressed out and wants to get away from reality--even for just a moment, I think the bath bombs will be the perfect solution to relieve the body and mind. My mom feels like a goddess living in complete bliss and I believe this was the best Mother&#x27;s day gift so far.</li>
    <li> I gave them to my wife and she loves them! She loves the smell and how they make her skin feel. These aren&#x27;t the first bath salts she has tried but these work far better than the others.</li>
    <li> ME and my kids love these bath bombs. Always exciting with different aroma each time.</li>
    <li> My wife loves them! She has yet to pick a favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving Rejuvelle 5 stars because they were great in getting my order to me quickly and their correspondence and information regarding the product I purchased was invaluable.  This is a Christmas gift for my d-in-law so I haven&#x27;t used them personally but if they live up to the experience I&#x27;ve had thus far, they will be awesome!  The Bath Bombs Gift Set looked exactly like the representation and was wrapped in plastic to protect the packaging.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend the company &amp; the product.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> These were purchased as a gift for a relative and she really loves them. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Julie and Alexa are a very personable duo that believe in their wonderful products. I purchased these bath bombs as a gift, and I have only heard good things about them.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Bath Bomb Gift Set as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it. The product was everything as described and very luxurious to use. She said she felt very relaxed and refreshed after her bath.  I will definitely purchase other products from this seller.</li>
    <li> This really made a nice gift...My sister loved it</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are great! They smell nice and soothe my dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> I did not use them right away because of getting sick over the holidays.  I wanted to wait until I could better enjoy them after the start of the new year.</li>
    <li> My sweet honey bought me a tin of these luxury bath bombs for Mother&#x27;s Day and they have become my favorites (my 3-year old son too!)! We are bath bomb connoisseurs in my household, and used to buy bombs from Lush for about $7 a piece until we tried Rejuvelle. Lush bombs honestly do not even compare to the quality of these...the essential oils in the Rejuvelke moisturize my skin post bath as if I had put on an after bath body oil. If we are comparing - Lush bath bombs are colorful and fun - Rejuvelle bombs do not turn the bath colors or create a bubble bath effect but my son who loves that didn&#x27;t even care because he didn&#x27;t have to put on lotion after our bath. It&#x27;s not too much oil however, just the right amount as bombs are about the size of a plum so in a full bath it is the perfect balance. I do not work for this company and I have never even left an Amazon review even though I order products here all the time. Also, they are natural (no parabens, synthetic fragrances, etc that might irritate skin). You need these!!</li>
    <li> These were great!! They filled the bathroom with relaxing scents, didn&#x27;t color the tub and the oils left my skin soft so I didn&#x27;t need lotion. Highly recommend 😀</li>
    <li> These Bombs are beautifully scented! I ordered these with a Amazon gift card and was so pleased when they arrived. I usually buy the lush bombs but since the nearest shop is hours away, I tried these. The thing you will love about these bombs are that they are more reasonable priced then the mall bombs. They have very pleasing scents that last in your bathroom for hours after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also come in a cool tin that can be repurposed. Mine even had a pretty red silk ribbon tied around it. you will feel pampered with these bombs for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt soft and scented after my bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My high school son even tried the lavender one. He likes to soak after sports practices and he usually just pours in epson salts into the tub. He added a bomb and now its part of his routine to have a epson/Rejuvelle soak!</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing!  Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> The woman gifted loved it...I, however, have yet to try it. Doesn&#x27;t matter as the gift given was it&#x27;s own reward several times over. Superb product.</li>
    <li> These were great!! They made a wonderful gift and I would recommend using them all the time.</li>
    <li> my wife loves them - they smell very nice and are attractively packaged.</li>
    <li> The product is fine, however, what I really like in a product/business is respect for privacy. I prefer a product that does not email me after purchase and require me to unsubscribe from further emails. Since all products purchased online now seem to do that, here is a perfect opportunity to make your product better than the rest by not emailing after purchase. In fact I would pay more for a product if it promised never to email me after purchase and said so clearly in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you for the option to unsubscribe, however I would prefer not to be subscribed in the first place and have to take the time to unsubscribe. In the last 3 weeks since Xmas I must have had to unsubscribe from at least 30 different vendors.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife for Mothers Day.  She loves them.  May need to buy more as now my daughter wants to use them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my very special lady. She absolutely loved the product. They smell absolutely amazing, and they are very easy on the bathtub not leaving a total mess once the tub is drained and rinsed using the shower head. I am pleased that the next morning I do not have to get into a shower that looks like a crime scene with all the coloring that competitors leave after a night-before-bath! Very pleased, and I will be ordering another set for her soon. They smell great, they leave no mess and best of all is they are all natural. Very, very good product! She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy; which means we are all happy!!</li>
    <li> Brought for my step - mother, who really enjoyed it.  Postage prompt!</li>
    <li> They are a gift so I haven&#x27;t used them, but the packaging is nice and they smell heavenly. I know my friend is going to love them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful relaxing and moisturizing effect.  Beautifully packaged.</li>
    <li> Love them! My skin feels soft, and I feel relaxed after using these!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom for her birthday, I can&#x27;t give personal feedback but she said she loves them!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my daughter.  She didn&#x27;t like them at all.  They did not live up to their description or do what bath bombs are designed to do.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter in Brooklyn. They are elegantly packaged and, although smaller than many bath bombs, she says they are just as aromatic. Would happily buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loved them.</li>
    <li> lovely products - used the grapefruit one last night and it was divine!</li>
    <li> This was my first time with a bath bomb. Love the fizziness, the scents, the fact that it has natural ingredients and oils which moisturize your skin while you&#x27;re relaxing. Great gift idea. Also, not expensive at all! Packaging is really cute too.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are amazing. I purchased 2 for gifts and they absolutely loved them! The aroma is very nice and soothing.</li>
    <li> I bought them twice one for Christmas and they left my wife&#x27;s skin so soft I order again as surprise that says enough.</li>
    <li> Great product! Loved it! Smells wonderful &amp; makes your skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Great great great!!!! Leaves your skin silky smooth, but do not try washing your hair in it or it&#x27;ll get oily.</li>
    <li> Smell nice though pretty small</li>
    <li> Just right scent:  indulgent but not overwhelming.  The bombs dissolve readily in the bathwater.  Husband seal of approval:  just right moisturizing for my skin without coming out feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this will be the fifth box I&#x27;ve ordered.  I wish the company would offer a box with a full dozen -- feel bad about recycling all those empty tins, although they are nice enough to re-use.  Because they aren&#x27;t cheap, I&#x27;ve been sampling a LOT of similar products from Amazon, including other bath bombs.  Nothing came close to what these Bath Bombs offer in terms of moisturizing and lovely scents.  I&#x27;ve researched making my own bath bombs to save money, but when I saw what it takes, decided that Rejuvelle can do it for me!  They do it right</li>
    <li> Just used my Rejuvelle Bath bombs for the first time. Let me first say that the fragrance of the bath bombs are so soothing! Each one bomb smells delightful! I am very happy with my purchase! The bombs left my skin feeling so smooth and rejuvenated!! It even helped with my eczema some!! Thank you! I will be making this purchase again once I have used all my bombs! :) happy customer and I am thinking of purchasing some for my niece who also suffers from eczema!</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loves them. I will definitely be buying them again</li>
    <li> I received these as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift and I love them! They smell amazing, and my skin felt so soft and smooth after my first bath. Absolute great value for the price!</li>
    <li> My son purchased these bath bombs as a gift for his girlfriend.  For a week before her birthday, the tin sat on the table in the living room and filled the space with such lovely scents.  Will definitely purchase some for my own bath the next time I&#x27;m ready to splurge a little on myself.</li>
    <li> Great customer service and a great product :)</li>
    <li> Fast and they were an awesome Mother&#x27;s Day gift</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are wonderful. Each bath bomb smells divine. They are color-free so you don&#x27;t worry about leaving a colored ring around the tub. My skin is sensitive to certain fragrances and chemicals, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with these. They are gentle and you come out of your bath baby soft! I sliced mine in half so I get twice as many luxurious baths. Will definitely buy again for gifts and treat-yo-self days.</li>
    <li> I purchased these bath bombs for my college-age daughter and she loves them!  They are a bit smaller than some of the other brands she has used; however, these bath bombs are just as fizzy, fragrant and luxurious as the bigger (and more expensive) bath bombs and leave her skin feeling soft and moisturized.  Being health and skin sensitivity conscious, we both love the fact that the Rejuvelle bath bombs are all natural and do not contain harsh chemicals or colors.  We also appreciate that these bath bombs are made in the USA!  Thank you, Rejuvelle, for a fun, safe and superior skin care product!  We will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom and she loves them. She has always been a &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; person. Thought I would pamper her!</li>
    <li> What a gift set and Bath bombs really rejuvenate and it comes for a long time. It comes beautifully boxed and no need of any extra wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift set and self buy.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for a teenage girl.  She tells me she loves them.  Success.</li>
    <li> Love the bath bombs!! The essential oils are very nice.</li>
    <li> Gave as wedding shower gift</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are VERY small! The photos make them look bigger. This product is very misrepresented! each bath bomb is wrapped in a piece of colored tissue paper. But the reality is that these bath bombs are all white, small and very cheap quality. I say, buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Loved it so much thank you so much</li>
    <li> Finally got to try these bath bombs and I love them!  Firstly, there are no bubbles, not a deal breaker for me especially with these bombs.  Run your water, drop the bomb in and you can see the fizzles in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about these bombs, is the oils that are used to make them; (they are all natural) but when you step into the water, it is such a luxuriating experience!  Your skin does not dry out at all, your skin remains so soft you never want to come out the bath tub!  Now, for the smell, oh my goodness, the smell permeates the air and it lingers.  I tried the Garden of the Gods and it is a lovely scent, whilst lingering is not at all overpowering so much so the next morning I could still smell the scent on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service from these ladies is just as amazing as their bath bombs!  I would definitely buy these bombs again and highly recommend this seller.  Julie and Alexa, thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift, and the recipient loved them! These make a great gift!</li>
    <li> Great product, purchased them for my younger sister as a birthday present.  Even compared to the lush bath bombs these seem to be more natural since they do not leave any residue or dye on your bathtub.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. My husband purchased them as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for me. Being pregnant, I was concerned about the fragrance being too strong. I think these do a great job of being fragrant without being overpowering, and of moisturizing without making your skin feel oily. I also think they are a good size. I took a bath with an entire bath bomb and it was very enjoyable. I also broke some of the others up to use multiple times and found them equally enjoyable. I will be requesting these again as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have purchased these for my wife before, and she absolutely loves them. I have no complaints. I bought them again as a Christmas gift for her.</li>
    <li> Gave as a birthday. My friend loved the packaging and raved about the product quality. As good as LUSH brand.</li>
    <li> Love these!! Especially the stress relief one :)  they make my skin extra soft! No mess in the tub either.</li>
    <li> I purchased the bath bombs for my Mother in Law and she absolutely loves them!</li>
    <li> Smells great and left my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> These things are awesome</li>
    <li> These are the best bath bombs I have tried to date! I will certainly buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> great product, my mother in law loves them</li>
    <li> I Bought These as a gift for someone else but when I opened the box and smelled them I ended up keeping them for myself very nice</li>
    <li> I quit taking bath and then my daughter sent my the Rejuvelle bath bomb gift set to me for Mother&#x27;s Day and now I look forward to long luxurious baths again!  Then on her birthday, I sent my daughter a gift set and now she loves them, too! I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> The bath bombs were perfectly packaged. Perfect gift for anyone. I purchased this product twice and could not be happier. My skin feels soft and smooth. The fragrances are amazing. I received the best customer care I&#x27;ve ever experienced from this company. I highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mother-in-law. The packaging was excellent! I didn&#x27;t open them to smell them or anything since they were a gift. But I would definitely recommend them, especially for the price! :)</li>
    <li> smells great.  my wife was thrilled.  thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend. She loved them. It was great to be able to purchase and support a smaller business that provides high quality and safe merchandise at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great product, really enjoyed. I liked it so much I gave it to my sister as a gift too.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great mothers day present, she was very pleased. Will happily buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product with reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and oily.</li>
    <li> Very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;The wife and I both enjoy using these.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom and she loved them. She was more relaxed after using them. Also the tin it comes in is handy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Great delivery! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a gift. They are in a nice box with a ribbon, and each one is individually wrapped. They arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing!!  Love them!!</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh, these bath bombs are just lovely.  The fizz is fun (and apparently quite healthful as your skin absorbs the magnesium and bicarbonate or carbon dioxide), the fragrances are delicious, and the oils leave your skin moisturized without being greasy.  On my first order, when I saw some of the titles of &amp;#34;Stressed Mom&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Yoga Sunrise&amp;#34;, I immediately thought of giving them to a friend of mine.  However, I remembered she is very sensitive to a lot of things, and figured there would be stuff that would probably irritate her skin.  Then I got email from the company, and when I read these were created because the young daughter had an autoimmune skin condition, I looked to see what the ingredients were, and they all looked very good, nothing that should irritate anyone&#x27;s skin.  So, I did give that set to my friend, and ordered another set for myself.  I have used several of them, and just love them!</li>
    <li> Amazing, absolutely amazing! I bought them as a gift for my mother on her birthday ans she fell in love. I will definitely be coming back for more later on. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! Your services were fast and convenient! Thank you</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with my purchase. Definitely found a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> The bombs dissolve very fast and last through the whole bath. Nice and relaxing.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are just plain awesome. Not only do they make my entire bedroom smell fantastic, but they leave my skin oh so soft! All 6 bombs smell terrific - there&#x27;s not a bad one in the bunch, if you&#x27;re worried about that like I was. A +</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The size is just right for a fragrant soothing bath. Nice variety of bath bombs in the tin.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Sent them as a Mother&#x27;s day gift and she loved them!</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are amazing and my girlfriend loves them,they leave her skin very soft and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister-in-law and myself for Mother&#x27;s Day. They smell delightful and make my skin so soft. Great to use after a long day!! Definitely will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Bath Bombs are excellent. Really enjoying having a relaxed bath. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice tin box they come in. Great for a gift. Smell really good. Have not used them yet.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the product. It moisturized my skin, smelled wonderful, didn&#x27;t stain my tub and was relaxing. In addition, I have bad allergies and I had no negative reaction. They all smell strong in the box together but in the tub the scent is disbursed and calming. It would make a wonderful gift or just a fun treat to relax.</li>
    <li> Relaxing and rejuvenating. I love this product!</li>
    <li> looove these! great on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Got these for my sister as a gift. She loves them!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Very relaxing</li>
    <li> Incredibly fragrant and soothing, these bath bombs really do the trick and make for a great gift for someone in need of relaxation or even yourself if you could use a little of your own. The fragrance can border on overpowering with some of these but for the most part, they&#x27;re very pleasant and once you soak yourself in a bath bomb infused bath for a couple of minutes, it adds to the overall calming effect, Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves skin silky and soft without leaving residue on the tub. No artificial dyes or chemicals so they are safe for the most delicate of skin! I even use these bath bombs while bathing with my 5 month old, he has extremely sensitive skin (as do I ) but the Rejuvelle bombs don&#x27;t irritate him at all. The essential oils give them a wonderful smell with out the harsh additives. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if your skin is easily irritated by other bathing products.</li>
    <li> We received our bath balms right on time. My 17 year old son had me order them for his girlfriend so he can use them to ask her to prom. Be the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; and come with me to prom...She loves bath balms and I am sure she will love these. Thanks for the fast turnaround.</li>
    <li> I ordered 7 of these tins (of 6 bath bombs) to give out as customer gifts for Mothers Day.  They arrived on time within the two days from ordering.  They arrived looking exactly how the picture shows them.  I have not actually used one yet, but my clients are loving them.  I added a tag that reads &amp;#34;Mom, You&#x27;re the BOMB!&amp;#34; I also love that these products came about because of a desire to make some thing natural their daughter could use.  Feels good to support this small company.  Keep up the good work Rejuvelle!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. My friends enjoy them too! This is definitely something I will order again!</li>
    <li> I will be sending this back I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
    <li> I love these so much!! I will definitely buy again. These are Wonderful! 😊</li>
    <li> I gave these out to 4 of my friends as part of a thank u for throwing my baby shower and they all looooooove them! I saved a couple for me and I&#x27;m going to use it tonight. So excited. They had nothing but great things to say about their bath bombs. They smell amazing!</li>
    <li> The GF loves these, and so do I - I don&#x27;t use them, but they make her skin so soft I wish I had an endless supply of them to gift her with. They smell good and she has gone from being a person who was indifferent about bath bombs to looking forward to her next bath with these. They made a great mothers day gift, but I would absolutely argue that they are good for any occasion - If your lady likes to take baths, these bombs will enhance that experience tenfold for her. Pretty amazing product in my opinion - If I ever need baby soft skin for some reason I might take a bath with one myself. The price is on the low side for this type of product as well, so it seems the value is about as good as it gets. I would buy an endless supply if I were financially able to.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully boxed if it is intended to be a gift but once you use one, you won&#x27;t want to part with the others!  Excellent product done right.</li>
    <li> They were ok. Way too much money for what they are.  Should get 8 or 10 for that price.</li>
    <li> &amp;quot;Great care and follow through from seller. I love this product! The seller is right that they are addictive! I can still feel the effects on my skin the next day!&amp;quot;</li>
    <li> This is my second set.  I so loved the first set that I encouraged hubby to order me another set from the kitty cats as a Mothers Day present!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrances are amazing.  They don&#x27;t leave you or the tub slimy.  Perfect size!!!  I&#x27;ve made these a permanent add on my Amazon Wishlist.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, wonderful customer service. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Excellant aromas! Not chemical at all.  Beautifully done.</li>
    <li> Very strong, pleasant fragrance.  They&#x27;re cool because they dissolve like an alka-seltzer in your bathtub.  They leave a fragrant moisturized coating on your body.  I really like these.</li>
    <li> I have used many Bath Bombs in the past and these are by far the best ones EVER!  Love the oils on my skin afterward and of course,&lt;br /&gt;the healthiness.</li>
    <li> I sent these to my wife as a gift when I was away. She had great things to say about the bath bombs and I will be sending her more in the future.</li>
    <li> These are the best and most natural Bath Bombs I have ever used. Will order again..AA++</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;We had issues with the local postman, who may have damaged the package.  After I made a commit to the company they replaced it an no charge.  We will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Bath bombs were ordered as a gift and she loved them!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> As soon as you open the box, you are greeted with pleasant smells. Each bomb had a unique smell, I loved that the sinus decongestion bath bomb actually started clearing my nose before putting it in water. I really enjoy the fact that these bombs are made for sensitive skin. The ingredients are natural, I was surprised that I could actually pronounce all of the ingredients. Great bath bombs for the price!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. This was my first time using a bath bomb. I really liked it and it was easy to use and clean up after. I look forward to trying the other scents.  It definitely moisturized my skin.</li>
    <li> These Bath Bombs have the most wonderful fragrance and are beautifully presented. You can keep them all for yourself or give some away. They don&#x27;t bother my allergies at all. I&#x27;ve used many Bath Bombs over the years and these are among the best. The price is great, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased these bath bombs for my wife for Mother&#x27;s Day. She&#x27;s truly an essential oil aficionado, and was absolutely delighted with this product. She&#x27;s found them to be very potent, effective, and expertly blended. We will definitely be reordering!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift purchase, to which, upon receipt, the recipient expressed much delight.  I was told she had used this or a similar product previously with most pleasing results.</li>
    <li> I love them!!!!  They are great!!!  When you finish your bath, your skin is so soft!!! I would buy them again!!!❤️</li>
    <li> I bought these for a dear friend who works a ton and has little time to relax. She absolutely loves them and has thanked me several times. She said the fragrances smell amazing. I am pleased with my purchase. It was what I wanted and was delivered in time.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom for mother&#x27;s day. She loves them!! She said that they smell wonderful and leave her feeling refreshed and relaxed.</li>
    <li> No color!! I was expecting color... Nice oil touch and smells good, but there&#x27;s no color or anything special... Save your money and go with Lush bombs!</li>
    <li> My wife is addicted to these! But I have to admit they DO smell really, really great!</li>
    <li> My bath bombs arrived today! I love Amazon and was excited to get them there. My son bought me my first set for my birthday back in April. I think they are awesome. I had a severe sinus headache and used the one that said decongesting- and was delighted that I really did get relief!&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder how to break them so I can use each one twice!&lt;br /&gt;About the set that arrived today - I have to decide if I should keep it for myself or introduce my sister to them for her birthday! Hmmm.  Hate to give them up!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway- thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> Love this product your skin looks and feels great, I loved it so much that I gave some to my friends to try and ordered again.</li>
    <li> This product is not how the pictures show. I bought these just to try them out but when I got them the &amp;#34;ribbon&amp;#34; was not like the picture. Instead of a nice beautiful ribbon that you would give a gift with, there was a red elastic string tied into a bow. I wasn&#x27;t going to gift this but if I were to gift it, I would be embarrassed. The &amp;#34;ribbon&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t even on the box when it came to me. It was just in the plastic bag. My second issue was that one of my bath bombs out of the two that I opened so far was crumbling already and fell out onto the floor as soon as I unwrapped it. I would not consider purchasing this product again</li>
    <li> these bath bombs are amaaaazing, I got them as a gift for my friend and she&#x27;s in love with them.</li>
    <li> great smell. Just wish there was more salt per pod</li>
    <li> They smell great, are a good medium size and come in a nice tin box. The oils are great, I really liked the fact that I was able to shave without using anything else!</li>
    <li> They are wonderful!!  Easy to open, unlike others I&#x27;ve used.  They make my skin feel really soft and that seems to last at least 24 hours.  They smell heavenly and truly make bathing luxurious!</li>
    <li> Everything was great. I bought these bath bombs for my wife for Christmas. She loved them so much she let me know that she used them all up before her birthday. Of course she received more and was very happy.</li>
    <li> Great but my only suggestion is to potentially make them easier to break up and use a single one for two separate occasions.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely gorgeous.  They smell amazing, they feel great on your skin and they&#x27;re packaged beautifully.  10/10</li>
    <li> I ordered these recently and received them a few days ago. I have only been able to take one bath so far, but let me tell you..... I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product. My skin felt so soft and smooth after , that I didn&#x27;t even need to moisturize! The aroma is amazing as well, I am extremely satisfied with this product! I love that these are organic ( and gluten free), they are something that even my mother can use while fighting cancer, and being on a chemo medication that won&#x27;t allow her to use most hygiene products. I can&#x27;t wait for her to try them. Again, a very happy customer here, I will definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I would like these bath bombs to bubble and change color faintly but the bombs make my bath smell nice and leave my skin feeling silky. Fast shipping too</li>
    <li> As a father of a 7 month old, it&#x27;s impossible to get out and go shopping. I bought these bath bombs for my wife on Mother&#x27;s Day. She loves them and gives her a chance to relax for a couple of minutes away from everything else in our lives.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for Mother&#x27;s Day this year and have used two of the bombs already this week! They&#x27;ve left my skin so soft! I&#x27;ll be ordering these for friends in the future!</li>
    <li> The bombs were given as a gift to a grateful lady who enjoys them quite a lot, she will buying more in the future, and aside from the LUSH stores, likes these bath bombs the most. Excellent product. !</li>
    <li> I maaaay be a bath junkie... as in I love being in the bathtub because it&#x27;s my excuse to escape from all the crazies, not saying the people in my household are crazy, I&#x27;m just saying that sometimes the people in my household are crazy. Everybody knows! That when I am in the bathtub it is a no cross zone. Send to bother me when I am in the bathtub is it the house is on fire, and maybe not even that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have tried a ridiculous amount of bath products. Bubble bath, fizzies, different oils, I have tried shampoos that say they are great for a bubble bath, I have tried to make my own the last, I took a class so that I could learn how to make bath fizzies, that was catastrophic... I have tried using the bath salts, I hate those. those never seem to even do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now THESE Bath bombs??? Yes. Why yes? Because on besides the fact that each back on is 2 ounces the peace, they are made in the USA, which is a big deal for me because I love products better made in my own country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not just that, but these are also cruelty free, and they are all natural, vegan, and gluten free! If I can read the ingredients and not have to google what something means because its some fortified or filler or chemical based ingredient that is going to be harmful to you either my skin or to my environment, I kind of don&#x27;t ever want to use it. The ingredients and each one of these Bombs are KIND of amazing. Ok, not KIND of... they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could smell these before I even opened the package! Maybe it&#x27;s because they used really sensual oils to infuse every single last one of these to help you relax, distress, detox, or help with sinus relief. And since I live in Florida, best sinus relief will definitely be used. Not tonight, my first one that I&#x27;m going to use is probably going to be stressed moms! the fact that it&#x27;s even called stressed moms is hilarious and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to save the sticker on that one :-)&lt;br /&gt; And hello...  No oil ring around the tub???!!! I am so not telling anyone that because that gives me more time in my bathroom all by myself!!! NO ONE needs to knoooooow. It reminds me of the commercial where the mom throws flour on her forehead? That is so going to be me later..&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is adorable, I love that this company cares about its people, I love that they ar MINE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not one person in this house is allowed to touch my bath bombs! these are mine, all mine, I am totally doing gimme hands, and I actually have the perfect hiding place because I don&#x27;t trust some of these people in this household!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am I love...&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review....

    <li> These were purchased as an extra gift for my wife for mother&#x27;s day.  She loves them.  That&#x27;s all that matters!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Got them for my wife. Made a great full bath of smooth moisturizing water. She soaked in the bath for hours and loved every second of it. Product was shipped on time and came as advertised. I will be ordering another set in the near future. Happy wife &#x3D; happy life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered from Rejuvelle for my wife around 8 times now. She loves them so much I cant order bombs from anywhereelse. Great product!</li>
    <li> My wife really likes these bath bombs. This is the second set I have ordered. They smell great and are really a solid product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Love these!</li>
    <li> Great Product! very affordable, smells great! Made my wife happy!</li>
    <li> My wife loves these bath bombs. She loves that they moisturize rather than dry out her skin. We loved them so much we purchased the assorted pack of 6 again. Look forward to purchasing again and trying other products by Rejuvelle.</li>
    <li> Love them! Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Wife was very happy with your bath bombs.  She loves to relax in the tub with a glass of wine and a lit candle all the while soaking with her bath bomb.  She tells me her skin feels rejuvenated with your product.  Keep up the good work.  Shark Tank possibilities I see in your future.  Good big!  Thanks for making her happy......</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift formy daughter-in/law. She loves them</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom and she absolutely loves them! They leave her skin so soft but no oily residue in the tub. Going to have to get some for myself!</li>
    <li> They are cute, smell super good, and got here almost 4 days early. Wrapping is nice too</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girlfriend. She says that she likes them even more than Lush bath bombs. Highly recommend this product and this family-owned company!</li>
    <li> We purchased these bath bombs for my wife who has enjoyed them immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our 7yr old daughter wanted to try them too. We were concerned because she gets skin rashes from products with strong perfumes and chemicals (like cheap bubble bath and heavily scented body wahses). With simple ingredients, essential oils,  and no dyes in these bath bombs we decided to take a chance. She loved her bath and came out of it with no skin irritations!  We will deffinitely be purchasing them again!</li>
    <li> Fizzy and very very good.  Price is well worth it.  Good Buy</li>
    <li> I bought these bath bombs as a belated Mother&#x27;s Day gift and I gotta say my mom loved them. They are a great gift for any occasion, whether it be a gift or for yourself they provide such a wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my daughter and she loved them!!!!</li>
    <li> Highly satisfied for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Quality&lt;br /&gt;2. Look and Feel&lt;br /&gt;3. Delivery</li>
    <li> Great bath bombs!  Got them for my wife and their aroma is so strong and relaxing - it&#x27;s great!  Definitely leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  We loved that these, unlike many cheap ones we&#x27;ve used before, were well formed and didn&#x27;t crumble and fall apart to quickly dissolve.  It stayed together until it finally, slowly, disappeared into the water.  Didn&#x27;t leave lines in the bathtub (from dyes), smelled great.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, 1 of the best i ever had</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Mom was very happy with this part of her birthday gift...</li>
    <li> These were delivered very quickly. They are hand made by a couple that needed them to be healthy. They smell woundeful, fizz for quite a while, and come beautifully packaged. Now here&#x27;s the BEST part I&#x27;m sure you know that big company that thinks theirs are LUSHish, well these are better, healthier, and cost less! I will always be buying my bath bombs from Rejuvelle!</li>
    <li> Very ineffective. Nothing blew up. No boom. No fireworks. Maybe I got a dud, who knows. All I know is she was supposed to die and all that happened was fizzy water. I&#x27;m going to have to resort to throwing in a toaster.</li>
    <li> My client loved them!</li>
    <li> Colorful and beautiful packaging.  Bought this for myself but I can see how it would make a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> I came across these a couple of years back and ordered them for a friend who was sick at the time. I live in the UK and she lives in West Virginia USA.  She loves them so much that I buy them quite regularly now. Last Christmas I could not get any so I ordered an alternative, but they were not so nice. I have never seen or smelt them but I know my friend loves them.&lt;br /&gt;A great product to make someone smile.</li>
    <li> It make the lady happy, so I&#x27;m happy. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received these three days earlier than expected. When they arrived, I opened the box and they smelled amazing. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look great in my bathroom and cannot wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> My son bought me some of this for Mother&#x27;s day and I have been hooked every since.  Great product and your skin is SO SOFT!  AND I just keep buying it!  In fact, I also gave some as gifts to a couple of ladies in my neighborhood and they are also hooked.  The product speaks for itself, you should try it.</li>
    <li> I really love your bath bomb! I wish you could make them as large as the Lush Bath Bombs. I have a large Soaking Tub and I find I need to use 2 of your bath balls to get the same effect as 1 Lush Ball. It would be nice option to buy small or large. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Tamra Harrington</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVEEEE them. Fast shipping, they all smell amazing.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Beautifully packaged - product is divine. Produced such a luxurious bath experience with lovely scents. Thrilled to have gotten them at this orice range. Surpassed my expectations.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nothing like a good soak in the tub...especially with these little gems! Aromatic and soothing. Your skin and your soul feel renewed!&lt;br /&gt;Great gift to myself!</li>
    <li> The girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are divine!  They smell amazing and leave your skin smooth and moisturized! Will definintely purchase more!</li>
    <li> These are great, they smell amazing, they make your skin feel silky in the tub and out of the tub.  I love that they are natural without the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great addition to a relaxing bath!</li>
    <li> They smell fantastic. They make your skin so soft and silky. When I use these it is the best bath I could ever have. I feel as though I am having a spa day.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are amazing!  They&#x27;really spa quality.  They leave a moisturizing layer on top of the water that leaves your skin feeling amazing!  Grear gift for someone and they come packaged really cute.  Definitely would buy these again!</li>
    <li> They are small but dissolve well and feel soft.</li>
    <li> Bought this product as a gift for Mother&#x27;s Day. My mom loved it!  She said that they smelled wonderful and made her skin feel very soft. I will definitely buy from them again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love them, really make me feel good, the bad news is I called in sick to work so I could stay in the Tub</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nearly done with my second round of these bath bombs. I tried a different brand, but these are far superior. I love that they don&#x27;t have artificial irritants and I am in LOVE with the scents. Each one smells unique, and sometimes I have a tough time picking which one to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small though they may be, they fizz just as long as larger ones I have used. I don&#x27;t find a residue in my tub and my skin does feel softer. I like that they now sell the sinus/allergy bomb in a set of six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much more to say on these...except that I&#x27;m saving up to buy them for a third time! Now if only my apartment tub weren&#x27;t so small and shallow...</li>
    <li> Gave a new dimension to the bath experience.  Enjoyed the scents as well.</li>
    <li> Love them!  Great gift too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to try them (more of a shower guy) but my wife loves the bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves these. more affordable than Lush bombs and a better size for one bath!</li>
    <li> bought these as a gift for my sister. they were shipped very quickly and arrived on time even though we ordered them last minute. she is very excited to try them and is pleased they are gentle enough to use with her toddler as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a xmas gift.  My wife loved it.  All you husbands should buy this for your wife.  You will get husband points.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used the vanilla bath bomb and the \\&quot;Garden of the Gods\\&quot; bath bomb, both are fantastic. It has organic ingredients and essential oils so it made my skin really soft after the bath. Great gift. Even got a sweet little card that said I could use the code to get 25% off my next purchase, what a nice company!</li>
    <li> I ordered these bath bombs for a woman who is like my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day. She absolutely loved them. She said her skin was so soft and moisturized after her bath that she didn&#x27;t even have to put lotion on.</li>
    <li> Loved them... but I&#x27;m taking away 1 star because they are not as bubbly or fizzy as i was hoping or expecting.  Also I do wish you could find more Rejuvelle sets, or at least have a choice of limiting the bombs to the 2, 3, 4, or whatever types you like in particular.  Its hard to buy these at a reasonable price outside this set.  So if there is one particular &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; you dont like.. or do like... to bad.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift. Although I have not personally used these, they do smell wonderful! The woman I gave them to told me she loved them and asked where I got them.</li>
    <li> My mom loved them for Mothers Day</li>
    <li> I was wanting to try something new but also stick with a natural bath bomb, these are amazing! They smell absolutely fantastic and leave your skin feeling super soft all night long. I have done the congestion relief one and it worked so well for me, also relaxing my muscles at the same time of clearing up some of my congestion. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again and I think I&#x27;ll get some as gifts for some girlfriends or family, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased these bath bombs as a gift for my wife, and she loved them. She can be difficult to shop for when holidays come around, but these were a real winner. So far she has used two of them, and she is already hinting that she would like more. I would recommend these for anyone seeking a gift for that special someone.</li>
    <li> Bought it for girlfriend she loves it. Now I have to buy more. 😐</li>
    <li> worst &amp;#34;bath bombs&amp;#34; ever, when you put them in the tub they don&#x27;t change the color of the water or even change the aroma to soothe and allow you to relax in the bath, if you place salt in your bath it would be more effective</li>
    <li> I Love the citrus ones! I don&#x27;t care overmuch for the lavender, but it IS a variety pack.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:31378c4ba898d606676e77b53a51ece2]] First off, I was so impressed by the quality of these bath bombs. They are USA made and only use natural products. There is literally NO scary chemicals, and not even dyes. I can plop one into my tub and fill up my whole bathroom with relaxing fragrant smells. They don&#x27;t leave rings around the tub, only soft wonderful smelling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must Try ! You&#x27;ll want to get everyone a set !</li>
    <li> Product was quick and recipient was pleased! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> These are great!! Very moisturizing! Smells fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and she said that they were amazing!  She wasn&#x27;t expecting much besides fizzy bath bombs and these were moisturizing and wonderful!  She recommended that I buy some for myself!!</li>
    <li> Amazing qualityand makes a great gift</li>
    <li> Hello, I purchased these for my cousin&#x27;s birthday as she loves bath products.  She was very pleased, said they smell fantastic and make her whole home smell good for some time.  I would recommend.  They also came very nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> The smells are good!! I&#x27;ve tried the light purple (Stressed Moms) or dark green (Sinns Congestion Relief) one, love both. I like how the essential oil dispersed in the water after the bath bombs being dissolved. The oil really smoothed my skin. I will buy more in the future whenever we are not in drought...</li>
    <li> They are absolutely amazing my wife LOVES them</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these! I have terribly dry skin and weather change can really take it&#x27;s toll. These leave my skin feel hydrated and luscious. The scent is amazing, there&#x27;s even one that helps if you&#x27;re congested . Overall, these are a must have for stressful days when you need something to help you relax on a budget. Also, I prefer these over the Lush brand, which I decided to try after buying these. These are much more hydrating and fizzy.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer for these Bath Bombs and love them.  I orignally bought these as a gift for my wife so she could pamper herself....then the kids got to them....then I got to them.  We all love them and highly recommend them.  As an aside, my son has eczema and these bath bombs have improved his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly recommend these bath bombs.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are super fun and rejuvenating. They left my skin soft and I was relaxed for the rest on my day.</li>
    <li> Excellent bath bombs!  I bought one set for me and one for my daughter.  We really like the scents.  Received the product really fast after ordering....impressive.....Bath bombs are high quality but somewhat expensive..</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and excellent product!</li>
    <li> They were smaller than I expected. Smells nice amd nicely packaged but rather plain out of pckg</li>
    <li> Was a gift for mom. It arrived on time and in great condition, and she is absolutely thrilled. Perfect gift for her (92 yrs old).</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for my great niece &amp; loved that they were free of chemicals. They smelled great in container &amp; my granddaughter &amp; I were a little jealous....would have been wrong to keep them, right!?! My great niece loved them &amp; I had such positive feedback from this small company. I am very impressed by their story &amp; commitment to quality. I plan on getting for myself &amp; doing some early Christmas shopping for all the bath lovers in the family!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s girlfriend loves these bath bombs! They were easy to order and arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> My mother purchased these for me as a gift. I was having the most stressful week of my life! However, I caught a few minutes of solice in my tub with these little balls of wonder! Just buy them.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived exactly as promised. It was the perfect birthday gift for my friend. She can&#x27;t stop talking about the bombs and actually had to fight her children to keep them to herself.</li>
    <li> Hey!!! I sent those bath bombs to my fianc&amp;eacute;e, and she loves them. I look forward to doing further business with you.</li>
    <li> These bombs were packaged really well.  My friend liked very much!</li>
    <li> Loved these bath bombs. They almost seemed to actually mouisturize my skin. They smell good too!</li>
    <li> Great product and value, quick shipping!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom who is a total bath junkie - she LOVES them!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love these bath bombs! They make my whole bathroom smell delicious even when they&lt;br /&gt;are just sitting in the box. The packaging is super cute. This would make a great&lt;br /&gt;gift. I&#x27;m loving that there are no horrible chemicals in these bath bombs. They make&lt;br /&gt;my skin feel great. I&#x27;m pregnant so I&#x27;ve been taking lots of baths and these make the&lt;br /&gt;experience very nice! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> AWESOME! SMELL SO GOOD!</li>
    <li> Sadly they are TINY about the size of two of your hands together. I was very sad about that when I got it.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a present for my Special Needs who has Angelmans Syndrome. The only complaints I have is there are no bubbles and the coconut oil is a little on the heaven side. More kid friendly flavored would be great as well.</li>
    <li> I bought the bath bombs for my wife, who thinks they&#x27;re great and won&#x27;t take a bath without one now. I prefer to shower, but at least once a week after a heavy workout, I like to soak in a hot bath to soothe and relax my muscles. Curious, I tried one of the bombs in my bath this week and it was amazing. The aroma and fizz add a new dimension to bathing; a totally new experience. I added more hot water and stayed  in longer than normal..</li>
    <li> I just love these so much! They come in a cute box with a bow! Perfect  gift! They also smell great! Also the price is so reasonable compared to other brands! Love this product and will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I like these bath bombs.  They make the water soft and the scents help me to relax.</li>
    <li> Love everything about these. Will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> I gave these out to 4 of my friends as part of a thank u for throwing my baby shower and they all looooooove them!  I saved a couple for me and I&#x27;m going to use it tonight. So excited. They had nothing but great things to say about their bath bombs. They smell amazing!</li>
    <li> Sent as a gift. Will buy more!!</li>
    <li> I actually bought these as a gift for a friend as she was leaving the company where we&#x27;ve worked together for roughly 15 years. She is absolutely delighted with them and says they&#x27;ve opened up a new area of self-indulgence for her -- something of the ultimate bath experience variety.  Hmm, I might need to get some for myself!</li>
    <li> Bath Bomb was great. They smell wonderful and make for a perfect bath!</li>
    <li> Wonderful silky smooth  and smell delicious for the bath. our second purchase as we love these bath bombs. No artificial smells, all natural. My daughter who suffers from eczema finds total relief from soaking in these.</li>
    <li> These are a real treat. 1 was enough for my large, deep tub. My skin felt soft and moisturizers afterward. If I didn&#x27;t like the product so much, I would have used them as sachets for my dresser drawers.  They smell so good.  They are packaged in a cute tin.  I intend to send them as gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law. She absolutely loved them! She said she had used them before and they were great. I&#x27;m thinking I will get some for myself now.  Mother&#x27;s Day is just around the corner!!! hint. hint.</li>
    <li> yummy smells good feels good while you are bathing. great product. nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girlfriend at first. She loved them. I ordered a second batch for my mother and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them too. You guys are great! Thanks a lot. Hope you succeed!</li>
    <li> I love these.  I&#x27;ve bought them for myself and for others as gifts.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; The wife love these bath bombs. Quick delivery. Will order more for Christmas</li>
    <li> Amazing!  The BEST bath bombs I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I am a bath junkie, and I have used a ton of different bath products. I used my first Rejuvelle bath bomb last week, and I am pretty hooked. The scent was amazing without being overpowering, and my skin felt so soft and smooth after! Also it did not leave a ton of residue on the tub, which has happened with other products and is definitely a post bath buzz kill. I am looking forward to my next bath ....</li>
    <li> Great fun healthy product!!!</li>
    <li> I never tried bath bombs before but these sucked me in! And the fact that I got 6 of them for such a good price was awesome. They smell fantastic and really do leave your skin mousturized. I&#x27;m already thinking about buying more and I haven&#x27;t even finished my first set!</li>
    <li> These are the perfect bath bombs!  Definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I love the fragrances and packaging, and they are untinted, so there&#x27;s no ring left in your tub or on your skin.  Very moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve already given them as gifts to friends!</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are lovely. Packaged nicely and smell wonderful. This company will send you a personalized thank you and ask how you are liking the product, which I adore. They also sent me coupons. I have used one bomb for my 3 year old&#x27;s bath thus far. She has mild eczema and it calmed down some spots &amp; relaxed her after a long day of Easter sugar. Yowza. I didn&#x27;t even need to lotion her up afterwards. They smell wonderful and they didn&#x27;t leave a ring around the tub that I had to scrub. Great product &amp; company.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Bought these for my teenage daughter and she loves them! Her skin felt very soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> These are the best Bath Bombs that I have tried. I have tried the Lush Brand which does not moisturize as well and has a manmade smell in stead of a natural smell (perfumy).  The Rejuve Bath Bombs, smell natural and leave my skin moisturized (this says a lot since I have very dry skin).  These are white and not colorful like some brands, but I like this.  I do not like bathing in dye and perfume, just moisturizers and natural scents.</li>
    <li> My wife likes these. They are much smaller than we expected, but looking back at the product description they are accurately described.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Sellers of this product are very conscientious about providing good service and quality. I was contacted with additional information from the seller on the product&#x27;s use which I found helpful. I will order from this seller again. Very pleased.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Lush bath bomb disciple for years, but decided to give these Rejuvelle bath bombs a try based on the other reviews. Very glad I did! They smell great, leave your skin silky and smooth. You can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality. I still love Lush products, but Rejuvelle is my new bath-bomb go-to.</li>
    <li> Great product.  As described and we love them!</li>
    <li> SKIN IS SO SOFT IM ADDICTED&lt;br /&gt;I felt my legs then my phone literally dropped in the water&#x27; its ok tho i noticed after 30 seconds im so surprised its ok</li>
    <li> Smells awesome definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> My husband and I went on vacation and a friend suggested these bath balls opposed to bubbles. These balls are great! They left our skin soft and silky. They smell amazing and they must have aphrodisiac ingredient mixed in because we felt so sexy. I&#x27;ll totally purchase these little guys again... Who needs bubbles.</li>
    <li> Gave it has a gift they loved it said it smell good and made them feel so smooth made the bathtub slippery so you might want to clean it  after</li>
    <li> These are essential oils are da bomb!  Although I like the soothing effects of the water I rarely take baths because it leaves my skin dry and itchy even if I apply lotion afterwards.  After two intense days of physical activity (I play competitive tennis and train for triathlons) I needed a hot bath for some very sore muscles.  I had received the set of six Rejuvelle Bath Bombs as a gift and decided to try the Yoga Sunrise bomb.  What a wonderful and surprising experience!  Not only was the pleasantly fragrant bomb relaxing, the oils in this product were gentle and left my skin very emollient and soft.  For the first time ever I did not have to apply lotion after a bath.  I am looking forward to trying all of the aromas in the set and plan to give a set to my daughter who is very sensitive to additives and chemicals in bathing products and laundry detergents.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and don&#x27;t stain her tube she loves them</li>
    <li> These were a big hit with my granddaughter!</li>
    <li> These were a gift for mothers day and I love them. The vanilla one I&#x27;m saving for last! It&#x27;s my favorite scent. Also loved the tangerine scented one. Love the longer lasting fizziness compared to other brands and the strength of the bath bombs which are stronger than the lush bombs I&#x27;ve used in the past. And also the tissue paper wrapping gave these a playful candy appearance which really made me feel like I was spoiling myself.</li>
    <li> Wife loved them.  Perfect for someone who likes soaking in the tub...</li>
    <li> Smells great, love them!</li>
    <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t a fan of these. They left a very oily/waxy feeling all over her skin after getting out of the bath. Not a smooth and moisturized feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I had to come back and update this to a 5 star because of the superb customer service of Julie and the company. Even though the product wasn&#x27;t quite to my wife&#x27;s liking, Julie contacted me and offered me a full refund even though I didn&#x27;t request one. That made my day. Thanks Rejuvelle!</li>
    <li> Purchased these as a gift. Truly fine product.</li>
    <li> I like my bath bombs very much! They shipped several days ahead of schedule and I love them in the bath! They are very moisturizing to the skin and I will buy them again</li>
    <li> I was looking for bath bombs to surprise my wife with, when I stumbled on this set. I was originally looking for Lush brand bombs, but this set immediately popped out at me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was blown away by how nice they smelled, and her skin was soft for a week! 10/10, would buy this again!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved these. She said they work and smell great. She did suggest that some color be added to them to make the bath water colored.</li>
    <li> I bought this a surprise for my daughter who is a stay at home Mom with a 3 year old and twins that are 1 year old. At the end of the day, she really needs a moment of solitude and relaxation. She loves these bath bombs and keeps thanking me for them! I am back to order a set for myself now.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I was given the Rejuvelle Bath Bombs as a gift for Christmas.  I love to take baths but never particularly got into bath bombs as I always used bath salts,  my daughter was excited when she seen these as she loves bath bombs. I did like the fact that all the ingredients are all natural which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well...I have to tell you that I have now been converted.  When I opened the tin of these essential oil bath bombs just the smell of them got me addicted. I loved the cute little bow on the tin too,  the packaging looks very nice and well presented.  I have already used 4 of the 6 bath bombs and love them all.  I have to tell you that my skin feels wonderful when I get out of the bath,  very silky and smooth.  If you have never tried bath bombs before try these I highly recommended them it was my favorite gift.  Now I have to buy more for my daughter and I will also get some for my friends who have birthdays coming up, makes a great gift for anyone or yourself.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> A true treat! Great quality and worth every dime.</li>
    <li> The bath bombs are amazing I got a set for my birthday and use them all within a week and had to come back and get more. I strongly suggest it for anybody and everybody who enjoys a bath</li>
    <li> Excellent gift my daughter loved them.</li>
    <li> Gave these as a gift! My friend LOVED them.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a gift so I did not actually use them, but they looked beautiful when they showed up. Definitely something I was happy to gift.</li>
    <li> poor poor quality, waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product and great service</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and it was a big hit, Girlfriend loved it! Everything came right on time and overall experience was great!</li>
    <li> Really great quality for an affordable price!  :)</li>
    <li> The smell is great and the feel of the water changes as the bomb bubbles.  I came out my tub feeling soft and feeling relaxed!  I will order more and give them as gifts to myself and others!!</li>
    <li> Got these for mothers days and absolutely loved them?</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are great, smell fresh and come well packaged and nicely presented. The follow up by Rejuvelle about my experience with the bath bombs was a nice touch by ensuring that I as a customer was fully satisfied with the product. In the bath tub they are wonderful and relaxing and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for a dear Lady friend and She really enjoyed them!  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> These are fabulous!  They fizz until they entirely disappear, they smell wonderful, and they really moisturize your skin.  The box is a flimsy, super-soft metal that gets dented and bent easily, but the product inside is great.</li>
    <li> They are awesome.  Great packaging - great for gift giving.</li>
    <li> I use this product for foot baths, and I absolutely LOVE the smells. Each bomb has a strong (yet pleasant) smell. Since I use these in smaller portions than they come in, I put them in plastic bags and threw them on the floor (tiny pieces work best for me).</li>
    <li> fantastic! love love love these. my skin feels amazing after</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom and she really liked it I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fun product. Bought them for my daughters they enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product and well priced. I just had the opportunity to indulge in the vanilla bath... worth every penny. Also, the packaging is top notch and I would highly recommend this product, especially as a gift.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described. Gf loves them so much she does not want to use them, just smell them lol.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Left my skin nice and smooth!! Only wish they were easier to break apart.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend absolutely loved them. It took her after work relaxing session to the next level. Thanks for making me look like an amazing boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Im a repeat customer.  This makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> Love them!!  Immediately bought two more sets after my first bath!</li>
    <li> My daughter love these. She said. they work and smell great. She did suggest that some color be added to them to make the bath water coloered.</li>
    <li> Great fragrances! But leaves quickly!</li>
    <li> This producted is very appealing due to its scent, however this product made my skin really irritated and inflammed especially my back area where my esczema is located. It is very hard to stop scratching my back now. I am highly dissapointed with this product. A refund is appriciated</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter she loves them.  They smell wonderful and made her skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> They are great and I loved everything about it: fragrance and feel on the skin.</li>
    <li> Got these for my mom on mothers day and she said they work great! They helped her wind down on one of her business trips. Will most likely buy again.</li>
    <li> I used my first bath bomb last night...Garden of the Gods. The smell was amazing and my skin felt great after my bath! Can&#x27;t wait to use the other bath bombs! Such a great product...way better than a normal bubble bath. The scent and the oils really made me feel like I was relaxing in a spa!</li>
    <li> Popped up under bubble bath category but produces no bubbles- went ahead and used but they kinda have a pathetic fizzle and little smell- not worth it - find another product if you are searching for something this isn&#x27;t it</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom and she said they leave the skin feeling very moisturized and soft, the scents are also amazing</li>
    <li> Enjoyed and made my skin really soft. I&#x27;ll be ordering more and make them a part of my weekly at home spa ritual.</li>
    <li> Hello, I have received my order and I am glad to say it met my expectations!! I love the bath bombs, was hoping for a hint of color but I would hate to have a stained bath tub. I often look for products with natural ingredients. It smelled amazing and made my body feel silky soft!! I look forward to experiencing the rest of my bath bombs and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> The bath bombs smelt absolutely amazing! They were a gift for my sister for her birthday. She messaged me earlier to let me know she used the &amp;#34;garden of the gods&amp;#34; one and she said it was just divine! Definitely will be purchasing some for myself as well!</li>
    <li> The product smells amazing, if I&#x27;ve never used a shower bomb before I would of rated it a 4 but being that I&#x27;ve used Lusts shower bombs these aren&#x27;t compareable. The shower bomb is small in size and dissolves way to fast and I didn&#x27;t know they were only in white. I really didn&#x27;t enjoy it. All I can say is that it smelt good but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It isn&#x27;t worth the price at all.</li>
    <li> great bath bombs-thanks!</li>
    <li> They smell simply divine!!! Great selection of smells. Skin feels wonderful after bathing with one!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to say I love the price. Bath bombs are normally so expensive, so finding six for $26.95 was a thrill. My fianc&amp;eacute;e is obsessed with bath bombs and loved these. I&#x27;d bought some other cheaper ones before and they just didn&#x27;t do the job. She has arthritis and often is sore and achey. She said these made her feel infinitely better. The only part she didn&#x27;t like was getting out of the tub!</li>
    <li> Great product! !! Leaves skin silky and smooth. No ring left in the tub when your done.</li>
    <li> Great item. All natural without the fillers that most products have. It moisturizers better than any bath salts and smells heavenly</li>
    <li> Prompt and well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Smell amazing but kind of slimy in the tub</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC product!! I was worried at first by the smell coming from the box that there would be unlabeled perfume in there, but there wasn&#x27;t. It was all natural and completely glorious! The shea butter makes it extra wonderful. I may never take a &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; bath again</li>
    <li> Bought this for mom&#x27;s birthday and shes loves it!</li>
    <li> The bath bombs are wonderful! I have really dry feet, so I break them in thirds and soak. My feet look and feel great. I love the “flavors” they come in, too. I&#x27;ll definately be purchasing more in the future and try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t smell that great</li>
    <li> Sent as a birthday gift. Recipient loves them! Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Loved them so much I got more..highly recommend them to everyone!!! Leave your skin feeling so soft and smooth!!</li>
    <li> Arrived gift wrapped and was in perfect condition when my wife opened it for Christmas. She loves the different fragrances.</li>
    <li> Absolutely,  incredibly, and completely wonderful! These are the best bath bombs I&#x27;ve come across. I absolutely love these and I&#x27;ve only used 2 so far. I will definitely be buying more. I wish there was a way to buy these scents separately too. But I&#x27;ll keep buying them anyway and I&#x27;ll buy them as gifts too! I can&#x27;t wait to take another bath and use the next one!</li>
    <li> Bought these as gifts and everyone loved them. Great smell and leaves your skin feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> These were amazing. Nicely scented and the oils left my skin feeling soft &amp; smooth. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister&#x27;s birthday since she loves bath bombs and loves all natural products. They were a huge hit!</li>
    <li> Although the bombs are a bit smaller than I thought, they are still well worth it.  I feel wonderful after my bath.  The packaging is very cute and would make it a great gift!</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are great.  They smell amazing and I love that they are made with natural ingredients.  I will continue to order from this company.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife, and then forgot about them. A few days later, out of the blue, my wife comes into my home-office, literally purring, and said she had just tried one in her bath and it was the most luxurious experience she had ever had! So - she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Great product and did not leave a ring in the tub! Left my skin feeling great. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Quality product, very reasonably priced, and came right on time! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My wife likes to decompress after a day at work and these bath bombs have become a part of the ritual. I would add another star if one could select the type that&#x27;s included in the pack and if they were more numerous at half the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half of one is enough for a single bath and we end up saving the other half for the next day. So as not to mess with your manufacturing process I would be happy if they were cut in half prior to wrapping it in the paper. It&#x27;s minor, feasible, and not too disruptive to customers who are used to throwing the whole thing in. Just have to figure out how to do it without it crumbling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-happy customers</li>
