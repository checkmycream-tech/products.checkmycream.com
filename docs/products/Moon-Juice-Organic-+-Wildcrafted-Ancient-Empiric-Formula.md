      <li>so I&#x27;m not yet sure about it&#x27;s effects on my skin, hair and nails.</li>
      <li>but this has caused no issues, and on top of that I do see a difference in my skin - smoother and clearer complexion.  </li>

      <li>So far, so good - my skin glows!</li>
      <li>I am excited to try all their formulas!</li>
      <li>In combination with a good diet and using all-natural skin care, this has really helped my skin.</li>
      <li>After hearing so many reviews, I was excited to try Moon Juice.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s full to the top.</li>
      <li>I just mix it with water and really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I will start by saying I enjoy the taste of this powder quite a bit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The dust is lightly sprinkled with sparkles from the pearls and the scent is alluring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>glowing skin is worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Overall it is a nice supplement that I have enjoyed adding into my regimen.</li>
      <li>The package came quick and so far i am very pleased with both the product and the seller.</li>
      <li>Lots of special healing energy.</li>
      <li>For me I see it as an investment in my &amp;#34;Beauty Arsenal&amp;#34; and in the long run more cost effective than cosmetic procedures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A true tonic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>problem with too sweet (besides taste)</li>
      <li>I love to make hot tea with this right before bed.  </li>
      <li>Also, this company ships quickly and efficiently.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been drinking it long enough to know if it is making me more beautiful</li>
      <li>/&gt;A must buy from the always stellar @Carbonbeauty for anyone in search of beauty from the inside out!</li>
      <li>The free shipping is a plus and it arrived fast.</li>
      <li>Lovely thing to keep in your pantry for an early morning cleanse.</li>
      <li>The packing is so fun,  </li>
      <li>So far, I really love it.</li>
      <li>Hopefully Carbon Beauty will be able to sell some of Moon Juice&#x27;s other products like the sprouted protein I&#x27;m dying to try :)</li>
      <li>Having it warm in the morning or evening is a nice sweet treat and cold with almond milk is quite refreshing.</li>
      <li>Great to add into matcha tea before bed, and has been helping me get a full night&#x27;s rest lately.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and break out easily</li>
      <li>Either I got a bad batch (because there was no safety seal) or everyone else got a good tasting batch, but I don&#x27;t see how anyone could say that this tasted and smelled great.  </li>
      <li>Recently I have been mixing a teaspoon of the Beauty Dust with a teaspoon of Organic Matcha powder in water and it has been a great mid day pick me up.</li>
      <li>and my face has a pretty glow.</li>
      <li>it is better if mixed with tea.</li>
      <li>I first became aware of this product from a promotional email I received from Moon Juice.  </li>
      <li>I put this powder in my water first thing in the morning and in the afternoon.  </li>
      <li>I have used it consistently for a month now by adding a tsp to my shakes or coffee in the morning and there is a noticeable difference in my skin and the whites of my eyes.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t even know what they were thinking!  </li>
      <li>I am on my second jar of Beauty Dust and I am still glowing :)</li>
      <li>My skin is looking better already after only 4 days!</li>
      <li>and glad I finally did!  </li>
      <li>so I enjoy it more as a treat a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It tastes good, and though the container is small</li>
      <li>: it increases your sugar tolerance, so you need more sugar to get the same high.  </li>
      <li>The product mixes well with both hot and cold water, and tastes delicious when topped off with nut milk and a dollop of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can taste the other flavors as well, and I can see why they thought they would need to mask them with a huge abundance of sweet, but it is over done.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any positive effects, but I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because just b/c I don&#x27;t see effects doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not doing good things for my bod</li>
      <li>I enjoy my daily serving of Beauty Dust in tea</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I have noticed my hair is very shiny</li>
      <li>complaint is that it has stevia in it, and the powder is WAY TOO SWEET!!!  </li>
      <li>This is a high quality powder that is chalk full of nutrient-dense herbs and extractions, such as pearl, which has been praised for centuries for</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s always a little magic involved with these kinds of powders, so why not try?</li>
      <li>I personally think it tastes like dirt, but in coffee (iced or hot) it&#x27;s more or less unnoticeable.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a real difference with my skin, but I have noticed my skin clearing up quickly!</li>
      <li>but I have also added new odacite serums to my regime in addition to the moon juice powder.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It actually does something positive, measurable, and noticeable within a few days of intake.&lt;br /&gt;Stronger nails, clearer skin, and better moisture retention</li>
      <li>I am not exactly sure what the product is supposed to do, but I feel a bit more energized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little too soon to say whether I am noticing big changes from use of this powder, but I will say I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>It is pricey but clear</li>
      <li>My skin has been looking more glowy lately</li>
      <li>It has a natural, wild flavor and you can taste the sweetness from the stevia.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to purchase this from amazon with free shipping because the shipping at Moon Juice is outrageous and I just had to have this!</li>
      <li>Its gentle at the same time and when swallowed, feels like a gentle healing wave hitting your entire bodily system, insides and outs and all.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s high Vit C content which promotes overall beauty.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Want to do a follow-up review after using it for a month or so, but it tastes great and has plenty of helpful ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using it in smoothies and also in my coffee when time is short. Skin is brighter and lips feel fuller after just a few days. There&#x27;s always a little magic involved with these kinds of powders, so why not try? Also, this company ships quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> Just recieved and have been adding to my morning smoothies. Doesn&#x27;t alter the taste at all. Too soon to notice a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; yet so I&#x27;ll update once I&#x27;ve been using a bit longer.</li>
    <li> It tastes a bit like juice, although it looks like chocolate.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for a couple of days now, and the dry skin that I usually get around my mouth disappeared.  I am not exactly sure what the product is supposed to do, but I feel a bit more energized.</li>
    <li> I love it. In combination with a good diet and using all-natural skin care, this has really helped my skin. It has a natural, wild flavor and you can taste the sweetness from the stevia. I just mix it with water and really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I first tried it in a glass of cold water. Meh, just ok. The next day I made it in hot water with half and half and... So good! I haven&#x27;t been drinking it long enough to know if it is making me more beautiful (ha ha...) but I hope it will (#joking #sortof).</li>
    <li> I first became aware of this product from a promotional email I received from Moon Juice.  I was quite disappointed when after completing the payment process, they were &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34;. Not to be deterred, I looked for other buying options. Quite honestly I chose Carbon Beauty because the shipping was cheaper than Moon Juices&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Beauty Dust. The packing is so fun,  I love the taste and knowing I&#x27;m putting great things in my body!!! I do believe after a few uses my skin as a 55 year old is taking on a fresher, glowey appearance! I anticipate seeing even more results over time and will share updates. The only downside for some may be the price point. For me I see it as an investment in my &amp;#34;Beauty Arsenal&amp;#34; and in the long run more cost effective than cosmetic procedures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carbon Beauty is a terrific company to do business with. Great communication and service. I will definitely be ordering through them again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is raving about!!!  I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell and taste long enough to see if it had any benefits at all.  Either I got a bad batch (because there was no safety seal) or everyone else got a good tasting batch, but I don&#x27;t see how anyone could say that this tasted and smelled great.  It smells like band aids and tastes even worse.</li>
    <li> Let me start of by saying, I do see a difference in my skin!  I have very sensitive skin, and break out easily (I can&#x27;t have maca powder for instance!!) but this has caused no issues, and on top of that I do see a difference in my skin - smoother and clearer complexion.  This is the same effect I have when I eat goji berries (in beauty dust as well) or drink green juices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is that it has stevia in it, and the powder is WAY TOO SWEET!!!  Like, crazy too sweet.  I really don&#x27;t even know what they were thinking!  I can barely choke it down (harder because of the taste of stevia).  I can taste the other flavors as well, and I can see why they thought they would need to mask them with a huge abundance of sweet, but it is over done.  It is easy to add more sweetener (honey, stevia, sugar, whatever people want!) but I don&#x27;t know how to take it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem with too sweet (besides taste): it increases your sugar tolerance, so you need more sugar to get the same high.  This is a problem for anybody (most of us) who get addicted to sugar.  My skin reacts badly to too much sugar, so I&#x27;d be surprised if it isn&#x27;t counteracting some of the benefits of the good in the jar too (even though stevia has zero calories your body doesn&#x27;t know that and probably still pumps out insulin to deal with the rush of sugar as it does with artificial sweetners).</li>
    <li> The free shipping is a plus and it arrived fast. The taste takes awhile to adjust to but I already notice a difference in my skin. My skin has a glow to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to purchase this from amazon with free shipping because the shipping at Moon Juice is outrageous and I just had to have this! So far, I really love it. It&#x27;s a lovely product, the taste is nice and I just feel like I&#x27;m doing something wonderful for myself with every teaspoon of beauty dust. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, once in an acai smoothie and once in a chia pudding. I want to have it as the creator does, in a glass of warm water as a night cap as a kind of tea. Hopefully Carbon Beauty will be able to sell some of Moon Juice&#x27;s other products like the sprouted protein I&#x27;m dying to try :)</li>
    <li> I love my this product! After hearing so many reviews, I was excited to try Moon Juice. I enjoy my daily serving of Beauty Dust in tea or I&#x27;ll mix it with almond milk. So far, so good - my skin glows!</li>
    <li> I love the Beauty Dust! It smells heavenly and tastes Soooo good! I love mixing mine with warm water and sipping it! I have noticed my hair is very shiny and my face has a pretty glow. Thank you Moon Juice!</li>
    <li> Tasty with almond milk. Waiting to see if it makes me radiant!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too soon to say whether I am noticing big changes from use of this powder, but I will say I absolutely LOVE it. My skin has been looking more glowy lately but I have also added new odacite serums to my regime in addition to the moon juice powder. Having it warm in the morning or evening is a nice sweet treat and cold with almond milk is quite refreshing. Will say it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side so I enjoy it more as a treat a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase and will recommend.</li>
    <li> There is something about this combination that has made my skin more supple and more glowy. Great to add into matcha tea before bed, and has been helping me get a full night&#x27;s rest lately. I love it!</li>
    <li> It does taste a little odd if you are not used to stevia, but it is not unpleasant. I have used it consistently for a month now by adding a tsp to my shakes or coffee in the morning and there is a noticeable difference in my skin and the whites of my eyes. I am sold on the product and looking into the other Moon Juice dust products.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the Moon Dust line. Here&#x27;s why I LOVE Beauty Dust:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually does something positive, measurable, and noticeable within a few days of intake.&lt;br /&gt;Stronger nails, clearer skin, and better moisture retention (I tried Rice ceramide for months in vain)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s portable!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s organic, delicious, and won&#x27;t spike blood sugar&lt;br /&gt;It replaces several individual products for me- bamboo silica, biotin, ceramides, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this beauty tonic enough!</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin is looking better already after only 4 days!</li>
    <li> I personally think it tastes like dirt, but in coffee (iced or hot) it&#x27;s more or less unnoticeable. I haven&#x27;t seen any positive effects, but I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because just b/c I don&#x27;t see effects doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not doing good things for my bod</li>
    <li> Had been curious about trying this beauty dust for a while and glad I finally did!  Delicious and benefits can be felt immediately.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it-my skin is clearing up! The taste is ok- it is better if mixed with tea. It is pricey but clear glowing skin is worth the price!  UPDATE: I am on my second jar of Beauty Dust and I am still glowing :)</li>
    <li> I liked this supplement powder. It was easily mixed into smoothies and I felt my skin showed improvement while taking beauty dust daily. My only complaint is how quickly I used up the product.</li>
    <li> One of the finest beauty products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Lots of special healing energy. A true tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dust is lightly sprinkled with sparkles from the pearls and the scent is alluring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If mixed with water, the taste is intensely herby, like deep root and earth, but not overpowering. Its gentle at the same time and when swallowed, feels like a gentle healing wave hitting your entire bodily system, insides and outs and all. Lovely thing to keep in your pantry for an early morning cleanse. Royal substance. Thank you moon juice for creating this dusty gold.  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking this for a few days so I&#x27;m not yet sure about it&#x27;s effects on my skin, hair and nails. It tastes good, and though the container is small it&#x27;s full to the top. The package came quick and so far i am very pleased with both the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I love to make hot tea with this right before bed.  Still waiting to see if there are any noticeable benefits.</li>
    <li> I put this powder in my water first thing in the morning and in the afternoon.  I love the way it makes me feel.  No matter how crazy my day gets, I feel more at ease after drinking this.  I am excited to try all their formulas!</li>
    <li> The taste is a lot for me to handle just diluted with water, but I added the powder into some tea and it was great! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a real difference with my skin, but I have noticed my skin clearing up quickly!</li>
    <li> I love to use this product in smoothies. I thought the jar would be bigger than it actually is, but the product is packed densely and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Tastes great! I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tolerate the taste, but that&#x27;s not the case. It also mixes well with anything.. I use it in my afternoon tea :-)</li>
    <li> An absolutely wonderful product that does wonders for skin tone, hair, nails, and collagen production.  This is a high quality powder that is chalk full of nutrient-dense herbs and extractions, such as pearl, which has been praised for centuries for it&#x27;s high Vit C content which promotes overall beauty. The product mixes well with both hot and cold water, and tastes delicious when topped off with nut milk and a dollop of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must buy from the always stellar @Carbonbeauty for anyone in search of beauty from the inside out!</li>
    <li> I will start by saying I enjoy the taste of this powder quite a bit. Recently I have been mixing a teaspoon of the Beauty Dust with a teaspoon of Organic Matcha powder in water and it has been a great mid day pick me up. Im not sure how it has been working for my skin yet but I have some breakouts that I&#x27;m hoping this dust will help me banish. Overall it is a nice supplement that I have enjoyed adding into my regimen.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
