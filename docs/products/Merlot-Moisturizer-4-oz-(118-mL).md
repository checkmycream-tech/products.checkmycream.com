      <li>And came very quickly in the mail!</li>

      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>Love how my skin feels after using Merlot lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years, and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>that is for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have been using it for about 10 years.  </li>
      <li>and i wasn&#x27;t satisfied with them</li>
      <li>I have used this skin moisturizer for many years.  </li>
      <li>and she will love you forever</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>completely satisfied......</li>
      <li>It has a refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>It does provide moisture and with the sunscreen I love it for day time use.</li>
      <li>And the seller was super nice. :)</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a wonderful product for those with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing the full size to that one soon!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a creamy gel, it smells light and refreshing, it absorbs quickly and leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the $15 price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many facial moisturizers/creams and most of them sting and/or leave a greasy look to my face.</li>
      <li>Make-up looks natural and better with this underneath.  </li>
      <li>this goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores and gives me decent protection against the sun.</li>
      <li>And the price is right.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>and I am a avid golfer.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product especially if you have dry skin.</li>
      <li>I tried 3 other moisturizers when Walgreens stopped carrying Merlot brand, but didn&#x27;t find any that I liked as much.</li>
      <li>Admittedly, genetics does play a large role in the make-up of my complexion and preservation, however, Merlot Moisturizer does provide a youthful glow, a softening of the features per say.  </li>
      <li>is not greasy, just very creamy.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves it men get your woman</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s value and quality!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product at my local Walgreen&#x27;s store.</li>
      <li>Most SPF moisturizers go on super thick, take forever to absorb and smell like glue.</li>
      <li>I love this product , I have more expensive brands</li>
      <li>It works really well on my face and keeps it looking soft.</li>
      <li>Altho I am neigh 40 and a grandmother, comments such as &amp;#34;pregnant glow&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;you have such healthy skin&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;what is your facial routine?&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and has very little fragrance - only a light natural fruit scent that quickly dissipates once it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
      <li>It is far to pricey not to mention this in a review.</li>
      <li>My wife has a sensitive skin</li>
      <li>usually get it locally at Walgreens, where it often comes with a free travel size.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen in this doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin or make it red.  </li>
      <li>I will never go back to the old stuff that I used to spend a fortune on.</li>

<li> I must admit, I expected more and was disappointed in Amazon pricing (my local drug store sold this same product for $10), features softened, filled or plumped, the skin on my neck may have tightened a tad, but, there was no real WOW! factor, nothing that said, YES!</li>
<li> Slight crow&#x27;s feet softened, a dreaded crease above my upper lip filled ever-so slightly and dark circles under the eyes became nonexistent.</li>
<li> I only use it on my face but it is also soothing for minor burns.</li>

<li> I would recommend this product to anyone with a dry skin problem.</li>
<li> Instead, it just absorbs into the skin and the skin still feels dry.  </li>
<li> Now in my 70&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;it finally has dried up some.  </li>
<li> One pot will last you at least 2 months, it only takes a little bit each time.</li>
<li> make it tight and dry.  </li>
<li> Not greasy or heavy; doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.</li>
<li> It both primes and moisturizes skin without adding a weird waxy shine, as some primers do or leading to small, bumpy break-outs on my chin, as other primers do.  </li>
<li> But, if I use a moisturizer with mineral oil in it I again oil up and it is not a good thing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not greasy or heavy; doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.</li>
    <li> I find this product quite sufficient for day time use. It absorbs well and does not leave a greasy look. It does provide moisture and with the sunscreen I love it for day time use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and not an expert about this kind of stuff.  But, I have a fair complexion and need something light with a sunscreen in it.  this goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores and gives me decent protection against the sun.</li>
    <li> I have used this skin moisturizer for many years.  I like it very much.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and has very little fragrance - only a light natural fruit scent that quickly dissipates once it&#x27;s applied.  I tried 3 other moisturizers when Walgreens stopped carrying Merlot brand, but didn&#x27;t find any that I liked as much.</li>
    <li> If you have breakouts this is one moisturizer that will not cause them. I only use it on my face but it is also soothing for minor burns.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to give this as a rating. Maybe two stars is even too generous.  I thought it would be a wonderful product for those with dry skin.  Instead, it just absorbs into the skin and the skin still feels dry.  It is far to pricey not to mention this in a review. I would not buy it again that is for sure.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is fantastic!!!! And for a good price too! And came very quickly in the mail!</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful, is non-greasy, did not cause any break-outs, and perfect for my oily skin. I originally bought this product at my local Walgreen&#x27;s store.

    <li> This is a great product especially if you have dry skin. I am so glad that I gave it a try. I will never go back to the old stuff that I used to spend a fortune on. This works so well with or without makeup. I use it in the morning after I shower and put it on again before I go to bed. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I had a sample from somewhere an it made my skin feel wonderful. Also pice was Bette than any stre</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels after using Merlot lotion.  It has a cooling effect and a mild, pleasant scent. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for about 10 years.  It works beautifully as a daily face moisturizer.  I especially like the fact that it has SPF 15 sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order of this and I will order again.  It soaks into my skin, making it soft,&lt;br /&gt;but is not greasy, just very creamy.</li>
    <li> I have used this since they stocked it @ Walgreens. (10-15 yrs) Great price and I don&#x27;t have to leave the house to get it.</li>
    <li> This product works!  I have dry skin and I am a avid golfer.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a dry skin problem.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen in this doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin or make it red.  It&#x27;s recommended for those with rosacea.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  It both primes and moisturizes skin without adding a weird waxy shine, as some primers do or leading to small, bumpy break-outs on my chin, as other primers do.  It doesn&#x27;t turn my make-up orange as some moisturizers do.  Make-up looks natural and better with this underneath.  And the price is right.  Last moisturizing primer and oil-free primers I used cost comparably 50 dollars for a tube.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Most SPF moisturizers go on super thick, take forever to absorb and smell like glue. Not this! It has a refreshing smell. Absorbs almost like a gel and my skin feels amazing! And oh yeah I have oily/combo acne prone skin and this has never irritated or broke me out. It&#x27;s just amazing! The night cream is good to(thanks to a freebie) I&#x27;ll be purchasing the full size to that one soon!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves it men get your woman this and she will love you forever</li>
    <li> It works really well on my face and keeps it looking soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product , I have more expensive brands and i wasn&#x27;t satisfied with them ,I received a sample on a shipping mall snd immediately after the first time using it  i feel in love !!</li>
    <li> I have had skin that is &#x27;not-so-dry&#x27; since I was a teenager.  Now in my 70&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;it finally has dried up some.  But, if I use a moisturizer with mineral oil in it I again oil up and it is not a good thing.  I found this moisturizer several years ago at the local Walgreens and have used it ever since.  It is oil free yet feels great on my skin and doesn;t make it tight and dry.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Out here in the desert, it takes lots of stuff to keep one&#x27;s face moisturized.  Merlot Moisturizer does its job...thank you.</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy and delightfully fragranced face cream.  Lavender in color. Altho I am neigh 40 and a grandmother, comments such as &amp;#34;pregnant glow&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;you have such healthy skin&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;what is your facial routine?&amp;#34; come about.  I am Portuguese-Scott, and have naturally fair skin w/an olive hue. Admittedly, genetics does play a large role in the make-up of my complexion and preservation, however, Merlot Moisturizer does provide a youthful glow, a softening of the features per say.  Slight crow&#x27;s feet softened, a dreaded crease above my upper lip filled ever-so slightly and dark circles under the eyes became nonexistent. I must admit, I expected more and was disappointed in Amazon pricing (my local drug store sold this same product for $10), features softened, filled or plumped, the skin on my neck may have tightened a tad, but, there was no real WOW! factor, nothing that said, YES! this is the product for me, it&#x27;s amazing...no, it&#x27;s just...OK.</li>
    <li> My wife has a sensitive skin so she could not use it because of the red and blue colors in the product</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer. Walgreens used to stock this but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  Thank goodness for Amazon. I hope they will continue stocking it. Probably the best moisturizer I have ever used. A very well deserved five star in my humble opinion, and I never write reviews..</li>
    <li> This is the only facial moisturizer I use. I&#x27;m 53 and get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me a gift bag for Valentine&#x27;s Day (bought locally) that contained samples of these Merlot Grape beauty products.  I was so impressed, that when I ran out I came looking for more. There are cheaper face creams (and lesser quality) and more expensive face creams (not necessarily of higher quality).  These Merlot products are made from grape seed oils and work great.  And the seller was super nice. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many facial moisturizers/creams and most of them sting and/or leave a greasy look to my face. This one is totally different! It&#x27;s more like a creamy gel, it smells light and refreshing, it absorbs quickly and leaves your face feeling clean. It is well worth the $15 price! I am a cheapskate and usually don&#x27;t spend much on things for myself, this is my splurge! One pot will last you at least 2 months, it only takes a little bit each time. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 years, and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get it locally at Walgreens, where it often comes with a free travel size.</li>
    <li> completely satisfied......</li>
