<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I previously purchased a bottle of Coconut oil from Majestic Pure and I am so amazed by the quality of their product.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to purchase their castor oil too, it is a huge bottle of 16 oz.&lt;br /&gt;A little always goes a long way, I am pretty sure this is going to last me for a good period of time.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that they included an easy cone spout cap, making it easy for me to dispense a product.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use this for my eyebrows. It has been proven that castor oil aids in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;It has a low molecular weight, making it easier for the skin to absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;In my two weeks of usage, I have noticed a significant growth on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;The hair strands are thick and luscious. I also have to say that I barely used a quarter of this product in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. I purchase this using a promo code for testing.</li>
    <li> Im using this product for almost a week now, And this is really a great product.It makes my hair shiny and more manageable.To be honest I was so hesitant at first to try an oil on my hair especially with this hot weather that we have.I know that it will be so oily and irritable to wear an oil but then my instinct said to try this oil and I&#x27;m not regretting it because this is really good in my hair.It&#x27;s not so greasy at all.I will absolutely recommend this product to all the ladies who want to have a shiny and manageable hair all day.</li>
    <li> I have read a lot about Castor Oil and its incredible results so I decided to try it for myself. I got a great discount for the Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil n exchange for a review. I found the oil to be lighter than I had expected. My skin was very dry so I tested it there first. I found Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil to absorb fairly quickly and it kept looking like it was moisturized for quite a while. Then I tried it on my grand daughter’s hair.  She has ethnic hair and it looks dry and brittle if it isn’t treated after her shower. I added Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil right to her conditioner and when she used it her hair looked shiny and well conditioned. I love that Majestic Pure Castor Oil, Hair Wonder Oil has no fillers or additives and it has Omega 6 and 9 beneficial fatty acids as well as Vitamin E, minerals, and proteins that are healthy for my hair and skin. And it’s backed by a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> i love i using this too to my eyelash and its work it, its amazing.</li>
    <li> My castor oil came bagged with a screw on top in the bag. For me this is awesome because it makes it easier for pouring, but you could always keep the normal cap on and pour it out to. Castor Oil is a very pale yellow liquid that is extracted from castor seeds. It is an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant oil. It is believed that most of castor oil&#x27;s benefits are derived from its high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids. Although it has a strong and rather unpleasant taste, castor oil is used in cosmetics, soaps, textiles, medicines, massage oils and many other everyday products. Castor Oil can used for many everyday problems such as but not limited to Migraines, Acne, Sunburn, Athlete&#x27;s Foot, and Inflammation. The anti-inflammatory properties of Castor Oil make it an excellent massage oil for relieving arthritic joints, nerve inflammations, and sore muscles. Below is how I do it, I am by no means a doctor just sharing my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make a small pad by folding a small piece of unbleached cotton into 3 or 4 layers. Dip the cotton pad into Castor Oil and place it on to the affected joint or muscle. Cover the pad with a plastic wrap. Place a hot water bottle or heating pad over the plastic wrapped cotton pad. The plastic wrap will prevent the water bottle or heating pad from getting oily. Leave the cotton pad on for 45 minutes to an hour, once per day. This Castor Oil pack can be reused. Simply place it into a plastic ziplock bag and refrigerate it until it is ready to be used again. It can be refrigerated in a ziplock bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love mixing castor oil in my coconut oil for my hair (trust me my hair dresser loves how healthy my hair is). Castor oil carries ricinoleic acid and omega- 6 essential fatty acids, which accelerate blood circulation to the scalp, hence increasing hair growth.  It works on nourishing the scalp and strengthening the roots with the help of essential nutrients.  Below is how I do it, the next day you hair will look and feel amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix some coconut oil with castor oil in a small bowl. Take some quantity onto your hands and begin with massaging the scalp well. Once done, cover your head with a shower cap and leave overnight, if possible. Rinse your hair completely, the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.feel amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix some coconut oil with castor oil in a small bowl.

    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Majestic Pure castor oil all over my body.  I have very dry skin and with the summer here, it&#x27;s even more dry.  I also get dry patches on my face. I first used this oil on the &amp;#34;rougher&amp;#34; parts on my body which is my feet and elbows. I applied it at night before I went to sleep.  When I woke up the next morning I was amazed at how soft and smooth my feet were. So were my elbows. This has Vitamin E, minerals, proteins, Omega 6 and Omega 9 in it which I know is good for your skin. I&#x27;ve heard of people using this on their scalp.  I&#x27;m trying that next!  I recommend this highly</li>
    <li> This Majestic Pure Castor Oil does wonders for my long thick curly hair! I put a little bit of the castor oil on my hair after I wash it and it gives my hair a nice little shine and makes my hair feel less stringy. There isn&#x27;t much of smell that I&#x27;ve noticed. The oil isn&#x27;t thick so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all. I love that this castor oil comes in a 16oz bottle which will definitely last me for awhile specially since a little bit really goes a long way with this oil. I also had a little bit to my hands and rub it in to make my hands smooth and less dry. The oil absorbs quickly and does indeed make my hands soft! I would definitely recommend this Majestic Pure Castor Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> My first thought was wow!! This is a huge bottle. I&#x27;ve bought smaller bottles for more money so I&#x27;m very happy with this on. It comes with a easy to put on and use twist type top also. Pure castrol oil is good for so many things. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with just having on hand in your house. Just to name a couple... Hair, skin and even as a moisturizer. I love this stuff. No loud harsh smell. Very light. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.The best part about this - there is NO GREASINESS. I mean NONE! No more stains on the clothes, no more greasy head rests in the car... I am in awe! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This company is turning into one of my favorite beauty and health product companies. Their products are priced well and are high quality. Castor oil has a ton of uses and comes in handy quite often. My brother got sunburn last week and this worked like a charm. I use it daily for myself as I get dry scalp regularly. Just a few drops every morning will do the trick. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> This Castor oil was great. I rubbed it on myself for joint pain and it really worked. Plus the price was a steal and left my skin so smooth. I received notification from seller right away and received my purchased very quick. Was very impressed with this item gonna refer to frienda and family for sure</li>
    <li> The Majestic Pure Castor oil has been very beneficial to me. I suffer from chronic constipation. After several months of research and failed attempts at other remedies, I decided to try castor oil. This bottle is 16oz. It will last me a while because I drink one teaspoon of the oil when needed for constipation. It doesn&#x27;t take too long to work and it is very powerful. I am so thankful for this oil because I can go day to day without being in pain. I received this bottle to review. Castor oil has many other benefits. I recommend trying today.</li>
    <li> Majestic Pure Castor Oil 16 Oz - 100% Pure &amp; Natural  FOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;castor oil has many great uses, some are just folk tales and others are the real McCoy. castor oil will give your hair a great shine, i have dry skin issues and castor oil works wonders, it is better then smelling like a girl. for what its worth give it a try I think yourself will be hooked</li>
    <li> I got this in exchanged for a review.I use this mainly for my. I let it sit under a plastic cap and a turbie twist for at least an hour (to deep condition). I hop in the shower and use a sulfate free shampoo and moisturizing conditioner to rinse it out. My hair is always soft, manageable and shiny. Every.Single.Time. I doubted this product and felt dumb buying it, but it&#x27;s amazing. If you notice that your hair is dry and frizzy or maybe you&#x27;re having to apply products everyday for it to stay moisturized try a little castor oil mix with another oil (to thin it out, its very thick). I workout every day and I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just use water and scrub with my fingers, my hair doesn&#x27;t smell and the only product I use between my Sunday wash days is a dry shampoo before I shower on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is good on its own or as a carrier oil.  The size is large to allow for mixture and also to use it on its own.  It comes with a pull up top making it easier to use when using it on its own or to put in containers to mix with other oils.  This oil can be used on your skin or hair.  The scent is nice and subtle, not like castor oil that one used to have to drink not fishy.  It is also good for fungal infections and to provide relief from joint pain.</li>
    <li> I love the majestic pure products so when I saw a special promotion to try the castor oil and share my honest and unbiased opinion I grabbed the deal right away, As usual the quality is there , just pure castor oil! I&#x27;ve been mainly using with some lavender oil combined on my cuticles and scalp , but there are many uses for it, It is a large size bottle and it comes with a tip for the bottle do there is no waste there.  it is filled with Vitamin E which makes it wonderful for skin issues,  is also filled with proteins, minerals and has anti-fungal and antibacterial properties .Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> This is fractionated, which is essentially highly refined/processed to make it more shelf-stable.  I tend to prefer cold-pressed, but I was really curious about how this would perform when compared with other castor oils.  I find that the two behave the same, but I still prefer cold-pressed for its beneficial properties.  Also, FYI - per the bottle, the product is sourced from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that this works well, and I really appreciate the applicator top because it&#x27;s been great when using this in the shower (I use it to detangle and braid my hair under the water - after air-drying, my hair is virtually frizz-free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I prefer the cold-pressed over the fractionated (not because of the quality; I can&#x27;t really tell a difference) but because it&#x27;s less refined.  Either way, I love Majestic Pure products and am a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Okay, when I think of Castor Oil, I thought of some old-timey remedy that people used for stomach aches and whatnot. Apparently, there&#x27;s a lot more to it than that. oh, and PSA, you don&#x27;t drink this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic 100% Pure Castor Oil has natural antifungal properties, and is touted to help with everything from acne to sunburn to athlete&#x27;s foot. It&#x27;s also an excellent carrier oil, for you essential oil enthusiasts. I didn&#x27;t detect a scent at all, and it absorbs VERY quickly. I tried it on a very itchy, irritated dry patch on my ankle and a fine red rash on my forehead, and both got noticeably better right away. I can&#x27;t speak for any other uses myself, but I thought that was pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and newly smooth skin are my own.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and had to try it out immediately last night. I used it in my hair and I was amazed!! I have long thick thick straight hair and usually its very heavy when I condition it, which I don&#x27;t do that much. I used this and it left my hair light and fluffy. Smooth and shiney. I love this and will continue to use it on my hair. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Who knew castor oil could be so much fun????  I have been using it to deep clean my face and as a hair treatment.  For the face I am amazed at how clean and fresh it leaves my skin.  I use a small amount and massage into my skin and then put a hot cloth over it to steam out the impurities.  Afterwards I don&#x27;t feel the need to rush with moisturizer or any other treatments.  I am excited to try the many other uses for it!</li>
    <li> product for review: LOVE IT. Great for your skin. This is a great company as well.</li>
    <li> Yes stuff really works!!!!! My hair is a little longer and thicker in 2 months!!!! Amazing!!!!! It will always be a staple in my hair closet!!!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find this oil is kind of dense... not water like.  But it sure does do what it says it will do. It helps my skin problems very well.  Will now keep this in my medicine cabinet as a staple.  It does a number of good things.  Was shipped quickly and was packaged to prevent any ability to spill.  I am sure my grandmother kept this in her medicine cabinet to use for a number of things.</li>
    <li> I use for massages, my hair, and body. I do mix with other oils . it helped my lashes to grow back. You will love this oil. I did receive for review. But my locs love this oil</li>
    <li> As far as Castor oil goes this is one of the best ones that I have ran across. If your new to using castor oil there are so multiple uses for it. Besides being a great remedy to treat some major illnesses and ailments, it has also been found to help with many everyday problems. My family and is use castor oil quite often. I use it as a base oil for many of my Essential oils. I use it for arthritis pain, I have two different ways in which I have tried. I have used it by rubbing straight onto my joints, which I will admit does not work as well as when I apply the oil to a cotton pad and place the cotton pad on the area that is bothering me, I then use something such as plastic wrap or a plastic storage bag to play on top of the cotton pad and the apply a heating pad. This works wonders for me! We have also used castor oil in our home to treat skin infections and other skin problems such as sunburn, abrasions, acne,and dry skin just but applying a bit to a cotton ball and applying to the area of skin, I have heard of people taking it internally as well but this is not something we have tried around our home. I am not a educated in medical practices so please if you want to try anything like that consult with your doctor first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said previously we use castor oil quite often. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful that kind of oils I use. This one I had no issues with. I used it as my base oil for use with my essential oils. I have also used it for the reasons mentioned above. This particular brand absorbs quickly, it leaves no oily residue and had a smooth, silky feeling to it. You really do not need much of this as it spreads very well so just a little bit will do. This castor oil comes as a large enough quantity that it will be on hand for quite a while. It comes with a screw cap for easy use of the oil. It is 100% pure castor oil, no added ingredients! The no added ingredients is what sold me at first. I love using all pure all Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at discount for the purpose of inspecting and reviewing. All statements made are 100% of my own based on my personal experiences with this product.ts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at discount for the purpose of inspecting and reviewing.

    <li> Fast ship, WONDERFUL product. Never used castor oil before but decided to give it a try . WOW! I mix it with my body cream for extra moisturizing and for cutting the strong scent of the body cream. The oil is GREAT to press into crows feet and lip wrinkles to flatten them out. Also I use a few drops on wet hands to blend onto my face for a moisturizer; it doesn&#x27;t look greasy...it&#x27;s more of a glow.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle to review, and we all know that caster oil has a bad reputation from our grandmothers, but I still love that there are so many ways to use it without having to taste it. This brand works just like its supposed, it brightened up ferns beautifully.</li>
    <li> Best Pure Castor Oil out there!!! I received the discounted Pure Castor Oil in exchange of my honest unbiased opinion, and for a person coming from Indian background, I can tell, this is the finest, in-adulterated quality of oil you can get. It is extremely beneficial for the hair re-growth and it helps in bringing back the moisture and locking it. You might want to place the closed bottle in hot (not boiling) water for about five minutes, and then apply / massage with your fingertips to the scalp of your head . The warm oil easily penetrates deep into the roots and does its magic. Apply at least twice a week before you go to sleep and shower next morning. You will see wonders. Be prepared for those compliments you will get !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love to use castor oil for my hair. I am in the sun constantly and Im a swimmer. This stuff works wonders to keep my hair shiny. If you use it long enough you will notice it helps your hair grow faster as well. I had an opportunity to get this at a promotional price and was so excited to try it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it great for the skin. Will absolutely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> When I think of castor oil, I think of an old wives tale on using It to induce labor in pregnant women. Prior to purchasing this majestic pure castor oil, I had never really come in contact with it and did not realize the various benefits it had....or that it was considered an essential oil. I was shocked! After reading up on it and realizing he antibacterial and anti fungal properties that it has, I figured I would try it on my baby&#x27;s cradle cap. I applied it to his scalp and gently combed his hair. The next day there was no evidence of cradle cap! He had been suffering from it for 6 months...since he was born and previous remedies didn&#x27;t work! I am amazed by this stuff! I will be using it in my own hair as well as my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;* I purchased the castor oil  to review during a promotional period. These are my personal, honest and unbiased opinions*</li>
    <li> has little to no smell at all. I use this for the castor oil wrap. Its used to help the body get rid of excess tissues and toxins and it also stimulates the lymphatic and circulatory systems which helps reduce and dissolve ovarian cysts.</li>
    <li> When I received this, I noticed another label beneath the Majestic Pure one. I was curious so I pulled it off. This oil is from another company. I took two stars off because its very thick and hard to work with. I&#x27;m giving them the benefit of the doubt that they&#x27;re distributing the other company&#x27;s product, but I&#x27;m still skeptical.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have struggled with toenail fungus for years.  I have tried EVERYTHING and this product did the trick for me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair feeling  rejuvenated. Wish I could have found this years ago.</li>
    <li> Awesome, for all body..and the face as well...</li>
    <li> This Castor oil is awesome. My grandma was telling me about how her mother use to put it in her hair to make it grow and it I have to say that it does ! I apply on my scalp twice a day and get under the heat for a few minutes to let soak in. My hair has grown at least 2 inches this month. Great oil!</li>
    <li> Very good but I don&#x27;t like its scent.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I found this castor oil on amazon I have been using different types most of them mix with other product but never the pure castor oil, I remember growing up in Jamaica my grandmother use to make it herself and that was the only oil we used in our hair them it makes our hair grow and very soft so when I saw this I was happy to order, the delivery was very fast I got it in just a few days and packaging was very safe too...love the size it will serve a long time and the smell it&#x27;s just as I remembered I Make am happy I found this and make a pledge that from now on I will only be using this product in my natural hair it&#x27;s just simply amazing...!!</li>
    <li> This oil actually made my hair grow back in on the sides.  Nothing else helped.  It softens my skin, and soothes my eczema.</li>
    <li> I always always have castor oil, why? Because it has been the best thing to happen to my hair. I had lost some of my hair and castor oil helped to restore and improve the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 16 Fl oz that&#x27;s a lot, it will last a long time. it also comes with a filter top that makes it easy to apply to sections of your hair and to also pour into other containers. This was an excellent idea because I usually do the very same thing, I would pour my castor oil in a another bottle that had the filter top so I could easily apply it to sections of my hair, I no longer have to do that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil is also very good for the skin, the first thing I did when I received this bottle was to smell how strong the scent was and surprisingly it is quite mild compared to the others, I would pass on using the others on my skin because they are thick and sticky but this one is so very different, I recently developed some rash on my forearm and I&#x27;m definitely applying some of this to it, your skin will also look a lot more smooth and younger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed, would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Castor Oil is used for multiple different things in my house. I use it mainly as a carrier oil in my essential oils. It is 100% pure oil which is important to me when using it daily. I like using this for bug spray (with essential oils mixed in) I can spray it on our cloths and I do not have to worry about it leaving an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; mark on our clothing. I have also been using this oil for massage, it heats up nice and leave a nice soft feeling to your skin. I would highly recommend this oil to others because it is a great price for a great product. I was given a slight discount to review this item.</li>
    <li> Totally Pure;  Castor Oil that&#x27;s pleasant &amp; great quality.</li>
    <li> I love using castor oil when i make.my soaps. It gives the soap big fluffy bubbles and also is very conditioning to the skin. I also use castor oil on the edges of my hair to help them thicken ip&lt;br /&gt; Because i use alot of castor oil, I can really appreciate this Majestic pure castor oil. Some castor oils have a really strong odor but this is very pleasant! I love the applicator tip as it helps to control out pour. I appreciate them puttingthe creation date abd expiration date so there is misuse.  I purchased this a at discount price but will be purchasing full price when this is gone.</li>
    <li> I am a castor oil lover and know a good one when i find it. Pure castor oil is yellow in color (which this it) meaning there are no additional ingredients and very little filtration which is good. I use this oil mostly on my hair since i am dealing with stress induced hair loss. I really like this oil and have added it to my regular hair care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this product was sent to me for little or no cost. After much use i am sharing my honest opinion of it</li>
    <li> Always have some on hand for so ,many different things. I use it currently for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This response could be premature.  I have used the product only about 6 days.  It appears to be a good skin product and I am mostly wanting it to aid with removing skin blemishes and it appears to be working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils but this one takes the cake. It works wonders on my skin leaving it smooth and even clearing up some of my acne. It also makes my hair very smooth. One thing I did notice was a different company&#x27;s name under the Majestic Pure label which I thought was very suspicious but none the less the product worked.</li>
