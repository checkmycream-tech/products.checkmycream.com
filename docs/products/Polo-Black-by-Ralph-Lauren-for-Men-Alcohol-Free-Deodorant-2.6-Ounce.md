      <li>Tried to turn the knob to make more deodorant go up, and nothing happens.</li>

      <li>I ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.  </li>
      <li>It was not as strong as I remember Polo being.</li>
      <li>Works fine</li>
      <li>The Polo Black Deodorant for Men by Ralph Lauren is an excellent grooming product, and I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
      <li>BUY AND ENJOY</li>
      <li>free.</li>
      <li>After searching more deodorants than I can count this is the first to contain this harmful chemical.</li>
      <li>Polo Black deodorant has a great smell and is easily applied.  </li>
      <li>I personally love the smell and find it very efficient.</li>
      <li>This item does not have the staying power that I have experienced with other Polo deodorants.  </li>
      <li>It also has a fresh and pleasant scent, and provides coverage that lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a great compliment to polo black cologne, but still too ineffective to count on.</li>
      <li>It looks like a really nice deodorant and smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey for a deodorant of this size, but it definitely looks like a gift item.</li>
      <li>When I order directly from Ralph Lauren (and pay much more)</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
      <li>I like this product because it smells exactly like the fragrance, and contains no alcohol.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly as I wished it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice companion to my Polo Black cologne.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, but only lasts half a day for me</li>
      <li>I wear this deodorant when going to social functions and have actually gotten inquires from members of the opposite sex as to what that great aftershave is that I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
      <li>very ineffective.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes armpits smell very inviting.</li>
      <li>I really like this item for the price and smell</li>
      <li>the items arrive expertly packaged and cushioned as if they were straight off the assembly line.</li>
      <li>I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>If you are going to be in a high stress situation, try something stronger.</li>
      <li>use you money on black polo cologne, or red lond lasting smell is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just for normal activity.</li>
      <li>I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THE POLO BLACK BY RALPH LAUREN FOR MEN DEODORANT!</li>
      <li>I have used the Polo Blue stick of similar make with no issues, as well the Yves St. Lauren stick was fine.</li>
      <li>I gave it to him inside a new gym bag.</li>
      <li>I liked the Polo in the green container and was hoping this would be similar.  </li>
      <li>But the fragrance is extremely light and does not last long.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Ralph Lauren original green polo stick since high school</li>
      <li>I find that the price of this product is far below the department stores prices for this product.</li>
      <li>I am not a heavy sweater</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I first starting using this deodorant a few years ago after searching for a product that was fairly mild and did not contain alcohol.</li>
      <li>I do sweat more than average but even still I don&#x27;t think this would last long in an air conditioned</li>
      <li>Nearly has no scent whatsoever and this is not Polo , you get what you pay for obviously with fragrance.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is strong and not nearly as pleasant.</li>

<li> The only thing I would comment on is that the deodorant doesnt last as long as the non-luxury brand deodorants.</li>
<li> Does not last long and liquid leaks from the plastic container...that is what happens when a company sells a brand and not a product.</li>
<li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> It is devoid of anything which can smell (good or bad).</li>
<li> I found it very effective, however,  this product is total crap, do not purchase you will begin to reek is you perspire even slightly.  </li>
<li> Hard to get item at a decent price</li>
<li> I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here, it is not very strong and is completely gone in two hours.</li>
<li> Being its alcohol-free it doesn&#x27;t burn your underarms as some other products do.  </li>
<li> Such garbage do not purchase stick to the original and you will no be disappointed</li>
<li> I have used other Polo deodorants for years and all have met my expectations until now.  </li>
<li> , I didn&#x27;t put it togeather right away so three days later after sweating a bit it had become really bad.</li>
<li> Just what he wanted for Christmas, and much less expensive than the large department stores.</li>
<li> Gave it one less star because it arrived beat up, as if it had been sitting around for years.  </li>
<li> The Polo Black 2.6-Ounce Deodorant for Men by Ralph Lauren has the same subtle spice and citrus fragrance notes as the Polo Black Cologne for Men.</li>
<li> When i tried to open the container the whole stick came out and broke at the base.</li>
<li> I had a bad reaction to this product, I noticed right away that my arm pits were itching</li>

    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I WILL BUY AGAIN I ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.  BUY AND ENJOY</li>
    <li> I really like this item for the price and smell</li>
    <li> The Polo Black 2.6-Ounce Deodorant for Men by Ralph Lauren has the same subtle spice and citrus fragrance notes as the Polo Black Cologne for Men. It also has a fresh and pleasant scent, and provides coverage that lasts all day long. The Polo Black Deodorant for Men by Ralph Lauren is an excellent grooming product, and I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Just what he wanted for Christmas, and much less expensive than the large department stores. I will buy every year on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to this product, I noticed right away that my arm pits were itching, I didn&#x27;t put it togeather right away so three days later after sweating a bit it had become really bad. I went to the bathroom and washed off and the skin came off the underside of my armpit, and it burned badly. I didn&#x27;t get a rash, but it felt like I had been rubbed with acid, it was bad, I threw the stick away. I have used the Polo Blue stick of similar make with no issues, as well the Yves St. Lauren stick was fine. I attempted to inspect the label and see if I could find anything but I have never had a reaction to anything else like this before, so watch out! I gave it 2 stars because it smelled good, but damn.</li>
    <li> Bad smell turns off the Women. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It was not as strong as I remember Polo being. My son-in-law wanted it and liked it. So it was good .</li>
    <li> Polo Black deodorant has a great smell and is easily applied.  I have not had a problem with it in any way and highly recommend it to every man who loves the Polo Black fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is great, it&#x27;s not overpowering.  BUT I gave it 4 stars because it don&#x27;t have a safety seal on it.  So you don&#x27;t know if it was used or not.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing not a cheap knockoff.  I&#x27;ve been wearing polo for many years and I know the difference. I was skeptical too and I was pleasantly surprised.  Definitely will be ordering here again</li>
    <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
    <li> very ineffective. I do sweat more than average but even still I don&#x27;t think this would last long in an air conditioned room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it smells great and it&#x27;s a great compliment to polo black cologne, but still too ineffective to count on.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes armpits smell very inviting. It is not extra strength. It&#x27;s just for normal activity. If you are going to be in a high stress situation, try something stronger. But this is a great every day and every night choice to keep you smelling good all over.</li>
    <li> Smells sexy, not over powering!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here, it is not very strong and is completely gone in two hours. I am not a heavy sweater but by lunchtime one would think I had no deodorant on.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and saved a trip to the department store</li>
    <li> Not a bad buy but doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ralph Lauren original green polo stick since high school I am now 40 I found it very effective, however,  this product is total crap, do not purchase you will begin to reek is you perspire even slightly.  Such garbage do not purchase stick to the original and you will no be disappointed</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses only this specific deodorant ... I personally love the smell and find it very efficient. Quality is definitively there !</li>
    <li> I liked the Polo in the green container and was hoping this would be similar.  It&#x27;s not.  The fragrance is strong and not nearly as pleasant. Expensive trial for me.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both like this product for him, and it&#x27;s not overpowering, so he can wear it every day. It&#x27;s about 30% off the department store price on amazon.</li>
    <li> i was looking forward to this ,cause i love the cologne and it last all day. but not the  deodorant. nor does it keep you from smelling  for 13.00 plus this is a real bad deal. gillette  for 3.00 at walmart is better and works all day. get a deodorant that works for you. use you money on black polo cologne, or red lond lasting smell is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the expectation that the fragrance would not be overwhelming.  The deodorant I received turned out to be underwhelming.  I have used other Polo deodorants for years and all have met my expectations until now.  This item does not have the staying power that I have experienced with other Polo deodorants.  Maybe I received a product that had exceeded it&#x27;s shelf life.</li>
    <li> Looking forward again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it.  Being its alcohol-free it doesn&#x27;t burn your underarms as some other products do.  I wear this deodorant when going to social functions and have actually gotten inquires from members of the opposite sex as to what that great aftershave is that I&#x27;m wearing.  This good thing about this deodorant is you don&#x27;t need to wear aftershave with it to get desired results.  It has an earthly man-like smell to it that most women just love.</li>
    <li> Works fine and I love it&#x27;s alcohol  free. Hard to get item at a decent price so was very glad to get it here.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as I wished it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong, goes on easy, and no chalky residual to get on your clothing.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it for years alrerady. The fragrance is very nice. it does not leav any stain on your shirt. And it realy keeps me from sweating for a couple of hours...</li>
    <li> The scent is very weak.</li>
    <li> This the only Deodorant my husband can use. He loves it.</li>
    <li> I suspect this does not contain any fragrances. There is no difference whether i&lt;br /&gt;use it or not. It is devoid of anything which can smell (good or bad). May be whatever&lt;br /&gt;i got has some fault.</li>
    <li> Nice companion to my Polo Black cologne.  But the fragrance is extremely light and does not last long.  Polo could have made it a better match to the cologne ... don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t.  Gave it one less star because it arrived beat up, as if it had been sitting around for years.  When I order directly from Ralph Lauren (and pay much more) the items arrive expertly packaged and cushioned as if they were straight off the assembly line.</li>
    <li> Tried to turn the knob to make more deodorant go up, and nothing happens. It seems the threads are stripped and I have used this 3 times or so.</li>
    <li> great product easy, fast</li>
    <li> my boyfriend like it.</li>
    <li> received an authentic stick (which sadly isnt always the case with some deodorants on amazon)&lt;br /&gt;smells great and lasts all day. i have tried about 6 similar products but by far this is the best smelling, and the best value.</li>
    <li> Good quality at a cost-effective price</li>
    <li> The ingredients list triclosan. Many studies prove triclosan causes cancer. If in doubt Google \\&quot;Triclosan Cancer\\&quot;. After searching more deodorants than I can count this is the first to contain this harmful chemical.</li>
    <li> i ordered spray. they sent me this roller. and this is the worst product in comaprison to price. no fragnance not even its capable of masking your bad fragnance</li>
    <li> I like this product because it smells exactly like the fragrance, and contains no alcohol. Works great, and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Poio is always has a good products and i am loving it.Poio is always has a good products and i am loving it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Polo, great smell.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long. Definitely cannot recommend it</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as a holiday present. I gave it to him inside a new gym bag. It looks like a really nice deodorant and smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey for a deodorant of this size, but it definitely looks like a gift item.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but only lasts half a day for me so I have to reapply.</li>
    <li> I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THE POLO BLACK BY RALPH LAUREN FOR MEN DEODORANT! I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN KNOW THEY MADE THIS. I JUST LOVED THE COLOGNE ON MY FIANCE! CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO TRY THE POLO BLUE</li>
    <li> SImply the best deodorant there is for my money</li>
    <li> I find that the price of this product is far below the department stores prices for this product. Great find and great product. Use once a day and you are all set.</li>
    <li> Does not last long and liquid leaks from the plastic container...that is what happens when a company sells a brand and not a product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and as described, very pleased with the seller and the item.</li>
    <li> Good job and great price.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this as his daily. I prefer it over any others because the scent is subtle. He does have to use a stronger one when golfing or he&#x27;s stinky.</li>
    <li> I purchase a lot of different designer deodorants and this is one of the worst ones as far as odor protection. After about two hours, its like I didnt have deodorant on.  Smells great when you first put it on, but will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I first starting using this deodorant a few years ago after searching for a product that was fairly mild and did not contain alcohol. That this deodorant smells amazing is just a bonus. It lasts months so the price isn&#x27;t too bad compared to drug store brands that smell like 8th graders.</li>
    <li> Works great but costs an arm and a leg...</li>
    <li> Nearly has no scent whatsoever and this is not Polo , you get what you pay for obviously with fragrance. When i tried to open the container the whole stick came out and broke at the base. Terrible product very sorry to say.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would comment on is that the deodorant doesnt last as long as the non-luxury brand deodorants.</li>
