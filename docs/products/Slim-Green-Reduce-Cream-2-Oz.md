<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gives kinda of some sensation, I apply this when walking or running along with waist trimmer belt. that should be good combination at least to work out.</li>
    <li> Went from 47&amp;#34; to 42&amp;#34;on waist in 3 days with help of mcdavid waist trimmer and a lil cardio. a must buy!!</li>
    <li> When I take off my arm bands and waist band I am so sweaty with this stuff. Have not really experienced much weight loss, but I do feel a bit firmer. Gave as a gift and my friend loves it as well.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me I did not see any results</li>
    <li> I guess I need to learn that this types of creams doesn&#x27;t work. It did not worked for me at all. I used it Bio Ceramic Anti Cellulite Shorts when I exercise which in my understanding should help in the process but I didn&#x27;t see any progress.</li>
    <li> i really like the tingling feeling but i see no difference maybe it makes my skin softer but thats it</li>
    <li> this product is okay I have not seen much of a change I no there is so many product out there that don&#x27;t do anything except eat your money never again</li>
    <li> I really liked the heating effect you get during a body wrap.. Way better than what I expected.. Awesome product</li>
    <li> Only work on my stomch for a while.didnt work om my arms or legs.i use it for 2 months cloth didnt fit any looser. ot did made my skin smoother thats it.</li>
    <li> The product smells like menthol and something else but hey that&#x27;s expected. I never tried the product alone I usually put plastic wrap and a excersizing belt on and I start to sweat within ten to fifteen minutes of excersizing. I haven&#x27;t broke out with bumps.</li>
    <li> Slim green reduce cream didnt work for me and I used constantly, im going to try with another brand probably.</li>
    <li> Not even sure what this is suppose to sweats stomach but haven&#x27;t seen change</li>
    <li> I am not gonna lie. You should still work out so that when the weight comes off your stomach ir WHATEVER body part is tomes. But this stuff really works. I put it around my stomach with a sweatband for about 4 hours a day and whenever I work out. Wonderful. I mean, im curvier &amp; my Nelly button has gotten higher. I recommend this completely, though this Will NOT replace exercise.</li>
    <li> it made me feel great gave me extra heat in my body to help help&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;elp&lt;br /&gt; me burn body fat</li>
    <li> Sooooooooooo amazing!! It makes you sweat like crazy! Very awesome!!</li>
    <li> It does make me sweat a lot but thats only when I&#x27;m in the sauna or sitting with the hear on blast.</li>
    <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t work. Could of just bought some icey hot lol</li>
    <li> Works great along with proper diet and exercise not a magic bullet nothing is but this is great love it</li>
    <li> I like this product. I don&#x27;t know if it really helps to lose weight but it has helped my skin. Old marks on my body have been fading from using this product. I would advise not to use on any sensitive parts of your body however because of the light burning sensation. It can be felt more so on those areas.</li>
    <li> been using this product constantly since i recieved it. and has yet to feel or see any results. even wear it while i am on treadmill, exercising etc and i feel no greater sweat.</li>
    <li> have not seen any results yet</li>
    <li> No me guste porq estaba muy chiclosa...si yego antes de la fecha de envio..no creo q compre de esta compania</li>
    <li> This product gives you a good sweat, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and leaves no side effects. Overall, for the price this is a great addition to your workout regime if you wanted a cream.</li>
    <li> After you put it on you start feeling the burn, you sweat more if you put a plastic bag along with it, you start seating like crazy but you have to be working out to get that result. I played basketball in the afternoon for at least 30 mins nonstop and sweat was running down my back. This cream actually works, I started seeing results in two weeks! But it&#x27;ll only work if you put effort in it and I promise you that it&#x27;ll work for you too!!!! :D</li>
    <li> This item was not effective at all! It was a disappointment unfortunately and waste of my money!! I wish I could have given a positive review!</li>
    <li> I used this stuff and nothing happen beside making my stomach hot. It was a waste of 3 dollars and some change.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything, and it smells not great. I only used it for a week and my skin was freaking out. Lame</li>
    <li> I like it so far I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker but it helps. Nice scent as well thumbs up</li>
    <li> I use it with McDavid Waist Trimmer  but have noticed and changes in my body.  It does make me sweat under the trimmer. I am still using however .</li>
    <li> I used the entire product over a 4 week period and saw no change waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> it not working for me, everyone body shape difference. it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  slim green don&#x27;t work  for me.</li>
    <li> I did sweat a little with this but nothing great happened. I bought quite a bit of this and used up 2 jars and nothing impressive about it</li>
    <li> this kit is excelent is complete and too good, and the shipping was excelent all the description is right, very clear and the quality is perfect</li>
    <li> It works good so far I like it that&#x27;s why I order it again</li>
    <li> it hasent worked for me, but then again i didnt use the wrap .DO YOU HAVE TO USE IT ??</li>
    <li> its okay but I don&#x27;t use it much I  use the other cream more i like the night cream best</li>
    <li> I broke out in a horrible rash with this. not even 5 minutes with this on and my skin was burning!</li>
    <li> Okay, the product came very quickly! not very much comes with it but you can but a bigger container. It smells very minty which is nice. You can you use when you work out. Or when you put plastic body wrap on for best results, but I&#x27;m not sure if just putting it on alone will do any good. Would get 5 stars but have to put 2 wraps on stomach to see results. Besides that great!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product since I got it. I hope it will do what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipment and this product helps me sweat while working out five days a week. Once you put the cream on your abdominal area, you can feel a refreshing sensation.</li>
    <li> I had chronic constipation after using this. I don&#x27;t know if this was the cause or something else. Maybe it simply sucked up all the water in my intestines. So I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT... I REALLY WORKS.. I BUY IT VERY OFTEN.. I USE IT ON MY ARMS AND STOMACH AREA!!!</li>
