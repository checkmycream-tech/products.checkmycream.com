### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I was so happy!</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve found my perfect regimen now, and RHG&#x27;s Lotion is an integral part.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is very suitable for people who dont like lotion with odor</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as that good as said in some reviews.</li>
      <li>it feels really good on the face, and it&#x27;s moisture.</li>
      <li>Perfect smooth nourished feeling like a lotion</li>
      <li>this is good stuff.</li>
      <li>The quality is good.</li>
      <li>Really nice toner, no doubt why it is very popular in Asia.</li>
      <li>I use this after my mild cleanser and its just perfect!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use lotions because my skin is too oily on its own.</li>
      <li>Has a nice airy fragrance to it.</li>
      <li>The Skin Care line which I really  liked also).  </li>
      <li>I have no idea if it&#x27;s doing anything spectacular for myp skin.</li>
      <li>smooth and feels really good after using it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Honestly, I like this one better than my clinique&#x27;s toner.</li>
      <li>Most of them use some kind of hyaluron and  collagen lotion mixture.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my best lotion that i&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>Maybe as time goes on, I&#x27;ll grow to love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>It is ok</li>
      <li>This stuff feels like water and is light on the skin!</li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;ve tried most of the Hadalabo moisturizers and did not like any of them.</li>
      <li>I discovered this product when I was living in Japan for many years.  </li>
      <li>I did a lot of research as to which toner would best suit my combination dry skin and after reading many reviews (check out MakeupAlley also on reviews on this toner).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Hadolabo products for awhile now and was not disappointed!  </li>
      <li>My Japanese friends all had perfect, youthful,  blemish free skin</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I can see this bottle lasting me for a year or more, so it&#x27;s great value for the money.</li>
      <li>Non sticky and absorbs very  quickly.  </li>
      <li>It always left my skin feeling clean with lots of moisture retention and very smooth to the touch, but I never though more of it because I was always blessed with good skin and figured I&#x27;d just switch to something else if I ran</li>
      <li>Light texture.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried both moist and light type</li>
      <li>then smooth it all over my face.</li>
      <li>so I decided to give this Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Smooth Light a try.</li>
      <li>my friend bought it and it was like light gel, but mine is liquid.</li>
      <li>Even this \\&quot;light smooth\\&quot; version made my face greasy, yet feeling tight/dry and unmoisturized.</li>
      <li>My cheeks are plump, smooth, and firm and I am happy!  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Goes on super smooth and light.</li>
      <li>I get so excited to wash my face and follow up with this toner.  </li>
      <li>I brought this for the summer months as it is supposed to be lighter version of the original.</li>
      <li>It applies super smoothly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly not harming it in any manner, so it&#x27;s a win.</li>
      <li>but I imagine folks who want a light moisturizer or live in a bit more humidity could use this as a standalone moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My skin feels great, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference when I don&#x27;t use it under the other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t say this too often and quickly about something.  </li>
      <li>What I&#x27;m left with, even before any serum or moisturizer, is beautiful soft moisturized skin.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a little too powerful for my face because for some reason I get oily really quick when I put this on, but it&#x27;s great for winter</li>
      <li>This gentle but effective toner has helped maintain my completely clear complexion.</li>
      <li>After it&#x27;s absorbed my sensitive/combination skin is noticeably well-hydrated, not oily or stick at all.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin/oilier T-zone, but I think I may actually switch to using the original version for winter or mix the two to create some sort of happy medium, and see if I can stretch out the hydrating effect for the entire 8 hours.</li>
      <li>My skin feels sooo hydrated, super soft and smooth once I apply this toner.  </li>
      <li>My skin is a little bit oily and it is just so good for my face.</li>
      <li>absolutely recommend and will repurchase without hesitation!  </li>
      <li>So, this is the only thing that dissapointed me &#x3D;))</li>
      <li>I love this product and this has been the third time I bought it.</li>
      <li>Let me first start by saying that I never leave reviews unless I can swear by them.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and night after washing my face and it doesn&#x27;t broke me out or anything even in hot humid weather.</li>
      <li>There are several youtube videos from various makeup gurus and the company itself that give you a pretty good idea of what to expect/how to use.  </li>
      <li>Also, I have no idea if this is a toner or not, but I&#x27;ve pretty much been using it as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>They suggested that I use this product  along with \\&quot;Cola-rich\\&quot; pure collagen gel.  </li>
      <li>My skin is much smoother now doesn&#x27;t get irritated nearly as much as before and it keeps my skin very hydrated without making my skin oily.</li>
      <li>does everything it promises, it&#x27;s definitely not false advertising.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shipping was fast, thank you</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to others.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>and I really do like it.</li>
      <li>I have pretty normal skin,clear skin, so there are no issues that is has helped correct or anything.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think this product would be perfect for folks with dry or oily skin because of the way it gives long lasting moisture, but seems to balance skin</li>
      <li>chose the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version because according to Hada Labo&#x27;s official website, this type is recommended for oilier skin, while the original version was recommended for extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>I saw a  huge change in my skin after the first 6 weeks of everyday use.  </li>
      <li>But so far, I really loooove this product.  </li>
      <li>I personally seal this in with the cream from the same line because I live in an arid/semi-arid climate (the kind where you constantly wake up to nosebleeds and cotton mouth)</li>
      <li>I use 3 drops and smooth it onto my face before using my other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I smooth about 6 drops of this onto my face and continuously pat it into my skin with my (clean) hands until it first gets a little tacky, then dries down.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to follow the instructions on how to properly apply this toner.</li>
      <li>a medical professional, I can vouch that the hyaluronic acid combined with the pure ingredients in the product is really what helped even out the pH of my skin, and so controlling the amount of oil control.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m left with supple, baby&#x27;s bottom skin ;)  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, has no smell, and has a watery consistency that would be easily be mistaken for just plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This light toner has a little bit alcohol scent and it doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin as well as the moist one.</li>
      <li>I often directly apply it without a toner after washing my face.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll be left with a sticky film that clings to your face the whole day.</li>
      <li>My face feels baby soft after.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely a liquid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 yrs old and have dealt with my oily skin and breakouts since what seems forever.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product doesn&#x27;t not make my face uncomfortable</li>
      <li>I pretty much use it everyday</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I feel like not only is the texture of my skin benefiting from it, but my overall complexion as well (less blotchy, more consistent coloring) even after I wash my face!  </li>
      <li>Ready for the day and no worries about dry skin.</li>
      <li>My skin type is dry; I get very flaky on my forehead and around my nose.</li>
      <li>i expected it would help decrease my acen, but it doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>I first came across this product a few years ago while traveling in Japan, and brought it back with me to the States where I unfortunately couldn&#x27;t find more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> it feels really good on the face, and it&#x27;s moisture. but it&#x27;s not as that good as said in some reviews. i expected it would help decrease my acen, but it doesn&#x27;t help much. Anyway, I will buy it next time.</li>
    <li> It is ok but I used to purchase it at a low price in Asia. So it is a little bit expensive here. The quality is good. I am oily skin and feel it is a little oil when use it in summer.</li>
    <li> Light texture.  Only a little of it can be spread out on mu entire face. Initially, it leaves watery sheen on my face. After it&#x27;s absorbed my sensitive/combination skin is noticeably well-hydrated, not oily or stick at all. I often directly apply it without a toner after washing my face.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to purchase this product for a while now and I had finally finished previous skin care items so I decided to give this Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Smooth Light a try. I absolutely love it!! My skin is much smoother now doesn&#x27;t get irritated nearly as much as before and it keeps my skin very hydrated without making my skin oily. I would absolutely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I always turn to Japanese products when I can&#x27;t find anything on the US market to meet my needs. I have a combination of dry &amp; oily skin. I decided to go with this product from the reviews of others. I&#x27;m glad I did. After washing my face I place a few drops in my palm then smooth it all over my face. Ready for the day and no worries about dry skin. Will buy again from Amazon unless I go to Japan sometime soon! Aloha from Hawaii.</li>
    <li> I probably am writing this review a little too prematurely as I&#x27;ve only used this product a handful of times.  But so far, I really loooove this product.  And I don&#x27;t say this too often and quickly about something.  I get so excited to wash my face and follow up with this toner.  I did a lot of research as to which toner would best suit my combination dry skin and after reading many reviews (check out MakeupAlley also on reviews on this toner).  My skin feels sooo hydrated, super soft and smooth once I apply this toner.  I&#x27;ve never had this feeling before with any other toner (my previous one before this was from Shisheido The Skin Care line which I really  liked also).  And once this toner sinks into my skin, applying whatever serum and moisturizer ontop is like a dream.  It applies super smoothly and I feel my moisturizer sinks into my skin quicker too!  So there&#x27;s no sticky feeling but I&#x27;m left with supple, baby&#x27;s bottom skin ;)  absolutely recommend and will repurchase without hesitation!  (sorry this review was referring to the hyaluronic acid toner, where the words on the left are pink)</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Not too thick, not too thin. Great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I brought this for the summer months as it is supposed to be lighter version of the original. I use it every day and night after washing my face and it doesn&#x27;t broke me out or anything even in hot humid weather.</li>
    <li> It is a good product doesn&#x27;t not make my face uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;Real smooth and feels really good after using it.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast, thank you</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to follow the instructions on how to properly apply this toner. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll be left with a sticky film that clings to your face the whole day. If you do however, you are left with supple skin with last hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in laboratory environment, which means fairly cold and dry air. Usually the fines lines of dehydrated skin starts to appear about 2-3 hours after I make it to work. With this lotion, I can make it about 5-6 hours before starting to see those ugly things creep up on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version because according to Hada Labo&#x27;s official website, this type is recommended for oilier skin, while the original version was recommended for extremely dry skin. I have combination skin/oilier T-zone, but I think I may actually switch to using the original version for winter or mix the two to create some sort of happy medium, and see if I can stretch out the hydrating effect for the entire 8 hours.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Really nice toner, no doubt why it is very popular in Asia. It&#x27;s silky and has no fragrance. Honestly, I like this one better than my clinique&#x27;s toner.</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying that I never leave reviews unless I can swear by them. I first came across this product a few years ago while traveling in Japan, and brought it back with me to the States where I unfortunately couldn&#x27;t find more. It always left my skin feeling clean with lots of moisture retention and very smooth to the touch, but I never though more of it because I was always blessed with good skin and figured I&#x27;d just switch to something else if I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I eventually ran out and switched to other products here and there. I started breaking out last year and could NOT control it - until I happened to come across this product again on Amazon! I was so happy! I had tried everything from expensive peels, lotions, antibiotics, over the counter creams, etc - if anything I might have made my skin worse by mixing all of these things together. After I started using this product again, my acne stopped within a week, and the blemishes started fading the second week. The product works by sealing in moisture into your skin while balancing the pH to control oil production in your face. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, has no smell, and has a watery consistency that would be easily be mistaken for just plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a medical professional, I can vouch that the hyaluronic acid combined with the pure ingredients in the product is really what helped even out the pH of my skin, and so controlling the amount of oil control. What is even nicer is that even if you don&#x27;t see results with it, it won&#x27;t break you out like some other products may. Like all skin products, it is not an overnight miracle but a few days in, you can FEEL the difference on your skin.</li>
    <li> this is good stuff. does everything it promises, it&#x27;s definitely not false advertising.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my best lotion that i&#x27;ve used so far. You only need to use a small amount and it could make your skin feel so hydrated and soft. I will continue to purchase this in the future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Hadolabo products for awhile now and was not disappointed!  I smooth about 6 drops of this onto my face and continuously pat it into my skin with my (clean) hands until it first gets a little tacky, then dries down.  There are several youtube videos from various makeup gurus and the company itself that give you a pretty good idea of what to expect/how to use.  Having skin that is oily, but needs to be well moisturized to prevent breakouts (or my skin goes crazy with oil production) I use this in conjunction with the cream from the same line.  When patting in, it does take a few minutes to get it to the tacky phase of absorption, and a couple minutes from there for it to soften down, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  What I&#x27;m left with, even before any serum or moisturizer, is beautiful soft moisturized skin.  This product is the rock star of my skin care routine at the moment.  I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I feel like not only is the texture of my skin benefiting from it, but my overall complexion as well (less blotchy, more consistent coloring) even after I wash my face!  Overall, I think this product would be perfect for folks with dry or oily skin because of the way it gives long lasting moisture, but seems to balance skin so it feels moisturized, but not oily.  I personally seal this in with the cream from the same line because I live in an arid/semi-arid climate (the kind where you constantly wake up to nosebleeds and cotton mouth) but I imagine folks who want a light moisturizer or live in a bit more humidity could use this as a standalone moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when I was living in Japan for many years.  My Japanese friends all had perfect, youthful,  blemish free skin so I asked them about their beauty regimen.  Most of them use some kind of hyaluron and  collagen lotion mixture.  They suggested that I use this product  along with \\&quot;Cola-rich\\&quot; pure collagen gel.  I saw a  huge change in my skin after the first 6 weeks of everyday use.  Now, 5 years later, I have not had a breakout, dry  patch, wrinkle or any issues with my face.  My cheeks are plump, smooth, and firm and I am happy!  I&#x27;ve been like  a walking spokesperson for the benefits of this product.  Here is the link (in Japanese) for the Cola-rich product:  [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both moist and light type and I prefer the moist one. This light toner has a little bit alcohol scent and it doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin as well as the moist one. This one feels like water.</li>
    <li> This gentle but effective toner has helped maintain my completely clear complexion. I&#x27;m 50 yrs old and have dealt with my oily skin and breakouts since what seems forever.  I think I&#x27;ve found my perfect regimen now, and RHG&#x27;s Lotion is an integral part. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the moist lotion from the same line, and it has done wonders for my skin. Goes on super smooth and light. Has a nice airy fragrance to it. My face feels baby soft after.</li>
    <li> I think this is a little too powerful for my face because for some reason I get oily really quick when I put this on, but it&#x27;s great for winter and I can slosh it all over the dry places on my body and it feels heavenly!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The pH is optimal for the skin and it&#x27;s very moisturizing. My skin type is dry; I get very flaky on my forehead and around my nose. This product in conjuncture with the milk from the same line has made an improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> Using this product everyday during summer morning and night. Non sticky and absorbs very  quickly.  Will continue to buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like only one thing - it is liquid... my friend bought it and it was like light gel, but mine is liquid. So, this is the only thing that dissapointed me &#x3D;))</li>
    <li> I love this product and this has been the third time I bought it. My skin is a little bit oily and it is just so good for my face.</li>
    <li> I use this after my mild cleanser and its just perfect! I can&#x27;t use lotions because my skin is too oily on its own. This stuff feels like water and is light on the skin! Perfect smooth nourished feeling like a lotion but without the sticky heavy feeling. My skin has calmed with this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have no idea if it&#x27;s doing anything spectacular for myp skin. It&#x27;s certainly not harming it in any manner, so it&#x27;s a win. I like the consistency of it. It&#x27;s completely a liquid. It looks like water. I use 3 drops and smooth it onto my face before using my other moisturizers. My skin feels great, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference when I don&#x27;t use it under the other moisturizers. I&#x27;ve never tried using it alone, maybe I will to see if I&#x27;m missing some of the effect. Based on other reviews, I thought this would in some way change my life. It hasn&#x27;t. I have pretty normal skin,clear skin, so there are no issues that is has helped correct or anything. A little goes a very long way. I can see this bottle lasting me for a year or more, so it&#x27;s great value for the money. I think I would order it again when I run out. If not, it&#x27;s only because I&#x27;d try one of the similar Rhoto HadaLabo products. I pretty much use it everyday and I really do like it. Maybe as time goes on, I&#x27;ll grow to love it. Also, I have no idea if this is a toner or not, but I&#x27;ve pretty much been using it as a moisturizer. I&#x27;ll try using it as a toner and see if that makes any difference.</li>
    <li> i do not open it but i used this product before.&lt;br /&gt;it is very suitable for people who dont like lotion with odor</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve tried most of the Hadalabo moisturizers and did not like any of them. I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; toners and the \\&quot;milk\\&quot; moisturizers, even the heavier creams. Even this \\&quot;light smooth\\&quot; version made my face greasy, yet feeling tight/dry and unmoisturized. It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone.</li>
