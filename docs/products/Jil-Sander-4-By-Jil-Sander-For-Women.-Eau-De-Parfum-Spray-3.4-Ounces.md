      <li>I love Jil Sander #4.  </li>
      <li>The latest Feb. 2015 review is the most accurate.</li>
      <li>amazon purchase made it easy for me to obtain it in the U.S.</li>
      <li>Vendor is great with fast shipping &amp; good packaging however Jil Sander #4 is not the same as it once was.  </li>
      <li>In any case, it is a fine cologne.</li>
      <li>Fabulous, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
      <li>Ever since my husband bought me the first bottle of it about 15 years ago, it has been my favorite fragrannce.  </li>
      <li>First rate company!  </li>
      <li>As this vendor admits, this fragrance has not been available or made by its manufacturer for several years or more.</li>
      <li>Many people say it is not the same fragrance</li>
      <li>love this german eau de parfum spray.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, it is difficult to buy and good to have Amazon access for buying it.  </li>
      <li>The only caution is that it can be strong</li>
      <li>Their instructions/description is quite accurate, so the risk is entirely yours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset.  </li>
      <li>I have worn this perfume for 20 years and have never tired of its scent.</li>
      <li>Also, arrives much faster than date given when purchased.  </li>
      <li>Can only buy when traveling through Europe as duty free in airport.  </li>
      <li>Deep, soft and luxuriously sensual without being overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I want my old favorite scent back!!</li>
      <li>The older perfume was made in France or Monaco, the newer in the USA.  </li>
      <li>Long lasting, gorgeous, and in the morning, breathe on it and the scent is back.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a reason the price from this vendor dropped by 50-70% or more in the past year or two.</li>
      <li>but it was the real perfume and no concerns that its not old</li>
      <li>I am aware it does not last as long as I remember it use to.</li>
      <li>This hard to find cologne is worth the high price.  </li>
      <li>Not that the fragrance has been discontinued the inventory apparently has been distributed to sellers and reduced in price.</li>
      <li>It is a mild scent, not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Apparently the company has sold and is being made by a different manufacturer in a different country.  </li>

<li> I too was disappointed when I bought some 10 years ago and found it significantly changed, weaker, without that special intrigue, but this perfume is what I remember.  </li>
<li> It is a deliciously fresh, subtle and lasting fragrance.</li>
<li> Very difficult to find in the USA, as it is a German perfume that I absolutely love.</li>
<li> Though it is often difficult to find in the US, it is worth the effort to source.</li>
<li> I spent a lot of money.  </li>
<li> Not really pricey, given the ability to get it not sold in the US for some reason.  </li>
<li> Men will follow you down the street or lean closer on a crowded train when you wear this.  </li>
<li> Got a sample ten years ago but until now have been unable to purchase it anywhere.</li>
<li> However, a small dab on a piece of cotton and placed in one&#x27;s undergarment the fragrance will linger longer.</li>
<li> My bottle is significantly past its sell-date, and the smell is rancid, unfortunately.</li>
<li> Definitely a subtle but seductive scent !</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s sooo expensive too</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so difficult to obtain here in the states</li>
<li> too bad</li>

    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, it is difficult to buy and good to have Amazon access for buying it.  Also, arrives much faster than date given when purchased.  Not really pricey, given the ability to get it not sold in the US for some reason.  Can only buy when traveling through Europe as duty free in airport.  Richard W. LeVan</li>
    <li> Buyer beware. As this vendor admits, this fragrance has not been available or made by its manufacturer for several years or more. The latest Feb. 2015 review is the most accurate. My bottle is significantly past its sell-date, and the smell is rancid, unfortunately. There&#x27;s a reason the price from this vendor dropped by 50-70% or more in the past year or two. Their instructions/description is quite accurate, so the risk is entirely yours. I&#x27;ve moved onto another fragrance, thankfully.</li>
    <li> excellent experience. arrived much sooner than advertised - in perfect condition. Amazing value, great service. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent site, prompt service, fair price and product exactly as shown!  First rate company!  Carolyn A Tucker</li>
    <li> Vendor is great with fast shipping &amp; good packaging however Jil Sander #4 is not the same as it once was.  I ordered #4 from 3 different companies and they all have a different scent than the Jil Sander #4 that was manufactured several years ago.  Apparently the company has sold and is being made by a different manufacturer in a different country.  The older perfume was made in France or Monaco, the newer in the USA.  I want my old favorite scent back!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this perfume for over 20 years.  I purchased several bottles of it from this vendor and it is not Jill Sander #4.  It&#x27;s been tainted  and doesn&#x27;t smell nice.  I&#x27;m very upset.  I spent a lot of money.  Don&#x27;t buy here!!!!</li>
    <li> Received order in a timely manner and in good condition.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for over 30 years. The last 15 I could not afford  it. Not that the fragrance has been discontinued the inventory apparently has been distributed to sellers and reduced in price. Many people say it is not the same fragrance but I believe it is. As we age our bodies change and things no longer smell the same nor do perfumes smell the same on our skins. I am aware it does not last as long as I remember it use to. However, a small dab on a piece of cotton and placed in one&#x27;s undergarment the fragrance will linger longer.</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for at lest 10 years. They used to produce a body cream . Would love to find some</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for 23 years, it seems that this is the only perfume my husband likes.  I will always love Jill Sander # 4 too bad it&#x27;s so difficult to obtain here in the states and it&#x27;s sooo expensive too but totally worth it!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find in the USA, as it is a German perfume that I absolutely love. Price is fantastic too! So happy Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> I did not like it&lt;br /&gt;Bad smill</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for 20 years and have never tired of its scent. Though it is often difficult to find in the US, it is worth the effort to source. Thank you Amazon for making it easy to find!</li>
    <li> Definitely a subtle but seductive scent ! I&#x27;ve been a Jil Sander faithful for 20 years! My oldest daughter is now a Jil fan!!</li>
    <li> I was turned onto this perfume about 10 years ago and have been wearing it ever since.  It is a mild scent, not overwhelming.  I receive compliments all of the time.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Jil Sander #4 in the 90&#x27;s.  Deep, soft and luxuriously sensual without being overwhelming.  Men will follow you down the street or lean closer on a crowded train when you wear this.  I too was disappointed when I bought some 10 years ago and found it significantly changed, weaker, without that special intrigue, but this perfume is what I remember.  Excellent shipper, it arrived within 3 weeks from Germany, not the 4-8 weeks given.</li>
    <li> Very wonderful smell it&#x27;s well loved</li>
    <li> Jill Sander is a pleasant scent.  I have used it for years.  I ordered it and assumed it was in the U.S.  I received an email written in a different language, could have been Norwegian or German  I&#x27;ve no idea what they were trying to say.  Amazon needs to check that out.  In any case, it is a fine cologne.</li>
    <li> love this german eau de parfum spray. amazon purchase made it easy for me to obtain it in the U.S.</li>
    <li> I order this in May of 2009. I just opened the package The perfume I recieved smells nothing like the Jil Sander&#x27;s I have purchased before. I will not order again form the internet.</li>
    <li> Fabulous, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been discontinued. Ordered 2 more bottles!</li>
    <li> This hard to find cologne is worth the high price.  Men follow me around the grocery store like I am in heat!</li>
    <li> I love Jil Sander #4.  Ever since my husband bought me the first bottle of it about 15 years ago, it has been my favorite fragrannce.  Is it no longer in production?</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Got a sample ten years ago but until now have been unable to purchase it anywhere. It is a deliciously fresh, subtle and lasting fragrance. My daughter, who is asthmatic, reacts to the majority of scents. This one she loves. Well done Jil Sander and Bravo Amazon</li>
    <li> Use this often, get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Was as advertised. Was concerned that it might b a knockoff but it was the real perfume and no concerns that its not old</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. I finally found it again. I will buy again. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance in the world</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume in the world and it is the constant in my repertoire. Long lasting, gorgeous, and in the morning, breathe on it and the scent is back. Just beautiful.  The only caution is that it can be strong so one or tops two squirts will be enough. I hope this never is removed from the market.</li>
    <li> Thank you, thank you, thank you!  This is my favorite perfume and since it&#x27;s been discontinued it hurts my heart.  I just love it!!</li>
    <li> Great and rich perfume. Highly recommended.</li>
