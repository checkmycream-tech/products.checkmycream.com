      <li>It adds a nice smell, but no color time.</li>

      <li>If i get too busy and cannot make it into the salon this adds the perfect amount of color to not make me look like a zebra....</li>

      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>This product allows me to preserve my hair color and helps me keep my hair healthy because I am not over shampooing, conditioning and drying/styling throughout the week.</li>
      <li>Even without touching it, I can feel my greasy hair on my head.  </li>
      <li>I feared I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it-</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>This product does make the roots look lighter and its ok in treating greasy hair (but could be better).  </li>
      <li>The 3-pack is a better value, as I go through one bottle about every 2-3 months (using 1-2 times weekly).</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Accidentally bought two, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>so it is just ok.</li>
      <li>Not a terrible smell, just smells kinda earthy.</li>
      <li>And after touching my hair the product was all over my fingers and some of the powder also fell onto my eyelashes and cheeks-</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Make sure when you use this product to wipe off the nozzle after each use; otherwise it will clog up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really just as good, and the blonde makes it GREAT!!!!</li>
      <li>Love it, best dry shampoo ever!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was hoping this would work better but when I used it turned my scalp yellow...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I hate washing my hair and this gives me body, color and a boost of sunshine.</li>
    <li> It may not be the best dry shampoo out there but it&#x27;s AMAZING when your dark roots are growing out!! The smell reminds me of s musky perfume which I&#x27;m not a fan of but who cares.. If you highlight dark brown hair and your roots show this is your saving grace!! Ulta has good prices on this and in fact now April 30, 2015 they are having buy one get one 1/2 off of all lines of this great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Ew. My hair is very ashy blonde this I can&#x27;t even use because it turns my hair yellow! where I spray it, I wasted money, and can&#x27;t stand it</li>
    <li> This is a great Dry Shampoo but the color doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long. It is my go-to though! Nice scent too. I&#x27;m getting ready to order a couple more of this product after comparing it to other dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It works beautifully! I would highly recommend for anyone with blonde hair and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Made my hair look dirtier than before I used it.</li>
    <li> Left my hair yellow and smells bad. Made my hair look like it had flakes.</li>
    <li> Light tint of gold kept my roots from looking too disastrous and gave my hair that just-washed volume after I delivered my son (and kept it looking great through the postpartum shedding phase). Just what a new momma needs when you&#x27;re working on a few hours of sleep and haven&#x27;t had a full shower in days!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff.  I&#x27;m on my third can and I hope they make it forever.  It is the best dry shampoo around and the hint of color is just perfect.  I used to use an oat based dry shampoo but they took it off the market.  This is the only other thing that has even come close to it.  It&#x27;s really just as good, and the blonde makes it GREAT!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very pale blonde hair and this spayed school bus yellow!  Instead of helping, I have to wash it out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Scalp turns yellow and hair looks like powder.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  The reviews are right - it will add a touch of blonde color, but this is absolutely perfect for root touch ups.  If you just brush the powder in after a minute, it also disperses the color a bit.  Smells nice and does cut grease for those who wash hair every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and this does have an odor to it. If you are not sensitive to various product smells, then it may work for you.</li>
    <li> Batiste is the only spray dry shampoo that works for me. It soaks up oil and gives me half a day to a day longer of hair usage. I love this color version because as a dyed blonde, my dark roots always make my hair look extra greasy even when it&#x27;s not. Batiste gives lift and make roots less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t replace my hair powder for days that I don&#x27;t want to wash, but it&#x27;s a great touch up product to revitalize after a long day, or to run to brunch on a Sunday morning.</li>
    <li> I love Batiste! Dry shampoo is a lifesaver for me as I have fine, limp hair, a toddler, and an extremely busy career! I use Batiste in-between shampoos and even on clean hair when I am needing texture and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about the color option. I have strawberry blonde hair that pulls a lot of copper. I was displeased with this blonde. It appeared very yellowish. With that said, I&#x27;ll be sure to add that it was blendable after working it into my root after proper wait time; however, I do not see myself purchasing the blonde tint again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stink to the options (that over amazing scents)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to try this to put curiosity at bay.</li>
    <li> I love batiste dry shampoo but if your hair isn&#x27;t bleach blond you will look like you have a helmet of powder on your head. It doesn&#x27;t blend very well. Worth the try though</li>
    <li> Love dry shampoo but this one even covers the regrowth when you don&#x27;t have time to dye your hair yet.</li>
    <li> Great product for Blondes! Helps for those 2nd (and yes sometimes 3rd days) when you don&#x27;t want to fix your hair! Covers the oily roots and gives your hair a boost!</li>
    <li> Love love this product!</li>
    <li> Great for blondes and when you just don&#x27;t want to wash your hair on the second day.  Great smell.  Best dry shampoo on the market.</li>
    <li> Best spray when you dont have time to wash your hair in the morning.  Good stuff</li>
    <li> if you have blonde/dirty blonde it is amazing!</li>
    <li> Batiste is an excellent product! I&#x27;m so happy I took the recommendation from my hair stylist to purchase this dry shampoo. I highly recommend this dry shampoo to my friends, family, and co-workers.</li>
    <li> This product does make the roots look lighter and its ok in treating greasy hair (but could be better).  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love batiste and LOVED even more this one! It does do a nice job covering my darker roots (even though that is not its main focus) but it helps! The smell is really nice and the product is always 100% for soaking up the oils in my hair between washes. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The stuff comes out pretty bright yellow and I have to be careful to spray it in a thin layer.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my hair but it doesn&#x27;t match the ash blonde highlights either.  I will stick with the Batiste that comes out with a white powder color rather than the &amp;#34;hint of color&amp;#34; in this one.</li>
    <li> I have used many dry shampoos and like batiste the most. This is the first time I used  hint of blonde and it works great! Absorbs oil, fresh feeling, and as a bonus, hides dark roots! Smell is a little too strong, but otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is great as a dry shampoo in between washing, but more important than that, it covers the gray roots in between dying. It is a little more yellow than I need but you can blend it in with your brush or your fingers and it covers the ugly gray.  It also does not make you itchy or irritate your scalp like other cover up products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used generic brand dry shampoos until I came across the Batiste brand.  I liked the idea of the blonde coloring in the powder.  Not only is the coloring great but the shampoo itself is amazing.  I find myself having to remember to wash my hair when I shower because it feels clean.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and tacky, but light and really clean.  I&#x27;ll always have this product in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very effective, just a bit yellow.</li>
    <li> I live out in the boondocks and none of the stores in my area carry this item.  Would have to use a lot of gas to get to Little Rock to purchase this.  It is an excellent product!! Recommended by Allure and other fashion magazines, rated Number 1.  I definitely agree!!  Sometimes, you just don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair every day.  I use it for a day or two and then shampoo, keeps my color-assisted blond hair looking great!!!</li>
    <li> awesome for volume. expensive to be buying it every week, that how long one can  lasted.</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of color to cover up outgrown roots and gives a boost! The smell could be better, but its totally worth it! Not a terrible smell, just smells kinda earthy. Its helping me go 1-2 weeks past my normal 5 week highlights.</li>
    <li> For sure, this does not cover up your hair root blonde color like they say it will. It leaves a thick yellow color that actually makes your hair look worse than if you had left the gray roots showing.</li>
    <li> Looked like I dyed my scalp bright glittery yellow. Not good for a natural blonde getting highlights. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I would stick with Batiste original (pink bottle)</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is pretty effective. I have tried the blonde colored one and the original and I think they are both good, although the benefit with the blonde one is that it is actually good for covering up highlight roots in between salon visits. However, my scalp often looks yellow after I use it (even after the product has absorbed into the rest of my hair). Also I think the original smells better. Make sure when you use this product to wipe off the nozzle after each use; otherwise it will clog up. The bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long if you use dry shampoo frequently. But anyway, overall, it&#x27;s a fine product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Covers my roots and has a great smell to boot. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the best! A good runner up if you hate the price point of the Batiste dry shampoo is getting TRESemme&#x27;s dry shampoo. Won&#x27;t cover your roots, but is a great price with a smell that doesn&#x27;t well, smell.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever &amp; great price</li>
    <li> Oakley&#x27;s wife here - and I love it! The smell is nice and the color is as stated.&lt;br /&gt;I put my hair up in a loose bun, lightly spritz my roots, cap my head, take my shower and brush out my hair... voila! This product allows me to preserve my hair color and helps me keep my hair healthy because I am not over shampooing, conditioning and drying/styling throughout the week.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and last a long time. I always order it for my mom. Impossible to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  Awesome for blondes.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and this dry shampoo is the BEST there is out there.  It&#x27;s the only one I use.  It has a light blonde powder that blends with wide range of blonde colors. If you&#x27;ve used a dry shampoo, try this one.  It will change your mind about dry shampoo!  It comes other colors too.</li>
    <li> I love Batiste in general - it&#x27;s my favorite aerosol dry shampoo by far. However, I much prefer the Blush one to this. The smell of this is really strange, and really strong. It smells a bit like Play-doh, only less pleasant. The color is very warm yellow, so be warned if you have platinum highlights - it will make your hair look brassy. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I find this colored dry shampoo not as good as the original product. It leaves a sticky film after use that the original product did not. Would recommend the original over this hint of color.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of using a dry shampoo and having positive results.  I have VERY fine blonde hair, which gets stringy at the ends and oily at the roots.  Shampooing daily was only making my ends dryer, so I decided to try No-Poo, Wen, etc ..... both products were just too heavy for my hair.  I resorted to washing my hair one day and then wearing a baseball cap the next two days.  Ugh, not the fashion statement I was hoping for.  I have started using Batiste Dry Shampoo and my hair looks AMAZING!  It actually looks better the third day than it did the day I shampooed, and I am able to style my hair without any problems - my hair is nice and smooth, but not greasy or stringy.  I need to wash my hair every 4th day as I can tell this product will have an increasing buildup, but I&#x27;m thrilled with the results I&#x27;ve had using this product.  Also, the blonde tint is a wonderful addition as there is no white flaking and it also refreshes my color at the roots.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE !!!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking like a limp mess an hour later. I also tried the original that is gray in color, and leaves your hair a bit gray. This one is great for blonds. It blends well. it&#x27;s priced right and works. Who could ask for more.</li>
    <li> this is the worst dry shampoo I have ever used. I applied as directed my felt and looked awful i would not recommened</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful. It takes all shine out and leaves my hair dull. I&#x27;m going to try the regular because this blonde type is not good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used! Has a soft baby powder clean smell. Does not get white pwdeer all over everything. I used this a few days after a shampoo and worked great. Makes hair full and bouncy.</li>
    <li> After paying through the nose for J Beverly Hills dry shampoo, and dealing with its godawful chemical stench choking me to death every time I wanted to refresh my hair, I decided to try out Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it and won&#x27;t be going back to the J Beverly Hills bug bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Does the job-- no one could tell I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair&lt;br /&gt;- Scent is nice-- kind of caramelish?&lt;br /&gt;- Spray can worked well; didn&#x27;t clog up or anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- If you have dirty blonde hair like me, you have to play with it to make it look natural&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves roots a little stiff (not too bad though and washes out well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to find a good dry shampoo. I try to only wash hair every other day. My boyfriend claims he can&#x27;t tell my hair is &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; on the &amp;#34;other day&amp;#34;s. Not bad, right? I can tell-- the hair feels a little stiffer where I sprayed it and it lightens/desaturates my root color a bit-- but the important part to me was looking presentable for the masses. Yes, it has a scent, but the smell is pleasant (kind of like a vanilla shampoo) and not too overwhelming. I had multiple people smell my head (gotta love making weird requests to unsuspecting friends) to see if they hated it, and everyone either liked the smell or didn&#x27;t notice it. The scent seemed to fade after an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Keeps my style fresh for a couple more days whihc is awesome when travelling, and keeps my roots looking lighter which again, helps with the frequency of hair salon visits. Really recommend this.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> Love it, best dry shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it&#x27;s better than other dry shampoo products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping so that&#x27;s good but the original version does work better.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! My hair gets oily about 12 hours after washing so it&#x27;s really nice to have a product that helps with that. This dry shampoo works better than many of the others I&#x27;ve tried, especially the so called invisible ones. It has a bit of blonde in it so it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair gray but adds a little kick. Nice!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the other negative review. I&#x27;ll tell you, I think this stuff is terrific to spray on my roots when they are growing out...I get an extra couple of weeks between touch ups by my hair stylist. The trick with this product (if you use it as I do for this purpose) is to spray it on your roots, make sure you wait a minute for it to mostly dry, then gently pat it a bit so it looks natural. This actually works very well. From what I read on the can, you should also let it dry before brushing out if you simply want to use it as a dry shampoo, but most people are too impatient to wait and their hair comes out flat rather than fluffy. Be patient, people. Sheesh.</li>
    <li> First off I wanted to say that I LOVE Batiste and the dry shampoo part of this works. It does get all of the oil our of my hair and smells great BUT it is YELLOW. I have very light blonde hair and I thought it would match perfectly. However it looks more like a Halloween temporary color spray! The regular kind blends in my hair way better!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Especially between highlights.</li>
    <li> It works well on my thick blonde hair and I really like the smell. Also helps with dark roots and is much more affordable than other brands on the market.</li>
    <li> My roots are really dark and I dye it light blonde so the blonde color does not show up but the dry shampoo does what is supposed to do and takes out the grease out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of dry shampoo but this works the best.  And as a blond it does not make my hair chalky looking which is great.</li>
    <li> The dry shampoo makes my hair feel like I just washed and styled it.  The blonde color works for me and helps cover up dark roots when I am in need of a highlight.  It can leave a slight residue on white clothes if it comes into contact but I have been using it for about 4 months and only had it happen once.  if you don&#x27;t want to run the risk of with the blonde then I would recommend trying the regular, best dry shampoo I have tried by far (and I have tried a lot!).</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever.</li>
    <li> this is OK - it does leave a residue that flakes off on dark-colored blouses and collars</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I usually buy a product that&#x27;s higher end /tinted and costs around 4x as much. I&#x27;m sort of a dry shampoo snob and this stuff is a real deal. It adds texture and lift, and soaks up oils without making hair feel chalky or weighed down.</li>
    <li> Product works decent for root touch up and ok as a dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> I actually first reviewed this product two days ago after using it for the first time. I was pretty disappointed with my first results- the yellow color seemed a bit too obvious on my medium blonde hair (it kinda looked like a flat crayon blonde powdery color), I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the texture of my hair with the product on it, and worst was that I could see the powder all over my roots even after attempting to work it through with my fingers and then a hairbrush. And after touching my hair the product was all over my fingers and some of the powder also fell onto my eyelashes and cheeks- not pretty. I&#x27;ve used it again twice more now since the original review, though, and I&#x27;ve liked it a little better. Even though I did shake the can a lot before the first use, I think maybe it just came out a lot more concentrated or something that first time because on my subsequent uses it hasn&#x27;t been as obvious/quite as yellow looking and hasn&#x27;t been leaving such a mess on my fingers or face after touching my hair- so I&#x27;m happy with that now. I&#x27;m still not 100% sold on the texture of my hair after applying, but the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have also left my hair feeling funky. So after I work this through my roots and brush my hair into place, as long as I don&#x27;t fuss with my hair again, it actually does look fresher and not greasy. So when I need a touch-up at work I think this&#x27;ll do the trick and get me through the end of the day without looking like a greaseball. But my hopes of finding a dry shampoo that will actually allow me to entirely skip shampoos haven&#x27;t been realized. For me, this is just good enough to be a mid-afternoon touch-up. On less oily hair, though, maybe this would be enough to skip a shampoo every once in a while.</li>
    <li> Was not as effective as other dry shampoos I have used. Seller delivered with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Freshens your hair between washings rdeucing oil at roots and keeping length of hair from getting dried out. It also lightens roots.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use as intended for dry shampoo and found it does a nice job of brightening hair growth between salon visits.  Provides body as well.  A bit drying (it is a dry shampoo after all) but in general very pleased.</li>
    <li> I thought this might help cover my roots a bit, but it didn&#x27;t.  It worked very well as a dry shampoo (light, clean, nice scent, etc.), but I get the same results using the regular (color-free) kind.  This one is fine, but I&#x27;ll just stick with the original in the future.</li>
    <li> I never leave the house without this product because it allows my hair to stay fresh all day. It also brightens up the color between hair appointments.</li>
    <li> If you have gray hair this is perfect to hide the gray until you get to the hair salon for your touch up!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo in the market, I have tried Suave, Treseme, and Pantene. Hands down this is the best!</li>
    <li> Love the lightness, immediate drying, and slight color it adds - this is the best spray dry shampoo. Used on fine, curly, dark blonde hair. Give me lift on the weekends when I have to run out after sleeping in, or just adds a little boost at the end of the day to weighted down hair. Makes hair feel soft and looks fresh, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either - just a fresh scent. Works extra great on roots, as the slight color makes it look like my hair hasn&#x27;t been slept-in. The 3-pack is a better value, as I go through one bottle about every 2-3 months (using 1-2 times weekly).</li>
    <li> It left my hair limp and slightly sticky.  I was also disappointed in the color-dulling effect it had on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  No only does it freshen my hair but it also helps cover my roots.  Can use as a volumizer as well!</li>
    <li> A family member owns a salon, and she finally convinced me that my hair would be healthier if I did not wash it everyday.  My hair was getting so greasy every day that I couldn&#x27;t even wash it before bed or it would be greasy when I woke up.  When I woke, I would brush it back, and it would stay back on it&#x27;s own.  It looked like it was wet.  I feared I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it-I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of having greasy hair.  Even without touching it, I can feel my greasy hair on my head.  I bought a bottle of something from the salon, and it worked okay.  Then a few days later, I found this at a local drug store. I only bought it because it had a 100% mail in rebate.  Wow, this stuff is amazing.  I have high and low lights, and my natural color is a dirty blonde.  I was expecting my hair to feel heavy and and still greasy.  My hair is so fine, you can see my scalp through my roots, especially when it&#x27;s dirty.  But, I spray this on, and viola. The clumpy, greasy hair is gone.  It even feels clean.  My roots look lighter, and my fine, limp hair has volume.  I have been able to do up dos that I could not do with my freshly washed hair because it went flat extremely fast.  I have been getting compliments on my hair (when it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;!) and I&#x27;ve been telling my die hard daily washing friends how happy I am with it.  They are still skeptical like I was about doing this, but I think it&#x27;s working.  I never thought I would feel okay with not washing my hair daily.  My hair is still in &amp;#34;transition&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m still training it to not get so dirty so fast.  I will be using this product even after my hair stops getting so greasy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot, scent was good. Didn&#x27;t notice much of a color difference and was a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job as a dry shampoo, but unless you&#x27;re a golden blond, don&#x27;t bother with the colored one. I&#x27;m a natural light ash blond and it left a yellow tint on my hair, as well as my hands (be sure to wash right after working it in). Batiste Original is way better and looks better, and I quite like it for the price.</li>
    <li> Hair type: Dry, Wavy bob&lt;br /&gt;Hair color: Dyed blonde, naturally medium brunette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses:&lt;br /&gt;-The day before I wash: I can go four days without washing if I use Batiste on day 3&lt;br /&gt;-Saves me a wash: Many people consider it better for your hair to wash it less frequently. I honestly don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, and I am just too lazy to dry my hair, which is necessary in the winter where I live. When I save myself the wash, I save my hair the heat of another blow dry, and I save myself the time of washing it.&lt;br /&gt;-At work: I have one of these in my desk drawer and I sneak away to the bathroom to spray it if I am getting a little greasy. Don&#x27;t spray this at your desk, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;pretty aromatic,&amp;#34; as my boyfriend described.&lt;br /&gt;-After a work out: I work out pretty frequently and try to maintain an infrequent hair washing schedule. When the sweat in my hair dries (ew,) I use this to restore life to my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT use this product to cover my roots. It lightens them up a little bit, but if you use too much, it&#x27;s very yellow, not natural at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought two more cans of this: one for home and one for my desk drawer at work. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
    <li> Spray paint for your hair. Looks horrible. Seriously considered using this as actual spray paint. Do not purchase unless for a costume.</li>
    <li> Meh..not a fan. Not a very natural looking color on me. Looks slightly orange. I will stick with baby powder.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Strongly scented.</li>
    <li> I never received these products, BUT I use it and I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> Amazing for blondes..has the perfect amount of color tint to help cover roots and reduce oils. Seriously a life changer!! You must buy this! I am not joking when I say this product changed my life. I used to have to wash my hair everyday or every other day (but had to be in a pony tail second day). and because of this product I can wash a few times a week. I know it sounds gross, but my hair also has so much more body when it isn&#x27;t washed everyday. I even put on after I blow dry to give a little extra lift and to minimize oils for the next day. Another HUGE bonus is the added color tint. If i get too busy and cannot make it into the salon this adds the perfect amount of color to not make me look like a zebra....seriously I look like a zebra when my roots grow in. I also recommend the spray shampoo that has the animal print and cherry print by the same manufacturer. It adds a nice smell, but no color time. I use that if my roots have been freshly dyed.</li>
    <li> Basically bought this to cover grey hair in between colorings.  It had a very yellow look.  Not acceptable I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> My hair is a fine darker blonde, and this product imparts a nice shiny highlighted look. Also it lasts for days. It smells like old ladies, but I&#x27;m willing to look past that because it works so well.</li>
    <li> Does great to hide my black roots with my fake blonde hair. Gives great volume to my hair, extends how long I go between washes. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo overall, but I can&#x27;t find any with blonde in stores anymore. I have been buying two at a time of this one now, and I use it on my roots everytime it starts growing out and I don&#x27;t want to get it done just yet. I&#x27;ll get out of the shower, blow dry, and then spray it in and then I&#x27;m blonde again. When you&#x27;ve just got dirty hair it&#x27;s also great and adds a lot of body. Like all dry shampoos you may end up getting a tense scalp or need to actually wash your hair the next day.</li>
    <li> When first sprayed on, it looks like fake gold. However, once it is ruffled through the hair with your fingertips and brushed, it has a natural looking color and works really well. My hair is heavily foiled and it hides dark roots and grays quite nicely. It has very little odor.. It can definitely extend time between washings and root touch ups. The only drawback is that it dulls any shine but I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again when this can is empty. Well worth the money spent!</li>
    <li> The hint of color is more of a POP of color but it works if you have the similar hair color</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great product for the price,</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo ever! I don&#x27;t love the smell but the product works so well it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo but I&#x27;m not a fan of the color.</li>
    <li> Crap! Made my white blond hair like straw!!!! Could not even run a comb threw it. Plus looked like I  put gold spray paint on my hair read so many good reviews.  But just terrible!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It soaks up the oil in the scalp and helps cover the grays when our hair color starts growing out.</li>
    <li> It is just ok!! There are plenty of dry shampoos out there now, and, while this is one not exactly expensive, it is not the cheapest either. So I expected more than I get from Dove or PSSSSST. You get a little color, but , as others have said, it is very phony looking on the roots (most ppl are trying to cover roots with stuff like this) ....so it is just ok. Sorry if that makes the 5 star reviewer (who is also the seller?? what&#x27;s up with that??) upset. )I see.....the person reviewing was \\&quot;T\\&quot;--sorry about that)</li>
    <li> I love this! Mom of 3 it&#x27;s needed!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo. Because of the blond tint, it blends right in without leaving any white powdery residue.  If you have blond hair, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Allows me to extend the time between my hair appointments. I can get away with washing my hair much less (time is money too!). It adds body to my hair in addition to hiding the roots. Definitely a return buyer!</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite life hack! I have naturally dark blonde hair, but I bleach it to a light blonde. So this dry shampoo helps me go an extra week or two without a touch up. No, it doesn&#x27;t make my roots perfectly platinum, but it does help my darker roots blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also just A+ dry shampoo. It&#x27;s much better than what you find on the drugstore shelf, and you don&#x27;t have to use as much of it as you do with cheaper products. I&#x27;ve been using this for two years and will continue to be a dedicated customer!</li>
    <li> Smells awful, makes hair appear very dry, but, at least a somewhat cleaner feeling.  Nothing&#x27;s really changed from the much older can of...Pssssst</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not only does it make styling your hair easier, it helps to stretch the time between highlights! It is a must have product for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo money can buy. The blonde tint blends with my blonde highlights perfectly, and the dry shampoo gives life back to my normally greasy, fine hair. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Made my hair look yellow more than anything</li>
    <li> This smells like baby Angels bathing in a vanilla cloud of happiness. Works well &amp; smells great. Accidentally bought two, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this stuff. :(</li>
</ol>
