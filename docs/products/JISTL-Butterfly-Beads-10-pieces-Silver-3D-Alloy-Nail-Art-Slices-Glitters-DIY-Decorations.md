<li> They looked a little dull too which made me wonder if they were used from both lack of shine and stickiness.</li>

    <li> Very pretty and couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive however for the price they will do and the stones stayed in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Love them. Been wearing them all week.</li>
    <li> I love these sparkly butterflies!  I used them for a design for my nails along with some other nail art d&amp;eacute;cor by Yesurprise and they look fabulous, if I do say so myself!  :)  Good quality, stayed on for days (plural!) until I took them off...I used nail glue (the kind that you use to put on acrylic nail tips).  I found them to be lightweight.  Definitely would love to purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Me encantan estas mariposas deslumbrantes!  Las use para un diseno de unas con otras decoraciones por Yesurprise y se miran fabulosas!!  Buena calidad, las lleve puestas por dias hasta que yo las quite.  Use &amp;#34;nail glue&amp;#34; (pegamento para unas) para adherer el metal a la una falsa que tenia puesta.  Las sentia que no pesaban.  Definitivamente me encantaria comprar mas!</li>
    <li> Theyre the perfect size and the colors of crystals are really pretty. My customers love them! Ive ordered these twice.</li>
    <li> I got them today and i alrady fall in love with them. thanks!! I will defenetly buy more from you.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love the Butterflys. They look great on the fingernail.</li>
    <li> These are multi colored sparkle there very pretty have yet to use on my nail will use this week hopefully they will stick to my nail .</li>
    <li> These are just what they seem and I like the fact that they are really flat. I can even put them on with just gel.</li>
    <li> These are super cute...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t got my product! Where&#x27;s my stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are not too bad looking. They look similar to the pic just not as detailed precision in lining the crystals. Those seem to be just popped on and some even swallow the wings making it look almost unidentifiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also a sticky sustenance on the back of most of these. I question what this is because it doesn&#x27;t look like nail glue but sticky stuff from the back of stickers. They looked a little dull too which made me wonder if they were used from both lack of shine and stickiness. I&#x27;m not pleased with this and I would save my money and purchase something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend and would not rebuy.</li>
    <li> Too small not worth the money,</li>
    <li> Beautiful just loved them so gonna purchase more defenetly fast delivery exactly as described</li>
