      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not in love with the smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find another item like this one.</li>
      <li>I Haven&#x27;t come across anything I like better.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take too much, and it&#x27;s great heat protection for my often-ironed hair.  </li>

      <li>I love this stuff and refuse to straighten my hair without it.</li>

      <li>I love the way it make my hair feel.</li>
      <li>seems to work pretty good on african-amercan hair.</li>
      <li>this spray left my hair incredibly greasy.</li>
      <li>with hot tools as desired (do not spray more or it will be oily!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great product if you have very dry course hair like mine.  </li>
      <li>and it came out so straight and shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>If i added to much and made it greasy i could add more heat and evaporate it.</li>
      <li>better to spray on your hands then smooth all over your hair because if its sprayed right on, it will be too much for one area.</li>
      <li>Very light weight with a decent scent.</li>
      <li>but after about 30 seconds it is normal healthy looking.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair very soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>bought this when I decided to try curling my fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>I stupidly never used a heat protector spray before this, and a section of my hair became severely damaged, very course and crinkled.</li>
      <li>*never* been able to completely straighten my hair.  </li>
      <li>Healthy hair makes me look and feel way younger and more vibrant.</li>
      <li>I apply right after I shower, spray into my palms and run over my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different flat iron sprays over the years, but this one is the best by far.</li>
      <li>This works wonders to make the damaged section look &amp; feel soft and smooth again.</li>
      <li>They were soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I sprayed one to two spritzes on a 1/2 section from about 6 inches away and combed it through.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>and i needed a trim when i first used this product.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair really soft and healthy looking with a natural looking shine.</li>
      <li>Not anything special as far as I can tell.  </li>
      <li>I have straightened my long hair for years and have probably tried most heat protection products out there.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you use a small amount if you have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have always had many problems with my hair being greasy at the roots but dry and splitting at the tips.</li>
      <li>Very greasy.  </li>
      <li>OOPS I really should have read the reviews...</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky and straight.</li>
      <li>after just one use, my hair felt and looked much healthier.</li>
      <li>Some days I am okay with it, other days it makes me nauseous.</li>
      <li>and I have super silky, smooth, flat hair the next day.</li>
      <li>Which is good because it means the product has a high evaporation temperature providing more protection to your hair but its bad because if you spray to much your sorta out of luck.</li>
      <li>I was able to make mine less greasy with the dryer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, including my previous fave...biosilk.</li>
      <li>high high heat(400 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;curly hair</li>
      <li>If you use directly it can be too much.  </li>
      <li>Unlike normal heat protectant</li>
      <li>I suspect a normal person would not have been as paranoid as I was.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>probably work great for thick, dry hair&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Similar to other reviewers, I found that if used as a conditioning treatment, this product can be very useful.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your hair shiny and soft...</li>
      <li>Have used this product on my hard-to-manage naturally curly hair for about 3 years now, and I hope they never stop making it.  </li>
      <li>I have blonde hair and if I spray too much of it</li>
      <li>I recommend to anyone who has thick hair, absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>This product was very sticky and made a mess of my hot iron.</li>
      <li>i use it before i blow dry my hair and a little more before i straighten it</li>
      <li>This stuff conditions my hair like no other!</li>
      <li>But again, be careful how much you use lest your hair get greasy!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Figuring I had simple overdone it (which is usually true of everything I do), I tried using much less the next time and from a farther distance.</li>
      <li>I put my hair up before my shower, spray the ends of my hair, shampoo and condition as normal (only the tips get conditioner, because that also makes my hair greasy), let air dry in my sleep</li>

<li> flat iron along with this spray.  </li>
<li> The only one I will use is Ion Heat Protection spray, I have used other more expensive brands and still go back to this.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
<li> I would imaginge that folks who have &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; hair but still use a flat iron would also benefit from this spray.  </li>
<li> it tames the flyaway hairs after flat ironing.</li>
<li> Until my next shower, my tips were neither oily nor dry.</li>
<li> I have curly but long hair (translation &#x3D; frizzy).  </li>
<li> I blow my hair mostly dry, then section it off, spray each section with Ion Heat Protection Spray and iron until dry.  </li>
<li> Then I either blow dry, or wait til it is dry.</li>
<li> At this point, I considered this product pretty worthless to me and decided to pitch it right after I washed it out of my hair.</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t weigh down your hair and make it very flat.</li>
<li> When I don&#x27;t use this product my hair seems dry and damaged due to coloring it.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> i have extremely damaged hair</li>
<li> For average hair I would suggest spraying into hand then running your hands through your ends</li>
<li> have a lot of hair its average thickness</li>

    <li> I have thick, brown, dry, hair. This is the best heat protection spray I have used. Leaves your hair shiny and soft...like a heat protector/shine spray combo. A little goes a long way. The supply store where I used to get this went out of business so now I am ordering on line. Love this product...I Haven&#x27;t come across anything I like better.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have used this for years.  Makes your hair very soft and shiny.  Just don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
    <li> The product left my hair extremely greasy and has a weird smell to it</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have very dry course hair like mine.  After I straighten it is shiney and frizz resistant until my next shampoo. I have been using this for years and can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> This is the best; my salon even uses it. Makes your hair shiny and silky and protects it from damage while using heat tools. better to spray on your hands then smooth all over your hair because if its sprayed right on, it will be too much for one area. just a couple sprays will do the job. This lasts foreverrr!</li>
    <li> This product is a must for me whenever i straighten my hair. It protects my hair and makes it real smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, including my previous fave...biosilk. This is amazing, I&#x27;m so happy!  I apply right after I shower, spray into my palms and run over my hair. If you use directly it can be too much.  Then I either blow dry, or wait til it is dry. My hair looks healthy and I&#x27;ve had men compliment my hair. When I don&#x27;t use this product my hair seems dry and damaged due to coloring it.  Healthy hair makes me look and feel way younger and more vibrant. I will never stop using this product.</li>
    <li> Short Review:&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Protects hair&lt;br /&gt;-Conditions&lt;br /&gt;-Would probably work great for thick, dry hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-Fine hair will be greasy&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not in love with the smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this when I decided to try curling my fine, straight hair. I have always had many problems with my hair being greasy at the roots but dry and splitting at the tips. The instructions on the bottle tell you to spray on individual sections of hair (but not the roots). The first time I used it, I sprayed one to two spritzes on a 1/2 section from about 6 inches away and combed it through. Then I styled my hair. My hair was greasy as all get out and I dared not let it touch my neck for fear of causing my acne to flair up. (Note: the list of things that cause my acne to flair up include such items as sunscreen, lotions, and breathing air. I suspect a normal person would not have been as paranoid as I was.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figuring I had simple overdone it (which is usually true of everything I do), I tried using much less the next time and from a farther distance. I still found my hair to be too oily for my tastes. At this point, I considered this product pretty worthless to me and decided to pitch it right after I washed it out of my hair. However, it was after I rinsed this stuff out of my hair that I discovered a wonderful thing. This stuff conditions my hair like no other! Until my next shower, my tips were neither oily nor dry. They were soft and smooth. I put my hair up before my shower, spray the ends of my hair, shampoo and condition as normal (only the tips get conditioner, because that also makes my hair greasy), let air dry in my sleep and I have super silky, smooth, flat hair the next day. This alone brought my rating up a star. While I probably won&#x27;t purchase another bottle, I have a use for the one I do own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the smell. Some days I am okay with it, other days it makes me nauseous. It&#x27;s fairly low odor, (ie. it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers), but I&#x27;m just not into it.it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers), but I&#x27;m just not into it.</li>
    <li> Very greasy.  Hard to &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; the oiliness while straightening.</li>
    <li> OOPS I really should have read the reviews...this spray left my hair incredibly greasy. It could possibly be sprayed on the hands and worked through hair for added shine.</li>
    <li> If used correctly works wonderful but can be a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair its average thickness and i needed a trim when i first used this product. I used it after dyeing my hair with manic panic, my ends were split and I desperately needed a trim. Looking back I sprayed way to much(I sprayed it like it was a detangler not a heat protectant XD). For average hair I would suggest spraying into hand then running your hands through your ends so you don&#x27;t weigh down your hair and make it very flat. If u have curly hair thick hair spray away. Unlike normal heat protectant If i added to much and made it greasy i could add more heat and evaporate it. This one I could not do this! Which is good because it means the product has a high evaporation temperature providing more protection to your hair but its bad because if you spray to much your sorta out of luck. I was able to make mine less greasy with the dryer but it took awhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST USES&lt;br /&gt;spray when your hair is wet!&lt;br /&gt;dry with dryer&lt;br /&gt;style with hot tools as desired (do not spray more or it will be oily!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE IF YOU HAVE&lt;br /&gt;thick&lt;br /&gt;frizzy&lt;br /&gt;split ends&lt;br /&gt;use high high heat(400 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;curly hair</li>
    <li> I have curly but long hair (translation &#x3D; frizzy).  I tried brazilian straigthening and all it did was teach me how to use a flat iron.  I now use a &amp;#34;wet/dry&amp;#34; flat iron along with this spray.  I blow my hair mostly dry, then section it off, spray each section with Ion Heat Protection Spray and iron until dry.  I have *never* been able to completely straighten my hair.  When I use the wet/dry iron and this spray my hair looks like I had Japanese straightening (like a Pantene comercial).  I would imaginge that folks who have &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; hair but still use a flat iron would also benefit from this spray.  This spray does &amp;#34;double duty&amp;#34; - it gives you aesthetically pleasing hair and mitigates the damage from heat processing.  My hairdresser told me never to use a heat appliance (flat iron or curling iron) without it.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair silky and straight. I have not been able to find another item like this one. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I used this on my best friends hair and she has very thick curly hair and it came out so straight and shiny and healthy. I also use it myself and it works so good!! I recommend to anyone who has thick hair, absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I have straightened my long hair for years and have probably tried most heat protection products out there. I have to say this is the worst product I have ever tried. I purchased this at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply, so I didn&#x27;t have a chance to be cautioned by reviews. Please do not use this, your hair will feel and look like you dipped it in baby oil. Side note: I have only chosen to write positive reviews for things, until this product, so I&#x27;m not just a party pooper saying something is bad...</li>
    <li> This is the best. I love the way it make my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Este producto es muy bueno ideal para cabello seco es como un aceitito protege el pelo al maximo y deja el pelo con brillo no es nada grasiento solo aplicar un poco o lo necesario y listo.</li>
    <li> La f&amp;oacute;rmula es muy grasienta, en mi caso lo que hago es ponerla en mis manos y distribuirla por que de lo contrario tendr&amp;iacute;a que lavarme el pelo de vuelta como me paso.&lt;br /&gt;No la vuelvo a comprar, no la recomendar&amp;iacute;a.</li>
    <li> Preferred over CHI  straightening spray.. Definitely recommend it. It has a nice &#x27;feel&#x27; to it.. Very light weight with a decent scent. It works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy! LOVE IT!! Buy it! You will love it too!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair. I stupidly never used a heat protector spray before this, and a section of my hair became severely damaged, very course and crinkled. This works wonders to make the damaged section look &amp; feel soft and smooth again. I could see how people would think this makes you greasy... I have blonde hair and if I spray too much of it my hair looks greasy. Just make sure you use a small amount if you have fine hair. I would buy it again, if the bottle ever runs out. Great purchase :)</li>
    <li> Perhaps this product conditions, I&#x27;m not exactly sure. I simply couldn&#x27;t get past the fact that it made my hair EXTREMELY greasy after following the directions and not using very much at all. I have long, thick and semi-dry hair so this wasn&#x27;t a problem of my hair being over conditioned or it being too fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to other reviewers, I found that if used as a conditioning treatment, this product can be very useful. I run a small amount into my hair after getting out of the shower and comb through. This makes my hair very soft and healthy. But again, be careful how much you use lest your hair get greasy!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and refuse to straighten my hair without it. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different flat iron sprays over the years, but this one is the best by far.</li>
    <li> This product was very sticky and made a mess of my hot iron. I was not impressed with it at all. It was a messy mess.</li>
    <li> The only one I will use is Ion Heat Protection spray, I have used other more expensive brands and still go back to this.&lt;br /&gt;You need to use VERY little, you might think your hair looks a bit damp afterwards but after about 30 seconds it is normal healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Have used this product on my hard-to-manage naturally curly hair for about 3 years now, and I hope they never stop making it.  Doesn&#x27;t take too much, and it&#x27;s great heat protection for my often-ironed hair.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Leave your hair greasy? Check!!&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash my hair with my regular shampoo and then use the clarifying shampoo to get all the grease out! Gross</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT LEFT MY HAIR LOOKING AND FEELING GREASY... GROSS! I FELT AS IF I NEEDED TO WASH MY HAIR ALL OVER AGAIN. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> seems to work pretty good on african-amercan hair. it tames the flyaway hairs after flat ironing. would use it again.</li>
    <li> I suppose it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Not anything special as far as I can tell.  I don&#x27;t like clutter and I chose to throw this product away as I wasn&#x27;t using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> amazing product! i bought it at sally&#x27;s, not here, but it&#x27;s still amazing. i have extremely damaged hair and it makes my hair really soft and healthy looking with a natural looking shine. it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it oily. i use it before i blow dry my hair and a little more before i straighten it and it works perfectly. after just one use, my hair felt and looked much healthier. this is definitely the best heat protection spray out there.</li>
