      <li>I love the stuff and it works great.  </li>
      <li>This is a huge issue because you can not get the ideal consistency.</li>
      <li>Just watch a couple youtube videos and you&#x27;ll be able to do it to yourself in no time!</li>
      <li>Okay so I bought this having never waxed anything in my life!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I could not find this anywhere else but here and am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It was pretty much perfect.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have used it for years now!</li>
      <li>Takes longer than it says to warm up.</li>
      <li>Having said that, I can&#x27;t give it five stars, because I don&#x27;t think they are really tellig the truth about how it works best in the instructions.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product before and liked it.  </li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing my own brows for about 8yrs.</li>
      <li>You have to heat it up for much longer than the box states, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>then the sticker kind of wax.  </li>
      <li>This product does not work nearly as effectively on him.  </li>
      <li>Some of the wax hadn&#x27;t melted, but some of it was very liquidy, so stirring all together made a perfect consistency.</li>
      <li>It is soo nice because it numbs the area after so there is no burning.</li>
      <li>I guess your results with this are going to vary with what kind of hair you are dealing with.  </li>
      <li>I could have plucked my own brows by then, and now must proceed to do just that...</li>
      <li>Its easy to use, remove all hair in one time, and smell good.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and saves a TON of money from getting this done at the salon.</li>
      <li>Use a pair of your own beauty tweezers and it will work better.</li>
      <li>far as waxing though, I had the best luck on my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>It also works A MILLION times better than those wax strips that you warm up in your hands.</li>
      <li>it worked great and was fun to use.  </li>
      <li>Came off easy!</li>
      <li>It works so well and is awesome in general.</li>
      <li>When I first started waxing this was the product that I used and it worked great and lasted for ever.</li>
      <li>Just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t just</li>
      <li>I still love my Sally Hansen creme though.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need strips for it.</li>
      <li>It works for about 2 weeks and the hair comes out smoothly and effectively.</li>
      <li>hairs (most of them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Have to do it twice just to make sure i get the hair i wanted to get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years (mostly on the chin).</li>
      <li>One thing&#x27;s for sure-</li>
      <li>Hope I helped! :)</li>
      <li>the wax would just stick to the wand, making it to where I couldnt use it again to apply more.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that there are no strips to hassle with.</li>
      <li>I also ended up leaving most of the hair on my lip.</li>
      <li>and I was satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love it will recommend</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this anywhere in stores, but I don&#x27;t really want to buy it from Amazon b/c of the cost of shipping either way, a great product</li>
      <li>There are so many things I would rather do besides</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used waxing products from this brand a couple times, mostly waxing strips.</li>
      <li>Realistically, the \\&quot;90 seconds on medium power\\&quot; that is on the box doesn&#x27;t cut it, but I think it&#x27;s more so that people don&#x27;t end up with wax all over the microwave.  </li>
      <li>If you pull it out WITH the hair growth, it will not work (but NOTHING would work doing it that way:) ).&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, you do have to watch it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t bubble</li>
      <li>Once I did a couple more times I felt confident to move on to my lip.</li>
      <li>but I think I will look for something better.  </li>
      <li>The wax had a consistency of cheap caramel candy that is too warm.</li>
      <li>but although it is inexpensive, I am going to buy some more brow wax from another company as soon as I am finished with this review.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Same thing, voila, perfect</li>
      <li>Still, I used the orange stick in the more goopy parts of the wax, spread it over the parts of my eyebrow</li>
      <li>This product will give you appropriate DIY-quick-fix-at-home level results.</li>
      <li>Hope I helped! :)</li>
      <li>and it could have been better.</li>
      <li>it works much better than strips</li>
      <li>It does ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansens stips and they work better.</li>
      <li>this is the next best thing to going to a salon for waxing!</li>
      <li>but you have to apply more than once to get most of the eyebrow hair.</li>
      <li>This is great if you want to avoid the high salon prices.</li>
      <li>new packaging and formula - product is great,</li>
      <li>And it was fairly easy to do :)</li>
      <li>Just be careful and you&#x27;ll have great results!</li>
      <li>I had to microwave mine longer than expected for it to get the perfect mix to stir.</li>
      <li>I am smooth and hair free!  </li>
      <li>I thought at first that it was a good idea and would help the wax melt more quickly.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but it ripped my skin off and does not peal off easily at all!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this very damaged! Also I read the instructions all the way through, and the wax was done and I let it cool and I put it on and it just hardened and I tried too get it off and it pealed my skin. Made it bleed. So it not something I would purchase .</li>
    <li> this is the next best thing to going to a salon for waxing! it works much better than strips you can buy to remove hair and causes very little pain. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to save a little money and cut back on salon visits for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing again but after time I have noticed that the more you reheat it over time the less likely the wax will break down and melt properly. however, it has not been much of a problem. you may only get about 2/3 - 3/4 use of the wax but for the price that is not too bad!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when the plastic deposit the wax is in melted the first time I put in the microwave. Thankfully, I gave the wax a chance and the wax left in the plate I placed it into I used it for my face and I was satisfied. The eyebrows stencils don&#x27;t work for me, and the tweezers don&#x27;t work either. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It worked perfectly and I am so thrilled I purchased it! It worked  very well and was easy to use. Includes everything you need.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily for my upper lip.  I&#x27;ve tried it to clean up the stray hairs under my brow line, but it dripped all over my lashes, barely caught any hair and generally was not worth the trouble.  However, for the upper lip, I prefer this to Nair (which I found over time took longer and longer to be effective, and would leave little black hair follicle dots) or the waxing strips which you warm with your hands (generally have to go over an area several times for it to work, which often will cause you to pull off some skin, and thus scarring -- not a good look!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product removes the most hairs on the first try and I really like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know before you buy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I heat this up in the microwave for 1 minute at a time, till it is really hot and is of a very thin consistency.  I then use the spatula to stir and stir till it cools down and I&#x27;ll use it just as the sides start to get a gel like consistency.  Otherwise, the consistency of the product is odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This stuff gets messy.  If you wait till the wax is a more \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot; consistency, then it will not work very well.  You want to use it when it&#x27;s still of a  pretty thin consistency, given the applicator tool.  So it can get everywhere.  Again, using this for my upper lip, I scoop some on the spatula and position the \\&quot;pot\\&quot; underneath, so the excess can drip back in the pot, rather than all over my bathroom sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This dries VERY quickly and to a hard finish.  Even though you&#x27;re thinking, wow, this is a liquidy mess as you&#x27;re about to put it on, it hardens almost the second you put it on.  And the finish is rather shell-like and hard, which I think is easy for at home use,than the sticky no-tweeze waxes the pros use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It hurts A LOT.  More so than the pre-waxed strips you heat in your hands, because you have to apply it pretty quickly to get the right consistency, you can&#x27;t really removes small patches at a time.  Otherwise, the consistency gets off and its a mess.  I&#x27;ve found it easiest to coat the upper lip area entirely (somewhat in sections, but it will all run together), and then wait a minute or so, so it&#x27;s really nice and hard, and then hold the skin VERY tautly and remove slowly because HOLY CRAP does it hurt.  To me, it feels like some sadist is individually tweezing each hair on my upper lip off and so I can only do a bit at a time before having to back off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) It will leave you red for awhile, so don&#x27;t do this right before you need to be somewhere.  Even when I did the small bit on my eyebrows, and it took out like 5 hairs, I was really red there for several hours.  However, unlike when I used the wax strips and I&#x27;d get red, the redness went away and I didn&#x27;t find out later that I&#x27;d pulled off a bunch of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this product is probably not for everyone, is kind of a pain to work with and get it \\&quot;just right\\&quot;, but the results are pretty great when you do.  I usually end up having to tweeze a handful of stray hair, but I&#x27;ve found that they are \\&quot;pre-pulled\\&quot;, so it doesn&#x27;t actually hurt.  Also, I&#x27;ve never used this when the hairs were still growing in and fairly short -- not sure how well it&#x27;d work, though I imagine it&#x27;d do okay since my lip hair never all grows in at the same length, and it does pretty well even on those really fine hair just above your lip (which hurt REALLY bad when coming out).</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Having said that, I can&#x27;t give it five stars, because I don&#x27;t think they are really tellig the truth about how it works best in the instructions.  I heat this wax in a small pan of water on the stove, and use it with small cloth strips.  Over-heating or getting water in the wax pot will make it foamy and ruin it.  The soothing cream is great.  I never use the tweezers or eyebrow stencils.  For some weird reason, it only works for eyebrows and hairline.  Face, lip and chin areas do not come clean with this wax.</li>
    <li> What a waste of time and money. The wax never became soft enough to spread and the only thing the wax stuck to was the wand. Save yourself the trouble and try something else.</li>
    <li> It really does work! You must put the wax on in the direction that the hair grows and rip it off in the opposite direction!! Have to do it twice just to make sure i get the hair i wanted to get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this wax 2 or 3 times in the past and absolutely love it. It works for about 2 weeks and the hair comes out smoothly and effectively. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with getting the hair to come out on the first try. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars though, because it can get a little messy applying it (I have my \\&quot;Monroe\\&quot; pierced so it&#x27;s gotten stuck on the ring a few times). Definitely worth a purchase if you don&#x27;t want to deal with strips or a warmer; however look for it in stores if you don&#x27;t want to pay 90% shipping.</li>
    <li> A total waste of money. Does NOT WORK!!! The box instructs to heat in microwave for 90 secs. An even after 15 MINUTES IT WAS STILL ROCK HARD!!</li>
    <li> I used GiGi Microwave Tweezeless Wax the past year with great results but finally ran out - there was a good deal on this Sally Hansen wax so I decided to try it out. First, it was still hard as a rock after the recommended 90 seconds at medium power. I had to heat it up an additional 2 minutes at 70% power. Then once I started stirring it up, I noticed it seemed to get thick again very fast and while I was messing around trying to see the heat sensitive \\&quot;READY\\&quot; on the applicator (which you really can&#x27;t see through the wax no matter what temperature it is), it got too cool and I had to heat it up another 20 seconds. After that, I ran to the bathroom, put it on my upper lip, waited for about 5 minutes and when I went to peel the right side off, it just fell off! The left side also peeled off with very little resistance. When I checked for hair, it was like I never even waxed! I went ahead and did it a second time (maybe I messed up?), but had pretty similar results the 2nd time. I ended up having to tweeze 80% of the hair that it missed. Will be getting GiGi again soon.</li>
    <li> I guess your results with this are going to vary with what kind of hair you are dealing with.  Not all facial hair is created equal.      If your problem is chin whiskery type hair - this isn&#x27;t going to cut it.  You would have to let it grow mortifyingly long for this to work.  Maybe if you will have no contact with civilization for 3 weeks or so, this would be the way to go...  but for that hair, plucking seems best if it&#x27;s SERIOUSLY just a few, shaving or laser are your best bets if there&#x27;s more than that.      I was, for reasons I don&#x27;t understand, blessed with decent eyebrows.  No unibrow, no crazy strays.  I don&#x27;t know why, I have crazy hair issues everywhere else (except my arms, which are also weirdly normal).  So I have never attempted to do ANYTHING to my eyebrows.  Off the cuff the thought of waxing them with this, though, seems messy and bound to go poorly.  I don&#x27;t even want to think about it.      What I use this for is my &#x27;stache.  Luckily, blonde, and fine, but it is prone to get weirdly LONG.  Since the hairs are so fine, this seems to grab it easily, even when quite short, and then it stays away for months.  Of course this is going to depend on how bad of a problem your lady &#x27;stache is.  And if it&#x27;s whiskery type hair, see the chin hair commentary - this probably won&#x27;t work.      For ME, it&#x27;s perfect.  Sugar type wax strips never seem to work, seems like the hair has to be long for sugar wax, but this grabs it all and grabs it in one pass.  It&#x27;s like the hard waxes shrink around even the tiniest fine hairs and yank &#x27;em out.  It takes a little practice to get it just so - spread just right, a tad thicker at the end so easier to grab - but once you do it&#x27;s easy.  And one package lasts for YEARS...  I just put the wax back in the pot and use it over and over again.  I think I have actually only bought this type of wax 2 times in about 9-10 years.  Since the hair is so fine, it doesn&#x27;t really impact the wax at all.  You can just keep re-using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my own brows for about 8yrs. Normally I use a salon quality wax with the cloth strips but I didn&#x27;t have time to pick up a new one and I needed to wax now! I was in a local drug store and came across this, since I wasn&#x27;t going to have time to get to a beauty supply store during the week I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance. It took nearly 3min to melt the wax in the microwave - and my microwave is powerful! By the time I was done the wax was nearly solid again and all along the top of the jar. I wasn&#x27;t able to clean off the ready stick. And it&#x27;s all over my nails and skin. Since I normally use honey wax I am able to wash of with warm water, this stuff is still stuck on my fingernails. On top of this I have a ton of fine hairs that are left behind - and I realize the packaging does say it needs to have grown for X number of days. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t really hurt, but then again I&#x27;m used to waxing my brows. Salon quality wax gets the fine hairs. Hoping I can return it. If not, oh well. Lesson learned - stick with the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. long time to warm and it does not pull enough hair at one time.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this wax, but when I did (after following all directions correctly) it ended up stuck on my skin. The wax hadn&#x27;t even had 3 seconds to cool before it was stuck. It hurt! It took a while for me to finally peel it off. The only people who like it are those who have been using it for a while (and have practice with it) - and even they have had problems with it! Won&#x27;t ever buy a Sally wax product again because of this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for 2 years and I love it. No strips are needed. When it comes to heating ignore the instructions--Like another reviewer mentioned, heat for about 2 mins. I suggest stirring the wax until it is a caramel syrup consistency, just remember -- if its too thin, it is too hot. It takes a few uses to get it right, but once you do you will love this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this at the local drug store.  Paid $6.39 +tax.  Followed the directions to the letter (nuked for 90 seconds, stirred until the temp-sensitive paddle said &amp;#34;Ready&amp;#34;, et cetera...).  The problem is, by the time the paddle said &amp;#34;Ready&amp;#34;, the wax was too thick to work with.  So I heated it up a little more, just to make it easier to spread on in a thin layer.  Waited until the wax was still soft, but not sticky and pulled the wax off briskly, and against the growth of the hair.  It removed about (and this is a guestimate, of course) 25% of the hair.  In my opinion, based upon this one attempt, this product is neither worth the time nor $$$.  For me, the Sally Hansen wax strips work far better and are much simpler to use.</li>
    <li> I have used the surgi stickers before on my eyebrows and lip but after trying this product, I won&#x27;t ever use anything else again.  It did take longer to heat the wax compared to what the directions said, but it completely removed the hair on my lip in one try.  I also waxed my eyebrows (but did not use the sticker guides in the kit) it worked great and was fun to use.  I found it less painful then the sticker kind of wax.  I imagine you have to get the hang of how thick to make the wax, or how hard to let it dry before peeling... you want it cool, but not solid.  I think those variables are the reasons for the mixed reviews.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible product!  Messy can&#x27;t even begin to describe what you&#x27;ll have.  Product does take longer to warm than on instructions and the paddle is useless.  Eyebrow guides aren&#x27;t worth the paper they&#x27;re on, and upon attempting to use, this went right into the trash.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> eehhh its alright. its a very small bottle and the time indicated on the instruction for heating time needs to be triples, sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t work, but when it does its great. It weird sometimes I think I just got a bad one.</li>
    <li> This is great if you want to avoid the high salon prices. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used waxing products from this brand a couple times, mostly waxing strips. I heard that actual wax, however, was supposed to work better and keep hair from growing back for a longer period of time. Yeah right. I really can&#x27;t recommend this stuff at all. I followed the directions very carefully, but wound up with a huge mess. The wax got stuck to my fingertips and wouldn&#x27;t come off for hours. And might I mention that it didn&#x27;t work at all? I think the wax took off a grand total of four hairs, if even that. Hardly did a thing. So, yeah, this stuff really isn&#x27;t worth your money at all. On the other hand, their waxing strips work very nicely.</li>
    <li> let me begin with a couple of things:  i NEVER follow the instructions regarding the heating time...it does not melt. i usually stick it in 2 and a half minutes straight...and it melts to a very thin consistency.  i also disregard the little wax wand that reads ready when the wax is supposed to be the right temperature...what i do is pick up some wax, blow on it for it to cool off a little and then apply it where ever i need to.  the first time i used this product i wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with it...but in this case practice does make perfect!...  it is a little messy but it works wonderfully on my brows, forehead and upper lip. and a bit of it does remain stuck to your skin, however it comes off with baby oil...  all in all i WOULD recommend this, be patient with it and you&#x27;ll see it working for you...  p.s. the tweezers and the after wax lotion are a waste of time. i dont bother with them, if i need to tweeze some very short hairs that the wax doesn&#x27;t remove, i use my lacross tweezer instead.</li>
    <li> I have used this wax for years. I love that you don&#x27;t need strips for it. It works so well and is awesome in general. That being said, I do have some tips for those who seem to hate the product:  1. You really need to microwave that bad boy for wayy longer than 1 minute. I always microwaved it until it is liquid  2. When you microwave it that much, make sure you blow on it when it&#x27;s on the applicator to cool it down before applying to your skin  3. Apply in small sections, and use more wax than you think you should  4. DO NOT wait until it is totally cool to pull it off. If you do, it will not come off and it&#x27;s a pain to remove... someone else said baby oil, I haven&#x27;t tried that, but I will in the future.  Anyway, I do love this wax, hate strips. Can&#x27;t find this anywhere in stores, but I don&#x27;t really want to buy it from Amazon b/c of the cost of shipping either way, a great product and I will keep looking for it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. I&#x27;ve tried some other products by Sally Hansen for eyebrows (wax strips) and didn&#x27;t like them nearly as much. They didn&#x27;t seem as effective. It may be tricky at first but it is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> This is the first facial wax I bought here in the US and it&#x27;s by far the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. It takes a good 15-20 mins on high heat to melt, does not stick properly to the skin, and does NOT remove any hair. I was completely frustrated by the end of it. I have a facial waxing kit I brought from India that I will be using for a while but not sure what I&#x27;ll do when that runs out. I won&#x27;t be buying this one for sure...total waste of money! I&#x27;d recommended not to even bother with it.</li>
    <li> It worked for my mustache hair but not my eyebrows very well.  Yet again I have thick eyebrow hair and seen from other reviews its vice versa.  its probably meant for people with delicate eyebrow hair, etc.  Im a messy person period, but this stuff is REALLY messy. I had to microwave mine longer than expected for it to get the perfect mix to stir. And removing it is worse. It sticks to your fingers and skin ridiculously unless removed with a cloth and warm water.    I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansens stips and they work better.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at walmart, thinking it&#x27;s cheaper than getting it done at the salon, and my brows had grown out a bit.  I just got done trying it, and I ended up throwing the entire thing out.  not only did it not heat up in the microwave, I gave up on that and just placed in in a bowl of hot water. the wax was sticky and messy, and using any of the wands that came with the kit was impossible after placing it on one time. the wax would just stick to the wand, making it to where I couldnt use it again to apply more.  you cant get it on too thin or too thick. too thin and it wont pull out. too thick and it leaves big chuncks.  it&#x27;s also impossible to pull the wax off without a cloth. it comes of in chunks and leaves alot behind.  my sin is now all red and blotchy from this product, and I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> Works well. The instructions say to absolutely not microwave it for more than two minutes, but I had to. Maybe my microwave wattage is lower than recommended. Not sure. But other than that, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is microwave, apply, and pull. There are no paper strips. You just pull the wax off quickly after it sets. If you wait too long, it gets brittle and won&#x27;t pull, so do it as soon as it sets (which only takes a few seconds.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was paying $10-14 per wax at the salon, so getting several uses out of this for about the same price is ideal. My only advice is to take your time and make sure you do not get it on any hair you don&#x27;t intend to pull. It&#x27;s a pain to get out.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but it ripped my skin off and does not peal off easily at all! It also hardens back really fast too. On top of that it is REALLY messy and sticky. The cream it comes with isn&#x27;t bad, but it has an unpleasant sent. The tweezers it comes with are like 3 cm long to... like why would I use this?  It did get the excess hair off my brows but it wasn&#x27;t worth it and it could have been better.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the body wax the one you have to use strips with. It does ok but you have to apply more than once to get most of the eyebrow hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of anything Sally Hansen since I lived in the US for awhile. Great quality, very effective, though I was a little discouraged by the other reviews re. new packaging and formula - product is great, no idea what they meant. My only complaint is the prohibitively expensive intl. delivery (nearly twice the product price)</li>
    <li> I bought this wax to see if it would be easier to use than the wax strips. Well I was shocked at how bad it is. They should pull it from the market. The only reason I would even consider giving this even one star, is because I do really like the soothing cream. It is soo nice because it numbs the area after so there is no burning. But the wax sucks. It was messy, didn&#x27;t melt right, way too hot in some spots, very hard to get off, and the hair that does come off is an insult. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Great deal</li>
    <li> Not good. Not even bad. Just useless. Upon my first use a month ago, this stuff took WAY longer to melt than the recommended two minutes. Plus, my microwave kept blowing a fuse while doing it. That NEVER happened with my old wax, which I&#x27;ve used successfully for years. Then it did a mediocre job of removing eyebrow hairs, but at least didn&#x27;t irritate my skin too badly. Which was good, because I had to go back over them with tweezers for 1/2 hour to remove the &amp;#34;stray&amp;#34; hairs (most of them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been a month (not near as long as my old wax lasted), so I busted the stuff back out because I&#x27;m starting to look kind of caveman-ish again, and this time I couldn&#x27;t even use the wax. It literally did not melt around the edges where I&#x27;d scraped excess wax off from the first use. I micro&#x27;d a total of 5 minutes with no success in getting anything than a pool of warm goo in the very middle. But the paddle and the edges of the jar were so coated as to make the product literally useless. So I had to toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering, I have used Surgi Wax for Private Parts with total success for years. Yeah, it&#x27;s bikini wax, and a little irritating to facial skin, but it works like gangbusters and cuts way down on waxing because the results last longer.</li>
    <li> I microwaved the wax in this eyebrow waxing kit for the recommended 90 seconds, but the wax remained as hard as plywood, so I went ahead and microwaved it for two minutes, which the instructions listed as the maximum time the wax should be microwaved. The wax was still just as hard as it had been before I ever put in the microwave, so I zapped it some more. Still did not change. It may have been just a fluke defect, but I&#x27;m going back to having my brows done at the salon, and I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this product or any similar Sally Hansen product again. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is the best wax I have found for removing facial hair (eyebrows, the annoying little chin hairs, etc).  While it usually does take a little longer to warm up than the package instructions state, once warm it works wonderfully.  An added bonus, it&#x27;s the only wax I have found that does not make me break out - so for your sensitive skin types, this is the product for you. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all. It doesn&#x27;t melt in the microwave and is a huge mess. It either spreads to thin and then just sticks to your skin when you try to pull it off or it spreads on super thick &amp; goopy. I tried it on my eyebrows and it didn&#x27;t remove 1 hair. I would recommend the waxing strips, those actually do work.</li>
    <li> I bought this little kit at Wal-Mart for about five dollars. The tweezers and stick-on guide are useless, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems using the wax. It does take a few minutes to get it melted the first time, but since then, thirty seconds or less and it&#x27;s perfect. (And my microwave is TERRIBLE!) Most of the complaints claim it&#x27;s messy and difficult. If you apply in small amounts, using the included orange stick, it&#x27;s very easy to put it where you want it. Trial and error has shown that if you apply it at a reasonable thickness and then let it cool for a minute or two, it comes off easily, bringing all but the finest of hairs with it. It works well for my mom, my aunt, and myself. We&#x27;ve all been pleasantly surprised and very satisfied. Just be careful and you&#x27;ll have great results!</li>
    <li> This is getting harder to find in stores lately, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it from Amazon. It&#x27;s the easiest no-strip wax I&#x27;ve used for my eyebrows, works every time. I have a hard time getting strips to work, so it&#x27;s perfect for me. Comes with an eyebrow shaping guide, if you need one, and a pair of tweezers, small wooden stick, and the wax spatula/spreader. Lasts me for several months, so it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than going to a salon.</li>
    <li> I have used Sally Hansen wax with strips in the past and it worked just fine.  When I went to repurchase, I saw this kit which promised \\&quot;no strips needed!\\&quot;  So I purchased it.  What a waste of money!    The wax was very messy.  Whereas with other waxes I have used, I could rinse it off, such was not the case with this.  I had to use their wax remover lotion (which came with the kit) to remove the wax from my hands and under my nails.      The wax itself did not remove as much hair as other kinds I have used.  All in all a waste of time and money.  I thew it away.</li>
    <li> I was always curious about wax for my facial hair.  My mother warned me a long time ago not to tweeze the hair on my chin and upper lip, but I didn&#x27;t listen.  As a result, the hair on my chin and face grew back faster, thicker, longer, and darker- I was screwed.  Throughout the years I&#x27;ve been tweezing and using cream hair remover once or twice a week; until I thought about using wax.  I just started waxing today, it was a bit messy but I quickly got the hang of it.  One thing&#x27;s for sure- It&#x27;d HURT LIKE HELL!!! Especially pulling the wax off of the upper lip area.  But the end result was well worth the tears!  I am smooth and hair free!  I will do a follow-up on how long it takes for my hair to grow back!  No Pain, No Gain! ;&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE!** I know, it&#x27;s been a while!  But after a few uses, my skin stayed hairless for about a week and a few days.  It gave me a little bit of a break but I think I will look for something better.  Based on my results, I give this product three stars out of five.</li>
    <li> I have always had very thin eye brows and never needed to wax them until recently. After having had them waxed for a wedding, they have started growing back thicker than before, and I need to wax, pluck, etc to make them look less messy. I hate to pluck my eye brows because I am impatient and hate the individual feeling of plucking each hair, so I picked up this waxing kit from my local grocery store&#x27;s pharmacy/health isle. I pulled it open to read the instructions and was surprised to see no waxing strips. The instructions said that the wand provided would read \\&quot;READY\\&quot; when the wax was cool enough to use and would not read anything if the wax was still too hot, but my wand had the words \\&quot;READY\\&quot; printed on it already, which I found odd. The \\&quot;wax\\&quot; was a hard, brown/yellow substance that I was not used to (I use sugar wax for my underarms). This kit apparently only requires one to apply the wax and then peel it off, which I thought would be cool, fun, and easy to use. Unfortunately, this kit was none of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and washed my brows, and put the wax per instructions in my microwave for 90 seconds. I let it sit for a few seconds and used the wand provided to stir the wax around. I had to put the product back into the microwave an extra 30 seconds until I was able to break the surface of the wax, per the product&#x27;s instructions. Of course, as mentioned above, I had no idea if the wax was really &#x27;ready&#x27; to use because my wand already had \\&quot;READY\\&quot; printed on it. The wax had a consistency of cheap caramel candy that is too warm. It was very tacky feeling. It was too thick and when I tried to apply it to my eye brows, it would not stick to my skin and would only stick to my hair if I quickly pressed the hardening wax into my hair as I tried to apply it. It was like trying to put candy on my face. The wax stuck more onto the wand than it did to my face and was extremely difficult to control. Not only that, but the wax would harden back up very quickly, even as I was trying to apply it to my brows. The wax would harden around the edges of the container as I tried to grab only the small amount needed for little areas of my brow. I made about 4 trips back and forth from my bathroom back to my kitchen to reheat the wax. After trying several times to apply the wax to my eye brow without actually waxing my entire brow off, I just ended up throwing the kit in the garbage and decided I would go on Amazon to write a review about how awful this product is and was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who is looking for a quick and easy eye brow waxing kit, this product is anything but! It was a waste of money and a waste of time. I am very disappointed because I have bought waxing products from Sally Hansen from the past and have enjoyed using them very much. Please stay away from this particular kit! Save yourself five bucks, and 20 minutes of your time. I could have plucked my own brows by then, and now must proceed to do just that... Very disappointed indeed!</li>
    <li> Takes longer than it says to warm up. It didn&#x27;t remove all my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Less mess and works well.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product for my eyebrows because I thought I can&#x27;t really lose anything. If it works once the cost is less than a salon. The problem was it didn&#x27;t work even once! I followed the directions closely. The wax doesn&#x27;t melt in the time the directions say (and my microwave is normally very powerful). It&#x27;s hard to spread...if you get it to thin it won&#x27;t pull off..too thick leaves bits of it behind. For some reason it really tucked my skin, but plucked very few hairs. I also wouldn&#x27;t trust the indicator wand to not burn you. Placing it in the hottest part of the wax it continued to show \\&quot;ready\\&quot;. The tweezers are Barbie sized and don&#x27;t work well at that. The soothing lotion is OK, but the kit includes nothing to clean off the goo with. I don&#x27;t think I would have ever gotten it off my fingers if I hadn&#x27;t had some wax remover from a different kit.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this product was deceptive, because the plastic container it came in had a false bottom.  The amount of wax contained therein was less than a quarter of an inch, whereas the actual jar it came in was 3 inches at least.  This fact made me irritated and the product has not lasted very long.  Before I bought this item, I had another container of microwavable brow remover that lasted me 20 years there was so much wax in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax does not work well either and I have put it on my lip and it will not take off all the hair, even though I have very fine blonde hair.  I have put the wax on after it has been heated for the 3rd time and will see if this will finally remove all the hair on my lip?  Well, I just finished pulling the dry wax off - and again it did not take off all of the hair.  Don&#x27;t know why, but although it is inexpensive, I am going to buy some more brow wax from another company as soon as I am finished with this review.</li>
    <li> First when I opened it there was a wax spreader,a jar of wax,soothing lotion,eyebrow shapers,and a toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it and half of the wax was melted to one side and it took me 3 1/2 minutes to melt it. When I put it on my face it was hot and got all over the place. It was hard to pull off,quite painful really and when I looked down at the wax only 1 piece of hair was pulled out! I would not recommend this product at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow shapers didn&#x27;t work and my eyebrows turned out horribly! Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> There are so many things I would rather do besides use Sally Hansen&#x27;s microwavable eyebrow, face &amp; lip wax kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* eat goat droppings&lt;br /&gt;* go play in traffic&lt;br /&gt;* the list goes on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say, I was completely underwhelmed with this horrible, messy, sticky, complicated product. Ugh, what a waste of time. What a painful experience. First of all, the instruction sheet is as long and complex as the scientific pharmacist paper that sometimes comes glued to a bottle of prescription medication. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the wooden stick was for, because I couldn&#x27;t find any mention of it except vaguely it might possibly kind of work for applying wax to eyebrows perhaps. Are the eyebrow-shaping templates reusable? Who knows! Sally Hansen doesn&#x27;t care, because they&#x27;ve already got your money with this pig-in-a-poke product. The tweezers do NOT work, don&#x27;t even bother trying to make them grasp the most obvious hair. The marketers crow that they have this \\&quot;revolutionary temperature indicator applicator,\\&quot; which is nothing but a crappy gelato spoon with heat-sensitive ink on it. Heat-sensitive ink that doesn&#x27;t work, mind you. There is nothing revolutionary about a product that refuses to work as promised. The wax is supposed to go into the microwave for ninety seconds initially, on high heat, but certainly for no longer than two minutes (120 seconds) total. They don&#x27;t explain what will happen if you go over 120 seconds; unfortunately, on high heat, my brand-new stainless steel microwave couldn&#x27;t melt this wax except in the very middle, which - when stirred with the Revolutionary Spatula Of Justice - made the entire jar into a nasty nightmare of lukewarm wax that will not spread, will not stick, and will not take hair off of your face. The only \\&quot;removing\\&quot; this product does is \\&quot;removing\\&quot; money from your wallet. Stick with a different form factor, a different company, just do ANYTHING but buy this product. I had to keep microwaving and re-microwaving the jar, running back and forth to the bathroom, slapping the minuscule quantities of adequately-cooled goop onto my face, and really, I&#x27;ve been doing this sort of thing for years, so it&#x27;s not beginner&#x27;s bad luck. This stuff left red patches all over my face, wherever I applied it. Their crappy temperature-telling spatula only tells you if the wax is too hot for you to put on your face, and NOT if it&#x27;s warm enough to be effective. Sally Hansen can&#x27;t have you burning your face, because then they&#x27;d have a lawsuit. But they don&#x27;t really care if you get any value out of the product. Also, the eyebrow templates are really just terrible, non-adhesive (they are supposed to stick), and that benzocaine-based aftercare cream smells terrible. If you want your eyebrows to look like the model on the box, then cut out the front panel of the box and staple it to your face.</li>
    <li> YEP RIPPED ALL MY HAIR OUT</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. I am on my second box of this. It is cheaper at amazon than at my local store. It also works A MILLION times better than those wax strips that you warm up in your hands. And it is way cheaper than going to the professionals. Just watch a couple youtube videos and you&#x27;ll be able to do it to yourself in no time!</li>
    <li> I suppose it depends on what type of hair your dealing with but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It only pulled out about 20% of the hair each time. However I was really surprised that it wasn&#x27;t messy at all. Anyway, didn&#x27;t meet my expectations so I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> it doesnt remove al the hair</li>
    <li> I could not find this anywhere else but here and am so glad I did! Most excellent product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years (mostly on the chin). Getting the hang of achieving the right temperature for the best results has been tricky, but it was still easier and cheaper than going to the salon every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But something has changed . . . the last time I bought it, the container had been redesigned to be shorter, but wider. I thought at first that it was a good idea and would help the wax melt more quickly. But the first time I placed the new container in the microwave, after several seconds I started hearing loud cracking and popping sounds. I stopped it to check for issues, but could find nothing. Eventually I got used to the sounds, but they continued to worry me. This happened ONLY when I tried to heat this wax in its new container. It never happened with the old container, and it never happened with anything else I heated in the microwave--ONLY with this wax in its newer, shallower container. I can only conclude that it&#x27;s something about the wax and/or its new container.  Today the microwave started making a loud humming noise when I tried to heat the wax. There were never any problems with the MW before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give up. It was not a perfect product even in the old container, sometimes working easily and sometimes not. It was good enough for me to keep using for several years, but not anymore. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M WORKING ON THEM,I&#x27;M A WORK IN PROGRESS</li>
    <li> This product was not effective.  I was very disappointed.  It is messy, the wax once applied did not take off the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather go to a salon and this task completed.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great Product and packaging! I am very pleased! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least five years, and it has been so effective for me I haven&#x27;t really tried anything else.  I did try the Sally Hansen strips once, and I found that they didn&#x27;t work for me.  Here is what I have found about this product so far.  For your information, I have fine and very blonde facial hair, but kind of a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  One tub of wax lasts me a pretty long time...I only buy about one or two a year (waxing about twice a month).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Liquid must be pretty hot and runny to stick to the hairs effectively (microwave 3 mins).  To the point in which it hurts a little bit because it is so hot, but not scalding.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Removes my fine and numerous upper-lip and stray eyebrow hairs very effectively.  On the other hand, I also wax my boyfriend&#x27;s eyebrows with this (the uni-brow part) and he has thick, long, dark hairs.  This product does not work nearly as effectively on him.  Usually I do two rounds, and then pluck the remaining strays.&lt;br /&gt;4.  I have pretty sensitive skin and eczema (red and dry patches) on my face (including near my eyebrows).  This product has never adversely affected my skin or has made my eczema worse.&lt;br /&gt;5.  If you ever spill the hot wax in the bathroom or kitchen (like I did at my old apartment), run an ice cube over the wax and it will chip off a bit more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone in the future :)</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter recently heated this in the microwave per the instructions and it melted through the bottom of the container and caused second degree burns on her hand.  This is not the first reported case of burns.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s so affordable and does just as good of a job as the salon does. You have to heat it up for much longer than the box states, but it&#x27;s awesome. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The bad reviews keep mentioning wax getting stuck on their fingers for some very strange reason. How exactly do you get this wax on your fingers??? I have used this wax for years - it&#x27;s also what my friend (a hair stylist who does my eyebrows) uses and recommends. If used properly - heated until liquid, cooled for a second on the stick included, then applied directly to eyebrows with the stick your fingers should never come in contact with melted wax. After application, let it cool and harden then peel up a small edge and pull swiftly in the opposite direction of hair growth. I have tried other waxes - non-heated types and this one works MUCH better than those. It picks up nearly every hair and it&#x27;s not messy if done correctly!</li>
    <li> I tried using this and it absolutely did not work... I think maybe it&#x27;s just me who don&#x27;t know how to use it..... I will try my best to give it 100% and I will update my review.</li>
    <li> works amazingly! you just have to make sure you&#x27;ve followed all the instructions properly.</li>
    <li> So i just bought this product, just to try it and see if it actually worked.  I got home and was excited to play with my new toy.  I tried to put it in my microwave, but sparks started flying!  I was horrified, especially since they claim that the container is microwave safe.  Just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t just my microwave acting up, i put a cup of water in it, and nothing happened.  I tried the container of wax again, and the sparks flew once again.  So i cannot tell you if this product works, because i can&#x27;t even heat it up to try it.[[ASIN:B000AA5VE0 Sally Hansen Eyebrow, Face &amp; Lip Wax, Microwaveable]]</li>
    <li> This is my fault.  I thought this was a product that I used to get at the grocery that is no longer available.  It&#x27;s quite similar, and it works, but it&#x27;s so small!  I should have paid closer attention to the size before purchasing.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all for my eyebrows... very disappointed. Also heated as instructed and it didn&#x27;t stay melted long enough to apply more than once without having to reheat.</li>
    <li> When I first started waxing this was the product that I used and it worked great and lasted for ever. It&#x27;s still the best product I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been waxing for over 10 years!  When you put the wax on you have to make sure you apply a thick coat so when it is dry it has solidified with the unwanted hair and as you pull it away it leaves a nice smooth finish. No hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this multiple times.  It did take a couple experiences to get it down pat like many beauty products (false eyelashes, eye shadow, cream leg hair removers.) I did find a micro-proof tiny sturdy bowl to put the hard wax in, nuke it for 3-4 minutes on LOW so as not to get it \\&quot;boiling\\&quot;, let it cool 10-30 seconds and used a tongue blade or popsicle stick to apply to upper lip.  Popsicle sticks/tongue blades are wider and seem to make it easier to control the hot goo.When I just started waxing, I didn&#x27;t understand the part about immediately putting a cotton strip over the wax to pull it off but it makes it soooo much easier!  Granted I still have a pro or beauty school student (saves $$$!) do below the brows just because it&#x27;s hard to see with my hands covering up one of my eyes!  I don&#x27;t understand how someone could possibly put it on with their FINGERS because out of the microwave it&#x27;s so extremely hot? Again, works very well when it&#x27;s done correctly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the local drugstore looking for an alternative to spending money on my eyebrows every week. Mine are pretty thick and grow back quickly, so I was looking to be more cost effective. This works pretty well as long as you follow the instructions! I don&#x27;t know why some other reviewers were heating this up for 15 min? Realistically, the \\&quot;90 seconds on medium power\\&quot; that is on the box doesn&#x27;t cut it, but I think it&#x27;s more so that people don&#x27;t end up with wax all over the microwave.  It took maybe 30 seconds on High for me (in a 700 watt). But, you do have to watch it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t bubble over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t messy either. Again, as long as you follow directions, you should be ok. The only messiness I experienced was a little wax on the lip of the container, and occassionally a little bit here or there stuck on my face after removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this! I have tried strips and cold wax before, but this is much faster, cleaner, and more effective. Definitely worth the $6!</li>
    <li> Its easy to use, remove all hair in one time, and smell good. I really like it and for sure I use it again and again</li>
    <li> The wax didn&#x27;t melt as the directions indicated.  Bad product.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews here first.&lt;br /&gt;I used to purchase this wax many years ago, it was a more orange color and came in a different taller, slimmer tub with a plain white spatula. I had noooo idea the product had changed. This has been reformulated and the tub is also short and wide now.&lt;br /&gt;The old formula used to work great for me. It would melt evenly, easy to apply a thin layer, easy to leave a thicker end for peeling, easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;This new formula is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;The time on the instructions has to be tripled and even then, the wax on the sides does not melt evenly. Once you dip the spatula in and start stirring, it immediately begins to cool and get tacky and sticky. FORGET about the ready indicator on the spatula. When it says ready, it&#x27;s already way to sticky to use.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it anyway and after struggling I could only get it to go on thick. It pulled off maybe 20% of the hair I applied it to, and that&#x27;s probably being generous. It also left wax residue behind. I&#x27;m so frustrated and dissatisfied with this. It&#x27;s not worth the time or money at all.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s reformulated to be safer. The wax to cool and harden faster and the new short wide tub so the wax won&#x27;t overheat. This has completely ruined the product. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Even though it is indeed only $5, it&#x27;s the biggest waste of $5 I&#x27;ve ever spent on.  I first tried to follow the instructions to a T, and the wax was still hard as a rock.  I then did the 15 second thing 5x and it finally was tat a liquid state, but it was still really tough.  I tried putting some on my lip and it didn&#x27;t do anything.  Then afterwards, I started reading the reviews on here to see what other people did before I gave up.  Like every other review said, it takes more than the 1:30 to heat the stuff up, and the microwave didn&#x27;t turn on half the time for some reason; I&#x27;ve had no problems with the microwave other than heating the wax.  After nuking it 30 seconds at a time for a total of 5 minutes, it finally gets to a thin consistency, but it was still too hot to apply, so I went to do something and came back less than 2 minutes later and the entire jar was already hardened.  I gave up and tossed the whole thing away.  I&#x27;d rather go back to the strips and use those instead of this product, or spend the $10 at the salon for them to do it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my eyebrows since the 7th grade. I&#x27;m 35 now.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> The amount of wax was significantly small, considering the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for the \\&quot;quick and easy\\&quot; hair removal kits and local drug stores.  Every time I buy one (usually for my legs) I kick myself later for getting a useless, smelly, messy product.  While I thought this might be the same, I gave it a try.  I am *amazed* to say that this worked really well.  Yes, it takes a little longer to heat up, and I probably will use a larger, flatter popsicle stick or something similar next time rather than the small, fat wand they provide.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t require cloth -- just the wax, and it takes so little to work.  Obviously, it&#x27;s going to take me a few tries to get the temperature/consistency right and to figure out the best way to get the shape I want on my eyebrows, but I will DEFINITELY use this product again!</li>
    <li> love this product!  couldn&#x27;t find it for a while and bought others that were one big mess and/or ripped off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;this works quickly and easily.  just put in microwave and use.  i have VERY fair skin and it still does a great job.  glad i found it on amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have used this microwave wax for roughly 1.5 years. It is very easy to use and saves a TON of money from getting this done at the salon. I think I paid around $4.50 or $5.00 for this at the drug store and would pay around 3 times that ($14-$18) for a professional wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read through a few of the lower rated reviews and would like to address a few of the concerns with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Heating - Yes, you have to heat it for longer than it says. Usually, I will heat mine for about 3-4 minutes each time I use it. I stir it up for about 30 seconds and I&#x27;m good to go. I take a small amount on the ready stick, let it cool for about a second and apply.&lt;br /&gt;2. Consistency - This is simple...if it&#x27;s too thin, let it cool a bit. If it&#x27;s too thick, you probably need to heat it a bit more or it&#x27;s been overheated (if this is the case, you&#x27;ll probably need to get a new one).&lt;br /&gt;3. Difficulty - NO ONE is a pro at anything right off the bat. We need to keep in mind that people attend classes to get used to this! My first time using this I was quite nervous and it took me about 30 minutes to finish both of my eyebrows but by the 3rd time I used it, I was done in 5. Take it slow, figure out your rhythm and you&#x27;re good!&lt;br /&gt;4. The smell - No the best thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled (kind of bees-waxy-honeyish), but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re wearing it. You slap it on and pull it off 5 seconds later.&lt;br /&gt;5. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair - This has always removed all of the hair I&#x27;ve used it on. I think that some of the negative reviewers might not have pulled the skin tight and removed the wax in the opposite direction of the hair growth. If you pull it out WITH the hair growth, it will not work (but NOTHING would work doing it that way:) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve never used the little wooden stick that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t use the eyebrow shaper guides.&lt;br /&gt;* Toss the tweezers, they don&#x27;t work. (You can use your old tweezers if this stuff happens to not remove a hair or two - which is VERY rare).&lt;br /&gt;* I used it to remove upper lip hair once or twice, its not a big concern of mine though, but it removed it all (and mine is SUPER fine). My mother had me remove her once and it did the job on her, as well.</li>
    <li> I bought it at my local store today after mulling the idea of another trip to the salon for $20 lip &amp; brow and the 50/50 chance of the too thin brow look. Went on easy. Came off easy! No strips needed like I thought I would anyways. I read reviews here first and found the &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; confusion issue answer- It disappears if it is too hot. Not the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it has a pleasant smell and hurt less than expected. I just about have up home waxing after a bad &amp;#34;bee&amp;#34; brand incident as a teen.</li>
    <li> Not enough wax in the container. The more you use this particular wax, the longer you have to heat it up in order for it to be usable. This is a huge issue because you can not get the ideal consistency. You are better off buying this brand in local store because this almost seems like a knock off product. Sally Hansen usually has high quality wax. Not sure what this is but it definitely isn&#x27;t working well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had never waxed before and didn&#x27;t want to pay salon prices, so I bought this to try it myself. I was really skeptical because I looked for several different brands and none of them had stellar reviews, but one day at Target, I just decided to go for it with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I microwaved for 2 minutes exactly, went upstairs to my bathroom and stirred the wax a bit, making sure it wasn&#x27;t too hot. Some of the wax hadn&#x27;t melted, but some of it was very liquidy, so stirring all together made a perfect consistency. I didn&#x27;t really read the directions or do much prep (didn&#x27;t use the analgesic or anything) but swiped it on, tapped it after maybe... 20 seconds? to see if it was ready to peel and then wham, bam, thank you mam&#x27;am. I only had to tweeze maybe 3 stray hairs? It was pretty much perfect. The wax was still a fine consistency for the second eyebrow and I even applied it twice right over eachother to make sure all the spots were hit. Same thing, voila, perfect eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a rush when I did it, so to have crazy haven&#x27;t-tweezed-in-two-months eyebrows to perfection in 3 minutes I call heaven.</li>
    <li> Ouch!  But, it does what it says it is going to do. And it was fairly easy to do :)</li>
    <li> Love it will recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not someone who enjoys having waxing done in a salon, nor can i afford it frankly, so....i looked to this product to take care of the brows. Works good, no residual residue left once wax is pulled. This is my goto wax....Period!</li>
    <li> I used a previous version of this product several years ago in high school to do my own brows, and really liked it. Then for a while I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and just alternated between plucking and salon waxing. But I found a $2.00 off coupon for it the other day, and I thought, Why not? I have to say, though, there&#x27;s definitely less product--I almost want to say half as much as I remember. The pot was taller, though about the same circumference, and there was double the amount of wax at least. So I won&#x27;t be buying it again unless I have a decent coupon for it. The quality is definitely not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s not the best wax; don&#x27;t expect salon or brow artist results. This product will give you appropriate DIY-quick-fix-at-home level results. Still I think it worked better in the past. You&#x27;re not supposed to microwave it for more than two minutes to melt the wax--this is absolute bull****. The first time I used it right out of the box, it took ten minutes to get it liquidy enough to work (in my experience, hotter wax will grab hair better as it cools--but don&#x27;t burn yourself!). Yes, my microwave power was on high. But the container stayed decently cool, which impressed me because before I had to carry it to the bathroom with an oven mitt-- now that&#x27;s not necessary, if you&#x27;re careful. And it didn&#x27;t do anything to my microwave. In fact, it&#x27;s the same microwave I used several years ago, too. I remember before it smelled bad as it heated, but they must have altered their formula to make it more heat-friendly or something between then and now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as waxing though, I had the best luck on my eyebrows. I have really fine blonde hair, and I think the hair on my upper lip and the top of my eyebrows was too fine for the wax to catch properly. I didn&#x27;t try to get rid of the wispies at the corner of my hairline in front of my ear; I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s necessary, plus I had a serious lack of confidence in the wax&#x27;s power to work there anyway. But it worked great on the under brow hair just above my eyelid and the space over my nose between my brows. (Advice--try to close the eye you&#x27;re working over as you apply the wax, not only for safely purposes, but to keep your eyelashes from getting in the wax). It took two or three passes before I got it all, and my sensitive skin got seriously angry--I recommend doing this at night before bed, so it&#x27;ll calm as you sleep. DO NOT wax before work or school or going out, etc. I didn&#x27;t use the skin soothing lotion provided in the box, I just dabbed on a generous layer of the miracle that is Aveeno. Um, what else... Oh, if you want to use the brow shape stencil things provided, go for it, but I didn&#x27;t; my brow shape is pretty well defined and waxing is a just a matter of cleaning up the peach fuzz around them. I don&#x27;t really understand how to use them anyway. and you&#x27;re also provided with a wooden applicator--it&#x27;s like that nail tool where one end is cut at an angle and it pushes your cuticles back, and the other is pointy like a toothpick. I&#x27;m not sure if it was meant for the shape stencils or just application in general, but I used it on my brows--the mini temperature-testing spatula is too big and can only do so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I can think of. Hope I helped! :)it worked great on the under brow hair just above my eyelid and the space over my nose between my brows.

    <li> I use Sally Hansen face hair removal creme but the hair on my upper lip grows so fast that I have to use it weekly. I figured I would try waxing. I&#x27;ve had professional waxing on my arm pits so felt that I knew what to expect. I bought the Sally Hansen face wax. I read the instructions all the way through. It took 3 minutes to melt the wax. The smell hit me right away. It&#x27;s awful. It&#x27;s like the little brother of melting tar. Using the ready atick I applied it to my chin first. It hardens almost immediately. I yanked it off per the instructions and it got some of the hair but any fine strands or shorter strands stayed. Once I did a couple more times I felt confident to move on to my lip. Because it hardens so fast I had to re-heat it about 5 minutes in to the whole adventure. I also ended up leaving most of the hair on my lip. The smell being right under my nose made me so sick to my stomach that I had to lay down. It really was awful. This product is going back to the store asap. I still love my Sally Hansen creme though.</li>
    <li> I use only this product for my upper lip area. Other brands are gummy and sitcky. Once this product goes on and dries, it comes off easily and leaves little residue.</li>
    <li> was hard and did not melt even after i put it in the microwave for 15-20 mins….had to throw it away</li>
    <li> This is just a totally mess and doesn&#x27;t work will never pay this product again. The guide line tapes will not even stick to your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Very hard to work with.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years now! Watch my video to find out tips on applying it ~ [...]</li>
    <li> It melted evenly and quickly enough.  It took about 5 minutes of stirring till it was a good enough consistency to apply.  Despite what&#x27;s advertised the super high tech &#x27;ready&#x27; applicator doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Even after the wax was clearly ready, it still did not display &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; on it.  That&#x27;s fine, I guess, but they shouldn&#x27;t advertise that as a feature if it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  The wax itself removed probably about 70% of the hairs between my eyebrows and the rest I had to pluck.  This package includes a small tweezer which is really quite a nuisance to work with.  Use a pair of your own beauty tweezers and it will work better.</li>
    <li> This was the worst product I ever tried. Really hard to warm up enough.. and then once it did it wouldn&#x27;t stick to any of my hairs on my eyebrows.  I tried for about 15 minutes and finally just threw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen&#x27;s face wax for close to 15 years now for my eyebrows.  I love the stuff and it works great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is so easy to use and mess free. As long as you&#x27;re careful, of course. I love the fact that there are no strips to hassle with. I would recommend it anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the time or money to go to a salon, novice or experienced.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t use sugar wax or the like because I am a Retin-A user, and sugar wax is not recommended lest you pull your skin off. But this wax only sticks to hair, not skin, so it&#x27;s not that painful and it&#x27;s very, very thorough. I occasionally have to go over with a tweezer and pluck a stray or two but rarely. I will always use this wax</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this having never waxed anything in my life! Total beginner. I read the instructions very carefully. Right off the bat, I noticed that heating it for the recommended time didn&#x27;t work. I ended up heating it for about 3 minutes total (15 second intervals). Brought it upstairs (didn&#x27;t let it sit for 1 minute like it says) and already it was hardening quick. Still, I used the orange stick in the more goopy parts of the wax, spread it over the parts of my eyebrow I wanted to wax, and a few seconds later it was ready to pull. It hurt, but no more than threading or plucking. And it got everything I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t like the heating issue though. It hardened so quickly in the container I barely got both brows done. Also, it was very stringy. I don&#x27;t think those brow guides are very useful, I played around with them but tossed them in the end. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent product, but I&#x27;ll be looking for something that stays gooey longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this from walmart I do believe and it was awful I would not recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite a number of years but all of a sudden I was not able to find it in stores in my area.  I take it on travel because it is compact.  At home I use the Melting Pot La Grande Pot and Melting Pot stripless was.  The price was a little higher than I had paid in stores but worth it to have for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I have tried several face wax products and brands, this is the only one that works for me! I&#x27;ve even tried other products from this company, they didn&#x27;t work. If you follow directions properly you will not have problems!! I have stubborn upper lip hair fyi, not peach fuzz. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair but its there, and then it isn&#x27;t. Lasts for up to a month. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and liked it.  The strips don&#x27;t work as well.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores here so ordered it.</li>
