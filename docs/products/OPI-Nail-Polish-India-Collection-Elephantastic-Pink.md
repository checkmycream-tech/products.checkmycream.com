<li> Going to gift this item to a less finicky friend instead of keeping it.</li>
<li> I applied three coats and it&#x27;s still a little streaky.  </li>
<li> I start with a base coat (currently Anchor by Zoya</li>
<li> Chipped off within hours after applying :(</li>

    <li> Barbie color ! Yes it is ! A wonderful pink with a result brillant, not shimmer but it&#x27;s like mirror. A plastic doll.  For girlies !!!</li>
    <li> Love this color. Such a beautiful spring / summer addition to my collection!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.. Great quality polish!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color. Very pretty carnation pink. However, it takes FOUR coats to achieve full opacity. Still streaky ever after 3 coats. 3 is the max I have patience for so this is somewhat unacceptable. Going to gift this item to a less finicky friend instead of keeping it.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I&#x27;m looking to buy it again after I used up the first one. It&#x27;s an awesome summer color for my toes, bright happy pink. I am quite fair-skinned so 2 coats are enough. I start with a base coat (currently Anchor by Zoya is my fav) and top it with a fast drying clear top coat and it lasts for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Received the OPI Nail Polish - Elephantastic Pink - it is a gift for my sister - she is a breast cancer survivor and collects elephants - how could I pass it up?  It is a beautiful color and she likes it a lot.    Prompt delivery and very well packaged!  Very pleased with this order.</li>

    <li> Great color; as always, OPI goes on and covers the best.</li>
    <li> The coral-pink color is lovely, but the formula is thin.  I applied three coats and it&#x27;s still a little streaky.  Not what I&#x27;m used to with OPI.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color and currently have it on my toes.  It is the perfect shade of vibrant pink and is at the top of my favorite colors to wear!</li>
    <li> Bright summery pink! This has been a summer favorite polish for several years!! OPI lasts for a week or longer without chipping.</li>
    <li> Love the bright colors OPI came out with!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a color that was a little more coral than pink,  this is the perfect color!  It looks exactly like it did in the pictures and people compliment me all the time on this color.  It looks shiny like a manicure,  so pretty!</li>
    <li> Fast ship. Great price.</li>
    <li> Perfect color , it was exactly the color that I was looking for, . It matches my sorority color in pink ,</li>
    <li> Love this color !! Two coats on your nails and it&#x27;s exactly the color it appears to be in the bottle. Very quick shipping and overall great experience!</li>
    <li> I really like this pink. I&#x27;d recommend checking out some online swatches (search the name of the polish and the word &amp;#34;swatch&amp;#34; on Google Images or Bing Images, or something images) before purchasing any nail polish, just so you could see what it actually looks like. Many bloggers specify how many layers they&#x27;ve had to apply, etc. You could also see what it looks like on different skin tones and figure out what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I did all that, purchased this baby, and am loving it. It&#x27;s very opaque and smooth, and very cute looking.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great color and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Actually I am really into pink color series and thinking of collecting more color like this.&lt;br /&gt;This one is brighter and lighter than the &amp;#34; I eat all lobster&amp;#34; color.</li>
    <li> I love this pink. Great summer color.  I will use it after Labor Day.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE OPI color!!!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what the description said!!! Arrived super fast!! And it a beautiful color, i will never purchase nail polish from a store again, buying off line was way easier, cheaper, and waiting a couple days to recive it was totaly worth it!!</li>
    <li> Depending on your monitor, the color may vary. It was not as bright as what I was expecting. It&#x27;s more of a true medium pink and doesn&#x27;t have this bright, coral-pinkish tone I was hoping for. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it had I saw it in person first.</li>
    <li> This is just a fun pretty color. This is a perfect color for Pedi&#x27;s in the summer. Love it, color goes on well, stays well. Perfect!</li>
