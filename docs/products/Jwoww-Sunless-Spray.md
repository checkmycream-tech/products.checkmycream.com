      <li>Very satisfied!!</li>
      <li>This tanning spray is the best thing ever!!</li>
      <li>Best spray tanning ever.</li>
      <li>&lt;3</li>
      <li>One of the best spray tanning that comes in a bottle!</li>
      <li>Find this to give the best color doing both!</li>
      <li>but the color looked great and it smelled awesome!</li>
      <li>and I had a great glow after I sprayed it</li>
      <li>It smells great, and gives a great color.</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>I think the spray part prayed good and the color is great</li>
      <li>You just have to make sure you exfoliate real good before using again in those spots.</li>
      <li>I will say that it does good on the face, neck and chest.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t suggest this for people with fair skin.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this tanning spray!</li>
      <li>I am just in love!</li>
      <li>Color was amazing.</li>
      <li>I liked the color</li>
      <li>Good color, no orange &amp; washes off clothing easily.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I love Jenni and her products.</li>
      <li>I have just ordered 2 more cans.  </li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this spray.</li>
      <li>I have relatively fair skin and this product is the only spray that I have been over the top pleased with!  </li>
      <li>Look great and natural.</li>
      <li>The color is very nice and natural.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect color (not orange), long lasting, and has a great scent.  </li>
      <li>and application was easy.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for something that I could put on since I needed a tan very quickly and had no time for ranting beds.</li>
      <li>Product easy to use.</li>
      <li>The color appears slightly streaky when applied (no one else notices) but evens out beautifully!</li>
      <li>REAL TAN, REAL QUICK!</li>
      <li>I was pretty pleased with this spray.</li>
      <li>I like this spray &amp; use it with Quick Drench which is my 1st choice.</li>
      <li>I would recommend wearing a latex glove or something to protect your fingers and nails, and once you&#x27;re done with your whole body, take the gloves off and lightly spray the tops of your hands.</li>
      <li>I used my tanning MIT to help with hard to reach areas it worked out great thanks!</li>
      <li>But, if you are comfortable with spraying your self, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Because I have skin cancer I have tried MANY bronzing sprays and I have found time and time again that I keep coming back to this one!</li>
      <li>therefore this is useless to me..not happy!</li>
      <li>Love this, wish it came in a larger size.</li>
      <li>It give you a real looking tan.</li>
      <li>It will stain your floor, so do it in a bathtub or shower, then rinse with water after or wipe with a magic eraser.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (one of the reasons I love JWOWW products).</li>
      <li>It looks natural.</li>
      <li>I only got a few applications out of the bottle even though it felt like there would be a lot more product in it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale and although I love the instant color it was a little too much for my pale skin right away.  </li>
      <li>Overall it looked very good (not yellow like I was afraid it would)</li>
      <li>, i wish they had ones in different tones and not just super dark, but it went on even and didnt leave me orange</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin like many other products I have tried and it doesn&#x27;t have a foul smell.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty dark</li>
      <li>I wish the color would build to the deep tan I eventually accomplished instead of just instantly dark.</li>

    <li> Overall it looked very good (not yellow like I was afraid it would) and application was easy. I would suggest using a mitt to rub it in because it tends to run and streak otherwise. I only got a few applications out of the bottle even though it felt like there would be a lot more product in it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually buy JWoww spray I bought Pauly D tanning spray and I love it! I have just ordered 2 more cans.  It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin like many other products I have tried and it doesn&#x27;t have a foul smell.  It looks natural.</li>
    <li> I like this spray &amp; use it with Quick Drench which is my 1st choice. Good color, no orange &amp; washes off clothing easily. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Love this, wish it came in a larger size. It smells great, and gives a great color. I tan in beds and spray tan. Find this to give the best color doing both!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning spray! Look great and natural. I have people asking me where I tan. It is pretty dark so I don&#x27;t suggest this for people with fair skin. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is when it starts to wear off, I had some lines and cracking. You just have to make sure you exfoliate real good before using again in those spots. I would definitely buy this product again though!</li>
    <li> One of the best spray tanning that comes in a bottle! I will continue to keep on purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Color was amazing. Product easy to use. I would recommend wearing a latex glove or something to protect your fingers and nails, and once you&#x27;re done with your whole body, take the gloves off and lightly spray the tops of your hands. The color appears slightly streaky when applied (no one else notices) but evens out beautifully! I love it!! The smell isn&#x27;t too bad either!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this spray. It give you a real looking tan. Because I have skin cancer I have tried MANY bronzing sprays and I have found time and time again that I keep coming back to this one!</li>
    <li> Best spray tanning ever. I use it on my face all the time, and there is no streeks or sploches. Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> This tanning spray is the best thing ever!! I love it! &lt;3 It doesnt stain and doesnt smell!! I am just in love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and although I love the instant color it was a little too much for my pale skin right away.  I wish the color would build to the deep tan I eventually accomplished instead of just instantly dark.</li>
    <li> I think the spray part prayed good and the color is great but it didnt last as long as id hope for...but the color looked great and it smelled awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I love Jenni and her products. I didn&#x27;t have time to go tanning, so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;It does make you TAN. REAL TAN, REAL QUICK! The only downside is that it does run if you spray too close. I had my fianc&amp;eacute; help me with it. When it did start to run, he just used a paper towel and folded it to blot. That does the trick, cause it turns it into a tan towel. It will stain your floor, so do it in a bathtub or shower, then rinse with water after or wipe with a magic eraser.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (one of the reasons I love JWOWW products).</li>
    <li> I love this spray tan only because it didn&#x27;t turn me a awful orange color. I have very pale skin and I used this spray twice and I had a great glow after I sprayed it I used my tanning MIT to help with hard to reach areas it worked out great thanks! I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I tried this after using the snooki brand just to see how different they were, and there is definitely a big one! This goes on blotchy and streaky, and runs pretty bad.  I tried to rub it in, but it seemed to have made it worse. I will say that it does good on the face, neck and chest. So I decided to use jwowws for those areas, and snookis for the rest of me.</li>
    <li> I was pretty pleased with this spray. The color is very nice and natural. Makes my legs look great!But I still prefer something I can apply with a mitt. I just can&#x27;t seem to get the hang of spraying because I always have streaks. But, if you are comfortable with spraying your self, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> The spray does not work so therefore this is useless to me..not happy!</li>
    <li> I liked the color but it was way to dark for me, i wish they had ones in different tones and not just super dark, but it went on even and didnt leave me orange so that was a plus!</li>
    <li> I have relatively fair skin and this product is the only spray that I have been over the top pleased with!  No streaks.  It is the perfect color (not orange), long lasting, and has a great scent.  I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> So I read the reviews and thought I would try it. I had been looking for something that I could put on since I needed a tan very quickly and had no time for ranting beds. And inexpensive too.</li>
