      <li>Product is nice, however I don&#x27;t think the word contouring should be used in the description.</li>
      <li>The blush is the perfect shade for it, although I keep it towards the jaw and use a lighter color closer to my cheek to really make the effect pop.</li>
      <li>If I were not so fair this product would wok better for me.</li>

      <li>Very nice powder and super convenient having both blush and bronzer ^.^</li>
      <li>The color is not too strong (my skin color is fair), but you could put more product to make it appear more visible if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
      <li>Also, the Laguna did not tonally change my foundation look, which is very important to me.</li>

      <li>Again, love e.l.f. products, but this just didn&#x27;t show up on my skin at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this set, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out either!</li>
    <li> Great product. The bronzer is perfect for contouring. I didn&#x27;t realize it had sparkles in it and I hate a shimmery effect. Thankfully, the sparkles aren&#x27;t very plentiful. This bronzer is great if you want a cheaper alternative to the chocolate soleil bronzer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it blends so easily, smoothly and naturally....it gives me a very healthy glow.....i would recommend this product to others definitely</li>
    <li> Just ok to have one more make up item in your make up bag</li>
    <li> Decent but streaks by the end of the day on oily skin.</li>
    <li> This contouring kit is not good. It sheds when you use it. Maybe it will work with oily skin I do not know. For dry skin it will never fix and mostly will increase dryness.&lt;br /&gt;The material is also cheap. Does not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Its really good. Its a bit too powdery and it leaves powder all over the case inside, but that may because my travel bag moves a lot. Other than that, both shades are great. Make sure to use the right brushes for each side.</li>
    <li> First time trying this contour and it&#x27;s my number one go to item.  Will be purchasing another one same color. It has not let me down.</li>
    <li> iI&#x27;m in love with this&lt;br /&gt;you can use it like blush or bronzer or Contour</li>
    <li> I tried to like this, but there&#x27;s just way too much chunky glitter in this product for me to like it.  Also, the product is darker than pictured, but the same is true of the picture of this product on elf&#x27;s website.  The blush is much more red than pictured and as a fair skinned woman, I will never be able to use this, unless it&#x27;s for Halloween or something similar.</li>
    <li> BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK! I have sensitive skin...from a bone marrow transplant. So it&#x27;s sensitive. I wear this on bare skin everyday. I apply it with a damp contouring brush and no primer...it last all day. The blush part is sweet. Nice illuminator there.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Still trying to learn how to wear it properly since i&#x27;m not a make up artist but i love it! Youtube helps with the tutorials. It lasts all day and for the price it&#x27;s such a good deal! &amp; the blush isn&#x27;t strong which i love so I don&#x27;t look like a clown.  I will definitely re-purchase this product once i&#x27;m out of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d order it again for the pink.  the brown is a bit much</li>
    <li> it already hit the pan im about to reorder i love this elf set! i dont really use the blush b/c of my dark completion but i love love love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> * The ELF Bronze, Blush duo colors are nice; but much too powdery for my liking  * I recommend trying the NYC or L&#x27;Oreal bronzer near the same price range</li>
    <li> It performs as promised. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and when I used this product my skin was perfectly fine. I love all ELF products! Normally, in the past when I purchased cheaper makeup; I was receiving cheaper quality. I do not feel that this makeup is cheap in any way. I loved the glitter aspect that was included when I put this one, it wasn&#x27;t too much to handle. The most amazing part about this is that I didn&#x27;t have to reapply a few hours after I put it on. It stayed on my face all day! It is hard for me to find makeup that can do that for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this contouring blush, will buy again!</li>
    <li> This product is &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34;. It really just depends on what you are looking for. Both the bronzer and the blush have glitter in it, but the blush has relatively more. The glitter in the bronzer may be due to the fact that the powder is very messy. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfectly clean but the colors come out way better on a smaller brush or on your finger. Overall I will continue to use this product, but if you have been doing makeup for a long time this may not be your top choice. On the other-hand, If you are a beginner I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do really like this product, however i use the \\&quot;bronzer\\&quot; for contouring and didnt care too much for the blush. I have extremely fair skin, so fair that i have a hard time finding foundation light enough. This bronze color because its not super pigmented actually ended up working awesome. I used it to contour my cheek bones and wow it made a world of difference. I set makeup with urban decay makeup setting spray and this bronzer lasted all day. A great value for the money especially since Hula is so much more expensive but id say very comparable in color.&lt;br /&gt;The blush is very powdery and i didnt care too much for it. It also has sparkles in it which i can do without. Ill probably continue to purchase this product strictly for the bronzer.</li>
    <li> The bronzing shade is very beautiful and pigmented, the blush however is not too pigmented, but still a beautiful peachy shade.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I read on some blog that it was a good dupe for the Nars Laguna and Orgasm duo...It&#x27;s NOT. The only similarity is the fact that you are getting a blush and bronzer together, and the similarity stops there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other people have stated, this bronzer is DARK. For the longest time, I did not use this bronzer at all, and just used the blush, since it is a nice peachy color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I got into contouring, and I realized that it has a lot to do with the blending. If I am doing a full face of makeup, I will apply this bronzer, and yes, it will be way too dark, but I go in with my Beauty Blender and it ends up looking great. I achieved a really good Kim K look with it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this on a daily basis, but when I have my hair up and I want my face to look more angular, I have learned that in order to make it work with a brush, I use a small face brush, lightly tap it into the brozer (just barely) and buff it into the hollow of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached a photo of the swatches on the back of my hand. I tried my best to make sure the saturation and lighting is as close to real life as possible, but in reality they are both a little bit darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you are on a budget, and you really want to get into contouring, go ahead and get this. Just keep in mind that it will not apply as easily or flawlessly as NARS or other expensive brands. Make sure you have the right tools for blending, and it will be fine.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really get the blush to show up. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t glittery</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product...E.L.F products are so cheap but are quality products I will continue to try</li>
    <li> I was using the NARS brand version of this which is almost $40...but after trying this $5 palette I haven&#x27;t looked back. Pretty much the same product, but with a little more shimmer. Still great for basic contouring. I don&#x27;t use the blush portion of this palette because it is so light that it doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin...and I&#x27;m very pale! However, the bronzer blends very well and is easy to apply. I&#x27;ve been applying it with a contouring sponge and blending and it looks gorgeous! I ordered on Amazon but quickly went through it...thankfully they sell it at Target for only $3 so I was able to stock up. ELF makes some great makeup products, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I belive the price is very good for blush and bronzer in one product. The pigmentation is not as strong specially in the blush but both have a very natural tone. Has glitter. not matte. The shipping was fast. In conclusion, for the price is right and de quality is acceptable but not excellent, if  that´s what you want should look for high-end products like NARS, TOO FACE...</li>
    <li> The bronzing powder did not show up very much on my skin tone even if i packed it on and i did not like the gold specs in it.Would not buy again, would go for a matte formula.The blush makes a great highlighter for darker skin tones though.But i pretty much bought this to contour with and was not pleased.</li>
    <li> great duo, and price for contour kit</li>
    <li> Similar to that of Nars. Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this palette on a whim and I&#x27;m really glad I did. I got the shade Turks Caicos and I was worried that the blush would be too light and the bronzer too red for my yellow undertones. But boy was I wrong, it shows up perfectly on my caramel skin tone. The blush is a bit powdery and has to be built up in order to see the true colour, with the bronzer, a little goes a long way and it appears matte on the skin, making it perfect for contouring. I would definitely reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive blush and bronzer duo; I definitely like it. I do have to apply it often but only when I don&#x27;t have a base powder underneath. Otherwise it stays on rather well. The color is as expected and complimentary to olive-based skin tones. Totally worthwhile purchase! Will likely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Very nice powder and super convenient having both blush and bronzer ^.^</li>
    <li> Great price, lovely color.  I am very fair skinned and have been using spray tans.  High quality product for a low price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Love the product</li>
    <li> This is such a great bargain and it looks great even for those who arent familiar with contouring like me.</li>
    <li> Product is nice, however I don&#x27;t think the word contouring should be used in the description. This is more like broker and blush. The colors are both a little too dark to contour with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the Nars duo that I&#x27;m sure this product is supposed to replicate, however, at a fifth of the cost, I&#x27;m quite happy using this daily! The bronze can take some getting used to heaviness wise - but the blush is great. Longevity could be a bit better, but I&#x27;ve found that with a primer and finishing spray it lasts as long as I&#x27;d need it to.</li>
    <li> This is ok...not exactly what I was going for...too many sparkles in it. Was looking for more of a matte, I guess.</li>
    <li> The best product for the price. Great pigmentation and lasts all day! I ordered 2 more, I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of this product.</li>
    <li> Lots of people say that E.L.F&#x27;s \\&quot;highlight and contour\\&quot; is a dupe for NARS&#x27; Laguna/Orgasm duo. Truly, they are not even close, in formula or color. I have uploaded a customer image of them side by side to show you just how they differ. Price wise, E.L.F. is $3 and NARS is $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the pan and swatched on your hand, both appear to have shimmer. This is because when you did that, you probably used your finger, which practically acts like a shovel.  They have incredibly similar packaging and I&#x27;m sure this is intentional on E.L.F&#x27;s part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*E.L.F.&#x27;s blush is so pretty and natural looking! On your hand it may appear to be sparkly but on your face it won&#x27;t be. (Use a fluffy brush, not one with compact bristles, to avoid the glitter effect). However the longevity of the ELF blush is pretty short. I don&#x27;t notice it still on my face when I leave work. NARS&#x27; Orgasm is a very long-lasting product but as you can see it is nowhere near the same color family as the ELF blush. I find Orgasm to be a glitterbomb on me for daytime use. I do find it&#x27;s less so if I use a very fluffy brush to apply it, however I can still see bits of glitter in my pores (especially as the day wears on). This for me is a nighttime or evening color, or one I wear only if I plan on being out just for a little bit. I will say though that when I have tested the Orgasm blush through a day of work, it was still there when I went home. (I do get a lot of people ssking me if I got &#x27;too much sun&#x27; when I wear it, even though I don&#x27;t put much on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The contour colors may appear to be similar but in use, they are nothing alike. The ELF product has a yellow cast to it, which tends to affect how my foundation looks throughout the course of the day. The ELF product is very powdery and transfers to a brush easily. NARS&#x27; Laguna highlighter has a less powdery formula, very firm, and you have to use a stiffer contour brush to apply it. To me this is a good thing, because I found that the ELF powder was so soft, that it was easy to over-apply it, and to apply it in places I didn&#x27;t necessarily want it to be. The NARS Laguna felt more precise. Also, the Laguna did not tonally change my foundation look, which is very important to me. I&#x27;m pasty-pale, I probably shouldn&#x27;t even be playing with bronzer, but I have been and I don&#x27;t want it to look like war paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I used the blush products on my eyelids as a base, and the contour colors on my crease, for a cohesive &#x60;natural&#x27; look. This worked well with the ELF blush and NARS Laguna contour. The ELF blush and contour didn&#x27;t look very nice, since the ELF contour color is so yellow. By midafternoon my eyes looked very grody and I had to fix it with another color. When I used the Orgasm/Laguna duo, the Orgasm&#x27;s pink color on my lids really brought out the fact that I have redness in my skin. It looked horrible. The ELF blush and Laguna bronzer though, paired nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt;n no way, shape or form are these two palettes interchangeable for each other, no matter what you read elsewhere. Just look at the color differences in the photos, and imagine just how different they are on your face!  My advice would be to TRY the E.L.F. if you can get it cheap locally, and see how you like it before you fork out $50 for a NARS palette.  I wish now that I had just bought the Laguna bronzer by itself since it would have been cheaper, and in general the Orgasm is NOT my favorite blush. (Deep Throat is nice, not as much glitter or brightness). I keep both of these palettes because I like the blush from one and the bronzer from another.F powder was so soft, that it was easy to over-apply it, and to apply it in places I didn&#x27;t necessarily want it to be.

    <li> I broke my normal blush the day of an important event. The store I went to was out of my favorite when this caught my eye. I bought this one in a rush and it turned out to be perfect! The blending takes a minute but if you know what you are doing it is amazing.</li>
    <li> At first I was worried about people noticing a huge difference or if it would look bad, but it blended really well! I like e.l.f. products a lot plus is shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> very good makeup the color stays nice and bright all day.  because it&#x27;s summer I stopped using foundation because I would sweat a lot so I started putting this bronzer on my face instead of foundation it works well and I get lots of compliments on my makeup. I will definitely be reordering this when I run out.</li>
    <li> Update the bronzing powder is okay but VERY powdery. The blush is also very powdery and doesn&#x27;t give off much color unless you really layer it on.</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that it came broken :( I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used it for contouring. Its pretty cool. It gets the job done. Affordable and simple to use. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome blush and bronzing powder. I have a sandy beige skin tone. The set complimented my skin. And I have sensitive skin and this did not cause allergies.</li>
    <li> I like the blush , I use it every day .. Gives a natural glowing look .</li>
    <li> The contour is VERY dark. I am a pale redhead and no amount of blending could make this color work with my snow white skin. Blush is a nice pink -very light.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good except I have noticed it is shimmery by produce&#x27;s photos, but any else it&#x27;s good. Good package, nice delivery.</li>
    <li> This blush is lovely and pigmented worth even more than its cost</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to contour, so I&#x27;m sure that I will like this product a little more as I figure it out. It doesn&#x27;t blend super well-- I&#x27;m going to have to invest in a stippling brush. The blush is the perfect shade for it, although I keep it towards the jaw and use a lighter color closer to my cheek to really make the effect pop.</li>
    <li> This due from elf is so good with an amazing price. I got the dark shade and I really loved it.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised! Loved the color of the blush and the bronzer was very blend-able. Definitely purchasing this product again :)</li>
    <li> Im very glad i bought this!!! great for beginners</li>
    <li> This is one of my first forays into bronzer after watching a makeup tutorial and deciding that I was missing that in my life.  I bought a few to experiment with and this is probably one of my favorites, despite the lower price point.  ELF makes excellent products and their Studio line rarely disappoints.  This is no exception.  The bronzer is purely matte brown and the blusher is a light rose colored product with a little shimmer to it.  (Nars Orgasm wannabe?  Maybe). The texture is a bit powdery.  If you have rough brushes, put them away and reach for the softer brushes when using this product.  A little goes a long way and it will saturate your brushes at the slightest agitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself reaching for this bronzer to try my hand at contouring each morning.  Some days I do a better job than others.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my co-workers just keep to themselves and never mention that one cheekbone looks higher than the other.  Maybe I should put my contacts in before trying my makeup?  Either way, the bronzer blends well usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find it blended better over regular foundation/powder than BB cream.  It seemed to really adhere to BB cream and then it goes NOWHERE. That can be a good thing or a bad thing.  I&#x27;ll just take out my contacts and decide later.  The blusher is a lighter color.  I find it is a perfectly subtle blush for when I didn&#x27;t overdue my foundation.  It&#x27;s great for the office.  It&#x27;s got more shimmer on it that I&#x27;d like, but I compensate by adding a bunch of glitter to my eyeshadows so no one notices my blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short - this was one of my better purchases and I was excited to get it in the mail.  I&#x27;m glad I wasn&#x27;t disappointed and when I run out, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> It was good I love it</li>
    <li> Love the blush color and the bronzer is good too! Bronzer might be a little dark for my skin color but I will probably use it more in the summer anyway! Great price and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing blush and bronzer! So beautiful! It definitely has a bit of shimmer to it. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the price. I got this at Target for about $3. It&#x27;s a $2 dollar difference, but I thought I should just throw that out there.</li>
    <li> Love this product and use it whenever I apply makeup.  Hardly any fall out and the 2 colors are perfect for that sun kissed look.</li>
    <li> Its a great bronzer, if you want shimmer &amp; glow to your face, it goes on beautifully &amp; you dont even need to apply a lot. Id like this in a matte color for non shimmery contouring.</li>
    <li> my favorite bronzer ever!</li>
    <li> Smooth formula. Love the color of the blush, but the contour color is not deep enough for my medium toned skin.</li>
    <li> I really like the 2 colors and combination!  Cannot afford more expensive brands.  Will look at this brand for future purchases.</li>
    <li> This product is my current go to in the morning. The blush is such a pretty color and I get so many compliments whenever I wear it! I have fair skin so the bronzer must be worn in very small amounts for me right now but once I get a little color this summer it will be perfect. Both products can be built up to create a bolder look or sheered out for more subtle color. I love this compact so much. The packaging is sleek and solid. The mirror is a decent size. The blush is very shimmery and the bronzer has a more subtle shimmer. I don&#x27;t usually need a cheek highlight when I wear this. Definitely not a matte product but that works for me.</li>
    <li> Such a great blush duo! Dupe for Nars Orgasm and Laguna bronzer. Highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for value !</li>
    <li> I mostly wanted this for the bronzer but I was also curious about the blush. I have around a MAC NC 40 skin tone and the bronzer was noticeable on me but I don&#x27;t think it would be noticeable as a contour for anyone darker than a NC 45 or something. It&#x27;s more of a subtle contour for me and I don&#x27;t mind. There is shimmer in the product BUT it&#x27;s really not all that noticeable when you put it on. The blush is this peachy/coral with gold shimmers but this blush is crap in terms of pigment. I caaan&#x27;t see color being added onto my skin but I still use it because why not? I paid for the entire thing and it doesn&#x27;t make me look bad or anything so I just use the blush. I will buy this again once I run out because you can&#x27;t beat the price. It&#x27;s expensive on Amazon... $6 but I got it anyway because I could get it in 2 days due to Prime. It&#x27;s $3 everywhere else: Target, Walmart, etc.</li>
    <li> Okay so let me start off by saying I love elf products they are the best! I received this pretty quickly and used it right away. The contouring powder is amazing! I don&#x27;t know if it just works well with my skin color (light, tan) or what but this is the first powder that gives me a natural contour. The blush on the other hand is not my favorite because it has a little of a shimmer to it but I still use it sometimes. Im sure its just me and other people may love the blush but i prefer a matte finish. Bottom line the is a very handy product to have I would def recommend.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this duo, I reach for it every single time I wear makeup. I love the bronzer for contouring - while in the pan it looks like it has some sparkle, that doesn&#x27;t really transfer to the face, so what you see on your cheeks is a matte bronzer which is easy to blend and simply perfect for getting that chiseled look (I am fair skinned, so I cannot use this shade as an overall bronzer - I don&#x27;t like that look anyways, so I have no issues with the darkness of the bronzer). It&#x27;s great that it doesn&#x27;t look orange at all on. The blush is very nice as well and it&#x27;s pigmented. What a steal for the money! ELF put out two new shades of this product last fall.</li>
    <li> Good color payoff, but it is extremely easy to use too much and end up looking like a clown. proceed with caution!</li>
    <li> Choosing CRUELTY FREE cosmetics and cleaning products is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;It feels &amp;#34;lightly packed&amp;#34; and won&#x27;t last long but...I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> While definitely not a dupe for Nars&#x27; Laguna/Orgasm duo, this duo is really great! The blush is very blendable and easy to build on for intensity. I&#x27;ve never been much of a blush person before, but after using this duo I find myself unable to leave the house without it! The bronzer is intensely pigmented and just a little goes a long way. The colors are very flattering on my fair but olive-toned skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great colors, blends very well, and shows your cheek bones off!</li>
    <li> This is muy sencond purchase of this blush!</li>
    <li> U can&#x27;t not really contour with the brown it looks dark but is very light...</li>
    <li> Overall, this product is not terrible. I really love the two shades of both the bronzer and the blush. However, the bronzer is difficult to work with for me. I also don&#x27;t use cheap brushes- they are all sigma. It also has some chunks of glitter that I wasn&#x27;t aware of when I applied it. My face was sparkling way to much because my foundation has a bit of glitter to it. The blush is Exactly what I was looking for. The bronzer not so much, but it could be worked with when my others are running low. Keep in mind I am very pale, and the product had to be blended in a lot.</li>
    <li> I first found these colors as part of a set (the E.L.F. beauty box from a few years ago) and went on the hunt to find them again once it ran out. Its perfect for a versatile spring/summer look because on my complexion the bronzer is better used as a highlighter. So I can use this compact as a highlighter, blush, and eyeshadow and call it a day. The biggest problems I have with this is that the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented and have too much glitter. So on first application there&#x27;s barely visible color and glitter. If you try again, you&#x27;ll have slightly better color payoff but much more glitter. If you&#x27;re not careful by the time you get the color payoff you want you might also look like a glittery mess. Its a great versatile product to have but if you don&#x27;t like glitter this isn&#x27;t for you. If you can get past that, play with it until you find the application that&#x27;s best for you</li>
    <li> If I were not so fair this product would wok better for me. This shade in particular is just really dark. But if you have dark skin this is probably a good combo for you</li>
    <li> I just started really getting into doing make up, and I needed something to contour with, it wasnt expensive and I thibk its great for all skin tones</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, because it goes on smoothly on my skin and it&#x27;s very blendable , I reccomend jt !</li>
    <li> Thank You works perfect!! will be back</li>
    <li> I love love love my NARS bronzer/blush duo in Orgasm. I basically use it every day and I love the slight shimmer and the the way the colors are easily blendable and stay put.  So, imagine my excitement when hundreds in the Pinterest world were claiming to have found a $3 dupe for my favorite duo. Three dollars!? I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Umm.. Just no. The color differences (as another reviewer pointed out) are totally noticeable before you ever even put them on your face! Once applied, it is still extremely noticeable that the colors are very different. Also, this stuff is super glittery. I mean like 5 year old dress up makeup glittery. My NARS has a shimmer to it... Shimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a disco party on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t like this product. It doesn&#x27;t blend well and just sort of &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on top of my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this if you came straight from Pinterest for your $3 NARS dupe.</li>
    <li> Neither great nor awful. For the price, I have no complaints, but sleek is definitely better and more pigmented for people on a budget.</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are beautiful! They complement one another really well- and go on nicely. It&#x27;s no chore to blend these products in and they have a very pretty, subtle shimmer that is perfect for spring/summer. I definitely recommend ELF products. They&#x27;re a great value!</li>
    <li> Did exactly the job for the price. Good product pigmented very nicely. I would recommend to anyone looking for a quick contour to carry around</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Target and I do a lot of conturing and this is by far my favorite for just an everyday bronzed look, It stays on very well and throughout my work day! I would recommend this to Anyone!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a bronzer without any red/orange undertone and this one it&#x27;s just like that. The blush is 0 pigmented. Nothing special. Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set! The colors stay all day too and compliment each other very well. I would definitely but again!</li>
    <li> The color is accurate with the photo and overall I like the product. The color is not too strong (my skin color is fair), but you could put more product to make it appear more visible if that&#x27;s what you want. However I gave it 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stay on too long even though I don&#x27;t touch my face and my skin is not oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!!!!!!!!!! Its amazing</li>
    <li> This product rocks.  It is comparable to the NARS duo and is a fraction of the cost.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and according to the specifications and with great value and a great specification Thank you for this offer</li>
    <li> Really like the bronzing part! rich colour goes a long way. The blush part doesnt show up very well on my skin so i stick to the bronzer. worth the price. one of the better Elf products.</li>
    <li> Again, love e.l.f. products, but this just didn&#x27;t show up on my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Great contouring kit  Very inexpensive for such high quality makeup</li>
    <li> Nice if you need to contour your cheeks, it&#x27;s really simple.</li>
    <li> Am giving it a 3 star cos the casing is Strach up. Other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good.. I just wish it were Matte not all glittery. But I&#x27;m African American and I just got a tan so I&#x27;ll have to wait til fall/winter to wear it.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not garish and looks great.  Feels good on the skin and not caked.</li>
    <li> I like the product for the price. My only reason for giving it 4 stars is because the blush fell completely out of its holder when I opened it. However I was able to salvage most of it.</li>
    <li> I love this duo .. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now .. Cheap price but a very good quality ..</li>
