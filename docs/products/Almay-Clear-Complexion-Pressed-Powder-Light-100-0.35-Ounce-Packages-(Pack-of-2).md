    <li> Like it ! It was what i expected</li>
    <li> Good-quality powder that never cakes or gets streaky.  It has staying power as well.  It&#x27;s a must-have beauty staple.</li>
    <li> The best Pressed Powder ever! My favorite!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Almay Clear Complexion for more than 5 years and I love it! Like most make up products, you need to find what is right for your skin type.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  You cant beat the price.  Of course shipping and handling makes it what it used to cost at the store.  But the stores dont cary it anymore.  I would buy again!!!!!</li>
    <li> It helps with acne and redness that comes with it. But, it wears off after a while. I would give it 5 stars if it would stay on for a full day</li>
    <li> My skin gets oily throughout the day Except when I put on this makeup.  I use it Over Revlon ColorStay Foundation and is a flawless combination (for myself).  The powder contains salicylic acid, which for me, was a concern.  I spoke to my dermatologist and aesthetician who put my mind completely at ease by informing me that the salicylic acid simply absorbs oil, nothing more.  As I said though, I use this over ColorStay Foundation.  As a powder alone, in all honesty, disappointed me as it provides no coverage and looks terrible When Used Alone if you suffer from oily skin.  In my own experience, it works well over any foundation both visually and to reduce oil.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, saved lots of money</li>
    <li> LO RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE</li>
    <li> I love it because It was I think.. It´s my tone. Perfect!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Almay and Clinique products for my acne because they are not supposed to make my acne worse.  I try to buy some Almay products because buying Clinique products can be quite expensive.  I really don&#x27;t care for this pressed powder.  The light color is too light and the light/medium shade is too dark.  It also has an orangey tent to it.  I have also found that the powder puff thing is made cheaply.  It seems like it is no time before it is falling apart.  I have bought three of these pressed powder compacts and all of the powder puffs are coming apart.  I think I&#x27;ll try Neutrogena or something, but I may have to switch back to clinique.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this powder.</li>
    <li> nice, cheaper than in normal stores, and keep some oil and glow away from your face al day long! love it!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to hide major blemishes, this is not the product for you. That being said, I LOVE this product. I have very oily skin, and this controls my oil and there are NO BREAKOUTS!!! It evened out my skin tone, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cake-y or even makeup-y. If anything, it feels like an acne treatment with a powder on top. Love this product, but it doesn&#x27;t provide very heavy coverage.</li>
    <li> I love it Almay makeup.</li>
    <li> Almay Clear Complexion Pressed Powder, Light 100, 0.35-Ounce Packages excelent quality recommended, at the right time was sent!very good, beautiful! I really liked the product.</li>
