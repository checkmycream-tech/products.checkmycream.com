<li> It smells like a raspberry plant but not strong like essential oils, rather faint.</li>
<li> just got mine in the mail, not sure bout the smell,&lt;br</li>
<li> There is no greasy or heavy residue!</li>
<li> Not Good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is not certified organic and should be removed for violating advertising laws.</li>
    <li> Used it for sunscreen- so far so good:) I would rather it say &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; as that does not mean anything in this world nowadays.</li>
    <li> Good oil for sun exposure, no irritation to combo skin.</li>
    <li> Great product for my homemade lip balm. Size is also good for the price.</li>
    <li> I had read many reviews of raspberry seed oil before I purchased this one. The overwhelming issue was that the oil had gone rancid. My bottle arrived sealed, with a use by date of Jan 2016. Upon opening the bottle, I noticed a slight smell to the, but nothing rancid. I added this to my sunscreen recipe, and it came out fine. I would recommend keeping the vial in a cool dark place as the label suggests. It is a very fragile oil, so you&#x27;ll want to take care of it. I will update my review as needed, but as of right now, I like and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> just got mine in the mail, not sure bout the smell,&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m excited to use on my eczema spots</li>
    <li> used only once in lip balm.  seems good</li>
    <li> Love this oil a lot! Please understand that this is not an essential oil. It is a carrier oil and has no significant scent. If I had to describe it it smells like vitamin E. I use this on my face and have shown major improvements in my skin in both acne and age lines.</li>
    <li> Just arrived yesterday, have used only two mornings straight on skin. The consistency, fragrance and application have been very silky and smooth. Will follow up with a more comprehensive review as I experience the product over time.</li>
    <li> The raspberry seed oil is rancid and unusable.  I would return it but it is too much trouble.</li>
    <li> Very nice...supposed to be an outstanding oil for facial oil wash mixture.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Has no odor, so it blends well with everything</li>
    <li> Using this to prevent more skin cancer. I mix 2 drops in with my moisturizer before I go outside.</li>
    <li> Great product! Came with a pump to dispense the oil rather than dropper top, which is great. Find it much more convenient to use. And no it doesn&#x27;t smell like raspberries people which is fine. Just smells like...plant/nut oil I guess. I use it for my homemade sunscreen recipes and its a great moisturizer for any type of facial cream. Also bought some carrot seed oil from this seller that same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order from again in the future! :)</li>
    <li> Trying this as a natural sunscreen additive in homemade lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I love it. it smells great and it isn&#x27;t too oily. It&#x27;s the right amont of oily. I like putting this on my face at night and a little drop goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, on sunburns!</li>
    <li> This is the holy grail of oils! I have dry/combination skin that currently has eczema patches due to a fragrance allergy. This oil leaves my face vibrant, soft, glowing, and hydrated. I have tried many types of (organic) oils (argan, coconut, almond, ect.) I have to say this is #1. It&#x27;s a very light oil so it will not clog my pours and it helped heal my eczema. My skin literally looks 10 years younger. Also, a little goes a long way! I apply 1 drop on my fingers and pat it on lightly damp skin and the moisture locks in the whole day. There is no greasy or heavy residue! I highly recommend this oil for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this oil.  Initially I thought it was mixed in with a carrier oil, but it seems it can be used as a carrier oil.  The labeling could be a bit clearer I guess. It has a pleasant smell.  I mix it with cucumber seed oil.  The two together smell divine.</li>
    <li> Excellent item, speedy shipping</li>
    <li> Aw - snap. This stuff is awesome-o. It smells like a raspberry plant but not strong like essential oils, rather faint. It&#x27;s dark in color. It absorbs immediately into my skin. I doubt its value as an spf. I got sssooooo many freckles today :-( Not Good. But know this &amp; use it as a skin moisturizer only (I&#x27;ll experiment with carrot oil for spf next - and yes of course along with actual mineral sunscreen but I love the oil booster). I had thyroid surgery 4 months ago &amp; doc said to use E oil. This has natural E oil. It&#x27;s SO MUCH better than those oils advertised as E oil, even the highest quality plant based rather than chemical based Es. Here&#x27;s how I know. And why I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars. I do yoga a lot. #everydamnday. I teach it even. Going back into Camel hurts my poor neck scar so much, pulling &amp; dry &amp; taut. Bothers my practice, bothers me emotionally. Since using this oil a few times a day, my skin &amp; neck scar are soft &amp; malleable. Dipping back into camel feels like I&#x27;m back :-D I rub it into the healing scar &amp; it feels amazing. I have a fragrance allergy that spans essential oils designed for fragrance purposes (damn that), but I use this no problem. No problem at all. I&#x27;ve had this for a week &amp; already I am getting low. It is wonderful &amp; healing.</li>
    <li> Great product, like that it is organic, this is a hard to find product, use it for sunscreen and my skins loves it.</li>
    <li> I had never ordered raspberry seed oil before, so I was a little surprised by the smell, but it probably smells more like a raspberry PLANT would rather than the fake raspberry scent. I plan on using it for homemade sunscreen and was glad to see the bottle came with the dropper!
