    <li> This fragrance is the epitome of what it means to be a woman.  I won&#x27;t bore you with top, middle, and base notes, but the scent is incredible from start to finish.  It&#x27;s not super sweet, or super musky.  There&#x27;s really nothing I can compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, however:  If you don&#x27;t like to wear a fragrance that gets attention and makes you stand out, don&#x27;t purchase this.  You will turn more than a few heads walking by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: easy on the trigger - it only takes 2 sprays (sometimes only 1) to get the full benefit of this stuff all night.</li>
    <li> perfume smells good and stays in the body for long ... I love it. Although it must be used sparingly because the smell is very strong and can be cloying ...</li>
