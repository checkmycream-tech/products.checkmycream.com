      <li>This is an excellent seller and i highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kerastase, however, looks far more impressive in my shower.</li>
      <li>Kerastase is top of the line</li>
      <li>She has used the product many, many times.</li>
      <li>Love these shampoos.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great when you have to use that much heat to your hair to give it some protection.</li>
      <li>That means more hair on my head, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product at reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Deleviry and packaging was OK.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am myself, an esthetician with over a decade of experience, and am able to read beyond chemical names and identify their derivatives-</li>
      <li>I love Kerastase line.</li>
      <li>She is very familiar with what it&#x27;s supposed to look like, smell like, and feel like.</li>
      <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used and doesn&#x27;t overload the hair or weigh it down</li>
      <li>Makes my hair super shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I believe this seller is trust worthy, and I will continue to get these products from them!</li>
      <li>She confirmed that this and the conditioner I bought ( Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti-Usure Conditioner, 6.8 oz Sold by:</li>
      <li>Beauty Aid Essentials) were the genuine product.</li>
      <li>(the #2 is smooth,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on par with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Advanced Haircare Power Moisture shampoo ($3.99).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the job done.</li>
      <li>It smells good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been been a fan of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s hair care for a while, and after using Wen for a while (love it), I figured it was time to really up the quality and go for L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s most luxurious and results oriented line:</li>
      <li>Kerastase, however, looks far more impressive in my shower.ult from the EverPure line from L&#x27;oreal (also less than ^$</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Smells great, leaves my hair looking healthy and shiny and you need a small dime size per use.</li>
      <li>Are these ingredients unique, and worth paying 30$+ for in a shampoo?</li>
      <li>This is most likely from some of the more slippery ingredients like hexylene glycol and glycol distearate.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>entrega super pontual.</li>
      <li>Kerastase is extremely expensive, and while it&#x27;s a good product, there are many shampoos that are equally as effective at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much! :)</li>
      <li>Worth the price and better than the regular Bain de Force, it&#x27;s more nourishing and leaves my fine, chemically treated hair, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>This seller offers it at a much more reasonable rate.</li>
      <li>I started out using their fibre architecte after blow drying my hair and before using the flat iron and these two products together really helps make it healthy!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products from drugstore to professional brands but have not seen much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent, I like L&#x27;oreal, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
      <li>I did not care for this shampoo very much.  </li>
      <li>Since I am not blessed with a massive amount of hair, I was able to get away with using about a quarter-sized amount of both the shampoo and conditioner, concentrating the shampoo on my roots and the conditioner on the ends.</li>
      <li>But this product has saved my hair, making it&#x27;s value way higher then what I paid.</li>
      <li>this shampoo leaves your hair soft, tangle free and shiny.</li>
      <li>I find this product to be superior for my heavily color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my old, tired, over-processed, over-EVERYTHING&#x27;d hair (I&#x27;m 63.)</li>
      <li>The difference was IMMEDIATE and very noticeable.</li>
      <li>Spring for the real deal.</li>
      <li>I also saw a couple of reviews saying that this isn&#x27;t the real product.</li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my hair feel soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>I am still trying to decode the different &amp;#34;erosion levels&amp;#34; on the front of these bottles and even the Kerastase website does not seem to list all of the products that are available, so it&#x27;s not all that straighforward.</li>
      <li>Works really well for me.</li>
      <li>Been using the product for couple of years and really like it.</li>
      <li>(Very synthetic smelling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really helps strengthen my hair.</li>
      <li>I get a much better result from the EverPure line from L&#x27;oreal (also less than ^$</li>
      <li>It is very easy on the hair, while at the same time reconstructs damaged dry hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After my new hairstylist recommended this shampoo/conditioner, I hesitantly ($$$!!!) decided to give it a shot out of sheer desperation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was truly surprised to read the packaging to discover the is not one ingredient that isn&#x27;t a sulfate, synthetic, or paraben.</li>
      <li>I found this shampoo to be fairly gentle, somewhat detangling, and strip my hair of some color (which I like actually).</li>
      <li>Feels (and looks) soft and swings when I toss my head.</li>
      <li>there truly is not one ingredient in here that is naturally derived or should have any benefit to hair:&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gently cleanses, despite it&#x27;s ingredients sounding like the back of a bottle of dishwashing liquid.</li>
      <li>I recently lost a very close friend and the stress and shock of it has caused my hair to break and fall out.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money as I did.</li>
      <li>I now only use Kerastase products this is my normal shampoo for two to three days a week that I wash my hair.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel stripped bare and literally &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>wow.. Definitely recommend all.</li>
      <li>I was absolutely shocked at how strong and smooth my hair felt all day.</li>
      <li>It is pungently fruity, very strong smelling and difficult for me to tolerate.</li>
      <li>The whole hair structure improved when the shampoo was half way gone.</li>
      <li>I have fine and thin hair to begin with.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice shampoo really loved a lot. It makes my hair feel wow.. Definitely recommend all.</li>
    <li> great hair shampoo without oily scalp residue.  great for fine hair</li>
    <li> After trying &amp;#34;generics&amp;#34;, I finally learned that you get what you pay for.  This is an excellent product. You only need a small amount and twice a week.  Won&#x27;t dry out your scalp.</li>
    <li> Great product at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love Kerastase line. this shampoo leaves your hair soft, tangle free and shiny. i would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am just loving this shampoo for now. I could see hair loss but i thunk it is because of the bleach and not coz of shampoo. This shampoo makes my hair feel soft and fresh.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my old, tired, over-processed, over-EVERYTHING&#x27;d hair (I&#x27;m 63.) My niece does my hair now, uses Kerastase products on me, and my hair no longer looks dried and fried. Feels (and looks) soft and swings when I toss my head.</li>
    <li> Please note that this review is for this shampoo used in conjunction with the Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti Usure (conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my new hairstylist recommended this shampoo/conditioner, I hesitantly ($$$!!!) decided to give it a shot out of sheer desperation. My hair is fine/medium thin, shoulder length natural blonde (with partial highlights) and is DAMAGED as all get out for reasons I don&#x27;t fully understand. We&#x27;re talking severe breakage, instantaneous split ends, and the tangly texture of a dried up tumbleweed. I have tried so many products from drugstore to professional brands but have not seen much improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bottle(s) arrived, I was slightly horrified when I realized how small they actually are. Since I am not blessed with a massive amount of hair, I was able to get away with using about a quarter-sized amount of both the shampoo and conditioner, concentrating the shampoo on my roots and the conditioner on the ends. The difference was IMMEDIATE and very noticeable. I was absolutely shocked at how strong and smooth my hair felt all day. This feeling continued into day 2, and it appears that every other day shampooing/conditioning is going to work for me. Everyone&#x27;s hair challenges and solutions are so different, but if your situation sounds anything like mine, I&#x27;d recommend taking the plunge and giving this system a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one criticism is that I find the line a little bit tricky to figure out. I am still trying to decode the different &amp;#34;erosion levels&amp;#34; on the front of these bottles and even the Kerastase website does not seem to list all of the products that are available, so it&#x27;s not all that straighforward.</li>
    <li> My hair was totally burned by a bad hair dye, which I kept only for 20 minutes. However, this shampoo turned out to be very good, leaving my hair silky and smooth. The whole hair structure improved when the shampoo was half way gone.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this shampoo very much.  It is no different from all the others on the market.</li>
    <li> Excellent Reconstructing Shampoo, the best ever. I can feel the different in my hair. Great product, a great price. I love it.</li>
    <li> Loved it! The package was sealed and the product is great!&lt;br /&gt;Legit staff works wonders for my hair I do recommend it!</li>
    <li> Kerastase is extremely expensive, and while it&#x27;s a good product, there are many shampoos that are equally as effective at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It smells good and leaves my hair soft. I  recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a great quality shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great hair product, their whole line is great.</li>
    <li> Changed the texture of my hair while it strengthened and help grow. No longer feels weak or limp on my fine, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the (oranges capped) &amp;#34;Bain Satin Shampoo 2 for Dry and Sensitized Hair&amp;#34; for 15+ years. Decided this product must be similar/more moisturizing &amp; strengthening. And at a 30% discount from my local price, thought I&#x27;d try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mistaken. I feel disappointed and wish I could return it but have used it for a week to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st thing: the fragrance of this product is completely different from its counterpart. It is pungently fruity, very strong smelling and difficult for me to tolerate. (Very synthetic smelling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd negative: I find it does NOT have anywhere close to the same gentleness or feeling of the lather (the #2 is smooth, almost creamy feeling when I shampoo with it). In my opinion, this #3-4 product is just like washing with liquid hand soap (something random, overly scented &amp; not special or gentle). It makes my hair feel stripped bare and literally &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will go back to spending $35 at my salon for the &amp;#34;good stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Quality product and your hair will look great</li>
    <li> This is an excellent seller and i highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;The price was great and the product is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I am totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money as I did. The product is either fake, old or diluted. The smell is not right and it dried out my hair. I have used this.product before from the salon and it is not the same formula. Spring for the real deal.</li>
    <li> Hair dry after use. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Repairs the hair from the inside out. Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used and doesn&#x27;t overload the hair or weigh it down</li>
    <li> Product not as hydrating as I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been been a fan of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s hair care for a while, and after using Wen for a while (love it), I figured it was time to really up the quality and go for L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s most luxurious and results oriented line: Kerastase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was truly surprised to read the packaging to discover the is not one ingredient that isn&#x27;t a sulfate, synthetic, or paraben. Not one. I am myself, an esthetician with over a decade of experience, and am able to read beyond chemical names and identify their derivatives- there truly is not one ingredient in here that is naturally derived or should have any benefit to hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Disodium Cocoamidopropionate, Laureth 5 Carboxylic Acid, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide MIPA, Sodium Laureth 8 Sulfate, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Methylparaben, Magnesium Laureth 8 Sulfate, Polyquaternium 30, Magnesium Laureth Sulfate, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Oleth Sulfate, DMDM Hydantoin, Carbomer, Polyquaternium 7, Magnesium Oleth Sulfate, Quaternium 87, Methylparaben, 2 Oleamido 1,3, Octadecanediol, Limonene, Citronellol, Blue 1 Lake (CI 42090) (CI 42090), Yellow 10 Aluminum Lake (CI 47005) (CI 47005), Fragrance (Parfum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the proof is in the pudding. I have been using this shampoo twice a week for a month. It gently cleanses, despite it&#x27;s ingredients sounding like the back of a bottle of dishwashing liquid. This is most likely from some of the more slippery ingredients like hexylene glycol and glycol distearate. Are these ingredients unique, and worth paying 30$+ for in a shampoo? Nah, you can find them in Tresseme, Garnier, L&#x27;oreal, Suave..you name it. I found this shampoo to be fairly gentle, somewhat detangling, and strip my hair of some color (which I like actually). It&#x27;s on par with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Advanced Haircare Power Moisture shampoo ($3.99). It&#x27;s decent, I like L&#x27;oreal, but it&#x27;s nothing special. I get a much better result from the EverPure line from L&#x27;oreal (also less than ^$ at a drug store.) Kerastase, however, looks far more impressive in my shower.ult from the EverPure line from L&#x27;oreal (also less than ^$ at a drug store.) Kerastase, however, looks far more impressive in my shower.</li>
    <li> This product seemed altered the shampoo was altered defiantly fraud</li>
    <li> Deleviry and packaging was OK. But.. I had kerastase products before. I even have a leftovers of my previous shampoo and this one even not close to what I had ...</li>
    <li> I now only use Kerastase products this is my normal shampoo for two to three days a week that I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I am beyond happy with this product! I recently lost a very close friend and the stress and shock of it has caused my hair to break and fall out. I have fine and thin hair to begin with. So I was desperate to find something that would help. I have been using this for about a week now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! My hair is like silk. And I have noticed a lot less hair in the drain and brush. That means more hair on my head, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very creamy, and a little goes a long way. Which is great considering the price. But this product has saved my hair, making it&#x27;s value way higher then what I paid. I will definitely be using this product from now on. Not to mention, this is one of the best prices I have found for this shampoo. I also saw a couple of reviews saying that this isn&#x27;t the real product. As soon as I got it (and the conditioner) I took it to my stylist. She has used the product many, many times. She is very familiar with what it&#x27;s supposed to look like, smell like, and feel like. She confirmed that this and the conditioner I bought ( Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti-Usure Conditioner, 6.8 oz Sold by: Beauty Aid Essentials) were the genuine product. I believe this seller is trust worthy, and I will continue to get these products from them! Thanks so much! :)</li>
    <li> does not arrived in the time with prime eligible prime&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed with prime serves and the UPS&lt;br /&gt;i wish i could get it</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so amazing. Smells great, leaves my hair looking healthy and shiny and you need a small dime size per use. This bottle can last you a long time if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 5 years and it great.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> Worth the price and better than the regular Bain de Force, it&#x27;s more nourishing and leaves my fine, chemically treated hair, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love it. Really helps strengthen my hair. It&#x27;s lightly scented and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Didnt meet requirements. Would not recommend this product it did not meet with my expectation for it use.on me? Not happy</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner, let me know when you have them in.  I always need this product.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the salon and received it within a couple of days.  Been using the product for couple of years and really like it.</li>
    <li> Works really well for me. Makes my hair shine and I use a blow dryer and flat iron so it&#x27;s great when you have to use that much heat to your hair to give it some protection. I started out using their fibre architecte after blow drying my hair and before using the flat iron and these two products together really helps make it healthy!</li>
    <li> Just started using it and my hair is completely different!</li>
    <li> This is the best reconstructive conditioning shampoo I have ever used.  It is very easy on the hair, while at the same time reconstructs damaged dry hair.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be superior for my heavily color-treated hair.  It is the only shampoo I have found that will salve my split ends.  Unfortunately, it is extremely expensive if you buy it from a salon.  This seller offers it at a much more reasonable rate.</li>
    <li> &amp;Oacute;timo, deixou meus cabelos macios, brilhantes e saud&amp;aacute;veis, bom para a reconstrução das fibras, farei uso sempre! entrega super pontual.</li>
    <li> Love these shampoos. Have been using for years. Makes my hair super shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is my normal shampoo, so it works for my hair - although expensive. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever.  Expensive but worth the money.  Arrived quickly.  Definitely will use this forever. Kerastase is top of the line</li>
