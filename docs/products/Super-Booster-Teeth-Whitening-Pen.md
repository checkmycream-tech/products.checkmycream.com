      <li>I drink a lot of coffee &amp; soda and my teeth have never looked better.</li>
      <li>So much better than going to the dentist.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only on their actual website do I see so many wonderful comments about the product whereas otherwebsites that do reviews have an audience with mixed-reviews</li>
      <li>u get more control i feel</li>
      <li>so Im excited to try it!</li>
      <li>So easy to use</li>
      <li>it was easy to use</li>
      <li>Super Fantastic Products!</li>
      <li>I love the Super Booster whitening pen.</li>
      <li>The application is very easy and fast!</li>
      <li>It has meant so much to me to be able to smile in pictures.</li>
      <li>whitens teeth very well pretty quickly at a good price</li>
      <li>It was super easy to use.</li>
      <li>I loved the application of this product and actually had fun doing it!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get the bright white effect I thought I would with this pen.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work after trying so many tooth whitening strips and stuff.</li>
      <li>oh wait, they only approve good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Super Booster Teeth Whitening Pen works as advertised</li>
      <li>super quick but not wut</li>
      <li>The smell and taste were pretty light, and not an issue for me.</li>
      <li>It fits in your purse, works well and dries quickly, while whitening!&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the pen is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Yes, these really work!!  </li>
      <li>My only sigh was when I receive this and took the cap off the pen it had busted and the cap was filled with product at the top so that sucked</li>
      <li>I received the product pretty quick.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Whitening Lightning and their products~!</li>
      <li>I noticed my actual bleach trays system works a lot better than this.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I read when I first got the product...</li>
      <li>Arrived earlier than expected and in great condition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice for if you drink a lot of dark soda, wine, or coffee.</li>
      <li>However this is the real product from what i see, comes in the orginal box and casing and everything and for the price you cant beat it.</li>
      <li>I have to say my teeth are so much whiter and</li>
      <li>Ready to use, seems to work and whiten.</li>
      <li>However, why do customers need to wait 14 days to see the true result when the last day to refund is exactly 14 days?</li>
      <li>The pen felt horribly light and cheap in my hand - something that usually cost more than $60 should absolutely not feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i noticed that my teeth became very sensitive after about a week of use.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Around 5-6 days later I got an e-mail saying that they can&#x27;t even though I used the same e-mail that I bought the product as a guest to make the account and the exact same IP address.</li>
      <li>but...it wasn&#x27;t as fast as I expected</li>

<li> I am thoroughly disappointed and will never buy a product from this company again.</li>
<li> I was disappointed to see that there was no change and ceased using it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit that that was a horrible mistake on my part</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ll start with the pros.  It was super easy to use. I loved the application of this product and actually had fun doing it! The smell and taste were pretty light, and not an issue for me. I also did not experience any sensitivity or pain after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t like this product because I diligently used the pen every night for two weeks and documented the color of my teeth. I was disappointed to see that there was no change and ceased using it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the bright white effect I thought I would with this pen. It&#x27;s nice for if you drink a lot of dark soda, wine, or coffee. I noticed my actual bleach trays system works a lot better than this. I felt like it didn&#x27;t adhere to my teeth as well as I thought it would stick. One sip of water and the bleach was off my teeth. This product helped the stains from drinking Pepsi, but it wasn&#x27;t amazeballs.</li>
    <li> Not so happy with my purchased because i bought it on accident n its really not all that got it delivered super quick but not wut i thought it would be</li>
    <li> I saw this on YouTube with the brow kit. I had to give it a try because my teeth have never been as white as I would like. I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work after trying so many tooth whitening strips and stuff. I have to say my teeth are so much whiter and even my dentist noticed. It has meant so much to me to be able to smile in pictures. Thank you Whitening Lightening!</li>
    <li> I lied hat it was easy to use and I could use it while I slept. People noticed my teeth were whiter, made me happy</li>
    <li> The Super Booster Teeth Whitening Pen works as advertised but i noticed that my teeth became very sensitive after about a week of use.</li>
    <li> Wow! So easy to use and the results are truly Amazing. So much better than going to the dentist. Love it! Jacki Curcio</li>
    <li> This whitening pen is ideal for travel. It fits in your purse, works well and dries quickly, while whitening!&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the pen is well worth it.  Get yourself one and start whitening today!</li>
    <li> Ready to use, seems to work and whiten.</li>
    <li> I received the product pretty quick. I opened the product and it looked like either someone twisted the gel up or it exploded on its own. I don&#x27;t know if any of that happened, but the product was all over the place. Haven&#x27;t tried the actual product yet so I cant say anything about it.</li>
    <li> It also didn&#x27;t work. There was absolutely no change! The color of my teeth didn&#x27;t get better but I kept using the product religiously until there was absolutely no more gel in the pen. There was no change yet I had to endure around 16-17 days of bad tasting, gum-tingling gel coating my teeth. I&#x27;ve used Crest 3D strips before and my gum never reacted badly to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting recommended by one of my favorite Youtubers to use this product, I used the discount code to buy the money-wasting product on their actual website hoping for at least a few &#x27;shades whiter.&#x27; I am thoroughly disappointed and will never buy a product from this company again. The pen felt horribly light and cheap in my hand - something that usually cost more than $60 should absolutely not feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On their actual website:&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it money-wasting but I smell something fishy! There are supposedly no refund forms unless you make an account so that they can spam you with e-mails to buy their products. I unfortunately bought it as a guest and immediately regretted it so bad that I tried to make an account then ask for them to merge the item that I&#x27;ve just bought into my account. I&#x27;ll admit that that was a horrible mistake on my part but I felt like I had to make one just in case I wanted to use the refund form later. Around 5-6 days later I got an e-mail saying that they can&#x27;t even though I used the same e-mail that I bought the product as a guest to make the account and the exact same IP address. Hm... Anyways, I have only myself to blame for that mistake. However, why do customers need to wait 14 days to see the true result when the last day to refund is exactly 14 days? That&#x27;s what I read when I first got the product... I think it was somewhere on the box but I don&#x27;t remember. However on the website it says 30 days return guarantee for all their products. Bull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only on their actual website do I see so many wonderful comments about the product whereas otherwebsites that do reviews have an audience with mixed-reviews but maybe that&#x27;s just me being a bit paranoid - oh wait, they only approve good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I am using whitening strips again and amazingly after three days of use I can see a huge difference. Everybody that I come across would praise how my white my teeth are whereas before when I was using the pen, nobody noticed and even when I asked my close friends, they couldn&#x27;t notice anything different either. Save your money, invest in strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However if you do still insist on testing out this product, be prepared to be disappointed big, big time.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received this product because I have heard alot of good reviews on it. The devlivery was on time and the product came in perfect condition. The application is very easy and fast! it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty taste in your mouth. I recommend putting it on before you go to bed and leaving it on there all night! I did notice a difference in the 14 days you are supposed to use this pen..but...it wasn&#x27;t as fast as I expected and I have been using it for well over the recommended usage..never the less it has made a difference and my family has noticed that my teeth are whiter! so all in all good product!</li>
    <li> I got some whitening but not much it takes a long time to dry. I feel as if strips work better u get more control i feel but wit the pen i apply close my mouth and then it would run off i keep spittng it out if that makes sense at all.</li>
    <li> I love the Super Booster whitening pen. I use it all the time and it WORKS. I drink a lot of coffee &amp; soda and my teeth have never looked better. Thanks to Whitening Lightning and their products~! Super Fantastic Products! I highly recommend them, the best out there. Nothing compares. My dentist even said my teeth are amazing from this product.</li>
    <li> I just received it today so I havent tried it the actual product yet but Ive read &amp; saw some really good reviews on the product so Im excited to try it! I hope it works for me like it has for others! My only sigh was when I receive this and took the cap off the pen it had busted and the cap was filled with product at the top so that sucked this seller doesnt packeage well enough I guess IDK but I dont like that so I will probably order from the actual website next time. However this is the real product from what i see, comes in the orginal box and casing and everything and for the price you cant beat it. Its $30 on there website so this is an AWESOME deal, I would just like to have gotten my product with none of the gel slipped out.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t do what I expected and for the price I paid the amount of product I received was much less than expected.</li>
    <li> whitens teeth very well pretty quickly at a good price</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> Yes, these really work!!  If you have ever had your teeth whitened, this is the perfect touch up to use in between.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected and in great condition. Would recommend this product to anyone. Definitely makes teeth whiter in a short amount of time!</li>
    <li> It does work .. just not as well as it is advertised .. I was hoping for better results so that was disappointing.</li>
