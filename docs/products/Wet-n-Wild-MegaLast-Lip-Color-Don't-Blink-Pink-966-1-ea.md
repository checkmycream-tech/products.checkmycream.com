      <li>I am really happy with the lipstick.</li>
      <li>Extremely bright.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a good lipstick.</li>
      <li>You can find this cheaper at a drugstore (say Walgreens for example) for around $1.99, though this is a good alternative if you can&#x27;t find the color that you&#x27;re looking for in store, or even if you have an Amazon gift card or something</li>

      <li>All and all a good product.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m more happy with the fact that I got this even before the estimated delivery.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shade but you can get them at Walgreen&#x27;s for $2!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS LIPSTICK!</li>
      <li>Great service, great price, great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formula is a bit drying upon application and the lipstick isn&#x27;t entirely matte, either.</li>
      <li>This stuff has amazing color pay off,</li>
      <li>Still a very pigminted an gorgeous color none the less!Great product!!</li>
      <li>Package was nicely wrapped in bubblewrap to protect it and the lipstick.</li>
      <li>Nice lipstick.</li>
      <li>Very bright and vibrant love this!</li>
      <li>Bright vibrant colors and great for Summer,</li>
      <li>but you either have to have a great nose, or be right up on the product to smell it.</li>
      <li>oh ya i just love this lipstick and its color.</li>
      <li>the price, the dryness is completely ok to me.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>But this one was better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying them for the most part.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick, it&#x27;s stays on</li>
      <li>love  it</li>
      <li>If you are considering this product I say go for it... but go for it in the drugstore for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i love it..</li>
      <li>I love the color...</li>
      <li>then that I love it.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I Loved It so much.</li>
      <li>I loved cherry picking so much</li>
      <li>I apply some chapstick before I put this on and it goes on fine.</li>
      <li>I find it&#x27;s best to put on a lip balm first or mix with a different lipstick.  </li>
      <li>so if you want something cheap that looks like those lipstick color</li>
      <li>Does not go on smooth.  </li>
      <li>Plus, you can&#x27;t beat free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>cheap and came in 3..</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t Blink Pink is a beautiful shade.</li>
      <li>is very hard to apply but the color is great and bright</li>
      <li>pink lol</li>
      <li>Super creamy but not too creamy to where it gets all over everything.</li>
      <li>After you go over your lips 2 or 3 times, the pigment really shows up and it glides on fine.</li>
      <li>Bright pink color, it stays on well even after trying to remove it you can still see it.</li>
      <li>just bright barbie pink.</li>
      <li>so, it&#x27;s worth it in the end.</li>
      <li>color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily.</li>
      <li>The lipstick isn&#x27;t as much of a hot pink shade as pictured, but it&#x27;s definitely a gorgeous color that lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>kinda long lasting also, great buy.</li>
      <li>The color is so pretty</li>
      <li>My corner drugstore sells this particular lipstick for $1.99 (and most recently had a BOGO-half off sale...)</li>
      <li>is because it is not the color in the picture showed,the actuall product is a lot lighter an much brighter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everything was reasonable.</li>
      <li>you can see the whole lid is just messed up.</li>
      <li>i love wet</li>
      <li>These lipsticks are so cheap and are affordable to try all the different types and shades.</li>
      <li>its a true hot pink &amp; sometimes for fun</li>
      <li>I notice other items in this very cheap line are also overpriced.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a little small still really good though!!</li>
      <li>The color payoff is most definitely there, and for me the lasting power went up to about three hours before I had to reapply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When It finally arrived in the package I was more than eager to open it.</li>
      <li>I slept with it on on purpose and to wake up with the color on my lips put a big smile on my face.</li>
      <li>and I live in India.</li>
      <li>It kind of dry but other</li>
      <li>The color comes off as a true vivid pink...</li>
      <li>This is such a pretty color.</li>
      <li>Wow</li>
      <li>n wild lipstick these kinds.</li>
      <li>If you like barbie pink and looking like you just warped from the 80&#x27;s than this color is right for you.</li>
      <li>More about the product now - Its understandable that lipsticks make your lips a little dry.</li>
      <li>The color is like a hot pink color.</li>
      <li>But the stain, at least on my lips did have more of a dominant red undertone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY barbie pink.</li>
      <li>How much ever, you carefully put the lid still after some minutes</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t like was that the top was broken when I received it, so</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a dry matte</li>
      <li>even when just dabbing it on the llips,it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or too dry either,it is a true matte.</li>
      <li>The very first time you put it on, it does seem a little dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> HORRIBLY DRY AND NEON PINK..&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY , HORRIBLE BRAND MAKES LIPS INSANELY DRY.&lt;br /&gt;PURE CRAP</li>
    <li> I loved the color!!! What I didn&#x27;t like was that the top was broken when I received it, so I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The best! I Loved It so much. When It finally arrived in the package I was more than eager to open it. I tried it on and was just like the previous one i have. But this one was better. ITS LONG LASTING!! I slept with it on on purpose and to wake up with the color on my lips put a big smile on my face.</li>
    <li> Hate this color! It&#x27;s VERY barbie pink.</li>
    <li> I have this color.think pink&amp;,pinkerbell and they are all very similar on my medium skin tone. I like them all but imo they look best on fair skin. These lipsticks are so cheap and are affordable to try all the different types and shades. I&#x27;m enjoying them for the most part. Some just don&#x27;t look that great on me but it&#x27;s still a good lipstick. Bright vibrant colors and great for Summer,</li>
    <li> oh ya i just love this lipstick and its color. The only problem with all wet n wild lipsticks are the packaging. How much ever, you carefully put the lid still after some minutes you can see the whole lid is just messed up. Having said that, I cannot complain about the lipstick it is awesome...</li>
    <li> Very bright and vibrant love this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shade but you can get them at Walgreen&#x27;s for $2!</li>
    <li> Bright pink color, it stays on well even after trying to remove it you can still see it. It&#x27;s an awesome summer color it&#x27;s not a dry matte it in between creamy and matte.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. I loved cherry picking so much I decided to give this one a try and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Super creamy but not too creamy to where it gets all over everything. Great lipstick</li>
    <li> i love wet n wild lipstick these kinds. i have some their lipsticks. its matte. you must add chapstick cause it drying on your lips.</li>
    <li> came broken off. color was not what i expected.</li>
    <li> Good color for people who like flash colour</li>
    <li> very dry when i put it on it is very hard to apply but the color is great and bright</li>
    <li> The color is so pretty and I got with in no time!! But it&#x27;s a little small still really good though!!</li>
    <li> If you like barbie pink and looking like you just warped from the 80&#x27;s than this color is right for you. I was shocked by the color when I applied it to my lips. A little goes a long way! It also applys dry, but if you put a gloss over it it would fix that.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the lipstick. Don&#x27;t Blink Pink is a beautiful shade. I&#x27;m more happy with the fact that I got this even before the estimated delivery. I placed the order on 14th Nov 12.  The parcel had to come in during 3rd - 14th Dec 12. I got it on 24th Nov 12 and I live in India. Package was nicely wrapped in bubblewrap to protect it and the lipstick. I&#x27;d suggest you buy it from BeautyJoint.More about the product now - Its understandable that lipsticks make your lips a little dry. I&#x27;d suggest that you use a little lip balm and then apply the lipstick. All and all a good product. 5 stars for the product BeautyJoint.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is very thick and dry.  Does not go on smooth.  I find it&#x27;s best to put on a lip balm first or mix with a different lipstick.  The color is also a bit &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; looking though this is a drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> I a good product. I love this product. It kind of dry but other then that I love it. The color is like a hot pink color.</li>
    <li> The lipstick isn&#x27;t as much of a hot pink shade as pictured, but it&#x27;s definitely a gorgeous color that lasts for hours. I apply some chapstick before I put this on and it goes on fine. The very first time you put it on, it does seem a little dry. After you go over your lips 2 or 3 times, the pigment really shows up and it glides on fine.</li>
    <li> This stuff has amazing color pay off,even when just dabbing it on the llips,it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or too dry either,it is a true matte. Although if your lips are dried out ,it can looked cracked an cakey,since it is a matte,so just a heads up.This arrived in wonderful packaging,protected an neat.It also arrived in a short time!:)so that&#x27;s always nice!The only reason why I give it four stars is because it is not the color in the picture showed,the actuall product is a lot lighter an much brighter.Still a very pigminted an gorgeous color none the less!Great product!!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Nice lipstick.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty color. The color comes off as a true vivid pink... no red in it... no purple... just bright barbie pink. Its long lasting especially for the price, hell its long lasting for any lipstick for that matter. I put this on over a lip balm because for me its not very moisturizing. I does not bleed on me, but I have not worn it in extreme heat so that may affect the bleeding. It has a very faint \\&quot;lip stick smell\\&quot; like the kind of lipstick your mom may have had... but you either have to have a great nose, or be right up on the product to smell it. If you are considering this product I say go for it... but go for it in the drugstore for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I give this one star based on the price. Regular price in the store is $2... and with a bogo its even cheaper. This company is robbing you people.</li>
    <li> Great quality lipstick for the price. The color payoff is most definitely there, and for me the lasting power went up to about three hours before I had to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars out of five, due to the fact that (for me at least) even with soap, and water, and even makeup remover I couldn&#x27;t remove all of my lipstick afterwards. It left a deep pinkish cranberry red stain on my lips (I know, why red? It&#x27;s a pink lipstick! But the stain, at least on my lips did have more of a dominant red undertone. It looked like I had dried blood on my lips! Yuck!). But all in all this is a great product! Came here well packaged, and I didn&#x27;t have to wait -too- long for my shipment to arrive, only for it to depart (five or so days, I believe) but, that is understandable. Maybe I was just too impatient! Haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was reasonable. Great service, great price, great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formula is a bit drying upon application and the lipstick isn&#x27;t entirely matte, either. You can find this cheaper at a drugstore (say Walgreens for example) for around $1.99, though this is a good alternative if you can&#x27;t find the color that you&#x27;re looking for in store, or even if you have an Amazon gift card or something so, it&#x27;s worth it in the end. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-E</li>
    <li> I believe it is the driest lipstick in the world, but the color is soooooooo pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price, the dryness is completely ok to me.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick, it&#x27;s stays on and it&#x27;s almost matte if you print your lips on a napkin. I love it</li>
    <li> Very similar to Mac candy yum yum and nix shocking pink but slightly darker but people won&#x27;t know the difference, I have a lot of people that walk up to me to ask me if I was wearing candy yum yum or shocking pink lol so if you want something cheap that looks like those lipstick color then I recomend this don&#x27;t blink pink from wet n wild.</li>
    <li> i like it but it is cheaper everywhere else</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see how much Wet n&#x27; Wild products are here. My corner drugstore sells this particular lipstick for $1.99 (and most recently had a BOGO-half off sale...) I notice other items in this very cheap line are also overpriced.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LIPSTICK! It lasts all night.</li>
    <li> cheap and came in 3.. i wasnt expecting 3 lipstick. but i love it.. i use to wear it everyday but now its when i go out.. i gave one to my friend... i love it</li>
    <li> Extremely bright. Wow</li>
    <li> love  it packaging was great! n I love the color...</li>
    <li> color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily. kinda long lasting also, great buy. its a true hot pink &amp; sometimes for fun I mix it with one of the other lighter pinks from this line....CAUTE!</li>
