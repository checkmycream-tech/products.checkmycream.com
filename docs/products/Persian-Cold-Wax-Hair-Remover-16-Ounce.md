      <li>The best thing I love about this wax is that it could be washed off by luke warm water.</li>
      <li>It is good for skin.</li>

      <li>Super easy to clean.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good at removing my coarse leg hair and washes off easily.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, removes the unwanted hair, so easy to take off</li>
      <li>At 1/4&amp;#34; it was working better, but leaving a decent amount of hair behind.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stir (a short metal flat spatula works best for stirring and application) and add 10 seconds till it is spreadable but not too runny.</li>
      <li>Luckily I opened it right after delivery.</li>
      <li>4 Stars because have to constantly warm it as the cold wax is not as effective as the warm one.</li>
      <li>I discovered that that one jar&#x27;s seal had been broken - not overly impressed with this.</li>
      <li>Vigorously rub my hand back and forth over the cloth strip 3 - 4 times to warm it</li>
      <li>No lotion, no oils, no soapy residue, and it should pull those hairs right out.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>just the right temperature (that&#x27;s tricky).  </li>
      <li>trim my hair down short before I use it, and it works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Strip with wax can be used 1 or 2 more times by quickly placing it on another area, rubbing it back and forth and pulling it off</li>
      <li>Proper waxing process gives a smooth and clean skin.</li>
      <li>Not too hot, but hot enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had never waxed before, and it was pretty user</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been a regular at many different salons for many years and have paid close attention to what aestheticians did.</li>
      <li>think this probably works better for people with finer hair, but my hair is somewhat coarse.</li>
      <li>I sugguest doing smaller spots for better results.</li>
      <li>But overall it work better than the Nads wax I was using.</li>
      <li>It is messy, but I found cleanup to be very easy and the wax washed off with warm water only.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only reason I give it 4/5 is that sometimes it does not work.  But this may be due to my inexperience (or the awkwardness of waxing one&#x27;s own face), and not a fault of the product.</li>
    <li> I tried this wax in several places, I applied a thin layer like the directions recommended and then applied a strip, placed some pressure, and ripped off in opposite direction. The wax didn&#x27;t come off just left a extremely painful and sticky residue. I&#x27;m dissapointed, if anyone has any tips, I&#x27;d appreciate it. For people who are thinking of buying,  I say your taking a big chance that it won&#x27;t work on you either.</li>
    <li> I love this because it is water soluble. If you drop it on a your expensive carpet or marble counter, get a wet towel. you can wax yourself and just hop in the shower. It is also all natural so if someone for some reason beyond me swallows it, no need to freak out.  The muslin strips are a one time cost. If you wash them after every use and hang them out to dry you will literally never have to purchase them again. My aunt has had hers for 15 years.  With this wax the hotter you can take it the better,the wax will be thinner when you take it out and it goes onto your skin thus, you use less and each jar lasts longer.  I am arab, persian, AND indian. I have all the possible ethnic traits for thick, coarse hair. Take it from me this product works! This is definitely comparable to salon wax.</li>
    <li> This stuff is FREAKING AWESOME. I had never waxed before, and it was pretty user friendly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trim my hair down short before I use it, and it works wonderfully! Water soluble means I can just soak my wax strips, wash them, and use them again :)</li>
    <li> The wax needs to be boiled for about a half hr before its the right consistency. If applied too thick or light it won&#x27;t remove anything. But overall it work better than the Nads wax I was using. I sugguest doing smaller spots for better results.</li>
    <li> The best hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s super easy to clean and removes hair wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Although I know how to make my own cold wax, I still prefer to buy Persian Cold Wax.  16 oz of Persian Cold Wax lasts me well over six months, is easy to prepare and apply, grabs and removes hair with ease, arrives in a timely manner, and at a reasonable cost (especially considering how long this product lasts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the hair on my head grows extremely fast, the hair on my body does not.  I have a routine in which I put the Persian Cold Wax to heat while I touch up my hair (about every six weeks to two months...and, although wax can be heated in the micro, I prefer to place the open container in a pot with water...this helps me to control the heat).  While the dye is setting in my hair, I wax both legs from knee to ankle, arms from elbow to fingers, and under arms.  Clean up is easy, and by the time I have finished, it is time to rinse dye from hair.  For me, this is an easy grooming routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY SKIN (and only water is used to rinse w/o need for astringents)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclaimer:  If you are going to wax your entire body (as I have seen some women do), OBVIOUSLY, you will get less mileage out of your purchase.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other waxes before, where you have to heat it in the microwave,&lt;br /&gt;to just the right temperature (that&#x27;s tricky).  Not too hot, but hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This requires no heating.  Also, the other buckets of wax I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;always have the lid sticking firmly to the bucket.  Not so with Parissa Persian Cold Wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it seems less painful.  Maybe it&#x27;s because ripping out hot wax is more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is WAY more practical than having to heat up the jar of wax.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff come off with warm water and gets all the hair off, will be only using this from now on</li>
    <li> love this stuff. was looking for a replacement for nads since i was getting annoyed at paying so much money for the nads hair removal kit every time. this stuff works just as well and costs less money per ounce. i heat it a little because i like the thinner texture when it&#x27;s warm. it&#x27;s good at removing my coarse leg hair and washes off easily.</li>
    <li> It works well. However it&#x27;s very, very thick and hard to get out of the container and spread. I like the kind you can microwave and thin out, but this is not meant for that. It does the job, however.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my go-to wax. I warm it up for a few seconds and it&#x27;s the perfect spreadable consistency! Super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> When I received this it had leaked and got all over everything. I still can&#x27;t open the jar.</li>
    <li> Very good cold wax. Have used it on legs and face and does the job. 4 Stars because have to constantly warm it as the cold wax is not as effective as the warm one.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax i have ever tried. Been buying the same product for years. Works warm or cold, the only difference is that when you warm it in the microwave it goes in your skin smoothly otherwise is kind of hard to apply. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> i love love love this wax.  even though it&#x27;s called cold wax i still heat it in the microwave before use and it works great.  in fact i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work particularly well if you didn&#x27;t heat it, as the consistency would be way too thick.  i started buying this to replace nads when it became harder to find at my local brick and mortar stores.  i appreciate that this just comes with a tub without papers and spatula, because it&#x27;s incredibly wasteful when every kit comes with papers (and most seem to).</li>
    <li> I like my wife to have a smooth cooter...this stuff is not that easy to use, and i sent her back to the salon where they charge $60 to do a cooterwax.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a-ma-zing.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for hundreds of years and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just discovering this now. Kudos to the reviewer who said warm it up a bit (15 seconds in microwave, stir, 15 seconds again), and it really makes all the difference. Also, you need to apply it to CLEAN skin. No lotion, no oils, no soapy residue, and it should pull those hairs right out.&lt;br /&gt;You save 20 mins hearing up, and 20 minutes trying to scrape off wax from your counter/floor/back of the leg, so you&#x27;ve just saved 40 mins reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;Also you don&#x27;t need to buy those ten billion wax removal products. Love.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I tried this. No more messy hot wax!!</li>
    <li> i like this wax it works will. i am giving 4 stars because its very hard to use do have to heat it up a little doesn&#x27;t come with any thing just the wax</li>
    <li> Ordered through Amazon and received in 3 days.  Works great and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat. Extremely satisfied. Will order again. Would help if jar indicated whether soft... med soft... firm... etc.</li>
    <li> Pros: Hair removal is less painful than other waxes. I barely noticed it. Clean up is a breeze-just use water. No horrible wax spots you need to steam away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: It&#x27;s wax...it can get a bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Let your body heat warm the wax for some time before spreading. Make sure your skin is free from oil/moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff and have converted so many of my friends. Dissolves with warm water so it comes off your skin very easily, or anything else you accidentally spill it on for that matter. I bought muslin strips and re wash them so that&#x27;s basically a one time purchase. My friend cut up an old sheet which also works. It says you can use it cold but I never do, I microwave it for a few second which also conserves the wax because you can spread it on thinner. I&#x27;ve been using this wax for about five years and I&#x27;ve never had a problem. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was a different kind of cold wax, like the ones the waxing salons use. This type of cold wax goes on your skin cold and has to be removed with a strip. Good quality and takes off the hair well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for years and nothing compares to it! It&#x27;s strong and gets the job done clean!</li>
    <li> This cold wax works great and I am very happy with this product. I use it on my arms and face.&lt;br /&gt;I have cloth strips from another brand and they work just fine with this product.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with drips and mess.  I think that if that&#x27;s the case, the person doing the waxing has way too much wax on the applicator.  When I do it correctly, it is very quick and leaves no hairs behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Apply a thin layer with a wax applicator over the area I am going to wax. But I make sure it&#x27;s completely covered (thin - not super thin)&lt;br /&gt;2. Lay cloth strip over the wax I just applied to my body.&lt;br /&gt;3. Vigorously rub my hand back and forth over the cloth strip 3 - 4 times to warm it the wax a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Quickly pull the wax strip off in the opposite direction of the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Strip with wax can be used 1 or 2 more times by quickly placing it on another area, rubbing it back and forth and pulling it off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I live in a very warm, humid climate and it doesn&#x27;t work well when the temps are too warm during the day.  I prefer to wax in the latter part of the evening when the temp cools down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than the GiGi cold wax product I used to by and it costs significantly less!</li>
    <li> number one wax ,love this product ,it is very easy to use i highly recommend it to anyone to wax....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff come off with warm water and gets all the hair off, will be only using this from now on. This product is great for hair removal and easy to use. It is good for skin. Easy to wash. Not only removes hair but also good for removing dead cells and blackheads. Proper waxing process gives a smooth and clean skin.</li>
    <li> I love using Parissa Cold Wax. As already mentioned, it is better to warm it up beforehand - spreads easier, goes farther, softens hair follicles. Smooth, hair-free skin lasts for weeks. I also like the way it exfoliates and thins hair regrowth with time. Clean up is very easy since it&#x27;s water soluble. I don&#x27;t worry about it clogging my drains. I do wash and reuse the strips. Instructions are easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer, beware of the container sizes and prices listed on this webpage. I clicked on the 24 ounce container, but in my cart was placed the 16 ounce. When I contacted the seller about it, they wrote, \\&quot;The prices are as follows for this product:&lt;br /&gt;7oz &#x3D; 11.25&lt;br /&gt;14 oz &#x3D; 15.60&lt;br /&gt;16 oz &#x3D; 21.25&lt;br /&gt;24 oz &#x3D; Not advertised on our site.\\&quot; But if you check it out, the webpage still lists a 6 oz, a 12 oz and a 24 oz.</li>
    <li> wish it was less expensive since it rans out fast.</li>
    <li> I estimate at least 10 uses in this container. For less than $2 per use, I have a comparable result to my $60+ salon visits for Brazilians. As some reviewers suggested, I warmed up about 2 TB of wax in a ceramic bowl in the microwave for about 20 seconds. The first application came off so smoothly and painlessly I thought I had done something wrong. Imagine my surprise when I see the strip (I&#x27;ll spare you).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a regular at many different salons for many years and have paid close attention to what aestheticians did. Bikini/Brazilian waxing at home is not for the faint of heart. It is messy, but I found cleanup to be very easy and the wax washed off with warm water only. I ordered hastily and assumed from one of the photos that the strips were included. They weren&#x27;t. Do yourself a favor and order the FantaSea waxing kit. The convenience the kit affords will make the experience that much less impractical.</li>
    <li> I ordered two jars - upon arrival one was leaking - upon opening I discovered that that one jar&#x27;s seal had been broken - not overly impressed with this. The second jar was intact however. I have used this product in the past and am aware of it&#x27;s effectiveness, but have yet to use the items purchased as of yet. Otherwise, the seller was timely and efficient with the shipping!</li>
    <li> This wax is the best. It is water soluble and gentle on your skin. I will only use this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to spend $ 10  for every month in a salon. Clean, Excellent.</li>
    <li> This works okay for me, but it leaves a lot of hair behind. I like this product because it is water soluble and causes the least irritation of any wax I&#x27;ve tried (and I have tried a LOT of waxes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this probably works better for people with finer hair, but my hair is somewhat coarse. I had to grow my hair out to about 1/2 inch for this product to work well. At 1/8&amp;#34; (typical length for other waxes), it would not work. At 1/4&amp;#34; it was working better, but leaving a decent amount of hair behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some tips on the internet that says that this works better when heated even though it is &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; wax. I found that actually helped but not enough to put it on par with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a great water soluble wax. Nair&#x27;s 7.7oz Peach Melon Microwavable wax was one of the better products I had found, but they stopped selling it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for an at home wax. Of course there&#x27;s some pain involved if waxing sensitive area, it is waxing after all. It took me a couple tries to really get the hang of it, but it works wonderfully, even on thicker hair. I recommend warming up the wax in the microwave for about a minute. Makes it easier to apply and use. Also - super easy clean up since it&#x27;s water soluble.</li>
    <li> I tried making my own cold wax with sugar and after many attempts it never came out right. This stuff is a good price and works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several wax and nonwax hair removal products. This is still the best. Others are gummy or don&#x27;t remove hair as well or have heavy scents. Put the opened jar in the microwave for 30 seconds. Stir (a short metal flat spatula works best for stirring and application) and add 10 seconds till it is spreadable but not too runny.</li>
    <li> The packing of the item was horrible and the jar was tilted and squished on one side and was about to leak. Luckily I opened it right after delivery.</li>
    <li> As someone who was tired of having to shave every few days and wanted to wax for the first time, I was a bit worried about making a huge mess and it being painful.  With this, it was very easy to use and I had little to no pain using it (and I&#x27;m usually a baby when it comes to anything painful).  It is very easy to clean up and it&#x27;s more natural than the other waxes I looked into.  Another thing I loved about it was there was no awful smell to it.  My mom uses some wax from Sally Hanson and it does not smell well at all, so having no odor was a plus.  After waxing I really didn&#x27;t need any post wax lotion (though I put some on anyway) because there was surprisingly no real redness or irritation and it was only a bit of a pinch when I removed the strip.  It&#x27;s really good if you have sensitive skin like I do.  I&#x27;m really glad I decided to give this a try.</li>
    <li> The wax is great! Since I used a microwave-heating wax system, the change has been great. I don&#x27;t need to run back and forth from the kitchen to my bathroom to get the wax hot and it works really well. One has to work a little bit on spreading and getting a thin coat of the wax so it might be a little hard for sensitive skin, but I tolerate it with no problem. Great product!</li>
    <li> okay product, be careful leaving for longer then it calls for, it may burn your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this wax for years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good wax a bit expensive but easily removed with water n pretty thin once heated</li>
    <li> Thank you for this product! It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, removes the unwanted hair, so easy to take off and that&#x27;s really all I wanted. lol</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair :)&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate skin&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get ALL the hair (but I haven&#x27;t found a wax that does yet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:&lt;br /&gt;Use it under my arms and on my bikini line&lt;br /&gt;I also use talc powder to keep the area dry</li>
    <li> Its painless but won&#x27;t remove any hair really. Maybe removes about 1/8 of the hair to wherever you applied it. I&#x27;ve tried it hot and cold still no luck.</li>
    <li> I received Parissa cold wax in time. The quality is very good. The best thing I love about this wax is that it could be washed off by luke warm water. Easy to use. I love it!</li>
    <li> Very messy and didn&#x27;t seem to work ask advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this wax on a whim. Turns out, I love the stuff. I did as someone suggested in the comments. I heated the jar in the microwave to get a syrupy consistency. After playing around with the wax, I figured out the correct amount needed to grasp hair. I was using too much wax initially. I have used the wax four or five times and I still have about 80% of the jar left. The wax easily washes off with water. I can reuse the muslin strips just by soaking them in warm water and drying them. My legs do not even need any aftercare with this wax. I use a light lotion and they look great.</li>
    <li> This wax is very nice.  The container is much larger than other waxes I&#x27;ve purchased online - I&#x27;ll probably get 6-7 uses (waxing both legs) out of the container.  I do heat it up - it&#x27;s very thick when it&#x27;s cold, and it works well warm.  It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance that I can detect.  It washes away easily with warm water.  I will probably purchase this wax again.</li>
    <li> Wax is okay, definitely cannot be used cold as it is touted. can&#x27;t even spread it without heating it up. Also, this is NOT Parissa brand, the listing is misleading. I purchased because i have used Parissa products before and liked them. No where on the container does it say Parissa. very disappointing, as that brand seems to work best.</li>
    <li> Very good price. Very good product. I love it.</li>
