      <li>$3 is a fair price</li>
      <li>my hair to stay as good as it was before I put the hat on.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m able to keep warm with my winter jacket.  </li>
      <li>great product and so appreciated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad someone still makes these.</li>
      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>Stylish looking, goes with any color.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not the most fashionable statement, but I am more concerned with comfort and function.  </li>
      <li>Also, you should know that it&#x27;s only perfect for shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that you could get them as Prime if you ordered them with another Prime order</li>
      <li>I purchased for function more than style and am satisfied with the preformance of this product.</li>
      <li>and she was so excited to know that she would still be able to purchase them.  </li>
      <li>very useful, and easily folds up to put away.  </li>
      <li>This old fashioned rain-bonnet does a very good job of keeping your hair dry and giving you good visibility.  </li>
      <li>so they are readily available.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t especially stylish, but it is not ugly either and very effectively keeps the rain off your hair or glasses and keeps rain from going down your back.</li>
      <li>I will probably appreciate it more when I am caught in a real downpour.  </li>
      <li>Was getting ready to make a purchase on Amazon when a huge storm blew in &amp; I searched for a bonnet.  </li>
      <li>I also liked this rain bonnet (I also purchased the rain skipper 888, from the same company).  </li>
      <li>but it could easily be worth $2.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for when you are going a short distance &amp; it isn&#x27;t worth the umbrella - or for when the wind is blowing so hard  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as shown...nice and roomy for when my hair is done up.  </li>
      <li>But!!  very functional!</li>
      <li>It is packaged in a nice plastic envelope, that snaps closed, so I can put it inside my pocket.  </li>
      <li>The Andre Rain Wear 900 Rain Glory is exactly like it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>The flap in the back is great for keeping the neck and my collar dry.</li>
      <li>I have had many over the years that are smaller but this one really covers my hair.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>so you can always be ready.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was fast, too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m staying so much warmer with it..</li>
      <li>It is much easier to carry than an umbrella.</li>
      <li>It covers your whole head from the rain.</li>
      <li>But I like it so much</li>
      <li>but it really does the job, covers the head and neck area</li>
      <li>so if you&#x27;re really in a downpour, the rain stays out of your collar and off the neck.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants rain protection for their hair.</li>
      <li>People make fun of me for wearing one in general</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for older ladies who probably use to purchase them from their hairdressers.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t mess up my hair the way hats do, and holds up in the wind much better than an umbrella.  </li>
      <li>It was shipped for FREE along with my other order .  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Andre Rain Wear Rain Glory because I am going to be in New Jersey in April.  </li>
      <li>I live in south Florida and</li>
      <li>I bought this item because I plan to have my hair done pretty during my trip to Universal Orlando.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large enough to cover my hair completely.</li>
      <li>This one has a longer extension in the back, so is better for hair that is a little longer.  </li>
      <li>My old rain bonnet bit the dust.  </li>
      <li>My hair is softly tucked inside.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t crush my curls and completely waterproof.  </li>
      <li>Mine (I ordered 3) are now over a year old and have not cracked or ripped.  </li>
      <li>Soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked everywhere locally &amp; could NOT find a decent rain bonnet to buy.  </li>
      <li>This rain bonnet is large enough to keep my hair dry and it is of&lt;br</li>
      <li>This rain hat is large enough to keep my forehead, hair, and neck dry in the rain.</li>
      <li>The visor part of it is soft like the rest of the item and you can chose to cover your face a lot or a little depending on how much you pull it forward.  </li>
      <li>Covers full head and back of hair unless your hair is past your bra closure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but floppy (or sloppy) to wear, especially in the wind.  </li>
      <li>Really like that it extends down the back a bit</li>

    <li> I keep it in my purse to use on a rainy day</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! The Andre Rain Wear 900 Rain Glory is exactly like it looks in the picture. It is of excellent quality and it looks good, too. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants rain protection for their hair. Delivery was fast, too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but floppy (or sloppy) to wear, especially in the wind.  Difficult to see with.</li>
    <li> I looked for these rainbonnets for a long time.  Just after I ordered this one, I found a Totes one at Walgreens.  It is much&lt;br /&gt;heavier.  Although I havn&#x27;t used either of them, I believe the Totes will be my choice.</li>
    <li> ordered this for my fussy/prissy sister in law.  she loved it and even though the sun was out, she had it on and tied under her chin in a flash.  great product and so appreciated.</li>
    <li> I bought this to have on hand for sudden rain showers in Hawaii, but I also used it on shipboard during the cruise to keep my hat from blowing off.in the wind.  I&#x27;m glad someone still makes these.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best rain hats I ever owned. It covers your whole head from the rain. My hair is softly tucked inside. Lot of room&lt;br /&gt;for my hair to stay as good as it was before I put the hat on. Terrific rain hat!</li>
    <li> Great hat. People make fun of me for wearing one in general but I&#x27;d rather have good hair all day at work! I live in south Florida and this does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Andre Rain Wear Rain Glory because I am going to be in New Jersey in April.  Coming from California, I have little to wear in case of rain, so I wanted to be prepared.  I like the visor, because it will cover my bangs (hair in the front above my eyes), as well as my neck.  However, I am very small, and this is a bit large for me.  I am keeping it, just in case I need something.  It is packaged in a nice plastic envelope, that snaps closed, so I can put it inside my pocket.  The color will match my coat, which is tan and brown, so that was a plus when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> And worse than not fitting properly it leaked!  I would not buy this product .  I just threw it away!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as shown...nice and roomy for when my hair is done up.  Light-weight so it doesn&#x27;t crush my curls and completely waterproof.  Really like that it extends down the back a bit so if you&#x27;re really in a downpour, the rain stays out of your collar and off the neck.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t especially stylish, but it is not ugly either and very effectively keeps the rain off your hair or glasses and keeps rain from going down your back. It is much easier to carry than an umbrella. It folds compactly and fits in a purse or glovebox of a car so you can always be ready.  You can always keep an umbrella in the car, too, but mine is often in the trunk when I need it.</li>
    <li> This rain hat is large enough to keep my forehead, hair, and neck dry in the rain. I purchased for function more than style and am satisfied with the preformance of this product.</li>
    <li> very useful, and easily folds up to put away.  Kept my head dry, and kept rain from seeping into my coat collar.  Only negative... I almost looks like a Kroger grocery bag in color.  But!!  very functional!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mum and she loves it.</li>
    <li> WHEN I USE SNOW BLOWER AND IT SNOWING I KEEP GETTING MY HAIR ALL WET.  I REMEMBERED MY MOM WEARING&lt;br /&gt;THIS IN THE RAIN, AND THANK GOODNESS AMAZON HAD THIS &amp; GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> This rain bonnet works well.  I use it to keep the humidity off my hair in the morning.  I like that I can see through the plastic.  It&#x27;s large enough to cover my hair completely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my great aunt.  She has had a very hard time finding these rain bonnets and she has lost all of hers.  After several attempts to purchase them locally, I decided to look on line.  I gave her two of them for Christmas presents and she was so excited to know that she would still be able to purchase them.  I love the fact that you could get them as Prime if you ordered them with another Prime order so I keep them in my wish list for when I need to order them again.  I recommend this product for older ladies who probably use to purchase them from their hairdressers.</li>
    <li> I also liked this rain bonnet (I also purchased the rain skipper 888, from the same company).  This one has a longer extension in the back, so is better for hair that is a little longer.  I would also recommend it to anyone looking for a rain cover for her hair style.</li>
    <li> Covers full head and back of hair unless your hair is past your bra closure.  Stylish looking, goes with any color.  I plan to use it during rainy days.  Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> This rain bonnet is large enough to keep my hair dry and it is of&lt;br /&gt;good quality and appears durable.</li>
    <li> I know it looks silly but it really does the job, covers the head and neck area and I even use it if it is only windy!</li>
    <li> I travel to rainy windy England a lot and it may be really ugly but it works. That&#x27;s why i gave it ony 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Not really attractive, but it keeps me dry!</li>
    <li> I look like and old lady but with working outside in this wet and cold I&#x27;m staying so much warmer with it.. I love it..</li>
    <li> My old rain bonnet bit the dust.  I couldn&#x27;t find another in any of the stores in my immediate area.  I was purchasing other items, so I  thought I would try this.  It looks big on me.  I have to turn back the front of the bonnet to keep from being swallowed up by it.  I will probably appreciate it more when I am caught in a real downpour.  I also wish this bonnet came in white.  The beige makes it a little dreary looking to me.  But it will work when I need it.</li>
    <li> Soft to the touch.  Mine (I ordered 3) are now over a year old and have not cracked or ripped.  The flap in the back is great for keeping the neck and my collar dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I plan to have my hair done pretty during my trip to Universal Orlando.  I don&#x27;t want the water rides to ruin my hair style for the rest of the day so I plan on protecting my hair with this apparatus for the duration of the ride.  I received it last night and it was raining and cold so instead of putting my thin rain jacket on to take advantage of the hood, I wore my regular winter jacket and protected my hair with this.  It works great and I&#x27;m able to keep warm with my winter jacket.  I plan on keeping it in the car or in the closet with my winter jackets.  Granted it&#x27;s not the most fashionable statement, but I am more concerned with comfort and function.  I like that I can tie it loose or tight depending on how hard it&#x27;s raining.  The visor part of it is soft like the rest of the item and you can chose to cover your face a lot or a little depending on how much you pull it forward.  Also, you should know that it&#x27;s only perfect for shoulder length hair.  My hair falls down to the middle of my back but no worries, I just folded it in half and tucked it under.  $3 is a fair price but it could easily be worth $2.</li>
    <li> I bought this rain scarf to have on hand in case I got caught in the rain. But I like it so much, I find I choose it over my various rain hats. It doesn&#x27;t mess up my hair the way hats do, and holds up in the wind much better than an umbrella.  I&#x27;m back to buy another one, so I can keep it in the car.</li>
    <li> This rain hat is the best I have ever had. I have had many over the years that are smaller but this one really covers my hair. Keeps me dry and therefore no frizz!!! I love this hat!! Just what I ordered!</li>
    <li> This old fashioned rain-bonnet does a very good job of keeping your hair dry and giving you good visibility.  It&#x27;s perfect for when you are going a short distance &amp; it isn&#x27;t worth the umbrella - or for when the wind is blowing so hard  an umbrella is useless.  I  have purchased several &amp; have them stashed in my car, my commute bag, et cetera so they are readily available.</li>
    <li> Due to a disability, I have a hard time using an umbrella &amp; I&#x27;ve been using the plastic bags the stores put my purchase in to keep my hair from getting wet when it&#x27;s raining.  I&#x27;ve looked everywhere locally &amp; could NOT find a decent rain bonnet to buy.  Was getting ready to make a purchase on Amazon when a huge storm blew in &amp; I searched for a bonnet.  It was shipped for FREE along with my other order .  Lo &amp; behold, the day I received it, it was pouring down rain &amp; I had the opportunity to test it.  My hair stayed dry.  There&#x27;s plenty of room for the ladies with the poofy hairdos so their hair won&#x27;t get crushed.  I now own 3 bonnets...one for both my cars &amp; one hangs in my coat closet.  Now I&#x27;m prepared for when it rains no matter where I am!!!</li>
