      <li>price was great and the product was great!</li>
      <li>This is a great shade</li>
      <li>I was thrilled!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good color.</li>
      <li>Good brand.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily, but it just doesn&#x27;t FEEL like I&#x27;m getting great coverage because it&#x27;s so light and airy.</li>
      <li>It is so light and stays great all day.</li>
      <li>This product covers nicely - doesn&#x27;t look  or feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Never has looked oily, just nice and creamy.  </li>
      <li>Quality Product,Nice Color,Goes on very smooth</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this color and it seems they have discontinued it.  </li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>And she purchases more at our drug store she loves it .</li>
      <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll find a shade that works for me in the summer as well :)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and I felt like the coverage was a lot better with the primer than without.</li>
      <li>I could see it better</li>
      <li>I tried it with primer yesterday though, and it was a lot better..</li>
      <li>It is so easy to order on line.  </li>
      <li>Many have commented that it makes their skin look oily, however, I have dry skin and haven&#x27;t experienced others concerns.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Fit</li>
      <li>Came out to only $4, so if it wasn&#x27;t great, not like it would be that detrimental.</li>
      <li>Me foundation seems to fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered this several times and always had good results.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not horrible, but it feels very runny..</li>
      <li>I mean the color is SO perfect, you really cannot tell I&#x27;m wearing foundation at all.</li>
      <li>THE OTHER HAND GOOD SIZE FOR THE PRICE</li>
      <li>But other than that the product is good.</li>
      <li>It comes right away with no hassles.</li>
      <li>This particular shade has a nice rosy undertone which for my skin tone is the only shade that doesn&#x27;t make me look washed out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mixed, and this color fits me perfectly (for the winter at least - when I&#x27;m not as tan).</li>
      <li>looks color looks different when you actually see it in person, I love it though!</li>
      <li>Affordable fast delivery</li>
      <li>Color much darker than pics and description.</li>
      <li>, I kept it and mix it with a much lighter shade that I happened to have.  </li>
      <li>So, I normally use Clinique&#x27;s Perfectly Real foundation, but I had a coupon and figured I&#x27;d try it</li>
      <li>.. see if I could find a decent every day foundation I could use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little too dark but will be great in the summer.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say I was excited to find it again because I love this product and shade.</li>
      <li>Overall, this foundation is applies smooth with even coverage and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is the feel of the formula..</li>
      <li>Unfortunately apparently they have dropped this shade as Amazon is the only place I could find it</li>

    <li> Quality Product,Nice Color,Goes on very smooth</li>
    <li> I have purchased this shade in CVS previously, then Mabelline discontinued the color.  When I found it at amazon I was thrilled!  Not your guys fault but was totally a different shade, I kept it and mix it with a much lighter shade that I happened to have.  quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> Came on time. I made a mistake of buying the wrong shade but I still use it by mixing it with another shade.</li>
    <li> This product covers nicely - doesn&#x27;t look  or feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  Many have commented that it makes their skin look oily, however, I have dry skin and haven&#x27;t experienced others concerns.  Never has looked oily, just nice and creamy.  This particular shade has a nice rosy undertone which for my skin tone is the only shade that doesn&#x27;t make me look washed out.  Unfortunately apparently they have dropped this shade as Amazon is the only place I could find it and it showed only a few in stock.</li>
    <li> So, I normally use Clinique&#x27;s Perfectly Real foundation, but I had a coupon and figured I&#x27;d try it.. see if I could find a decent every day foundation I could use so I didn&#x27;t have to use up the Clinique every time I went somewhere.. Came out to only $4, so if it wasn&#x27;t great, not like it would be that detrimental. Anyway, it is a perfect match.. I almost bought the wrong color.. went back and forth a couple times and finally decided on 325. I&#x27;m mixed, and this color fits me perfectly (for the winter at least - when I&#x27;m not as tan). I love the color. I&#x27;ve never found anything (even my Clinique) that matches as perfect as this. I mean the color is SO perfect, you really cannot tell I&#x27;m wearing foundation at all. The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is the feel of the formula.. it&#x27;s not horrible, but it feels very runny.. almost watery. It doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily, but it just doesn&#x27;t FEEL like I&#x27;m getting great coverage because it&#x27;s so light and airy. I tried it with primer yesterday though, and it was a lot better.. I could see it better and I felt like the coverage was a lot better with the primer than without. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this for my everyday stuff - just use the expensive stuff when I&#x27;m going somewhere important. Hopefully I&#x27;ll find a shade that works for me in the summer as well :)</li>
    <li> Orderedfor my Mom and she loves it...price was great and the product was great! Recommend for anyone!</li>
    <li> DARKER THAN EXPECTED....BOUGHT IT IN CREAM BEIGE 325....WILL PROBABLY GIVE IT TO A FRIEND WITH DARKER SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;ON THE OTHER HAND GOOD SIZE FOR THE PRICE I PAYED ( $3.47).</li>
    <li> A+&lt;br /&gt;Great product but looks color looks different when you actually see it in person, I love it though! So happy!</li>
    <li> Good brand. It&#x27;s a good color. It wasnt the one I needed. But other than that the product is good.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this several times and always had good results. This shipment however (an order of 3 bottles) came to me with 2 of the bottles completely broken. they are unusable. I logged a request for replacement but to date nothing.</li>
    <li> This is a great shade</li>
    <li> Color much darker than pics and description. Can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> I have looked for this shade in this product all last summer but was unable to find it anywhere. Needless to say I was excited to find it again because I love this product and shade. It is so light and stays great all day. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this color and it seems they have discontinued it.  I&#x27;m bummed!  Hoping to buy out all of these so I don&#x27;t have to wear a color that doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Affordable fast delivery</li>
    <li> Received this and didn&#x27;t realize how dark it was ! But that&#x27;s okay I gave it to a friend! And she purchases more at our drug store she loves it .</li>
    <li> I can never find this product in the store.  It is so easy to order on line.  It comes right away with no hassles. I love this product. It goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a foundation for my mature complexion that didn&#x27;t look heavy or caked looking. Fit Me foundation seems to fit the bill.  It&#x27;s a little too dark but will be great in the summer.  I plan on purchasing a shade lighter next time. Overall, this foundation is applies smooth with even coverage and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
