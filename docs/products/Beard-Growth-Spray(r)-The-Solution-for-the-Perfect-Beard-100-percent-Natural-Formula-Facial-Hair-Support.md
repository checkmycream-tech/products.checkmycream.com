      <li>then my barber would get rid of the scraggly look to give me a good line, and I&#x27;d always have to admit it looked better.</li>
      <li>It is also absolutely one of the best gift ideas.</li>
      <li>and im loving the results even more.</li>
      <li>This is extremely a suitable product for those who want a rigorous manly look.</li>
      <li>He just says \\&quot;It is highly suitable for my profession.</li>
      <li>reading all the reviews and seeing the rating I thought for sure</li>
      <li>Actually more grew more than before.</li>
      <li>(who knows what results my friend could get if he buys more?)</li>
      <li>my beard&#x27;s growing more and faster now.</li>
      <li>I like to have a beard to be more appealing</li>
      <li>Meanwhile I have a grown considerably more hair with the spray</li>
      <li>Ok product</li>
      <li>So I started to use many creams and capsules to grow hairs on my face.</li>
      <li>so I am so glad i gave it a try.</li>
      <li>you need to be able to grow some type of beard..</li>
      <li>Bought this solution to get more hairs on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>Your look much handsome using it and will surely increase your personality.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I have grown more mustache and even more hair at my sideburns area.</li>
      <li>I’ve been really happy with how much this helps with length, speed, and with the condition that it leaves my beard.</li>
      <li>This worries me because it can&#x27;t be healthy for my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, after reading many of the reviews; I decided I will not be purchasing this product &amp; will caution my friends to avoid it as well.</li>
      <li>To my suprise, I started noticing &amp;#34;new undergrowth&amp;#34; and the bits of gray that had shown up were blending more or falling out.</li>
      <li>I just really love this product.</li>
      <li>apply for a month or more for any results.</li>
      <li>better off with a beard vitamin or Rogaine</li>
      <li>Satisfied costumer , but</li>
      <li>but I figured I&#x27;d get some more and try it for longer</li>
      <li>you release the pressure without any product and therefore you won&#x27;t be able to recover all the product in the can.</li>
      <li>and I have to say that mine is growing in more evenly and thicker.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to say that it has now filled in quite nicely, almost matching the rest of my beard, which is full everywhere else.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how many compliments I have received on my hair.  </li>
      <li>An aerosol spray-can can&#x27;t be the most efficient way to apply anything to your face.</li>
      <li>It was basically invisible, which is why I&#x27;m glad I got this,</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure if It was gonna work for me</li>
      <li>I am now way more confident since I have the beard of my dreams.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always thought that having a beard would give me an older more attractive look</li>
      <li>This as been a great product, and I love that it’s all natural.</li>
      <li>I love the smell; it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>have been using LED laser treatment in conjunction with this, which I enjoy and seems to be doing more work.</li>
      <li>This is really a too good product for growing hair on face.</li>
      <li>I am already using the third bottle and I am more than happy with the shown results.</li>
      <li>it would be so easy to get the hair I&#x27;ve been wanting.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good but finishes rather quickly now that they changed the aerasol spraying function.</li>
      <li>, the changes were pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells fine to me.</li>
      <li>I like those huge, bushy goatees which is what I was aiming for.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, when you buy it from Amazon you get a 3 month supply so there is no reason not to give it time to take effect.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>delivery took only 2 days which is also great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of on the fence because I don&#x27;t really like the hair spray smell in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>and I can say this is a good product so far.</li>
      <li>The hair is very light at first</li>
      <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s just hair spray (smells like it).</li>
      <li>It is worth its price!</li>
      <li>but I was willing to give it a shot, and I&#x27;m really glad I did after using it for 3 weeks day and night</li>
      <li>I definitely need to trim and tidy up my beard more often.</li>
      <li>I already had a pretty impressive beard prior to purchasing this product, and frankly I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
      <li>How many of you have seen any asian males with super nice beards?</li>
      <li>With all its natural ingredients, it gave me amazing results.</li>
      <li>I always wanted to grow a full beard but every time I tried it would just stop growing and it would look horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have always been able to grow a beard, but recently I wanted to see if I could maybe push the growth up a bit and make my beard look more healthier and smooth.</li>
      <li>butt still can’t grow a full beard yet.</li>
      <li>After using it continously for about three weeks my beard did not only grow faster, but I could even notice that it has become fuller and more healthy looking.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and using any product requires thorough research and care. Due to this reason, it became difficult for me to get thicker beard line. However, using this Beard Growth Spray was the best and the smartest choice. The natural ingredients help in quick growth of facial hair and at the same time soothes the skin to avoid itching and flaking.</li>
    <li> Bogus....Absolute junk, didn&#x27;t grow a single hair...nuff said.</li>
    <li> It does what it says!!&lt;br /&gt;But you need to be able to grow some type of beard.. Dont expect miracles, if you cant grow any !!!.  You&#x27;ll notice a change in your beard after a week or two. It worked for me. Satisfied costumer , but it is a little too pricy. And it sprays too much .  4 stars just for those two reasons but i like thr product</li>
    <li> Snake-oil product. Pretty sure it&#x27;s just hair spray (smells like it). An aerosol spray-can can&#x27;t be the most efficient way to apply anything to your face. Too expensive for what it is. Who knows if it actually works. apply for a month or more for any results. I will not be buying another can nor will I finish the one I bought. better off with a beard vitamin or Rogaine</li>
    <li> One can lasted 3 months. I see a noticeable difference (went from only a few stray hairs to 1/3 patchy beard), but I&#x27;ve also been using exfoliating scrub once a week to also encourage growth. Between the two, I&#x27;m hoping to finally have full beard by August (so 6 months total).</li>
    <li> I have a half decent beard but am very thin in the goatee area. I used this as directed for a month (until the bottle was gone), and never noticed any change. When I bought this, there were almost all 5 star reviews, so either it&#x27;s a scam, or I&#x27;m one of very few for which it didn&#x27;t work. Leaning towards the former, but eh, you decide.</li>
    <li> Bought this solution to get more hairs on my cheeks. This product works. I now have more facial hair and the spray is really refreshing.</li>
    <li> Been using for 5 months now. Dont expect miracles but it certainly helps. I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re just starting to grow a full beard! Dont expect miracles but it certainly helps.</li>
    <li> I like to have a beard to be more appealing but unfortunately hair started to grow in patchy. So I started to use this product Beard Growth Spray. This is made with natural ingredient so there is no side effect on using it. it gave me a good result within a month after using it. I am impressed</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think you dudes who give it 2 stars and under, understand that it&#x27;s all about genetics.</li>
    <li> I tried to grow a beard since I was 23. I used several different brands of straight 5% minxoidil for half a year. They were itchy, running on my face and took ages to dry. The worst part is that they didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends recommended try Beard Growth Spray. I was skeptical in the beginning. 3 months later, I am a believer. In 3 months, I&#x27;ve had facial hair coming on my face in places that I haven&#x27;t seen before. It&#x27;s steadily getting thicker and darker too. I have enough hair now that I actually have to be concerned about beard styling for the first time in my life. This is all after only 3 months, which isn&#x27;t very long into Beard Growth Spray&#x27;s full effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Beard Growth Spray worked for me while minoxidil failed.&lt;br /&gt;This product has light yellow color. However, the yellow color is not noticeable at all after it is applied to the face. It does not smell, dries much faster than minoxidil, and does not cause itchiness as the minoxidil products do either.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, product exceeded expectations. I was hesitant at first to try a product like this at home but I am happy that I did. I did not get any type allergic reaction like I thought I would, all thanks to the spray being organic. Highly recommended, saw results in under a month! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Well, for some time I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for a product that will help enhance the very little facial hair I have.&lt;br /&gt;However, after reading many of the reviews; I decided I will not be purchasing this product &amp; will caution my friends to avoid it as well. Thank you to those of you who have written reviews to warn of being ripped off from a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my husband. When he grew mustache, he pulled a few hairs subconsciously when he was bored, and that hair didn&#x27;t grow back. We were worried a lot. So I fould this product. After shaving entirely, he started growing beard and mustache again using the product as directed. It really worked!  Actually more grew more than before.</li>
    <li> I love the product it could be a little less sticky after u massage it into your face but I&#x27;ve noticed some new dark hair growth I&#x27;ve never had before.  Still don&#x27;t have any in the area that I really need but I figured I&#x27;d get some more and try it for longer</li>
    <li> The reviews that you have read are extremely misleading.  If you can&#x27;t already tell, they are very short, to the point, and extremely similar.  Look for key words.  All have the same problem.</li>
    <li> Worked quickly and incredibly well for me, helped to resolve a bit of beard &#x27;patchiness&#x27; issues I was having.</li>
    <li> So, my beard has become sort of my hobby over the past year, which means I&#x27;ve bought a number of products for it--something I&#x27;m not usually prone to do. I&#x27;ve used a couple of the beard vitamins, and I was overall pleased with them, but no matter what I did, my cheek line was still spotty. I&#x27;d let it go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for a month or two then my barber would get rid of the scraggly look to give me a good line, and I&#x27;d always have to admit it looked better. Then about a month ago, I ordered this beard growth spray and have been using it on my patchy cheek area. I&#x27;m very pleased to say that it has now filled in quite nicely, almost matching the rest of my beard, which is full everywhere else. So it--along with a beard vitamin and general grooming of my facial hair--is definitely a part of my daily routine and will continue to be as long as I keep the beard. (That&#x27;s going to be from now on as far as I can tell.) Good product, especially in conjunction with an overall routine.</li>
    <li> Nothing changed at all and don&#x27;t even buy it I feel I lost hair with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days with biotin and the results are amazing. I shaved clean and I already have a little scruff coming in. When usually it&#x27;ll take a week before any hair sprouts. I will be using the product again.</li>
    <li> This is my first review after using this product for 2 1/2 weeks. I think it&#x27;s coming to an end with the middle growing in not equal. This product will help me grow my beard equal in the middle. I will use this product twice a day and a little extra at night for the middle of my beard only. It&#x27;s not that bad because I can make it look equal but when it&#x27;s wet I&#x27;m looking at it like wow. I don&#x27;t know the cause but I think I have an idea why it does that but it&#x27;s something personal. So I won&#x27;t do whatever I do to make it uneven and use this product to even it out instead of shaving it cause I&#x27;m doing a black and blonde checkerboard beard soon and I need it to grow in even in 2-3 weeks from now. I&#x27;m thinking of just using it for the middle until it&#x27;s even. Then after it&#x27;s even, anything goes past the length it is getting too. I just need to blow dry it and put less shampoo in it cause it gets curly. This along with rapid hair growth formula and amish beard balm and eventually beard growth pills will help my beard grow to the floor very fast. I will post a review when I use all three bottles.</li>
    <li> i have been using it for almost a month now and has not fixed my patchiness</li>
    <li> This thing is clearly a scam. I should have realized it sooner, shame on me. Close inspection of the website gives it away. The product&#x27;s packaging had typos on it for God&#x27;s sake. What a complete waste of money. All the positive reviews on this website are completely fake btw, do not trust them. Same writing style of the fraudulent website they crafted. There is no science behind this. If you don&#x27;t believe just try to find anything positive on the internet about this or ask your dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This is really a too good product for growing hair on face.Your look much handsome using it and will surely increase your personality.&lt;br /&gt;This spray is herbal so it will not cause harm to your skin.I prefer this product to every man.</li>
    <li> No new results at all. Been using for 2weeks now bottle almost finshed</li>
    <li> Excellent product excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> This spray helped me grow my beard fast and easy. It only took 3 weeks to see some growth on my beard. Its worth every penny to buy this product. It gives you a great look for cheap. I recommend it to anyone who has trouble growing hair! Excellent product very high quality.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I  think this beard spray is so so. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it is probably made in China but bottle don&#x27;t mention where it is manufacture. I don&#x27;t think this beard spray really help much in terms of beard growth it is more like a skin moisturizer. It don&#x27;t  justify the high price. I will not buy anymore of this beard spray. It might possibly help beard growth for some people, but its not for me. Take your chance with this product from China.</li>
    <li> I have been sought a solution to grow facial hair from places where hardly grows. I want to match my style beard. In the short time I&#x27;ve been testing this product. I have had very good results and seems to solve my problem. Additionally after use skin is properly moisturized feel a part of its refreshing scent. I highly recommend this product if you want to grow more facial hair</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2KHME9H3KTQHM]]I purchased Beard Growth Spray to try and give myself a little bit of increased growth.  I chose it because it was made with all natural ingredients, so I figured if it didn&#x27;t work, at least I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be hurting my skin. Starting the morning after I received it, I used the product after my morning shower, and after drying my face very well, as per instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in the video, I&#x27;ve just gone into my second month of using BGS and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the results I&#x27;m seeing so far.  I notice increased growth, especially in the areas I concentrated on, and my fullness increased as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue to use this product, at least until the 3 month supply given is finished, and if I continue to see positive results, I&#x27;ll definitely order again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Just plain and simple, there is not much instructions on it, or at all. I used the spray for about 1 month. Two weeks after it finished, no results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not natural 100% I think it has chemicals such as minoxidil and caused me allergy</li>
    <li> Spray hasn&#x27;t worked yet, but they do honor their 30 day guarantee which is nice.  Gonna try for another 30 days and see.</li>
    <li> So far is not working.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed by this product. I wish I could say that I gave it a fair shot and achieved some to little grow,which was what I pretty much thought I could achieve with BGS. I don&#x27;t have the problem of lack of facial hair as much as areas that have opportunities. This product did not last six days,and it&#x27;s a monthly treatment. I used it twice a day like the maker suggest and this product ran out and I had every little expectation but man they did not deliver.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to grow a full beard but every time I tried it would just stop growing and it would look horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product finally made my dream come true, it helped me tremendously to grow my beard and it&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> beard growth has been working well and I can say this is a good product so far. texture of product feels great and the smell of itr also matches up. Easy to apply and does not burn up your hear like other products do.you will feel refreshed after this product is applied and you rinse off very good product</li>
    <li> Just plain doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! Little oily but hey it works!</li>
    <li> i dont think it works  It just a scam</li>
    <li> its bin working extremely slow.</li>
    <li> This as been a great product, and I love that it’s all natural. I grow a good beard, but it takes a long time. I’ve been really happy with how much this helps with length, speed, and with the condition that it leaves my beard. I don’t think this would help if you can’t grow a beard at all, but if you can, and you take the time, you will be happy with this great skin care spray. I followed the directions and applied the product twice a day, you don’t have to use much to work it into your beard. The fresh herbal smell is nice without smelling like perfume or a bunch of fake chemicals. You got to try this out!</li>
    <li> There has always been this bald spot on my beard that prevented me from truely growing facial hair.  People would stop and ask if that spot was accidentally shaved.  This spray has helped me get the look I&#x27;ve wanted for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> It is really good priduct</li>
    <li> I noticed a small growth,but not sure is the product is the cause.</li>
    <li> I am already using the third bottle and I am more than happy with the shown results. I have grown more mustache and even more hair at my sideburns area. My friends can&#x27;t believe the awesome results. One of them has already ordered the spray for himself .The delivery took only 2 days which is also great. Thanks!</li>
    <li> First off I want to start off by saying I am a actually customer and this isn&#x27;t a fake review. I just started using the spray for a few days now about a week and I very hyped up about the product to begin with. reading all the reviews and seeing the rating I thought for sure it was legit. Only after i received it did I see everyone saying it doesn&#x27;t work so I got a bit skeptical. However after a week or so of using it i have noticed a significant difference in my facial hair. Granted its not a lot but a few areas that were patchy before have begun to fill in with smaller dark hairs. It&#x27;s not a lot but it is enough for me to notice. I will continue use of the product till i run out and see if it will actually work as described. For now it seems to be working from the new hair growth I&#x27;ve seen, not a lot of hair but it is enough that some areas are a little darker and thicker.</li>
    <li> Very bad product didnt help at all.. Never waste your money</li>
    <li> Ever since I was little, I admired guys with thick, full beards and facial hair. When my facial hair finally started to grow in, I was disappointed to find it patchy and thin. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for products that might help me grow out my beard. Finally, I found Beard Growth Spray. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m already noticing new growth and thicker hair. This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> I never really was statisfied on how my beard looks. When I saw this I thought I would give it a try. This product hads surprised me by how much it actually helped. For such a little price it made my beard look just like how I wanted to be. I am now way more confident since I have the beard of my dreams. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> All reviews talk about my husband got it and my girlfriend bought thise to thise a fake review really it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I got this product in India for patchy beard growth.It is not effective as promised it failed to grow new facial hair and is a waste of money</li>
    <li> I purchased Beard Growth Spray to try and give myself a little bit of increased growth the fact I like about this product is that it’s made out of all natural ingredients and it gives promising results. When I first bought this beard spray I was a bit sceptic about it, but after using it for a while I saw some clear results, The hair is very light at first but after month 2 I noticed it gets a little darker. I plan to continue to use this product, and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have tried products like this before and haven t had the best experiences. Some of them worked to an extent but not enough to justify the price. Needless to say I was pretty skeptical but gave it a shot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date I have been using this spray for just over two months. All in all I am completely happy with the results. One thing to keep in mind when using these types of products is the results definitely aren t instant which is why I waited a few months before leaving a review. Fortunately, when you buy it from Amazon you get a 3 month supply so there is no reason not to give it time to take effect.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> These reviews are obviously fake - the type of reviews New York State&#x27;s Attorney General is going after for criminal prosecution. Amazon needs to monitor this practice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sorry fellows- no spray, cream or vitamin is going to help grow facial hair!!</li>
    <li> My younger brother is a model and he likes to  grow more facial hairs but unfortunately he could not do it because hair started to grow in patchy. Then I came to know about this product through an advertisement. I purchased for him.  I observed the changes he had within few weeks. He just says \\&quot;It is highly suitable for my profession. I am impressed\\&quot;. I am happy to see my brother happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a short while, but the results are already pretty noticeable.  My facial hair, particularly my beard always grew to less than an inch within a couple of days of shaving and then never grew again.  It was basically invisible, which is why I&#x27;m glad I got this, my beard&#x27;s growing more and faster now.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately 😕</li>
    <li> Makes existing facial hair thicker but doesn&#x27;t grow new hairs.  It&#x27;s pretty sticky after you apply it.  It&#x27;s smells fine to me.</li>
    <li> I honestly though this would help me I was so convinced it would by the reviews. But I been using it for about a month now and it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Sorry I&#x27;m not one to give bad reviews but I was sadly dissapointed...</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work. Dont waste your money on this stuff</li>
    <li> it really works! I can see the difference in one week! Asian people do not have too much beard so I am so glad i gave it a try.</li>
    <li> The spray actually worked really well for my husband! It look a little while, but his beard is clearly fuller and his hair appears much healthier as well. Have a little patience with this product, and I think you&#x27;ll see results like we did! Effective, and affordable for the price; I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I like to grow facial hair as it could enhance my handsome unluckily, beard started to grow in patchy. So I started to use many creams and capsules to grow hairs on my face. But I did not get the expected result. A few weeks ago I tried this spray. It&#x27;s really worked out well. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I can’t say that I have ever had a “problem” growing facial hair. The problem is it seems like my goatee always hits a point where the hair growth just slows down to a crawl. I like those huge, bushy goatees which is what I was aiming for. I started using this spray when I may goatee seemed to stop growing and it definitely helped. I can’t say whether or not this would work for someone who has problems growing facial hair at all – but I can say if you already have facial hair but want it to look fuller then this is an option you should strongly consider.</li>
    <li> It’s tough to really see the day to day growth. With that said, since I started using it I definitely need to trim and tidy up my beard more often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old and I really wanted a bread and saw this spray and bought it I wasn&#x27;t really sure if It was gonna work for me but I&#x27;m really starting to see results my facial hair is growing much faster than normal and is staring to form like a bread it does take some time to see results though but it&#x27;s worth the wait cause it does work the bottle it comes in is small but if u use it just once everyday it should last u a month I still have my first bottle but am buying another one just in case I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start growing a bread</li>
    <li> Patience is all what we need. Starts from lil white hair, after a month turns black and there after starts growing large.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both Rogaine (Minoxidil) and Beard Growth Spray for growing a fuller beard. I&#x27;ve seen moderate facial hair growth with both products. However I like the Beard Growth Spray more because it didn’t dry out my skin so much and it had no other side effects whereas the minox gave me headache and sometimes palpitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two negative issues with this Beard Growth Spray though. First, the three bottles of the spray do not last three months as advertised. I&#x27;ve read this complaint from other users and thought they were probably using too much product, so I made a point of carefully using the spray. I spray it on my fingers and massage the liquid into my skin. I know some people wear gloves when applying the liquid, but I don&#x27;t because I wash my hands thoroughly after applying it. Besides, hair won&#x27;t grow where there have been no follicles, i.e. hair might grow on the back of the fingers between the knuckles but not on the finger tips because there never was any hair on the finger tips. And hair won&#x27;t grow on the back of the fingers if your hands are washed after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is the liquid base of the product. Because it is liquid that flows as freely as water, it can be difficult to apply because it can run down your skin where it isn&#x27;t wanted. Why can&#x27;t they put it in a gel or cream? The liquid is easier to spill than gel or cream would be.&lt;br /&gt;If pharmaceutical companies can put this in liquid form, I don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t find a medium that is easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Dissapointed with this product.... I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now.. No result shown</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m in my mid-20s, and still couldn&#x27;t grow a beard. It was getting to the point where I was starting to be self-conscious about it, so I figured I would give this stuff a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 2 months in now, my facial hair really has noticeably thickened and a lot of new hair follicles have developed. I even have had people asking me if I took steroids (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is pretty expensive though. Especially because you have to re-order it every 3 months because the effects will fade if you don&#x27;t apply it regularily. I apply it once in the morning and once in the evening so its pretty straight-forward.&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning I encountered slight itchiness of the skin but after about a week there were no problems anymore. I give it a 4 star rating!</li>
    <li> I intend on updating my review after completely finishing my bottle, however I wanted to write down my perspective after three weeks of daily use on some patchy areas of my beard. I&#x27;m not using this on my entire beard so I expect the bottle to last me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to warn you, the reader and beard enthusiast, that this comes in an aerosul can. Yes, it smells like hair spray and it doesn&#x27;t feel very natural. This is the first and only beard product I&#x27;ve seen that comes in an aerosul can. I&#x27;m pretty sure this was the worst idea. The fact that this is in a spray can presents some issues, this alone is my primary reason for only 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray can delivery is never consistent, if you press too hard you get too much, likewise if you don&#x27;t press hard enough you release the pressure without any product and therefore you won&#x27;t be able to recover all the product in the can. This is a real turn off and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s certainly needed for the solution to work on the skin. The company should really look into a more reliable container, like a simple glass dropper would do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aerosul can also has a very distinct and gross hair spray smell. I don&#x27;t want my beard to smell like hair spray and it kind of leaves a trace smell that makes me want to loose my lunch. I&#x27;ve been spraying my fingers and letting whatever chemical they use to pressurize the can dissipate but there is always a trace amount. This worries me because it can&#x27;t be healthy for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I have is the lack of information here on Amazon. I wish Amazon would require companies to list ingredients on the information page because this contains tea tree and I didn&#x27;t want another product with tea tree. I was adding this to my routine and I already use two other products with some tea tree oil. That&#x27;s not the only active ingredient, but it is very drying and it can cook your skin/hair if you use too much of it. Had I known I wouldn&#x27;t havebought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label doesn&#x27;t cover the entire bottle and the packaging looks cheap. If your looking for something really all natural I wouldn&#x27;t put this in that category. This has a real cosmetic/industrial feel which I&#x27;m just not into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently reluctantly using it since I bought it, but I most likely will not buy again or do I recommend you buying it unless these complaints don&#x27;t apply to you. The price point for the amount of product that&#x27;s in the spray paint can isn&#x27;t very good, in fact I felt ripped off. For this price point, there are more natural and consistent products which are packaged appropriately and will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was honestly excited to give this a try, but now after a couple weeks I&#x27;m really not into it. They need to change the packaging, cut down the tea tree oil and drop the price. This product sits low on my list because of the vague information here on Amazon and the fact that so much of the product gets wasted with the given delivery method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend looking elsewhere until they correct these issues. With all of this being said, I haven&#x27;t seen any solid improvement in 2 weeks, but if I do continue use I will update. I&#x27;m kind of on the fence because I don&#x27;t really like the hair spray smell in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using LED laser treatment in conjunction with this, which I enjoy and seems to be doing more work. I suggest you look into getting a device like that and using a beard oil of some kind. I hope this helps and good luck on your beard journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, these are my initial impressions after 2 weeks. But the issues I&#x27;ve identified here are real and do, IMO, justify the 2 stars. I almost considered 1 star but I&#x27;m being generous today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great spray!  I have been using this whilst attempting to grow a nice full beard recently, along with some different conditioners to keep the hair soft and wax for styling, shaping etc..  This spray does wonders! helped the overall speed of the beard growing and the quality and thickness of it too!  5/5/ Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have seen this product featured on TV so thought I will give it a try. To summarize my experience and results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I personally did not experienced any side effect while using this product. Usually I am sensitive to supplements etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* My beard growth seems to be improved and hair itself grows stronger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy one more to see what results I will get after second month of use</li>
    <li> My girl friend has presented me this beard growth spray and I used it regularly for three weeks. Now I can see some increased growth of my beard. With all its natural ingredients, it gave me amazing results. This is extremely a suitable product for those who want a rigorous manly look. It is worth its price!</li>
    <li> I just really love this product. It hasn&#x27;t only helped my beard grow longer, it has also help the thickness. I can&#x60;t recognize my own beard it has changed that much, haha!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a single change. Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my 1 month and yet I see no changes. I still see the same hair growth pattern and hair follicles when I started.  I take twice daily as instructed. No new growths, problem areas and patches are still there. I&#x27;m not sure where all these positive reviews came  from, but it doesnt work for me. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good but finishes rather quickly now that they changed the aerasol spraying function. It comes out ice cold and a full bottle will last less than 30 days</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this is very effective</li>
    <li> These reviews are false. The company wrote em all out themselves. Dont believe the hype. beards are a product of genetics. You may have a shot with Rogaine assuming there is something there to work with to begin with. Not this JUNK though. Save ypur ca$h and dont believe the hype.</li>
    <li> Nothing Happened and it took me like 8 days to finish the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> i used this product for a few months and i did noticed results ! just don&#x27;t expect if you don&#x27;t any facial hair or little to none to all of a sudden have a complete full beard. in the 3 months i used it i would say i grew about 50 facial hair. The hair is very light at first but after month 2 i noticed it gets a little darker.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately failed to read the reviews of this item before purchasing and only focused on the answered questions. As I came to find out, this is pure snake oil, a SCAM that should be avoided at all cost. Complete rip off. There is no telling if there is anything useful in the aerosol but it did absolutely nothing to stimulate hair growth. Save your money or look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last month.  I am normally skeptical of overzealous claims.  This product seemed to promise quite a bit and I am happy to report that it delivered.  I applied the product in the morning before leaving for work and in the evening before going to bed.  My beard growth was barely noticeable at first, but soon became noticeably fuller toward the end of the month.  I was pleasantly surprised by the result.  I attribute the growth to the all natural ingredients that seemed to clean and prep the skin for growth.  Of course, it might not work to the same degree for everyone.  I believe it’s worth the risk, you just need to take the leap of faith and try to gain hair yourself.</li>
    <li> I saw little white hairs sprout but it stikl looks like I don&#x27;t have a beard.  I will update when I use all three bottles.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve seen one of my friends using this product for a couple of months now, and was impressed with what change I saw. I mean, the change wasn&#x27;t MAJOR, but I was actually surprised to see real growth. (his beard was rather thin at first, but its become noticeably thicker.) There is so much crap out there when it comes to beard growth formulas, but this was the first time I&#x27;ve seen one work, if even a little. (who knows what results my friend could get if he buys more?) I thought why not, and bought myself a case. So far things look sorta the same, but I have noticed some sprouts. So far so good. We&#x27;ll see as I continue using it.</li>
    <li> Wow! I was very much depressed that I&#x27;ve been lacking behind in growing my beard. While that moment one of my friend suggested me to have this as he got one extra pack. On his suggestion I did. Surprisingly My beard started growing thick and neat. Also I finally got rid of the patchy uneven beard. The herbal formula has really helped me to. I&#x27;m very much thankful to this item</li>
    <li> I like the product very much.  I got this product last month, and within the 3rd week I noticed tiny little hairs standing up , it was new growth! I had no idea it would be so easy to get the hair I&#x27;ve been wanting.  A little bit goes a long ways. I cannot believe how many compliments I have received on my hair.  I love the smell; it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve had a bald patch under my chin my whole adult life, and after 3 weeks of using this I have hair growing in there! I was very skeptical at first but decided to try it, and so glad I did. Use it as directed though, apply to dry skin and twice a day. I apply it before work in the morning and at night when I get home.</li>
    <li> Doest NOT work! But then again, I couldn&#x27;t grow much facial hair to begin with. However, I am sure for anyone else that can, this product would work well for invigorating their facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing dad!</li>
    <li> This product has no effect. I would have given it 0 stars, if that was an option. .</li>
    <li> I have always been able to grow a beard, but recently I wanted to see if I could maybe push the growth up a bit and make my beard look more healthier and smooth. I wanted to use a product on a biological basis as I didn&#x27;t want to damage my already grown beard. Beard Growth Spray was the perfect option for me. After using it continously for about three weeks my beard did not only grow faster, but I could even notice that it has become fuller and more healthy looking. I am really impressed by these results and I would say it&#x27;s a must for every &#x27;beard-fan&#x27; like me.</li>
    <li> This has given me some horrible side effects of dizziness and low blood pressure. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> I did see some new hair sprouts, I only recommend this product if your capable of growing somewhat of a beard, it also made my beard a lot darker which I love!</li>
    <li> Its only been 1 month so its early on for me but product is easy to apply. Theres a few new hair follicles appearing and the skin is a bit burning right now, which I read means the product is working. Im very hopeful so far.</li>
    <li> Overly priced! Ok product</li>
    <li> I see No Results. been using this In the Morning and Afternoon Every day for 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;I see Literally no Results.</li>
    <li> The spray is better than all the other stuff I have tried before. I have tried this Vita Beard joke without getting any results as well as minox. which made my skin dry and itchy. I use the solution twice a day, sometimes even 3 times a day. The results do not come overnight. It has taken about 2-3 weeks for me to see the first improvements. Meanwhile I have a grown considerably more hair with the spray and I am still using my second bottle. I am totally convinced!</li>
    <li> I was skeptic at first, I didn&#x27;t know if it would work or not but I was willing to give it a shot, and I&#x27;m really glad I did after using it for 3 weeks day and night, the changes were pretty amazing. I had a really uneven patchy beard, and this spray totally made the difference. Now im not so ashamed of my facial hair as it is thicker and not so patchy. I bought a second bottle and im loving the results even more. On to the third.</li>
    <li> Works great. Noticed it after the 4th day</li>
    <li> I picked up this product recently because my man for whatever reason can&#x27;t grow facial hair. It comes in patchy and awkward and just doesn&#x27;t look like a nice manly beard like I&#x27;d enjoy. I got him this product and after a few weeks it&#x27;s starting to grown in fully and I absolutely love the feel of his facial on when he kisses me. Don&#x27;t mind me, just love me some facial hair. Mmmm.</li>
    <li> I used this for a three whole months with zero results! :(&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I got were really bad (infected) ingrown hairs, when I stopped using it. Still recovering from them two months later. :(</li>
    <li> Not good have y seen any changed</li>
    <li> Works! Im seeing hair growth in places that didnt grow before! Takes time so be patient.</li>
    <li> I already had a pretty impressive beard prior to purchasing this product, and frankly I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. My wife loves my beard, and I&#x27;ve been entertaining the idea of entering some local competitions. I didn&#x27;t even know they were a thing until others told me about them. At any rate, I had hit sort of a plateau in length. It just would not seem to grow any longer (about shoulder length? I guess is how you would say it.). My wife found this for me and asked me to give it a try, just to see if it would do anything. To my suprise, I started noticing &amp;#34;new undergrowth&amp;#34; and the bits of gray that had shown up were blending more or falling out. The kicker? The length. It finally &amp;#34;broke through&amp;#34; it&#x27;s self imposed limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, my wife and I are fans. I wish it were just a bit cheaper, but it does produce noticeable results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I used this rating because I haven&#x27;t seen the results I expected to get just yet. I&#x27;v been using for about 2 weeks. My beard has got a little bit denser on the sides butt still can’t grow a full beard yet. I&#x27;m going to give it awhile longer. Plus I do take vitamins for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift for my boyfriend and it works. His beard is much thicker now and it seems to grow faster. I love that it contains natural ingredients. He has very sensitive skin but this product does not irritate it at all. It is super easy and fast to use. It is also absolutely one of the best gift ideas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that having a beard would give me an older more attractive look but sadly my hair grows in patchy and just looks like I&#x27;m a boy in the middle of puberty. During the first week of use it was irritating and made my skin itch but after a the first week the itch went away and hair grew it it&#x27;s place! It took about a month and a half for me to be satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Takes time &amp; it&#x27;s now filling in my cheek hair &amp; patches,</li>
    <li> I am an asian male. How many of you have seen any asian males with super nice beards? My guess is close to none. We usually grow in patches :( Decided to test this product out and I have to say that mine is growing in more evenly and thicker. No more patches. Will update and definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I give it 3 because ,I&#x27;m using vitamins as well, I think this is effective as well as the beard vitamins, I do see a lot of hair follicles wanting too sprout  which is a good sign for me,I bought 2 cans of this spray, I been using this for about a month and I&#x27;m still on my 1st can so a little goes a very long way I might buy again it depends after I use my next can</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks.  It&#x27;s crap.</li>
</ol>
