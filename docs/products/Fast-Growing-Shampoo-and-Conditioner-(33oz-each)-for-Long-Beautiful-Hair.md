      <li>i think when i wash my hairs with &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34;, feel fresh, cool&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can easily see the line where the new growth has come in.  </li>

      <li>- Only mutants and liars say their hair grows more than 2 inches a month while using this product.</li>
      <li>and BEFORE you wash your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed some of the advice from one review, here on Amazon, and it has been MOST helping, especially for a person with &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair and someone who is SPECIFIC who can DESCRIBE &amp; ELABORATE their experience with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff - went through the bottles and ordering my second batch.  </li>
      <li>but i just give myself a hot oil treatment after every use to restore the moisture which also helps the hair grow too</li>
      <li>I have tried many different shampoos and none worked.  </li>
      <li>Also use a leave in conditioner along with your favorite oils such s coconut, argan oil.</li>
      <li>, I paid more than $1000 hair products, vitamins  and doctors consultation to treat my hair, i contacted the nisim international from youtube</li>
      <li>Thank you FAST!</li>
      <li>My hair is getting longer and healthy in very short period of time.</li>
      <li>The stress from the sulfates will be too much and your hair will break off right in your hands.</li>
      <li>After coloring my hair for 20 years, I know exactly how much my hair grows, and I can say without a doubt it grew faster that month.  </li>
      <li>I am disappointed to spend so much time to research and have the promising result and the &amp;#34;softness&amp;#34; on my hair as the product as advertised but on the bright side, I am learning more and more about MY hair and care for it as well as helping it naturally grow.</li>
      <li>but most of them not really what they said they were till I found FAST.</li>
      <li>This FAST shampoo and conditioner is no BS..</li>
      <li>It absolutely works.</li>
      <li>SO much fuller and the curls are well defined.  </li>
      <li>I was not expecting much but after reading reviews on the product on the internet</li>
      <li>Fast my @$$.  </li>
      <li>it really does what it says on the bottle</li>
      <li>She used Fast shampoo and conditioner for about a year, and her hair is longer than it was when I took her for the trim.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to rub conditioner on my scalp for fear of weighing down my hair.  </li>
      <li>BUT you have to be REALISTIC and do not expect your hair will be like Rapunzel within a month...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner because the shampoo alone is drying.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended..</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>If you follow a sulfate-free wash/conditioning with a sulfate heavy product like Nisim, you will have greater than normal shedding.</li>
      <li>but that is normal.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a requirement, but it helps strengthen the new growth so it won&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For centuries women have known that if you trim your ends on the new moon it will grow faster.</li>
      <li>F.A.S.T. only alters your hair&#x27;s growth rate while you use it so when you get the length you want, stop using it and go back to coloring and using your sulfate free products.</li>

      <li>It does make your hair very soft as well.</li>
      <li>I used this the first month, trying to wash as often as possible.  </li>
      <li>This is the first one that definitely made my hair grow faster and healthier.</li>
      <li>I have heard people complaining that it dries out their hair, but mine is so soft!  </li>
      <li>first Nisim F.A.S.T. product I bought was off the Nisim website because they offer a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it or if it doesn&#x27;t work for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been having a problem to grow out my hair fast in the last few years, so I&#x27;ve been trying to find many products</li>
      <li>i have soft wavy,curly hair this product works wonders for me</li>
      <li>I havent measured my hair yet, and i cut it last week to get rid of all the real fried ends.</li>
      <li>In addition her hair is soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>my hair is starting to fill in nicely where it was thin.</li>
      <li>It helped just a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I made sure not to flat iron and blow dry as much as I usually do (only do twice a week) and kept it as natural as possible.</li>
      <li>It is drying ,due to the sulfates, and you will use twice as much conditioner as shampoo but it works!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>promise your hair will not dry out.</li>
      <li>a person with thick, &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair, I only washed and conditioned every other day and most of the time I left the conditioner in my hair for 6-12 hours.</li>
      <li>It is a little drying (because of the sulfates) and you will use twice as much conditioner as shampoo . . .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used a bunch of different products.  This is the first one that definitely made my hair grow faster and healthier.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter&#x27;s hair got \\&quot;butchered\\&quot; and she was so distraught that I bought the shampoo and conditioner.  I was not expecting much but after reading reviews on the product on the internet I thought, what the heck and gave it a try.  After 7 weeks, her hair has grown approximately 2 inches!  She was not able to tuck her bangs behind her ears in the beginning and now approximately 2 inches dangles down from her ears.  It has been said that hair grows approximately ½ inch per month normally but with FAST, it is more than doubled!  In addition her hair is soft and silky.  Great product, I am impressed!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell if it makes my hair grow faster....my hair grows fast anyway, but since I had a bad cut thought I&#x27;d add this shampoo</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past when I wanted to grow my hair faster and it works. However, it will make your hair dry so use extra conditioner.  I add garlic to my shampoo to cut down on shedding due to the drying effect.</li>
    <li> First ordered the 12oz bottles after getting a bad, short cut. It absolutely works. My hair has been growing and feel healthier and softer than ever. Have had many people comment on how nice it looks and how fast its growing. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;l admit my hair did grow faster the first few months  but then seemed to slow down after about 5 months  of having it. It smells pretty good, not my favorite though.  It does make your hair very soft as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 4 years now.  I can tell a big difference in my hair when I do not use it. I would highly recommend this product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I used both every other day, although it says to use it everyday I believe there&#x27;s no need for such thing. My hair was grown 1 1/2 inches in 4 weeks. I will continue to use , very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I had to get me a refill that&#x27;s how great this product is.. I was alittle skeptical about this product but when I was using it, it only took a week to see results... No joke n no lie..</li>
    <li> Nice but I don&#x27;t love the smell, but hey if it works well.why are words required I don&#x27;t even have to do this</li>
    <li> As a black woman who uses relaxers, flat irons, and blow driers . . . I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;The first Nisim F.A.S.T. product I bought was off the Nisim website because they offer a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it or if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it - It worked - I bought more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things to do to help maximize the effectiveness of the product. Not doing this can hinder your results, sometimes to the point you don&#x27;t think anything is happening.&lt;br /&gt;1 - get your ends trimmed of all splits before you start.&lt;br /&gt;2 - if you relax your hair try to start the Nisim shortly after a touchup&lt;br /&gt;3 - dont use sulfate-free shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners immediately before or after using this product. F.A.S.T. has sulfates in it, so not only will it strip the moisture from your hair it will also strip any coloring as well. If you follow a sulfate-free wash/conditioning with a sulfate heavy product like Nisim, you will have greater than normal shedding. The instructions say to wash you hair daily, but that dried my hair out so bad I had to reduce to every other day. It didn&#x27;t effect the results AT ALL. Once a week on my \\&quot;off\\&quot; day I did use my sulfate-free deep conditioning mask to make up for the dryness. Just dont use the sulfate-free stuff immediately before or after using the F.A.S.T.&lt;br /&gt;4 - take a hair vitamin. it&#x27;s not a requirement, but it helps strengthen the new growth so it won&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few things to know before you start the F.A.S.T&lt;br /&gt;1-Long hair is heavier. It will shed more. Only comb it while wet if you&#x27;re using a wide toothed comb. If your hair is extremely dry or thin DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. The stress from the sulfates will be too much and your hair will break off right in your hands. Thin dry hair grows slower, there is a reason for that. Try to change nature and you will loose every time.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Know your hair. For centuries women have known that if you trim your ends on the new moon it will grow faster. Trim it on a full moon and it wont. Knowing things like this and how YOUR HAIR works will help you set realistic goals and track your results more accurately.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Only mutants and liars say their hair grows more than 2 inches a month while using this product. On average the fastest hair will grow naturally in a month is around one inch. Nisim at best can double your growth rate. So if you&#x27;re a yetti then expect \\&quot;around\\&quot; 2 inches. If you&#x27;re not a sasquatch expect around 1 and a half&lt;br /&gt; 4 - Drink water. The more you consume, the stronger, thicker, and healthier you hair (and skin) will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nisim does what it says if you do your part. It is a little drying (because of the sulfates) and you will use twice as much conditioner as shampoo . . . but it works!&lt;br /&gt;F.A.S.T. only alters your hair&#x27;s growth rate while you use it so when you get the length you want, stop using it and go back to coloring and using your sulfate free products.Knowing things like this and how YOUR HAIR works will help you set realistic goals and track your results more accurately.  3 - Only mutants and liars say their hair grows more than 2 inches a month while using this product.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem to grow out my hair fast in the last few years, so I&#x27;ve been trying to find many products but most of them not really what they said they were till I found FAST. This FAST shampoo and conditioner is no BS.. Truly hair growth product.  My hair is getting longer and healthy in very short period of time. Thank you FAST! I have a lot of complements from people that my hair grow so fast and healthy...Highly recommended..</li>
    <li> my hair is starting to fill in nicely where it was thin. i still have a tiny bit of hair fall out but that is normal. don&#x27;t brush your hair when it is wet. that&#x27;s when your hair comes out the most. wait till it is dry. i guess that is when hair is stronger. i will continue to buy the set of shampoo and conditioner they are working and you get a lot. it is worth it for me :)</li>
    <li> second time we bought the 1 liter size as well.  excellent for our whole family with all times of hair.</li>
    <li> I used it as recommend.  Fast my @$$.  Not worth the money.  Just take biotin supplements!!  Don&#x27;t waste the money!</li>
    <li> I am not kidding!  I researched products that make your hair grow.  found it on amazon and purchased this.  I was amazed.  You can tell a big difference after just a few weeks.  I had to stop using it so much because I was having to get haircuts more often.  I suggest anyone try this that is interested in growing their hair for any reason!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo!  I have always had long hair (but it is curly and takes forever to grow).  My hair was damaged and started to break.  I ultimately had to cut it (above my shoulders).  I have tried many different shampoos and none worked.  I started using this shampoo and conditioner and my hair is healthier (less breakage) and has grown well past my shoulders.  I highly recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner because the shampoo alone is drying.  I read reviews before purchasing this product and other people have found their hair grew approximately 2 inches or more every 3 months, and I found the same results.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I first heard about this product. I have researched for months and months.&lt;br /&gt;I actually works BUT you have to be REALISTIC and do not expect your hair will be like Rapunzel within a month... It takes TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also advise NOT to mix any other shampoos/conditioner products especially not to use any sulfate-free products. DO NOT MIX THEM UP. I also made sure to get my hair trimmed before I used the product, split ends hold you back anyway. I also made sure to take my hair vitamins, (E + Biotin, primarily) and make sure to drink LOTS of water. (I drink a gallon a day on average)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person with thick, &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair, I only washed and conditioned every other day and most of the time I left the conditioner in my hair for 6-12 hours. The smell of the product is nice. It smells like it&#x27;s from an expensive salon! My hair is very soft BUT is drier than usual after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo can really dry your hair out (due to the sulfates) and the conditioner isn&#x27;t complete with Nisim&#x27;s promise of conditioning...but I also used Nisim&#x27;s hair masque. It helped just a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I made sure not to flat iron and blow dry as much as I usually do (only do twice a week) and kept it as natural as possible. I would comb it up and put it in a bun most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has grown more than 1/2 of an inch within 5 weeks, rather than 2 centimeters in 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The promise of altering hair grow is definitely kept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE I washed my hair, I always made sure to COMB MY HAIR OUT BEFORE I showered!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some review talk about shedding, etc. AFTER showering but the smartest thing to do is to brush your hair out when it&#x27;s DRY and BEFORE you wash your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed some of the advice from one review, here on Amazon, and it has been MOST helping, especially for a person with &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair and someone who is SPECIFIC who can DESCRIBE &amp; ELABORATE their experience with this product. If it wasn&#x27;t for this reviewer, I probably would not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nisim does what is promised BUT you MUST do your part. It is drying ,due to the sulfates, and you will use twice as much conditioner as shampoo but it works!&lt;br /&gt;This product only ALTERS your hair&#x27;s growth rate while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;When you get the length you want, stop using it and go back to your usual routine (color, flat-iron, etc.) and go back to using your sulfate-free products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 2/5 because it does what it is promised to do but the dryness is a problem for me, but I am learning what to do and what not to do, while using this product. It has helped me a lot with hair health and care. But this product certainly is not for me. I am disappointed to spend so much time to research and have the promising result and the &amp;#34;softness&amp;#34; on my hair as the product as advertised but on the bright side, I am learning more and more about MY hair and care for it as well as helping it naturally grow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Egypt i have wavy soft thin hair, i bought this shampoo and conditioner from internet store sunset and beauty hoping my hair grow longer but the surprise is i lost %60 from my hair after the second used it made my hair lost like crazy super dry and frizzy, when i taken my shower and washed my hair i found pieces of hair at the bathroom  all my body cover hair at this time i do not believe the Scene, also my mother tried it and she lost her hair, I paid more than $1000 hair products, vitamins  and doctors consultation to treat my hair, i contacted the nisim international from youtube the support said to me you will return it but unfortunately i can&#x27;t because i will pay to the ups shipping about $220, finally i cleaned my bathroom with this shampoo the smell really good. do not buy this very bad product you will loss your hair and money. trust me.</li>
    <li> I used this for maybe 2 weeks. I contacted the company and they said I should lose hair for a week then it should stop. That is not what happened. I had beautiful on hair and wants it longer and this product thinned my hair and each strand. Even after almost 2 years my hair is still not back to what it use to be and may never will be according to the doctors. I have been in all kinds of vitamins and doing natural treatments to try to get my hair back to half of it&#x27;s prior health. This was a horrible experience!</li>
    <li> I dont use it everyday, i havent noticed a remarkable difference either,also it doesnt have a great smell, my co worker uses it and you can tell it works great for her though. Only time will tell, dont we all wish we could buy a miraculous hair growth cream that works in minutes... I havent measured my hair yet, and i cut it last week to get rid of all the real fried ends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing my hair growth 2 inches just one month I&#x27;m using twice a week</li>
    <li> Ive been trying to grow my hair out but it grows very slow. Since using this shampoo &amp; conditioner, I immediately noticed my hair getting longer. It&#x27;s growing about twice as fast as usual.  It does seem a little dry some days but it&#x27;s been healthy, shiny and strong, with no split ends. I use a conditioning mask once a week or so to regain moisture . I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it really does what it says on the bottle the only thing is it will dry your hair out but i just give myself a hot oil treatment after every use to restore the moisture which also helps the hair grow too</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. My hair keeps growing. I do not put the shampoo on my hair ends because it makes it like straw. I use the shampoo only on the hair on my head. I put a couple of drops of the conditioner in my hands and message it into the ends and leave it there after I rinse out the conditioner. This makes my hair feel and look great.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  I would definitely buy it again.  Her hair looks healthier too.</li>
    <li> I took my teenaged daughter to my hair stylist to have her hair trimmed no more than 1 inch.  I watched in horror as about 4 inches were lopped off one side.  The rest of her hair had to be shortened to match the short side.  She cried, and cried and was furious at me.  She used Fast shampoo and conditioner for about a year, and her hair is longer than it was when I took her for the trim.</li>
    <li> I love FAST&lt;br /&gt;My hair even feels healthier. I wish it was cheaper since it does go so fast.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to shampoo twice, What I&#x27;ve learned is to do this, but watered down.&lt;br /&gt;The first shampoo should just be one pump, a small amount to rub just onto your scalp. This clears the way for the second shampoo, which I use two pumps [half dollar size].. [If you do only one shampoo and then one conditioner I find the results are not the same as when you double shampoo].&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is also VERY light that I use it as a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Almond Oil [100% organic] to help my hair grow. Who knows if any of our tricks actually work. All I know is that my hair, and scalp are the healthiest they have ever been.</li>
    <li> I be used this product years ago and it definitely works not only does it help with hair growth and hair length but also with hair loss caused by stress or chemicals and promotes volume and strentghning of the hair follicle.</li>
    <li> I started using this on 1/23/13, so its been 2 weeks. I am using it on myself and my 3 daughters. We did experience softer, thicker and longer hair of about 1/4 inch. All I can say is that you need to use a good conditioner along with this product. It will not affect the performance of the product at all. Apply the F.A.S.T  to the roots and the other conditioner to the rest of your hair. If you are AA like myself then you don&#x27;t want to use everyday but every other day. Also use a leave in conditioner along with your favorite oils such s coconut, argan oil. promise your hair will not dry out. Keep the blow dryer on low. In addition drink plenty of water, your hair will thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner for 2 months and my hair grow 3 inches!! I am glad i bought this set..Thanks to who ever invented this prouduct :)</li>
    <li> i have soft wavy,curly hair this product works wonders for me i love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> these items are my second time ordered. i think when i wash my hairs with &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34;, feel fresh, cool&lt;br /&gt;so good....</li>
    <li> I dye my hair every 30 days like clockwork because it has grown 1/2 inches.  I can easily see the line where the new growth has come in.  I used this the first month, trying to wash as often as possible.  By 2 1/2 weeks I had to dye it because it had already grown 1/2 inch.  After coloring my hair for 20 years, I know exactly how much my hair grows, and I can say without a doubt it grew faster that month.  The second month, I didn&#x27;t wash as often.  I just don&#x27;t have the time every day.  It still grew more than normal, but not as much as the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this didn&#x27;t make it grow faster, my hair has never looked better.  I have heard people complaining that it dries out their hair, but mine is so soft!  SO much fuller and the curls are well defined.  My husband even commented that my hair looked fuller.  I haven&#x27;t found a shampoo that has worked so well on my hair.  I have never been able to rub conditioner on my scalp for fear of weighing down my hair.  Not so with this - I work both the shampoo and conditioner into every part of my hair and scalp for at least a minute each.  I love this stuff - went through the bottles and ordering my second batch.  Hoping this will help people, because I know I read 100+ reviews before I bought it.</li>
