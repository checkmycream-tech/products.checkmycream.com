### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works the best out of all dandruff treatment products I have tried for over 25 years.  </li>
      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>Love this product !!</li>
      <li>Very nice product  </li>
      <li>Glad I found this product!</li>
      <li>and I like the smell of the cream others don&#x27;t to each their own</li>
      <li>LIKED SHAMPOO.</li>
      <li>MY head kept drying and more flakes would come.</li>
      <li>I have dandruff in my eyebrows, but the shampoo didn&#x27;t work any better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for about 2 months now and my scalp is as healthy as ever.</li>
      <li>My mother who has spent years helping me treat my hair is soooo impressed!!!</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it worked like magic!</li>
      <li>The shampoo was a disaster for my fine hair and made no noticeable difference.  </li>
      <li>Must use the shampoo though and every thing else is smooth sailing for m there.</li>
      <li>This product is really worth a try!</li>
      <li>And special thanks to the beautician that told me about this, you has saved my hair!!!</li>
      <li>If you have dandruff please buy worth the money..</li>
      <li>Stopitt Shampoo never dries your scalp and it makes your hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t claim the cream is good or bad for removing dandruff,  but it worked great as girlfriend repellant.</li>
      <li>Also - use it consistently</li>
      <li>I do use the pommade stuff every day and it&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t get crispy like gel or oily like some other hair dressings and waxes.  </li>
      <li>i recommend buying the cream also especially if your scalp easily builds up.</li>
      <li>but much improvement has been noted.  </li>
      <li>Unlike some others this really does work as it says.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying this product because I def couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
      <li>and I think that makes almost as much of a difference as the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is really drying but as long as you follow up with a moisturizing conditioner it should be fine</li>
      <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well, so I tended to use more than I would&#x27;ve used for other shampoos.</li>
      <li>This product is the best and is for anyone who has a bad dandruff problem.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try because of the long lasting effect it has, will definitely buy more when my 1st order is finished.</li>
      <li>is that I which the Stoppit treatment was clear.</li>
      <li>WHEN I OPENED PACKAGE OUTER-SIDE OF CONDITIONER COMPLETELY CRACKED THROUGH.</li>
      <li>I spent so much money and felt like I had nothing else to lose</li>
      <li>However, this is the only product that has completely eradicated dandruff in my experience - and I&#x27;ve tried literally every single product out there.</li>

<li> for such a long review, but I hope this helps!</li>
<li> I had more dundruff after using it,,, really bad</li>
<li> Scalp treatment works as expected.</li>
<li> that makes it work unlike other products.</li>
<li> use the shampoo about every other day, and just dunk my head in the shower in between.  </li>
<li> I did buy one of those little blue round brushes for working the shampoo all the way down to my scalp</li>
<li> Some things worked a little bit and several things actually made the condition worse.  </li>
<li> I havent even used half the bottle and my dandruff has not reappeared.</li>
<li> I still have a few flakes</li>
<li> The medicated grease I have to mix with green grease bc.</li>
<li> Never have i had a product that literally within a few days took all my dandruff away.</li>
<li> Shampoo seemed a bit weak, not lathering as expected.</li>
<li> after 3 times of use my dandruff is gone no more flakes</li>
<li> I checked the label and didn&#x27;t see any ingredients out of the ordinary</li>
<li> No more itching, and no more embarrassing flakes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff and scalp infections due to it this stuff actually got rid of it completely, not sure if it works for everyone</li>
<li> However, recently it was at its worse and I tried everything, all the anti dandruff shampoos, organic( expensive) shampoos,tea rinses ,oils, not washing my hair ( which I don&#x27;t recommend ), Apple cider vinegar</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick and its works well!!</li>
<li> I have had very bad flaky dandruff for a long time on and off.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ever seen this product in stores and the labeling looks weird</li>
<li> The cream may work, why I gave 2 stars instead of 1, but it smelled bad.</li>
<li> I tried it a couple of times and no noticeable change, but my girlfriend and I both hated the medicinal smell.</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have very bad dandruff,  </li>
<li> I hope it works as described because I have terrible dandruff.</li>
<li> And the biggest plus is it does not smell awful!  </li>
<li> If you suffer from horrible, unmanageable dandruff, like I do, do yourself a favor and get this.</li>
<li> and I suffer from a horrible case of seborrhea.  </li>

    <li> I had more dundruff after using it,,, really bad</li>
    <li> It has not work for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;I still have hope but I&#x27;ve been y song it for a week with no results.</li>
    <li> after 3 times of use my dandruff is gone no more flakes</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and after a month she says she still has dandruff and the medictaed cream just turns her hair and scalp white.</li>
    <li> My scalp is a lot clearer since using Stopitt Medicated Shampoo.  I still have a few flakes but much improvement has been noted.  Glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> Very nice product  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Unlike some others this really does work as it says.If you are looking for a product to stop dandruff then this is it.</li>
    <li> I just want to start off by saying this product has given me back my peace of mind. I have had very bad flaky dandruff for a long time on and off. However, recently it was at its worse and I tried everything, all the anti dandruff shampoos, organic( expensive) shampoos,tea rinses ,oils, not washing my hair ( which I don&#x27;t recommend ), Apple cider vinegar rinse(that worked for a while but it came back). I spent so much money and felt like I had nothing else to lose so I decided why not. I have been using this for about 2 months now and my scalp is as healthy as ever. No more itching, and no more embarrassing flakes. This product is really worth a try! The shampoo is really drying but as long as you follow up with a moisturizing conditioner it should be fine and I like the smell of the cream others don&#x27;t to each their own but you have to rub it in so that your not left with white specks in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for such a long review, but I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet I hope it works as described because I have terrible dandruff. Will try it out before the week is out</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this but it took care of my dandruff. I use the shampoo and cream as directed and haven&#x27;t seen a flake since and I suffer from a horrible case of seborrhea.  I checked the label and didn&#x27;t see any ingredients out of the ordinary so I&#x27;m trying to figure out what&#x27;s in it that makes it work unlike other products. I&#x27;ve ever seen this product in stores and the labeling looks weird but it works and that&#x27;s all that matters.  If you suffer from horrible, unmanageable dandruff, like I do, do yourself a favor and get this.</li>
    <li> WHEN I OPENED PACKAGE OUTER-SIDE OF CONDITIONER COMPLETELY CRACKED THROUGH. I USED TWICE AND MY SCALP STONG FOR OVER AN HOUR. LIKED SHAMPOO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff since I was in middle school and I&#x27;ve tried all the different shampoos and conditioners and experimented with different schedules, every day to every three days, changing my pillow case every night, etc.  Some things worked a little bit and several things actually made the condition worse.  I even had dandruff when I had a buzz haircut.  I&#x27;ve never had anything that worked so completely and reliably and also required so little extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the shampoo about every other day, and just dunk my head in the shower in between.  I do use the pommade stuff every day and it&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t get crispy like gel or oily like some other hair dressings and waxes.  I&#x27;ve got medium-short hair (for a guy) but I&#x27;ve had shoulder length hair too and it worked the same.  I did buy one of those little blue round brushes for working the shampoo all the way down to my scalp and I think that makes almost as much of a difference as the shampoo.  I&#x27;ve even noticed that since I don&#x27;t have the flakes or grease in my hair, the rest of my skin has improved as well.  Unless something else comes along, I plan to be a life-long customer.</li>
    <li> Love this product !! This was the only thing that stop my dandruff from coming back... I&#x27;ve been to numerous doctors and try numerous product but this was the only things that work !! If you have dandruff please buy worth the money.. The medicated grease I have to mix with green grease bc. It&#x27;s thick and its works well!!</li>
    <li> I gave this stuff 3 stars because my hubby swears by this stuff and his dandruff is gone. This did not work for me and I don&#x27;t have severe dandruff. I didn&#x27;t see a difference but as stated, hubby thinks this a miracle cure!</li>
    <li> This product is the best and is for anyone who has a bad dandruff problem.  You want regret it.  Please don&#x27;t stop making this produce.  The only compliant  I have is that I which the Stoppit treatment was clear.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything it stated. I still have flakes and the itching.  I will definitely never buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every dandruff shampoo on the market and nothing seemed to work. Until I found this gem!! Works instantly!!</li>
    <li> Shampoo seemed a bit weak, not lathering as expected. Scalp treatment works as expected. Reduced flakes to date.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have very bad dandruff,  I have dandruff in my eyebrows, but the shampoo didn&#x27;t work any better than Head and Shoulders. The cream may work, why I gave 2 stars instead of 1, but it smelled bad. I tried it a couple of times and no noticeable change, but my girlfriend and I both hated the medicinal smell. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well, so I tended to use more than I would&#x27;ve used for other shampoos. My thoughts are it&#x27;s just Head n Shoulders in a medical looking bottle. I can&#x27;t claim the cream is good or bad for removing dandruff,  but it worked great as girlfriend repellant. I just shave my head now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff for years and this worked within 2 weeks. however , the shampoo and cream go hand in hand.</li>
    <li> Never have i had a product that literally within a few days took all my dandruff away. Ive tried every dandruff product in walmart and nothing worked. MY head kept drying and more flakes would come. Stopitt Shampoo never dries your scalp and it makes your hair feel soft and healthy. I havent even used half the bottle and my dandruff has not reappeared. This is literally your stop to looking for shampoos for dandruff and visits to the dermatologist. i recommend buying the cream also especially if your scalp easily builds up.</li>
    <li> Both products have to be used together to work. It&#x27;s a pain to use the cream (the smaller bottle) because you have to scratch your existing dandruff off. Also - use it consistently, otherwise dandruff returns (unless that&#x27;s just me). However, this is the only product that has completely eradicated dandruff in my experience - and I&#x27;ve tried literally every single product out there.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, it worked like magic! It has been the ONLY product I have ever used and it works! My mother who has spent years helping me treat my hair is soooo impressed!!! Must use the shampoo though and every thing else is smooth sailing for m there. Thanks Amazon for carrying this product because I def couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. And special thanks to the beautician that told me about this, you has saved my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Execellent it does the job</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all for itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> To keep it simple - neither product worked for me at all.  The shampoo was a disaster for my fine hair and made no noticeable difference.  The scalp treatment cream didn&#x27;t help one bit and the &amp;#34;Pamper&amp;#34; smell was almost unbearable.  On to the next product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff and scalp infections due to it this stuff actually got rid of it completely, not sure if it works for everyone but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try because of the long lasting effect it has, will definitely buy more when my 1st order is finished. Tip cut hair as low as possible before use apply cream to scalp leave for an hour or so then rinse off with shampoo, this method worked for me</li>
    <li> Works the best out of all dandruff treatment products I have tried for over 25 years.  One treatment last for weeks.  And the biggest plus is it does not smell awful!  But the downside is the cream sticks to your scalp.  I&#x27;ll take that white scalp over a stinky one.</li>
