      <li>You just push a button and the cord easily retracts back inside.</li>
      <li>BUT I certainly would recommend to a friend.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 90 year old mother, she says its a great hair dryer, loves that it has 3 settings (low, med. high), and that the handle folds, and has retractable cord, also not loud.</li>
      <li>Only reason it did not get a 5 star is that the retracting cord does not retract all the way making it a bit cumbersome to fit the 8-10&amp;#34; of cord not retracted into the tighter space.  </li>
      <li>It is fast - drying and the folding feature</li>
      <li>My headline really sums up my feelings.  </li>

      <li>Hands down, this blow dryer is superior to any crappy brands being sold at big box stores or pharmacies.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this hairdryer. I found it in a hotel in Houston and had to have one for my own. It blows at a great temperature--just hot enough but not so hot as to burn you--but is very fast due to the high velocity of air it outputs from the dryer. This is the fastest (and best) dryer I have owned.</li>
    <li> An excellent dryer, but heavier than most. The retractable cord is a great feature, but adds to the weight.</li>
    <li> I first used this hairdryer at a hotel. It is definitely one of the best hairdryers I have ever owned. It is small and compact, and folds nicely. It also has a retractable cord, which is a huge bonus. As far as drying goes, this dryer did a great job on my hair. I have thick, coarse hair that is about shoulder-length. The airflow is excellent, and this dryer shaved at least five minutes off my normal drying time. It is also surprisingly quiet (as quiet as a hairdryer can be), even on the high speed. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best folding hair dryer on the market as tested by travelers with thick hair that holds water ... We love this and amongst us nothing is it&#x27;s equal.  It&#x27;s compact and powerful ... I have one at home now, too since it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my (admittedly oversized) medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Love the foldability/retractable cord.  Good heat/air flow.</li>
    <li> Stayed at a hotel in Orlando, Florida and they provided this hair dryer for their guests.  It dryed my hair quickly and the dryer was so light.  When I got home and returned to the heavy dryers I had, just had to find a dryer like the one in Florida.  Called the hotel and they gave me the name and went to Amazon...and there it was.  Cannot tell you how thrilled I am with the purchase.  Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer at a resort, so I came home and ordered it. Ilove its compact size and the retractable cord. It has three speeds--not a hair dryers do, so I like that feature also. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is nice and pretty much what I wanted. It is a little bulkier than other hair dryers BUT I certainly would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Miss the Cool Shot feature of my cheaper dryer, don&#x27;t feel like it gets as hot either.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with Hospitality hair dryer while staying at a boutique hotel in Ashville, NC. This is same model/wattage and the retractable cord is so handy. Not heavy or excessively loud.  My hair looks professionally blown out with this model. Hands down, this blow dryer is superior to any crappy brands being sold at big box stores or pharmacies.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever used and I am 74 years old.. Love the retractable cord and all speeds are accurately labeled with temperature and  air flow,  rarely experienced with other hair dryers.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer.  First used it at a hotel and was finally able to locate one online.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer while on vacation last week.  I thought it was amazing.  It dried my hair faster than all the hair dryers I have used over the years.  This model was as good as the professional one used by my hairdresser. I ordered one as soon as I returned home.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer.  It is fast - drying and the folding feature allows me to put it in tighter quarters without using a whole drawer to store!  Only reason it did not get a 5 star is that the retracting cord does not retract all the way making it a bit cumbersome to fit the 8-10&amp;#34; of cord not retracted into the tighter space.  Otherwise, good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairdryer. My wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, just the right speed and temperature to do your hair. Best hair dryer I have owned, beats out the dryers I have paid almost $200 for.</li>
    <li> Bought this hairdryer after using one in a Hotel. Love it, works well just like your hairdressers in the salon</li>
    <li> Used it at a hotel and had to have one. This is the best hair dryer I have ever used. Dries fast cuts drying time in half, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy. Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Works well and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hearing when using it.  Shipped quickly.  Stores well and electrical cord recoil is cool.</li>
    <li> I first tried this at a Marriott and loved the hidden cord.  I&#x27;m tired of multiple cords on my counter.  The speed is great as is the power.  It dries my hair faster that my old drier.</li>
    <li> I like the size of the dryer it&#x27;s perfect for what I need the only problem that I had with it was the court did not go all the way back into the handle of the mat it&#x27;s it would be a five star rating for me thank you</li>
    <li> First used this dryer at an Orlando Hilton resort.  Although the blowing power is intense, the heat factor is less than ideal.  This would be a 5-star if I had thinner hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast, easy, less noise and whine than any other I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> There are not 3 levels of heat. There ARE 3 levels of blowing air, but I wish the heat was different. Not what I expected. I do like the retractable cord for the convenience of storage. I&#x27;ve used the dryer for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> My headline really sums up my feelings.  If I took the manufacturer&#x27;s settings and translated them into plain English, I would say this thing has two modes: hurricane and arctic.  What I mean by that is that it gravitated for me between being too cool (i.e. not warm enough to dry my hair) or too strong.  I honestly felt I was in a windstorm.  There are better dryers out there (I now own a Babyliss myself.)</li>
    <li> I also used this hair dryer in a hotel first.  I even called the front desk and asked if I could purchase it but they wouldn&#x27;t let me.  I looked it up online and purchased it on Amazon.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Birthday present for the wife after she used one at a hotel. Drys in half the time and stores easily.</li>
    <li> Very nice, powerful. It is a bit on the heavy side, but seems durable. It doesn&#x27;t get blistering hot like some hairdryers, that is a GOOD thing. I am not a huge fan of retractable cords, but this one seems well made, albeit a bit short.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing I don&#x27;t love about this hairdryer! Found it while traveling and couldn&#x27;t wait to make it my own. No regrets.</li>
    <li> Great amount of air flow. Could be a little hotter though. Overall, not a bad hair dryer. Very light and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Quality unit….does not have heat settings , but ok for me…3 speeds….folds and retracts nicely</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in half the time as my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The products were of the quality that I expected.  They will be given as Christmas presents.Good quality and good prices.</li>
    <li> Used one of these in a hotel and liked it so much we came home and ordered one.  It was delivered quickly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this long.  I bought it primarily for the retractable cord which works great.  Blow dryer is strong and not too noisy.</li>
    <li> Used this at a hotel and had to have it!  Best hair dryer I ever used.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this little hair dryer. I have thick, wavy hair and I need a powerful hair dryer to dry it. This is very powerful, more so than my at home hair dryer. I love the retractable cord. Easy for traveling. I weighed it on my kitchen scale and it weighs just slightly over 1 1/4 pounds. I thought it would weigh more. A good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 90 year old mother, she says its a great hair dryer, loves that it has 3 settings (low, med. high), and that the handle folds, and has retractable cord, also not loud.</li>
    <li> Purchased based on reviews and two features:  folding handle and retracting cord.  Useful in the home and for travel. Performs as advertised and rated.</li>
    <li> I first used this dryer in a hotel.  I was so impressed I tracked it down on the Internet.  Get it, you will love it!</li>
    <li> I researched many dryers before I bought this one for her as a Christmas present. She loves it. I asked her why, and she said it is light weight and easy to maneuver, has three speeds as well as a retractable cord. It seems well made, and hopefully should last a long time.</li>
    <li> The dryer is nicely  compact when it&#x27;s folded. I like the retractable cord, which makes it even easier to store or travel with. My only complaint is that there&#x27;s only one switch for &amp;#34;Low, Medium, High&amp;#34;. I would prefer if it had separate temperature and speed controls. I went with this rather than another compact dryer with those controls because of the good reviews. I can say that this is really well built.</li>
    <li> My wife used this dryer at a Hilton resort and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if Amazon carried the product. They did, and she states no other dryer in all the years she&#x27;s used them have worked as well as this brand and model. If you don&#x27;t have it, buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer based on reviews from other buyers.  I don&#x27;t  know if the company has changed the product or if the people who raved about the product had never owned a decent dryer, but I was very disappointed.  First, it is difficult to hold because of a squared handle.  Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t have much power.  And third, it stopped working in less than 2 months - just died.  I would not recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve used. Light weight and dries hair fast.</li>
    <li> I first saw and used this hair dryer in a resort we were staying at.  I loved the fact that it had a retractable cord because I was always getting mine at home tangled.  You just push a button and the cord easily retracts back inside. No longer do I have to unplug and untwist the cord every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother-in-law.  She loves the retractable cord feature and that it folds for easy storage.  The only negative is that the weight isn&#x27;t exactly light if you&#x27;re using it as a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer, but it does seem very well-made and works very well!</li>
    <li> I did a bit of research on the web to get a good price. This does look to be similar to the ANDES product with the same features, but the Sunbeam Hospitality is the dryer I have. I chose this based on 1)Retractable Cord (am using with the Stowaway tray and wanted to be able to adjust the cord length so it didn&#x27;t get caught in the cupbaord when closing) 2) Tourmaline 3) Not too gigantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much chunkier and larger than I anticipated from the photo, but not enough to annoy me - mainly becuase this is one of the FASTEST dryers I have ever used. Seriously.. And, added bonus, the sound is not obnoxiously high-pitched. My hair is dry in like 4 minutes. With my older hair dryer(s) ...usually after 10mins I stop drying and I have \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; dry hair... with this, I have it on for 4-5 mins and it is completely dry! Love it! You should buy one!</li>
