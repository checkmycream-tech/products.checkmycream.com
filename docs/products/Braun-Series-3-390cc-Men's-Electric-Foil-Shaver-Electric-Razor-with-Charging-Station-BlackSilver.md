<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really no different than any of the 7 series.</li>
    <li> Packing sound, shaving is very quiet. The packaging looks very high-grade, workmanship is very good. Very satisfied! But the voice is a little big.</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave and like it better than my other one.  Seems more natural way to shave.........</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  He had one like before and wanted another just like it!!  He likes the closeness of the shave and the easy cleaning process!!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this shaver</li>
    <li> My old Braun shaver is so old I cannot remember not having it, and it would still be working if I had not tried to clean it under the beard trimmer. Something plastic broke in there, finally, and I needed another shaver. The old one had lasted so long and done so well that I went back to Braun on Amazon to see what they had now in the same line. The new model seemed similar at first, but with two important differences: the beard trimmer was separate from the razor head, with a completely different slider that apparently cannot trap whiskers under it like the old one; the cleaning system, though bulky, automatically keeps the razor clean and charged. I was a little taken aback when I discovered that there was no hard protective cover for the razor head, which I always used for traveling, keeping the razor so protected and its brush in a soft traveling case. However, this one comes in a hard protective case for the razor and charging cord, which should serve well for any trip. I&#x27;m pleased, to say the least.</li>
    <li> Very convenient&lt;br /&gt;shaves much better and faster than my previous shaver.</li>
    <li> all works well still adjusting it a little</li>
    <li> A very high quality shaver as would be expected from Braun.</li>
    <li> Great value for item that arrived in a timely manner. Perfect if you&#x27;re looking for a gift for guy for birthday/holiday. Mine loves it!</li>
    <li> I just bought Braun 390cc-4 shaver. After i opened the box and charged it fully, it came to my notice that product is faulty. one of the charging lights is dead. Now amazon won&#x27;t take an open box back and when I contacted the braun customer service number 1-800-272-8611, they ask you to pay for shipping to service center for repair. Braun sell cheap quality products for hundred dollar and we have to pay for shipping back. That was the one of the worst customer service I have seen.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is evidently a favorite with my son. It is just that I should not have ordered it online. My son wanted a replacement razor for his already Braun charger and cleaner. He loves the Braun razor but if I had known I was getting the whole thing again I would have gotten the 5 Series. Once it came and I realized this I wanted to return it however because it is rechargeable I could not. I am usually more careful about buying things I cannot return online so I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband, based on my son&#x27;s recommendation. My husband loves it, says it shaves well and it is nice having the cleaning system right there for instant use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver! His last one, same model but older design, lasted him a number of years before finally biting the dust. It&#x27;s a quality product and user-friendly, though, so he was thrilled to replace it with this newer rendition of the tried and true model he&#x27;s come to rely on. Got to love the self-cleaning feature!</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and don&#x27;t rely on an electric razor for daily use. This one provides an acceptable shave and can be cleaned by running the head under the tap.</li>
    <li> My German made Braun Activator was on its last legs, having served my face faithfully for 8 years. So I bit the bullet and bought a 390CC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box I found it a handsome tool and the slim shape felt comfy in the hand. And, yes, it shaved my medium to light beard like a champ and was much quieter than my old Activator. In fact, the shave was so close my face felt a little \\&quot;skinned\\&quot; and I had to adjust the closeness setting down a notch. I liked the semi-rigid travel case (looks like a nylon sun glass case) a lot more than the old hard plastic one that came with the Activator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge base worked well but was a more basic model than I used with my Activator--no LCD or dry cycle--but the cleaning cycle did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the 390CC gave up the ghost after only 10 days of once a day use. And right in my middle of my trip to Vegas! It began by randomly turning on and off while in the case (not in the cleaning base). After a day of that, it could not be turned off--on-off switch did nothing--and the battery was drained dry. When I arrived home a couple days later--unshaven I might add--I put it in the charge base but it would no longer accept a charge. This 390CC is made in China and obviously suffered from a lack of quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this situation is Amazon&#x27;s wonderful return policy. A couple clicks and I had a UPS mail label and that dirty dog was out the door. I bought a made-in-Germany 565CC to replace it and am a clean shaven happy camper.</li>
    <li> This is a real let down after having a much better Braun shaver. That is all one could possibly say.</li>
    <li> Of all the electric razors he has used, my hubby likes this the best.</li>
    <li> Razor is nice and does shave very smooth. But the charger not so much. It automatically tries to clean it every time you try to put on and try to charge it. It wastes a lot of the cleaning solution and if you don&#x27;t use the solution often, it will evaporate quickly as it doesn&#x27;t keep in sealed once installed to the charger. But other than that, it is fine. I just don&#x27;t buy the solution to clean my razor anymore and just manual clean it.</li>
    <li> The shaver works good.  However, the slide to push the beard trimmer is not easy to use.  It&#x27;s not as intuitive as the old one I had.  You really have to concentrate when you slide the trimmer.  The slide lacks proper features for your thumb to &#x27;grip&#x27; on to.  The overall feel of this shaver is kind of cheap.</li>
    <li> Braun is always the best</li>
    <li> I just bought it for my grandpa as a gift, he just loves it and it&#x27;s what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for about a week and so far im really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m upgrading from a norelco 8020x. To tell you the truth I was never really impressed with it and never got a nice close shave like I wanted. I just figured thats how the world of electrics went. Boy was I wrong. This shaver works perfectly for me. After my first shave with it I was impressed. No one little hair missed. Usually with the norelco I would go about my day and and then feel that one hair that had somehow avoided previous shaves. Words cant describe how happy I am that I can get a close shave with out cutting my face up. The cleaning system is neat however It lacks the ability to just charge. Heres my pros and cons of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Build Quality- The shaver it self just feels right and that it was built to last.&lt;br /&gt;-Close Shave- Like I said before this shaver has accomplished everything I want and everything my norelco couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;-Charging Lights- Its nice to see exactly how much battery I have left just in case I forget to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning Light- Tells you when you should clean you shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The charging Cable slips out. This bothered me. The Cord has just enough resistance to with stand gravity but if u tap it, the cord falls right out. There really is no way to shave while its plugged in. The Cord is like a spring so the tension alone pulls it out. It really isn&#x27;t secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It Charges, cleans, disinfects, and lubricates all in one. Perfect for people like me who just want to shave and be done.&lt;br /&gt;-It Looks Pretty Good. Its Black with silver flakes. It also has a blue Led that lights up the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-No on and off button. There is a button on top that lowers the charging cable in place. However that also starts the cleaning. There is no way to charge the shaver in the bay without starting the cleaning sequence.&lt;br /&gt;-Loud. Its not a constant loud though. It goes thru a cycle. So it may only get loud2-3 times for a couple seconds.</li>
    <li> It gives me a close shave for a thick beard. This is also the 2nd Bruan shaver I have bought and they were both the same model. I hope this second one last longer than 4 years with daily use.</li>
    <li> My husband is enjoying his new shaver.</li>
    <li> The Braun 3Series shaver gives a real close shave and the clean up takes no time ay all. Haven&#x27;t enjoyed a electric shave like this one in a long time</li>
    <li> this turned out to be a great shaver for my husband! and it comes with a self cleaning system! Couldn&#x27;t have been better! shipped fast and received in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Its just right for him, just what he was looking for, and Its a good item went we go on vacation, I give it a 5 star. thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my series five which broke and was surprised it saves just as close and is much quieter a keeper.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly as described.  Exterior box was slightly damaged; however, the interior product looked fine.  Everything worked.  I&#x27;ve just started using my Braun shaver.  This review is from a dry shave perspective.  I love that the shaver is much quieter than my 4 year old Remington.  The shaver cuts very close; however, I believe it takes me longer to shave.  The recharging cord almost seems too lose; however, it works just fine.  All in all, it smaller, quieter, and I like it.  I&#x27;m watching the shave time, seemed to only last a week - maybe because it&#x27;s new and only charged once.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Had an old braun series three 350, the 390 is much better all around</li>
    <li> I did some price comparison at local stores and other websites before purchasing this. I purchased it at a great price. It arrived at a very respectable time frame. This shaver works a lot better job than the model just below this one that I owned. It lasted about 5 years before the trimmer broke from the screws it was attached to because of the constant vibration and use. When I read the reviews on this particular electric razor, it was recommended to use the cover for the Clean&amp;Renew when not in use. And clean the shaver once per week. By doing this, the cleaner would last longer. Great advice.</li>
    <li> I have been using an older version of the same Braun model and like it very much, so this felt like an easy choice.  The cleaner is a little different so they are not compatible, but the cord is the same. At this point, I would have to say the shave is closer than before, and seems less harsh, too.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchased this razor. I use it to shave my head and face. It works great.</li>
    <li> Works great nice smooth and comfortable shave. Vendor had very fast shipping. Product was exactly as described. Comes complete with charger cleaner and cleaning fluid.....</li>
    <li> Really great price and it was delivered right on time.....</li>
    <li> I love that you can take this right in the shower.  I have been using my razor in the shower since high school.  Now I can finally use my Braun in there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well made device, with a number of improvements over older models.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the cash on the other features (vibration and cooling).  I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> Close shave as advertised. The cleaning mechanism leaves the foil in clean and perhaps sterile condidtion for each shave. Razor block remained acceptable for clean and quick shave for at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaver. It was a good introductory shaver to get the feel for it. I later bought this same one for a few friends and family members for the holidays. I recently upgraded to the Series 7 which gives a super comfortable shave, but this one worked just fine to be honest. I approve.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Nov 18, 2014. The product arrived on time and in excellent condition. At first the 390CC-4 was a joy to use, and clean. After 7 months the cleaning station has stopped cleaning the shaver. It cycles normally, but the cleaning solution does not get to the shaver. After two calls to Braun and getting the you have to send it to a repair facility, I don&#x27;t know how I could recommend this product to anybody. I have a disability that doesn&#x27;t allow me to use a blade razor. If I have to send this out, I will have to purchase another electric shaver. It WILL NOT BE ANOTHER BRAUN PRODUCT!!!!  This is an update to my previous review. After a third call to Braun they sent me a free mobile shaver M90. I sent the 390CC-4 in for repair on June 26, it was was returned to me on July 1 all repaired. The M90 worked pretty good, but I am happy to have my 390 back. I will move give this product three stars.</li>
    <li> This has been a great shaver !!! I love the self cleaning of the shaver after you use it !!! Just put it in the holder and use it the next day !!! Recommend it highly !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought mine as a birthday gift for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It aren&#x27;t chip - around $110.&lt;br /&gt;The battery does not hold the charge. As soon as it is out of the charger, it does not work,&lt;br /&gt;and shows that battery is not charged. If you hook up the cord - it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. of course, has a perfect excuse to not to allow returning or even replacing it - it comes with the flammable liquid.&lt;br /&gt;(in the cleaning cartridge). No money back, no returns, no replacements nothing ;-(&lt;br /&gt;I guess not everything can be safely bought at Amazon, anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Watch carefully what you are buying at Amazon, even eBay returns and exchange items.&lt;br /&gt;I guess Amazon grew up to big to value little customers.&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of Sears 5 years ago. Where is Sears now ?...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very unhappy about my birthday gift that does not work and I stuck with it - thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Have a happy birthday to me with non working shaver.</li>
    <li> Has a tendency to scrape the skin under my lip, otherwise does a great job on the rest of my face. Does a better job than my old Braun which just stopped working after 8 years of steady service.</li>
    <li> Contrary to Amazon policy, when I tried to return this electric shaver, I was told this item was not returnable because it was a &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; material and could not be shipped by mail.  Funny since it was shipped to me by them!  They said the rechargeable battery was the reason it was designated a &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; material.  Nowhere on the website page for the shaver did it say this item was not returnable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a &amp;#34;discussion&amp;#34; with a customer service rep where I was not happy with the outcome I requested to speak to a supervisor.  The CS rep told,me that rather than talk to her supervisor she would just refund my money and that I could dispose of the shaver however I wanted to.  Sounds like I was not the first to complain about this item!</li>
    <li> Thought it was ok to use in shower but isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. I&#x27;ll never use a blade or a Norelco again!!</li>
    <li> sent me the wrong replacement blades.</li>
    <li> With a pretty good shave, but you need to be an engineer to figure out how to use the liquid cleaner.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product because it did not come as advertised. I was missing the protected cap for the blades. I&#x27;m unable to use the case that&lt;br /&gt;came with it when traveling because it want fit in my toiletry bag. I complained about this and a Braun rep told me it was not guaranteed to be&lt;br /&gt;in the box sense it comes with a carrying case.  How horrible is that because it was advertised in a video and the little protective cap is an accessory that&#x27;s  shown in the product manual of pieces I should have gotten. If I wanted it I was given a number by the Braun rep to order it. So I ordered it. I was charged $14.  I will never order a Braun product again. The liquid cleaner that comes with it I did not buy more. I add distilled water and alcohol together and replace it in the liquid container. I will not give them any more money because of the error they made. When the blades are not sharp any more I will not buy and replace the blades. This will be it for braun, I will toss it and go back to straight razors. This was my first and last electric razor. Braun made an ERROR adding the protective cap in there manual and can&#x27;t guarantee that the customers will actually get it. Maybe they should make this product in America so they can keep an eye on the parts and make sure that it&#x27;s included in orders. Now that I received the little protective cap that I had to purchase it fits perfectly in my toiletry bag. The cap is useful and needed.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Works pretty good. Could have included better instructions. Packaged and delivered adequately.</li>
    <li> Very nice product . I recommend  !</li>
    <li> Replaced an older one.  This one seems to be better built.</li>
    <li> This model does not shave as well as my 10 year Braun which died.  The trimmer is held by two small 90 degree plastic tabs and broke about 14 months into its use.  Also the on/off button is positioned where my thumb likes to sit while shaving and hence I turn it off from time to time while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not pleased with this model though I do particularly like Braun products.</li>
    <li> My existing Braun shaver was showing its&#x27; age.  The new 3 Series does exactly what I need.  What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> I have always been a Norelco customer and finally started to look for another product since the Norelco blades did not last nearly as long as in the past.  Also, the cost to replace the blades were about the cost of a new shaver.  I went with the Braun 390 cc-4 and have no regrets.  I especially the clean and renew feature.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun shaver for years. Decided to purchase a new one and very happy with this unit. Great close shave at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> when i buy any product online i always read a lot of the reviews and with this product was no different so after reading the usual 5 starts and some 1 stars i bought it  when it got here it look great it came with the stand that you can put the cleaning liquid in and it cleans it and lubricates it ( which has a really nice face feel) but it works great on a couple day scruff (but have not tried it on a full beard as i don&#x27;t have one) but the trimmer is amazing you could save your head with with absolutely no trouble. the shave is really really good my face is really smooth after a shave and have not cut myself with it or had any trouble with it it also comes with a nice semi-hard travel case which will be nice when i use it but overall i would recommend this to anybody who wants a really good razor or a decent price</li>
    <li> Broke after 7 months of use.</li>
    <li> Good shave, nice feel, easy to use and clean.  My beard is moderately heavy.</li>
    <li> best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor (Braun 390CC-4) in October of 2011.  The price then was about $120.  After many years of triple head Norelco this was my first foray into the world of foil razors.  I thought that since it was a Braun it would be high quality.  It has been an astonishing disappointment.  It has never given a clean or close shave, much less a comfortable one.  I have to scrub back and forth, up and down, and side to side for fifteen or so minutes just to get a mediocre shave and my face is left sore and raw.  I&#x27;ve resorted to smearing my face with oil just to reduce the friction.  Some neck whiskers it simply won&#x27;t cut and about every third shave I have to pop up the trimmer and trim them off with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual said that a new cutter head would be required after about 18 months, but I found that the OEM only lasted about 5 months before it required replacement.  At $20 apiece it works out to almost $40 per year in maintenance costs, which seems way too high to me. Perhaps it is made for thin, light, and soft whiskers, not a heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner/charger that comes with the razor works fine but takes a good deal of counter top space, so a cup with a bit of alcohol is much easier to deal with.  The razor can also be used in the shower which, when used with a sudsy face, can help avoid the skin burn from scrubbing your face with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that a company with Braun&#x27;s reputation for quality would sell this low quality item.  I should have been suspicious upon seeing that it was made in China.  Needless to say I&#x27;ll be ordering another new Norelco soon, and Braun will come off of our list of brands to buy.  I definitely do not recommend buying this razor.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this razor. Had not used an electric razor in over 30 years - they were never good he said.  Now, this one comes along - it shaves cleanly, caring for it is easy, and the cleaning option works perfectly. Such a great option over disposal razors!  You actually feel like you are doing something good for the environment!</li>
    <li> Pulls on the hair sometimes.</li>
    <li> I received my new razor in a very timely fashion from Amazon. It was simple to get set up and had it charging in no time. After letting it charge over night, I used it for the first time the following morning. Not only was this razor 3 times more quiet than my other simply by being on, it also made considerably less noise while cutting the hair. It was super smooth in operation and after several weeks of use, I have had zero skin irritation. It works very well, although like any other electric razor I have owned, I have to go over each area a couple of times to get the smoothest shave. The cleaner while in operation was also very quiet. The best thing I noticed about this razor is that the unit captures all of the cut hairs, leaving none on my shirt, nor on my counter. I have not had a razor that didn&#x27;t allow the cut hairs to fall out to some degree. The charge lasted almost an entire 3 weeks before I even noticed the motor slowing. I&#x27;m going to fully charge and then fully discharge (as opposed to charging after each use) a few times to get the most of the battery but to be honest, I can&#x27;t imagine I will ever be in a position where I need 2 or 3 weeks of shaving without being able to plug it in somewhere. The only thing I found unpleasant about this shaver is that I have a goatee and while shaving around it, the razor grabs on to the hairs of my goatee from time to time. Otherwise, I couldn&#x27;t be happier and highly recommend the 3 series 390CC-4</li>
    <li> I had this razor for almost 2 years. The battery is now dead and I&#x27;ve tried everywhere to find a replacement to no avail. For the money I paid for this it sure seems like it should have lasted longer. This was my first electric and I was unimpressed. It was convienient but I had to shave twice a day rather than once with a blade razor. I guess it&#x27;s back to the blade for me. Much closer shaves, only have to shave once a day and MUCH less costly.</li>
    <li> I love the razor.....Lasts forever on a charge and makes cleaning up a breeze! It&#x27;s 100% better than the Braun battery travel razor I had been using. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Like it very much. Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair like id like. But Still very nice.</li>
    <li> It does a pretty good job. It has a cleaning station included. I still clean it first manually. Shave pretty well, I think the trimmer could be a little better.</li>
    <li> this is absolutely the best electric shaver that I have ever owned, good close shaves and no discomfort after, love it</li>
    <li> Much better shaver than the other ones he has.</li>
    <li> As a long-term electric and Braun user, this shaver has definitely met all my expectations for performance and ease of use.</li>
    <li> The complete fittings quality is great with very convenient handle is also very good charging time very quickly After use feeling very smooth face almost feel the presence of beard The shape of the charging dock no good-looking 590 cc</li>
    <li> this razer gives a very close shave. every one should have one I love how its always and fully charged</li>
    <li> I received this razor for Christmas and the quality is not what it used to be. The Braun razors are no longer made in Germany, they are made in China.  I have been using Braun razors for about 25 years and this is the cheapest Braun razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing is made of cheap plastic and the power cord is short and does not stay plug in the razor.  The brush to clean the razor is really small and there is no cover for the  razor blades.  Also the traveling case is made of this really cheap fabric.  I am returning the razor and will be looking for another brand of razor since the only things that stay the same with Braun is the high price.</li>
    <li> No razor gives me a close shave without much serious effort.  It does a little less than I expected.  My old Braun shaver that I&#x27;ve had for about 10 years broke.  Thus I bought this one.  I thought it might do a little better than my old one but it seems to be about the same.  Tough beards like mine really need a sharp blade.</li>
    <li> Open the packing, pay the duties, very unhappy.</li>
    <li> A good unit, but not built as well as the Series 5--not likely to hold up as the 5Series, I fear.</li>
    <li> Received as a gift for Christmas.  Was expecting usual high quality from Braun as my 8000 series is over 10 years old.  First impression is it looks stylish, higher tech look than the 8000.  That&#x27;s where it ends.  It&#x27;s much lighter and that&#x27;s probably where all the quality went.  Unfortunately Braun decided to move mfg to China from Germany and it shows badly.  I tested it after being set up exactly per the instructions.  My 10 year old 8000 will still shave circles around this.  It was tough to shave close directly under my nose and on the sides my throat/neck.  Took many more passes and patience.  Shave was ultimately close but took far too long. Again a 10 yr old shaver beat this one hands down.  Poor lightweight Chinese quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type/brand of razor out there and I must say this shaver has been the best. I have sensitive skin and must shave on a daily basis. This shaver has been great thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;- cleaner works great&lt;br /&gt;- smooth, close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- does not get every hair around neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this model is so good, I can&#x27;t even imagine how great a higher series works!</li>
    <li> Owned a Braun years ago then switched to a Norelco based on price when it was time to replace my old Braun. Never did like the Norelco  so decided to go back to Braun. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in awhile.  This is a fantastic razor.  I used to get really bad razor burn with the Norelco even when new. My new Braun has been amazing.  No burning redness from razor burn and it gives a nice close shave.  The built in trimmer for side burns is great as well.  Haven&#x27;t used the disinfecting solution yet, so can&#x27;t comment on that.  I hesitated for a long time based on the price of Braun razors, but they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> a replacement that Amazon did for me when they did not have to. The razor works great and anyone using an electric razor should try this one.</li>
    <li> When I try to take it out of the holder the cleaning cycle starts which wets the head that over comes me with fumes</li>
    <li> Second use this type of razor, this type of high performance to price ratio, web design is reasonable. Shaving is very clean and convenient cleaning. Attached to the cleaning, charge is reasonable. A good product worth having.</li>
    <li> My husband previously owned a Braun shaver that he loved.  When it finally died, we purchased the 3Series model which was supposed to be a replacement for his old shaver.  He is NOT happy with the replacement, stating that the performance is poor and it does not give as close a shave.  A model upgrade is suggested for shoppers or maybe even a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Very light shaver and very quiet. Have been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good. Price is very good on Amazon compared to stores in my area.</li>
    <li> A great shaver. Provides a good close shave.  I purchased this to replace my previous Braun 3Series 390 which was starting to become old and the charge was lasting only a few days.  Tip:  I use the brush daily to clean out manually.  Then once a week I use the automatic cleaning system and put the lid back on the cleaning solution to prevent evaporation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a few hours and I already love it!  My last shaver lasted 15 years, but this one already feels more solid and offers a better shave than my old rotary shaver ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra money on this.  You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also adds a nice blue lighting to your bathroom, doubling as a futuristic night light.</li>
    <li> Good razor:  works well, shaves close, easy to use and easy to charge.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good razor, has a lot of room for improvement in the cleaning system, after a few cleanings, it is easy to change the cartridge, and the cleaner is good, but hair builds up in the &amp;#34;bowl/collection area&amp;#34;, I just received a new one for the holidays, and immediately noticed they are now made in China as opposed to my 2 year old Series 3 which was made in Germany. The new color scheme is good, and so far just as good as my old one was before the trimmer broke off. Next time I will buy the Series 5 or 7, but this is a solid razor and should give you a few years of use.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun Shaver.  They are sturdy, have an excellent cleaning system, and do a good job shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this product a five star rating is because there is nothing like an actual barber&#x27;s razor when it comes to shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since Christmas.  It takes a week or two for your face to adapt but now, yes, it gets a close shave even on my neck.  I used to use a blade and my neck would suffer if trying to get close.  This gets my neck with no burns or rash.  The head adjustment allows for one of the two to retract a bit to get under your nose properly.  The cleaning station surprised me a bit since it runs the razor while seated in it and bathes the blade with cleaning / lubrication solution.  Pretty enjoyable so far.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the product.  The old one I had included a heating element in the Clean &amp; Renew unit, but this one did not.  So I just needed to get used to taking the razor out of the Clean &amp; Renew unit to dry it.  Al Thompson</li>
    <li> Very good shaver if you need the \\&quot;clean cut\\&quot; appearance. With all Braun products, take atleast 2-3 weeks for your beard to adjust properly. This really doesn&#x27;t mean a whole lot looking back at the 6+ months of using this shaver. The downsides are, if you want to have a stubble look or even rock out like no shave november, this shaver doesnt help AT ALL. Do NOT buy unless you are the \\&quot;clean cut\\&quot; mechanic. You&#x27;ll find yourself using this tool sooner to hammer in nails than to attempt to give yourself anything other than the clean cut. Other than that, does fine. Cuts super close to the skin, baby smooth skin for me and my chin hairs are preettyyy thick. If your looking to clean cut every 4-5 days, this shaver will need about 2-3 passes over the skin, other than that look forward to shaving twice in the same day to get it ready for the day you want to be clean shaven. Cleans up superbly with the packaged cleaning center. never had a problem with clicking it in and giving it a 4-5 hour rinse. Fluid does run out faster than meets the eye. tend to the local bestbuy and inquire about the Braun cleaning fluid. Its better to buy than online.</li>
    <li> My last Braun was over 10 years old but was still working fine when I retired it. This new Braun is even better. The shave is absolutely blade close, its quieter and so is the cleaning base. If my last Braun is any indicator, this new shaver will keep on giving me great shaves for a very long time to come. Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> Thvery-very Good buy one....is the best shaver I have had bar none !!!</li>
    <li> It is very smooth, no pulling of my beard, and quiet. It was a great choice and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> shaver can trim down hair, but will not give you the closest shave. Could expect more for the money spent</li>
    <li> Still cant find an electric shaver that can replace a clean razor shave for a man with thick hair. Otherwise it&#x27;s one of the better ones we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> 10+ years ago I had a Braun Synchro, that I loved - it got me to convert totally to electric.  A few years back I lost it during a move, and didn&#x27;t have the money for a new Braun so I thought I&#x27;d try the Norelco 3-disc type razor - after fighting with that thing for 2 years I finally broke down and got a new Braun - so happy I did.  Same quality as my old Synchro, and works just as good or better (if that&#x27;s possible!).  As simple as they look, these things are far and away the best electric razors IMO.</li>
    <li> Just works...  I have thick facial hair and this is the first product that I have had that does the job.</li>
    <li> I would give it 3.5 stars. Works well, but I wish I could get a closer shave. The self cleaner is nice and seems to work well. Still requires some rinsing.</li>
    <li> I like it alot. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to clean it to charge it. Overall very pleased!</li>
    <li> I chose this shaver. It is a very good shaver for it&#x27;s price. It does every thing as it was advertised.</li>
    <li> The old man loves this</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Convenient and great for in-between blade shaves. Highly recommended and shipped quickly.  My husband says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s no straightedge razor but does give a nice shave for electric.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Better than I expected</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with Braun&#x27;s newest 3 series.  Price was good as well. Gives close shave with easy maintenance. Overall very satisfied with product--would recommend.</li>
    <li> This shaver is easy to use and gives a wonderful shave. I especially like the self cleaning feature. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in the performance of the Braun 3Series 390CC-4 Shaver.  Will sell at next garage sale.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement purchase for a unit that broke, so I liked its performance enough to get another!</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave. Keep up the good work Braun.</li>
    <li> I am 44 years old and this is my first electric shaver. I know, and yes I&#x27;ve been under a rock. This is a great product. I&#x27;ve had trouble with razor burn my entire life, didn&#x27;t matter what I used to shave with. This product leaves my face smooth (no stubble) with absolutely no razor burn at all. Anybody questioning a purchase, I assure you can by Braun products from Amazon with certainty and confidence. I&#x27;ve wanted an electric razor my whole life, because my grandfather had one, I finally bought one and I still feel joy before, during, and after, every shave. This product won&#x27;t let you down. Sounds weird, but there&#x27;s Heritage and tradition in shaving. I am pretty sure, your kids won&#x27;t cut their lips off using this razor. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> I have looked at Braun for several years.  The setup is easy, everything works as expected.  It looks like a great purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Shaver arrived \\&quot;Dead On Arrival\\&quot; DOA. Talked to Amazon representative who was great, polite and efficient. A replacement is promised to arrive in 1-day.  It is unfortunate the shaver did not work. Red light blinks when turned on, but will not charge. Will see if the replacement works better. 3 stars since Amazon service made up for the shaver that did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update*** The replacement shaver arrived from Amazon expedited as promised and works.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Amazon for amazing service.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Gives a great shave!!!&lt;br /&gt;Electric razor allows my husband to go a longer time without having to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> Performs well.  Easy to use and is everything I wanted in an electric razor.  Took care of my shaving irritation.</li>
    <li> Works great and at a pretty reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have been a life long Braun razor user and always liked their quality.  That said, I have to say the quality is gone now.  I had this razor for less than a year and was getting good shaves, had to replace the head once but that&#x27;s normal.  My beef is that the hardware itself fell apart!  First one of the tiny springs that allows one of the heads to move sprung and is now in the bowels of my bathroom somewhere.  Okay, it still worked so I continued using it.  Next I was using the trimmer and again a spring sprung!.  The whole trimmer assembly fell apart!  The design is still good but since its now manufactured in China the quality control is gone.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun razor. They just keep getting better!! Even better shave than my first Braun! Triple action head is a bonus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good razor, waterproof, gentle and effective just a hair harsh for my adam&#x27;s apple, other then that i love it.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> Does a exceptional job of shaving.  The cleaner stand helps keep the head clean and the blades from unusual wear.</li>
    <li> Great much better razor than the previous Braun series 5 razor I previously owned. Just wish it charged whenever it is put in cradle like the series 5 did. Also like the shape of this razor over the series 5. Really like that the head/blades move better to the contour of my face when shaving.</li>
    <li> Due to my sensitive skin and constant razor burn with manual razors, I bought my first electric shaver: The Braun Series 3 390cc-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gave me a really close shave and smooth skin as the advertisement says: Tough on beard, smooth on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for weeks now and the shaving experience is very enjoyable. No pulling and no skin irritation. For the first time, I have a really close shave above my lip. Before with a manual razor, my skin gets irritated after the second run through of the blade. Hence, the not-so-close shave. But now, thanks to the Braun&#x27;s SmartFoil(tm), a close shave is achieved with zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very ergonomic design that gives me a good hold of it while shaving. It really adds to the very fun experience of shaving. Plus, the shaving head can be remove for manual cleaning. I personally rinse it with warm water every after shave. Then, if its necessary, I use the cleaning station too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin facial hair, so I believe that the Series 3 is more than enough to take care of the stubble. I read a lot of reviews before buying this product and I think I made the right choice. I would have gotten the top-of-the-line Series 7 (awesome shaver!) but in my opinion it would be overkill for me because I can&#x27;t even grow a full beard. My facial hair is sparse - it grows unevenly. (Only sideburns, chin, neck and moustache). But don&#x27;t let this stop you from buying the Series 3. According to Braun&#x27;s website and their shaver recommendation, the Series 3 is a great shaver for those who are on the budget even if you have a thick facial hair. It will still deliver good results but I think it&#x27;ll require you to shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station, although not really a necessity, is a great feature that can clean and maintain the shaver. I use it once every week when I need to charge the shaver. It will also make the cleaning solution last longer. It is just unfortunate that the cleaningstation will charge and clean at the same time. Since the shaver is equipped with a Ni-MH battery, personally, I only charge the shaver if the battery is running low and from time to time, discharge the battery then charge it fully to lengthen its battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Braun provided us the charging cord compatible with both the shaver and cleaning station. Unlike the Philips Norelco shaver, the cord is only connected to the charging stand, which I believe is a hassle to bring around with you when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The semi-hard case is great for travelling! I brought it with me on trips and it&#x27;s a nice case that also low-profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver for those who are looking for their first shaver, for people who have thin facial hair or for someone who wants a high quality shaver without the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about electric shavers, you can visit: [...] (I got advice from the creator of the website. Great advice!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My dad saw the performance of the shaver and asked me to buy one for him. I purchased the 340s-4 for him because he wants something simple and without the cleaning station. So, I guess the 340s-4 is perfect for him. Plus, he can use it if he&#x27;s in the shower, which the 390cc-4, according the Braun, is unable to do.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever bought so I cannot compare it to anything like a Norleco or Philips product.  I do know that I am extremely pleased with the performace of the Braun Series 3 390cc-4 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very well constructed and feels very solid in your hand and the clean and renew dock/charger is pretty cool with a blue light that is bright enough to be a nightlight for your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performace is excellent as it gets ALMOST as close as a razor.  I doubt that ANY electric shaver will get as close as a new razor blad but it gets VERY close to the skin and I don&#x27;t feel any stubble at all when I&#x27;m done.  It is a little hard to shave the portion on your neck (and I&#x27;m not like a fat dude or anything with folds) and I sometimes have to keep going over the same spot to get all the hair/stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean and renew system is very nice and depending how often you shave it will last you a while. I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and haven&#x27;t even come close to having to buy a new cleaning solution cartridge.  The charge also lasts a long time, about 45-50 minutes per charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a really good electric shaver that I recommend if you have sensitive skin or are tired of taking out a second mortage on your house just to buy replacement blades for your Quattro or 5 blade gilette.  Really impressed.</li>
    <li> The shaver works great for what I need. I don&#x27;t need all the fancy lights, but I did get the one with a fancy cleaner. I have to say this is the best buy out of the 3 series. If you are on a budget and want something to speed up your time out the door than this baby is for you. Once I finish I just throw it into the cleaner and when I use it the next morning it is clean and ready to go! The cleaning solution is not badly priced either for the speed and without the hassle of taking it apart and brushing off the stubs and lubing up the blade. This one beats it for me when instead of doing all that you just throw it in the base and it does the rest.</li>
