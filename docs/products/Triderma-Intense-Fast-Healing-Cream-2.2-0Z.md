<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great came right when it said it would thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried Triderma.  I have been using it for 4 days now on several contusions and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product.  The product is packaged in a tube that is easy to squeeze and the cream can be easily applied.  I have noticed an improvement in the healing of my contusions for which I am pleased.</li>
    <li> My grandson got a burn, it was a really bad one. I received the cream and in one day it improved. Thank you for the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I literally sliced my finger tips off with a mandolin and this healing cream was my miracle.  I healed faster than what was expected.  I applied twice a day.  This is something that will forever be in my first aid kit.  I&#x27;ve been keeping it in my purse for any little scratch I get.  Its amazing.</li>
    <li> this was for my husband. he said it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This Healing Cream is very gentle to skin and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Recommending Triderma to anyone with a skin rash or sore.</li>
    <li> I feel like the quality of this product is decreased. Before this product used to heal my skin faster. Now  I have to apply a lot and takes little longer to heal. The cream is not absorbed quickly or easily, you have to rub it a lot.</li>
    <li> If you have eczema, you really need this, I have been using it for 1 month now and it really helps keep my eczema from crusting up and flaking it stays smooth, it also removes some of the redness.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with a very difficult to treat dermatitis rash for the last 14 years. My doctor has often treated it with anti-fungal creams and antibiotics. These treatments have been helpful, but the rash keeps flaring up. I had previously purchased the Triderma Eczema formula in hopes of finding a more natural way of treating my rash. A sample of the Intense Fast Healing Cream was included and when I tried using it, I noticed a big improvement in the dermatitis. I intend to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> After suffering a MAJOR Rosacea flare up, this is the only product that actually worked!!!  I&#x27;ve had Rosacea, of and on,  for about 20 years.  My latest flare up lasted for over 3 months with extreme redness, irritation, painful burning, scab like skin and swelling all over my face.  After trying numerous products, including prescription medicines,  The only cream that gave me immediate relief and has continued to improve my skin is TRIDERMA INTENSE FAST HEALING CREAM..  THANK YOU TRIDERMA!!!! From Terry in Miami.</li>
    <li> Bought TriDerma in a local store a couple years ago and have used it for about everything!  Finally began&lt;br /&gt;looking to buy some more and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around.  Knew if anyone had it it would be Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and purchased another tube.  This is a great product to keep in your medicine chest - from minor burns,&lt;br /&gt;irritations, rashes and a host of other things it is just wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is what I call a healing miracle cream - however I do recommend visiting a dermatologist if no change in a week&#x27;s time.  Also gentle enough to use on babies</li>
    <li> I swear this product cures all my skin ailments. I&#x27;ve been blowing my nose a lot these past couple weeks and I always apply some to my nose right after and my skin isn&#x27;t getting chapped at all like it usually does. It heals pimples and marks from picking, almost overnight.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this works. I have never written a review in my entire life but this deserves it. I had large fairly deep extremely painful and probably infected wounds on my face. I bought this bc of good reviews and all natural and reasonably priced. Within days the wounds healed with no infection and no pain and are almost gone and I can tell already they will not leave bad scars it&#x27;s a nice healthy pink even level with the rest of my skin. It&#x27;s a miricle how fast and how well this cream works and it&#x27;s not all greasy so it let&#x27;s ur skin breathe. I would definitely recommend this and buy it from now on!!!</li>
    <li> really works great i am diabetic and love this product</li>
    <li> I have used the ulcer healing cream for a couple years and it has been a wonderful thing for me. I have used this a couple times on skin that is more intensly damaged and so far it has helped so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am diabetic, and larger size person. I have problems with diabetic skin issues. Plus I also have skin problems from Sjogrens (auto-immune condition)</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. I&#x27;ts great for cuts, and minor burns.Have let friends and family use it, and they love it. Only drawback... Can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
    <li> Triderma Intense Fasst Healing Cream is the &amp;#34;BEST.:&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Triderma Intense Fast Healing Cream lives up to it name and claim.  I need to order the larger size as I use it for every kind of skin injury.  Soothing and non-greasy on your skin.</li>
    <li> I put this on a burn on my face.  It healed with a few days without leaving a scar.  My mom is currently using it on wounds on her face, hand and knee from an accident.  Scabs developed quickly and now they are starting to fall off.</li>
