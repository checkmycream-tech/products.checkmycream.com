      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>and this really helps reduce the frizz.  </li>
      <li>I use it with the hair curl boosting spray, and don&#x27; even have to to blow dry to get the free curly style I want,</li>
      <li>People, with very fine hair just need to be very careful to apply just the right amount, because if you do apply too much it will really weigh your hair down and you will end up with hair that looks wet/greasy all day because it does not absorb in and disappear.</li>

      <li>but it exploded in shipping and was a mess to clean</li>
      <li>It does wonder for my curls, keeps them looking frizz free without that crunchy stiff feel.</li>
      <li>I think this product is probably better suited for people who have coarse, thick curly hair.</li>

      <li>curly, thick, long hair that requires more control to make the curls stay together and frizz-free.</li>
      <li>With that comes the fact that  it&#x27;s not as strong in its hold as other mousses that are not natural, but I&#x27;d rather take that than dry my hair our.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but my big curls look thick like a lion&#x27;s mane.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just not for my hair type which is fine it seemed to not do what I wanted it to do and weighted my hair down.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this product, but didn&#x27;t completely hold my very curly hair as i would have liked.</li>
    <li> This product encourages excellent curl. The curl is relaxed, not spikey. Curl Up lasts all day. The only product I am skilled enought to use.</li>
    <li> it is great product but it exploded in shipping and was a mess to clean, also it caused me to lose about half of the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have naturally curly/wavy hair and this really helps reduce the frizz.  I bought it at a drug store on a whim and have been using it for a couple of years now.  I finally ran out of the three bottles I bought and was sad that the store no longer carries it.  I&#x27;ve searched the web and for some reason the price skyrocketed from 6.99 to 11.99!!!  It would be a 5 star other than the price!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells divine!!! It also is priced reasonably. It was $5.40 when I purchased it, although the price has increased to $7.99 now. But I still think that&#x27;s not too bad.  For how little I need to use, it will last a long time. I have fine hair, but my big curls look thick like a lion&#x27;s mane. I find that a very small amount is all that I need to keep the frizzies tame.  I have used it on both wet and dry hair, and it works both ways.... it works best in wet hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue or make my hair weighed down or crunchy/shedding white flakes like gels or mousses sometimes do. My hair feels soft, smooth, and looks shiny.  I also like that it is made from a plant. I never knew a garden weed like dandelions could do so many wonderful things, from healthy teas to hair care!</li>
    <li> This product is not available where we live. I bring it over from the US everytime I come here. Girlfriend loves it says it&#x27;s the best for her hair she could get.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my curls. It isn&#x27;t sticky and smells great. A little goes a long way, even in my thick hair.</li>
    <li> It is too sticky and made my hair like a wooden hair. I got what I paid.. No regret  ;)</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair and have tried every product on the shelves without success, try this one.  I use it with the hair curl boosting spray, and don&#x27; even have to to blow dry to get the free curly style I want,</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels</li>
    <li> Good price, pleasant smell, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s a more natural product. With that comes the fact that  it&#x27;s not as strong in its hold as other mousses that are not natural, but I&#x27;d rather take that than dry my hair our. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! When it first comes out of the bottle, it looks like a gel but it goes in to your hair like cream, aka no crunch! It&#x27;s awsome and makes your hair smell nice while keeping the curls from frizzing out.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad product, just not for my type of hair...curly, thick, long hair that requires more control to make the curls stay together and frizz-free.</li>
    <li> When my perm starts to grow out and my hair gets limp and too long this stuff helps until it&#x27;s time for the next perm</li>
    <li> The best for curls! Could not find for the longest time; so happy to locate this product again and my curls are happy too!</li>
    <li> I have been lookig for a curl enhancing product that doesn&#x27;t produce hard crunchy curls, which this does. I have long, fine naturally wavy hair. The first time I used this product I applied way too much(quarter sized dollop) and it left my fine hair weighed down and greasy looking. So, the second time I scaled the amount back(nickle sized)and was careful not to apply ANY to the crown portion of my head and was much happier with it&#x27;s effect. I think this product is probably better suited for people who have coarse, thick curly hair. It has substantial weight to it and would help reduce volume and frizz for that type of hair. People, with very fine hair just need to be very careful to apply just the right amount, because if you do apply too much it will really weigh your hair down and you will end up with hair that looks wet/greasy all day because it does not absorb in and disappear.</li>
    <li> Great curly hair gel, leaves curls soft and not crunchy!</li>
    <li> I have natural Shirley Temple curls and this is the only product I have found that gives your curls a boost, doesn&#x27;t get crunchy and is made from a plant (dandelions).</li>
    <li> Could not find this product locally so I looked at Amazon and found it, even cheaper than where I used to purchase it!  It does wonder for my curls, keeps them looking frizz free without that crunchy stiff feel. Curls are nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Makes my hair feel and look great. Gives my Curls the boost they need to stay in place all day.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for something to control my curly hair.  I first found this product on the clearance shelf at the grocery.  I really like it.  I am happy to orer it if that is the only way I can get it.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shiny and controlable.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is outstanding. There&#x27;s something about it that&#x27;s better than most.&lt;br /&gt;Actually they changed the product a little and I even liked it better before.  Whenever anything is real good and you get addicted to it \\&quot;they\\&quot; change it for some reason.</li>
    <li> I really like the FX product line. This doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or stiff. I usually use it mostly on the lower part and ends of my hair. Keeps it pretty smooth. I really like the original formula which, I think, gives me better natural curl definition .</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this product did nothing to control my curls and just left my hair frizzy. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> It brings out my natural wavy, curly hair from many many years ago that had disiappeared. I gave one of my bottles to my neighbor and she LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Betty  :o)</li>
