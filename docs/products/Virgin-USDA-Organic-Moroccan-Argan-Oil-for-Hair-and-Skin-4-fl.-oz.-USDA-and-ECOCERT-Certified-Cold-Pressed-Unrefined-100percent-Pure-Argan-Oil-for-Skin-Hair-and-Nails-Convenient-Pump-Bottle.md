<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am not an expert on Argan Oil and have only tried 2 brands. I ordered this one because it is organic, is in a dark bottle and has a nice little pump to dispense the oil! I spend time in a pottery studio, which can really dry out the skin and use the oil every night on my face, arms, back of hands and neck. The packaging includes a free skin care guide, a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Use it for hair, nails, and skin. Wonderful for all!</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied with this brand, as it smells rancid. Will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Have been mixing this product with some lotion for our children. They have sensitive skin and sometimes something will cause their skin to rash up and we already use Cetaphil to help this but sometimes that wasn&#x27;t enough.  Found that mixing this oil with lotion seems to really help and makes those rashes go away.  So this has been very helpful as our kids are growing up and moving past the super sensitive stage.</li>
    <li> This is NOT authentic Argan Oil. I have used two other brands and I know how it is supposed to react to both skin and hair… this is not it. Argan oil should soak in and leave no after feeling of slimy oiliness on either. It should dry as it is a dry oil. This is not dry. It is no different than castor oil. It is watery and slimy. DO NOT USE. I am seriously upset that I put this on my skin and hair. I should have trusted my smell instinct as this also smells nothing like Argan Oil should. This brand is clearly a scam. Avoid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started to use it for hair and hands-good.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something more affordable than the Josie Maran brand argan oil I currently use. Honestly, the price is what sold me on this. I read a few reviews that mentioned the oil had a weird &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell but went away after a while. I thought for the price, I could afford to try it. I apply argan oil at night before I go to bed. I figured for sure any smell would go away by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but I&#x27;d compare the smell at its best to wet cardboard. Truthfully, it reminded me too well of my 1-year-old&#x27;s foul diarrhea diapers. For something I use on my face daily, I couldn&#x27;t even pretend to stand it. Even my husband noticed how badly it smelled from across our bed. Also, the smell didn&#x27;t go away. I would wake up in the morning and still smell it on my hands. Maybe I just have a super power of being able to smell really well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt and use it for a week to see if it actually worked as well as the JM argan oil. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell you if it works as well or not. I didn&#x27;t even make it a week before giving it the boot. I did not try to return the product because I&#x27;d rather be out $13 than go to the post office. On the plus side, the seller sent a very lovely email asking how I liked the product. I started a reply but didn&#x27;t have the heart to say my face smells like my 1-year-old&#x27;s diapers. I&#x27;m assuming I just got a bad bottle, as it seems many other amazon buyers really like the product. You win some, you lose some!</li>
    <li> Smelled rancid.  This is not how argan oil should smell.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil it leaves your face and hair feeling soft, I like the pump because you get the amount you want. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have eczema patches all over my body and just after one application I can already tell a difference. This product is not only perfect for hair but also as a scalp treatment. A+++.</li>
    <li> I use another brand that I&#x27;m happy with. I was looking for something like this Aryan oil for my skin which is ok for skin,but too  oily for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It is an absolute great deal, too. I love that it is 100% pure argan and helps women live a sustainable life for themselves by making it. There are other brands out there which cost a lot more. This is truly a wonderful product, and the price is right!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I highly recommend this product it does exactly what it saids it will therefore, I rate it 5 stars!  Perfect for hair,body and any other places you choose to use it on!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME way to moisturize.  And a reasonable price for it as well.  The push down dispenser is wonderful and you don&#x27;t waste any. I am using it on my hands where I have trouble with a side effect to medication I take.  It is already working and I have only used it a couple of times ***.This is my 2nd order, I will continue to order this wonderful oil.  Why pay these inflated prices of other brands when this one is the BEST !!! It lasts a while as you only need a few drops to moisturize.  I am also using it some on my face now. Absorbs great and never greasy.  Why are you paying $60 for only a fraction of this amount of oil ?  No celebrity name and great value.  Thanks guys !!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I was a bit disappointed to find out the price I paid was an introductory price. I will consider buying it in the future but I am a sucker for a great deal.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I bought would have qualified for a 5 star rating.  Odorless, absorbs quickly, non greasy, fantastic way to keep my skin moisturized.  The second bottle smells rancid.  I immediately wrote their customer service (they send you a &amp;#34;How is the VoilaVe Argan Oil Working?&amp;#34; after you&#x27;ve received it) so I responded to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They responded with &amp;#34; Argan Oil will sometimes have a more pungent smell, this is not an indication of rancidity, just keep your oil in a dark place and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with spoilage.&amp;#34;  You can describe the smell however you&#x27;d like, but basically it&#x27;s an unacceptable smell that I have no desire to put onto my skin.  Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this argan oil on March 23rd, 2015.  There are also one star reviews complaining about the smell dated March 30, 2015, March 22, 2015, March 15, 2015, and February 12, 2015.  Looks like a bad batch that they&#x27;re not taking responsibility for.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for dry hair, skin, and nails.</li>
    <li> I have used organic argan oil from different brands in the past but this one is a lot better. I love this oil.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Great value for large size bottle (often sold as 1 oz for same price as this 4 oz bottle). Very nice product; I use it instead of cuticle oil, which is much more expensive per oz.. A great all-purpose moisturizer. Delivery was prompt and as promised, and customer service followed up to make sure product was received and satisfactory. Thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff!  I use it on my nails my hair and my face!  Iv seen amazing results!</li>
    <li> This is the best argon oil I&#x27;ve used. It is not to heavy and absorbs well. I use it on my fine hair. It tames frizz and adds shine, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I will definitely purchase this product again. I also use it under my eyes in the morning and use VoilaVe Rose Hip Oil in the evening. My hair and skin have never looked better.</li>
    <li> This is decent, comes in a nice glass bottle. I have thick hair, and it worked ok.</li>
    <li> I love the organic argan oil.  I use it for my hair and it does not leave a heavy greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I have never tried argan oil before, but i have always wanted to try it. I was given a discount for this product and I&#x27;m so glad that i&#x27;m finally get to try out this so called &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; that has been constantly praised by my friends. There are so many uses for this product, and a small amount goes a long way. So far, I have only tried it on my hair and skin. It is so easy to apply and it&#x27;s NOT greasy. I used this on my hair after washing, and I noticed that it does almost immediately made my hair soft and silky. I also used it on my face where there are flaky spots, and I have yet to see any improvements. I will update the results after a week or so. So far, I give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I use it everyday</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil in my hair for years and thought I&#x27;d try a different brand. This seemed like a good deal and the reviews seemed favorable. I applied to pumps in my hand and the terrible smell of electroctics burning mixed with pickles wafted towards me. This stuff smells terrible!! How anyone can put this anywhere on their body is beyond me. Don&#x27;t do it, you deserve something better.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I love that I can use it in my hair or on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having a real tough time with the skin in between my eyebrows being too dry and this stuff does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in my hair and I didn&#x27;t get any tangles (which is saying something because I have very fine hair). I would recommend not putting it on the scalp area of your head because it did make my hair look greasy there. Just focus on the body/ends and you will be good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a code to review this item.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff for her hair.  The brands she buys usually have a top you have to quirt it out.  Having the spray top is much much better</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Argan Oil - and I have to say.. WOW. I&#x27;m from the North East, US and we experienced a long, cold, dry, horrible winter. My thick, curly hair has been pretty much unmanageable since and I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that will leave my hair feeling soft and looking great - This is it!! I&#x27;ve used plenty of products in my hair and I&#x27;m always worried about the damage that may be caused from chemicals in the other products, but because this is 100% pure, I feel a lot more comfortable. My curls look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review when I use the product on my face!</li>
    <li> an o.k. product. I need to use it more to get a better idea about it. Makes my hair too oily.</li>
    <li> I got this to review. It didn&#x27;t do what it said it would  first I used it in my hair it was sitting on the top of it. I cant use this on my face because now I have bumps for this product.I used this on my legs after an hour the oil was gone and i was dry.</li>
    <li> Great product for skin and hair. leaves dry skin smooth and hydrated</li>
    <li> The smell of this argan oil is not overpowering, which is a plus for me. I use it for my hair, cuticles and sometimes as a moisturizer. I&#x27;m glad it comes with a pump because it allows you to control how much you want to pump out. I would definitely order a second bottle when I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
    <li> This product did equally as well for my skin hands and cuticle...  Wish I could get creamy consistency in the Aryan oil</li>
    <li> When I received this bottle it was leaking. A mess right out of the shipping box. I started using it a week later; just to find the oil was going bad. It smelled like old olive oil in your cupboard. I should have returned it. But, I didn&#x27;t use it right of way and threw out the necessary paperwork... darn it. All I can do now is write my woes.</li>
    <li> I love this non-greasy oil. It makes my skin feel very silky</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say. Amazing argan oil at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great value purchase, arrived very quickly, really like the size of bottle and the way you dispense the oil too.  Have used this wonderful oil 8 times this week in conjunction with my D&#x27;arsonval High frequency facial treatment....no results from either yet but it sure feels lovely going on my skin!  In three months I&#x27;ll know if the DH treatments work or not.  This oil is what the professional hair dressers use on their customer&#x27;s hair for deep conditioning....so I know if the DH treatments don&#x27;t work out...it will NOT be due to this wonderful oil.  You need to buy 100% pure, ECO-Certified, organic Argan Oil or you are not doing yourself justice.  If you can&#x27;t use this, just use an OTC lotion from your local store.  This is the serious oil for those who won&#x27;t settle for anything but the best for their skin and/or hair.  At my age (68) I&#x27;m going to use this till my expiration date is up!  Thanks for making this so affordable for us on social security!  Will use it from now on - no matter what! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend who has bad psoriasis. He uses it sparingly and daily on his dry patches. He loves it. Only Argan Oil has helped for clearing it up</li>
    <li> Love it.  Best oil I have ever used.  Will continue to use it.  I mix it with the Rosehip oil.</li>
    <li> Made my dry hair soft. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff makes your skin sliky smooth</li>
    <li> This oil smells like it has been burned. The smell like smoke does not dissipate. Must return.  Also is thicker than any other 100% argon oil I have used!</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Feels like olive oil but goes into the skin fast.  i believe that is is going to be good.  I use it with other moisturizers, etc.</li>
    <li> This is better than expected.  The oil is very nice, and the bottle is huge.  I love the pump top, no mess.  This should last me a long time.  I think this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Love it, using for my hair mostly helps breakage.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for burns, heals quickly. Nice on skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil!  It absorbs quickly and my old body hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in ages. I put some in a gal. size baggie, insert a foot, zip it closed to ankle and leave it on for hours. Been long time since I&#x27;ve had happy feet!  I am telling all my friends about this discovery!!!</li>
    <li> I used this and could already tell a difference in my hair! It also makes my skin feel super soft!</li>
    <li> I am really sensitive to additives and fragrances.  So, I can&#x27;t use most store bought products.  This is pure and amazing.  It leaves my hair soft and smooth, but not greasy.  I have repeatedly ordered this brand, and have always been pleased.</li>
    <li> this is amazing! i set in my hair while its damp and once it dries its amazingly soft! it dries wavy, gives a great beach hair look.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is one of the betters oil for skin care.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I went through Chemo and I am hoping it will help me with making my hair a lot stronger.</li>
    <li> I liked this argan oil, didn&#x27;t have a funny smell or anything.  I gave it 4 stars because I wanted to use it on my hair as well but it was a bit to greasy.  I have since found another argan oil that I can use on both hair and face with no problem.  This stuff was so greasy that sometimes the little amount I put on my face would make my hair GREASY!</li>
    <li> This product argan oil is no liquid gold or miracle for skin. Regular lotion work just as good to keep you skin moisturized. When applying this on my skin it take more than one to two drops to layer a area based on instructions you recommended to use. Overrated.</li>
    <li> I am not sure this is real 100% Argan Oil</li>
    <li> Great! I keep on buying it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!!  Arrived quickly. Love the oil. Would highly recommend both the product and the seller. They followed up with me via email to make sure I was pleased with the product. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I used this for my daughters hair and her hair seem to be easier to manage and looks healthier. I am really happy with how this product works in her hair and the best part is it is all natural.</li>
    <li> A very good oil.  I talk around my aboutit.  I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
    <li> love love love! I use it for my hair and face as a moisturizer</li>
    <li> Returned for a full refund.  I did not like the smell, consistency or anything about this product.  I will stick with Savanaahs and Josie Maran</li>
    <li> Great oil. With the dry winter will definitely be getting another bottle.</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast delivery, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent Argan Oil. I have used two different brands. After some months the oil smells stale and old. I will never buy these two brands any more. On the other hand Voila Ve argan oil is totally different. this is the second time  I buy on Voila Ve. I feel confident that is a good oil and original. I have been using it on my hair and skin. My skin feels nice and healthy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the incredible results of Argan Oil.  I use it on my face, my hair, my cuticles... and it is amazing.  It shrinks pores, gets rid of acne scarring, moisturizes and most importantly --- gets rid of those wrinkles forming on my over 50 face.  I love love love it.  I recommend this product to everyone as it has multiple uses and is so great.  Kudos to VoilaVe.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever. I&#x27;ve been using it for month and have barely put a dent into it. I use it on my face with 100% hyaluronic acid, I also use it on my neck, chest, elbows, hands, feet. If you don&#x27;t use too much it won&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I have cystic acne and super oily skin in some parts of my face. The oil doesn&#x27;t make it more greasy and helps with my acne as long as I exfoliate every shower. I don&#x27;t like the squirt top it&#x27;s useless and messy. If it had a removable squeeze dripped it would be less messy. Overall I would recommend to a friend and will probably buy again when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product.  Was in Morocco a bit ago and brought home Argan oil from the factory.  Was pleased to see this product&#x27;s quality was as good as what I purchased in Morocco.</li>
    <li> This has saved my face, hands, hair from total destruction from this cold winter.  I am outside a lot &amp; now that I am older, my skin gets really dry. I am allergic to everything, except this.  I highly recommend this, it beats every beauty product I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered, love this oil!</li>
    <li> First off, it comes in a glass container with a measured pump, which makes for no worries with storage in plastic or mistakes in the amount being applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had ridges in my nails for some time now but since applying one pumps worth to my hands each morning for the last few weeks the ridges are going away and my nails aren&#x27;t breaking as they grow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply two pumps worth each day.  The first I run into my hands and the excess is used as primer for makeup on my face.  Not too oily, and just enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second pump goes on my hands again, then the excess is worked through my long hair, in particular the parts dried from too much exposure and lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels and looks great without causing breakouts or a greasy feel.  It doesn&#x27;t get weighed down, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Moroccan&amp;#34; oils tend to have silicone mixed in to lighten it up, ultimately damaging the hair, but this is a great product that I don&#x27;t have to worry about in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone looking for an all natural solution for smooth, moist, light shiny and healthy hair.  Or for anyone looking to replace makeup primer or strengthen their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my face didn&#x27;t break out from using it as a primer.  It wasn&#x27;t even greasy at all!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for skin, hair and nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with Argan oil! It is the one thing I have found that keeps my nails long and strong. Rubbing it into my nails just a couple times a week keeps them from breaking and chipping. I can see and feel a physical difference when I use this regularly. Also great on hair!</li>
    <li> Product was awesome. Made my wife&#x27;s hair looking less drying and more manageable. I had also gotten it at a good discounted price therefore I decided to purchase this and I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> Love the 4 oz. size!!! Great value.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It soaks up pretty quickly on your skin and smells nice. It&#x27;s a bit thick for hair, but mixed with a little water before application solves that problem.</li>
    <li> I am using this  as  a preshave oil. I cannot give an accurate review of this product compared to others.&lt;br /&gt; On the bottle it says . 100% pure certified organic. Imported from Morocco.Certified by ECOCERT ICO.&lt;br /&gt;Use a Pea size amount for hair treatment.</li>
    <li> Really revitalizes my hair after shampooing it. In other words, keeps my hair from feeling dry and frizzy! I&#x27;m a dude btw. Dudes can use this too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Black woman who HAD dry, brittle, damaged hair. This product repaired my hair and gave it life again.</li>
    <li> I will keep buying this!!! Argon oil seriously saved my hair after a series of damaging highlights and lack of regular hair cuts. I use this on my skin too, just not on my face. Highly recommend. I use this pretty frequently and not sparingly. It lasts me 3-5 weeks depending on usage. I have also used it in conjunction with a Vitamin E oil for my arms and legs. This was an intense treatment and I loved it. The two worked nicely together but the argon was seriously so helpful and vesatile. Thanks!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Argan oil.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00IT1HKV4 Organic Argan Oil for Hair &amp; Face - Cold-Pressed 100% Pure USDA &amp; Ecocert-Certified Organic Moroccan Argan Oil - Large 4-ounce Bottle - Miracle Oil for Skin, Hair, Nails, &amp; Anti-aging]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;awesome oil.  the only kind i use on my hair!  it is the only thing that turns my kinky, curly, aging red mane into soft and manageable curls!</li>
    <li> Product is oil, so yes, it will leave an oil all over your skin.  Because of this, I do not use it on my face, but use it everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my skin much, just puts a coat of oil on.  I use this on the weekend when I can then put lotion over-top of this oil and and be around the house in jogging pants for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used other Argan oils but like most in the market they are mix with silicone extenders, finally found a 100% pure Argan oil at a reasonable price , highly recommend this brand .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of argan oil (I use it usually after I wash my hair when my hair is still damp) and it really gives my hair a great shine! I decided to give this one a try, but to me it was just okay. I think the #1 thing I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of was the smell. It definitely went on smooth and gave my hair a great shine, but I thought the smell was kind of funky. I don&#x27;t think I would get it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin or nails yet though, just hair!</li>
    <li> First of all, the bottle is HUGE! This was a great surprise since I usually pay this price for a bottle half this size. Second, the oil itself is beautiful. Smooth and no rancid smell (as other brands have had). I use this as a moisturizer and for my scalp, it has been working great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I use this oil for all problem spots on my body, face and hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Argon Oil at the local beaty supply that was smaller and more expensive. So when I saw this on amazon I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Im very pleased with the purchase, as the oil is good quality and the price and size are a great value. I really like that it is in a spray bottle for convenient application.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm so far. Not super thick and very soothing</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is awful</li>
    <li> Great product and very easy on the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> It does a good job at moisturizing my face, a little goes a long way. I also put it on my ends after I get out of the shower before I blow dry, helps maintain fly away&#x27;s to on dry hair. I am looking forward to re order.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever!!!! Do NOT use!!! Not argan oil at all.... its crap and a scam!!!! I will never buy this product again!</li>
    <li> The smell at first gets to you, but it dissolves after a while.  I have very dry hair and this product made my hair moist.  I have also used it on my skin and it does last and kept my skin Moisturized and only needed to apply once.</li>
    <li> All natural is always good!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a carrier oil for essential oils, and as a nighttime moisturizer. It is light and non-comedogenic, and has no scent. A very good oil for the face and hands.</li>
    <li> I am new to purchasing separately for use on my skin, hair and nails and this one is the third brand I have tried and I believe it is the best one! I use it after my shower placing a drop into my hand with some of my organic and fragrance free lotion and my skin is like silk. I also it on my hair after shampooing and it does great things for my long baby fine hair. It is a keeper for sure. I will continue with this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help strengthen my hair. It feels great on my hair. Imagine my surprise when I tried it on my face. WOW!! I love it, it helps my dry skin so much. No breakouts. My daughter uses it too. Still works great. Love their customer service.</li>
    <li> Great product and value. Buy with confidence. This comes after extensive searching on the internet and personal use.</li>
    <li> I love your Argan oil. Thank you for asking me about my opinion.  The service and product are fantastic.  Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Maytee</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair. It does an amazing job at taming my fly aways and frizzy hair. I have very thick hair and live in a humid place and have been searching for a product to help me. It does not weigh my hair down at all. The Argan oil leaves it shiny and healthy looking. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I am not crazy about the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great  for my hair type</li>
    <li> Best oil out here! I mix it with my body lotion. Helps to make my skin smooth and adds moisture. Does not feel greasy, just smooth!</li>
    <li> A great balm whit no fragrance for hair and skin, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very soft, It is great for scratch marks.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use it on my hair, which is up to my waist. Before I started using argan oil, the ends of my hair always seemed dry and very limp, which makes me want to chop it off. But thanks to this amazing oil, my hair is shiny, soft and silky from roots to end. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought a different brand of Argan oil couple weeks ago and bought this VoilaVe Argan oil again to compare the qualities. I was really surprised that how 2 brands are different in quality. I really like VoilaVe Aargan oil because it penetrates really well on skin, color is rich and smelled the way it should be...though some people might think that it&#x27;s bit strong.  I will buy again and I am happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> The VoilaVe Argan Oil  arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.  It  has the same scent and absorbability as the argan oil I purchased in Morocco.  Mostly I use it on my face and chest.  Sometimes I mix it  with another product.  This is my second bottle of VoilaVe and I will reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RF&lt;br /&gt;Raleigh, NC&lt;br /&gt;Feb 15, 2015</li>
    <li> Good quality product. I use it in my face cream. Feels good on skin</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to use with her hair. She moved to a natural Shampoo that requires this as an addition. She ranks it a 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Love the product! I&#x27;ve been using it for less than 2 weeks and I already have noticed a difference in my dry skin and eczema. The company selling has great communication and response time too!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. GREAT PRICE&lt;br /&gt;I SAW PURE ARGAN OIL SELLING ON QVC FOR THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE PRICE. I WANTED TO TRY IT BUT NOT&lt;br /&gt;AT THAT PRICE. THIS WAS MY FIRST USE OF ARGAN OIL. I USUALLY USE A RETIN PRODUCT AND VITAMEN E CREAM.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER USING THIS ON MY FACE IN ADDITIONAL TO MY REGULAR PRODUCTS, I NOTICED A NEW MOISTURE SMOOTHNESS&lt;br /&gt;TO MY FACE. PLEASE TRY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I AM USUALLY SCEPTICAL BUT THIS OIL IS EXCELLENT. I ORDERED MORE BOTTLES IN CASE THEY RUN OUT.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product but have had some remarkable results. I am mixed race and suffer from confused hair syndrome. My hair is very finicky and dry.  Oddly, not only is my hair better conditioned and softer; it is also straighter. I straighten my hair once or twice a year with a very weak relaxer just to get it bit more frizz resistant. Anything harsh on my hair and it falls out. Now, I may not have to do that  It is winter now, but I have perspired heavily and my hair has not gotten frizzy. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  My husband and I use is and we use it on our kids (hair).  Great value and quality!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say that the shipping was great. I ordered this yesterday and received it first thing this morning. I love Aragon Oil in general. But, this was awesome. I opened it as soon as I got it and used it on my split ends. It makes my hair look healthier at the ends. I then applied it up a bit higher on my hair ( but not to the roots) and it made my hair look better and have a healthier feel and look. It also made it easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Would absolutely NOT buy again.  Only owned a little over 6 mos. and it&#x27;s turned rancid and smells.  They claim 365-day money back guarantee but I can&#x27;t figure out how to get a refund. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare the quality of this to. The pump feature on this bottle is quite nice and a great alternative to a dropper. The smell is very light, which is good. This is a nice size bottle for me as I use this on my face and as an overnight treatment for my hair. The price is just right for a person like me, who is just starting out and seeing what works and doesn&#x27;t work for her skin.</li>
    <li> I used the popular Josie M&#x27;s argan oil and I think this one is very comparable. It&#x27;s lightweight and is great for cuticles, hair or even as a moisturizer for dry spots. Very good product and love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> This oil goes on to your hair smoothly and distributes evenly. You only need a little bit (depending on hair length) so I anticipate this bottle lasting me 2-3 months. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the way the product just melts into your skin.  There isn&#x27;t a greasy film after application.  I originally bought it for my hair but for me it make it too oily. Start with a very small amount and really only place on the parts that seem to be dry or prone to break a ways.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and really loved it both for my face and hair.  The bottle, however, is made of glass and is heavy. Sadly, the bottle slipped from my hands (we are dealing with an oil solution) after only 1 week of using the product and it all shattered and splattered on the bathroom floor ... I would definitely buy it again, but in a plastic container next time ...</li>
    <li> Love this product. Keeps my hair straight and soft.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, but a lot of it, and was looking for something to boost the shine and soften. This left my hair feeling and looking super oily - like I hadn&#x27;t washed in days. I tried it for a few days with different amounts to see if maybe I had too much in my hair, but no - even with a small dime-size amount it looked like I had covered my head in olive oil.</li>
    <li> I love that this argan oil comes with a pump for easy use. It&#x27;s very thin and smells good. Looks great on my hair and is perfect for taming frizz.</li>
    <li> excellent product, after I apply I noticed some kind of smell but it didn&#x27;t bother after a while, it absorbed well and I felt like my skin is more smoother and clearer, no outbreaks and looks clean. I will continue to use it and will monitor the progress.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to argan oil, but so far I love it. I have very thick, coarse hair and it helps to soften it.  It has been great on my feet, which were getting dry wearing sandals. My only complaint would be the smell, it is rather repulsive.  But all of the great uses for the product overpower the bad odor.</li>
    <li> Good product for a decent price. I preferred another brand I bought last year (just by a nose) but if I could not find that version, I would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I always had dry skin, and I find that the Argan Oil definitely lubricates it.  I actually blend the oil with my liquid makeup before applying it in the am.  At night after cleansing my face with a mild soap I also apply the oil.</li>
    <li> I love the way it make my skin glows.  I don&#x27;t use it on my hair. I&#x27;m not sure what it smells like, but it&#x27;s not foul and it&#x27;s not sweet</li>
    <li> Organic Argan Oil for face, hair and hands.  I tried this on a promotion and it is different then I expected. I expected a basic emolliant oil but this is a very rich it is a little on the heavy side but it penetrated extremely well. I tried it on my hands and found it to be slightly more greasy then I typically like but it penetrated and really sunk in within about 5 minutes. I noticed it has a slightly earthy scent that is not unpleasant but it did dissipate after about 1/2 to 1 hour and now has no noticeable scent. My hands feel incredibly soft with no residual greasiness after the first 1/2 hour. One thing I have really been liking about using oils on my hands (which is fairly new) as opposed to lotions and creams is that after the oil sinks in it really stays and you can wash your hands and do chores - when I use creams and lotions even after I feel it has penetrated my skin the minute I get water on my hands it goes into solution with the lotion and it pretty much washes off. I am becoming a real fan of oils and serums.&lt;br /&gt;i think this would be very good on my feet as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Cold-Pressed 100% Pure USDA &amp; Ecocert-Certified Organic Moroccan Argan Oil from VoilaVe to try on my 2yo.  She has curly hair that is sometimes hard to manage, and has a layer of curls at the nape of her neck that gets knotted easily with beadhead.  We&#x27;ve used other Argan Oils with great success previously and I want something that is organic and chemical free since she&#x27;s so young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The VoilaVe Organic Moroccan Argan Oil is clear in color, has a faint nutty scent that disappears quickly, and is smooth/silky to feel without feeling greasy.  The bottle comes with an attached pump, which is great for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The VoilaVe Organic Moroccan Argan Oil left my daughters curls feeling soft and manageable without looking like it had product in it.  The added bonus of using it in her hair is that my nail cuticles are looking great ;)  While I do miss the scent from our other Argan Oil products, I love that this one is free of perfumes or dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount in exchange for my honest review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I had not heard of Argan oil and the many uses for it until I read a small &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; for easier make up application in a popular magazine for women. The article said that a thin application of Argan oil before applying makeup smoothed the skin and helped maintain moisture.  After reading product information and customer feedback on many different sellers, I selected VoilaVe for reasons of value for the price and the fact it is bottled in dark glass which is critical for keeping the oil fresh and preserving the integrity of it.  This Argon oil is everything it is reported to be and does everything customers have said it will do. A few drops on my face and neck smooths instantly, feels like silk and is absorbed into my skin fairly quickly. Having fought with oily areas on my face all my life, I have always steered clear of anything oil-based for my face. If that is a concern for you, let me say that I find Argan oil to be in an entirely different category...it&#x27;s an oil that quickly changes to a silky smoothness on your skin. I use it on my face, neck, arms, and legs. My skin has never been in better condition. I really have already ordered another bottle and it won&#x27;t be the last.  One more thing, I&#x27;m 70 years young and, as I&#x27;ve mentioned my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been. If this oil can do that for me, I can only imagine how beneficial it will be for younger bodies!</li>
    <li> I bought this to add shine and moisterize my hair as a natural option, however I can&#x27;t use it for that purpose since it even makes my dry hair look greesy instantly! Not a good look! So I am currently using it for my cuticles, for my face whenever I am staying home as a hydrating treatment (since it makes it shiny too so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for leaving the apt) and I apply it on my hair the night before washing it everyonce in a while as a treatment and it works well for that...&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I didn&#x27;t like the smell, now I have gotten used to it, it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell but it&#x27;s mild and it goes away quickly...</li>
    <li> Great product! I researched multiple brands prior to purchase.  I used this product on my hair for my split ends.  I have somewhat thin hair and usually products leave my hair feeling weighted and oily, but not this one!  My hair felt silky without looking dirty and oily.  I also began applying it to my cuticles.  I have bitten my nails since I was 2 years old thus my cuticles are dry and brittle. I&#x27;ve been using it a week on my fingernail cuticles and can see and feel a difference already.  Overall, this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy, brightly colored hair, two drops rubbed in the palm of my hands and worked into the ends of my hair was the perfect amount. It gave my hair the beach bum kind of waves. I think any more would give a greasy unwashed feel, so it&#x27;s better used in small doses.</li>
    <li> I use the stuff on my long frizzy nightmare of a hair and it makes its silky smooth a manageable. It works well if I want to have my natural curls or if I use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and a little goes a long way. It leaves hair and lips soft and moisturized. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this oil , wow it really works great ! I have been looking for a pure oil for my hair especially, I use just a small amount for my very long hair then I rub in the rest on my hands , I will buy again thanks VoilaVe</li>
    <li> Great product. I have tried various Argan oil brands--not all are created equal. This is by far the best quality I have found so far and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil on my face for about 18 months. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and they were good, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one. It absorbs very fast so I don&#x27;t have to wait to apply my makeup. It&#x27;s very light and the pump gives you the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using oil, I haven&#x27;t had to use moisturizer (huge savings there) and I no longer need my expensive prescription acne medicine. It keeps my oily, acne prone skin clear and shine free. I use it after my shower in the morning and again before bed, after removing my makeup. It&#x27;s amazing how much better my skin looks. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as shown in the pictures and description. It is truly 100% Argan oil. I&#x27;m glad about this because I always get other products that claim to be 100% Argan oil, but then I see other crazy chemicals in the ingredients..but this one is actually 100%!! I see a major improvement in my hair after just a week&#x27;s use. I put a little in my hair after every wash while it&#x27;s still slightly damp. I also put a drop or 2 in my hair while its dry to tame some frizziness. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and I plan on coming back for more once my bottle runs out! Only complaint is the smell...but it&#x27;s the price you pay for quality Argan oil.</li>
    <li> On my 30th bday I realized fine lines on my forehead and crows feet near my eyes. It hit me that I haven&#x27;t cared for my skin in a while. I started using just one drop of this product every evening after I way my face. I spend 5 mins to massage it into my skin. 6 months later, my skin is so radiant that I get compliments all the time. It really boosted my confidence!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I see no difference. Could be a fake. Unfortunately, I am not rich and therefore do not have the money to keep gambling with different argan oils. I used this oil for my skin and hair. Olive oil works better than this stuff.</li>
    <li> This purchase was my first time using Argan oil. The product is wonderful. I especially like the pump instead of a dropper. I have experimented with different oils over the years.  Argan oil is the best. I wash my face with Jojoba oil and a warm washcloth, then apply the Argan oil a.m. and p.m. It has diminished under-eye wrinkles and the tone of my skin has greatly improved. I am in my late 60&#x27;s, have minimal wrinkles and don&#x27;t need makeup after using Argan oil. My skin is totally smooth. I also use a drop on the back of each hand at night. Wonderful discovery.</li>
    <li> Half way through bottle, will buy again.  Use it for face and with essential oils.  The pump works great and is quite convenient for application.</li>
    <li> I was using a different brand, which only comes in 1 oz. containers. This is 4 times as much. It works, but not as well, and does not absorb as quickly. And I&#x27;ve learned that argan oil spoils if you keep it around very long, so the smaller container is probably a wiser choice.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Good product</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel amazing and helps with the frizz. I live in Florida with curly hair humidity and me don&#x27;t mix. This helps</li>
    <li> I had thought this bottle would be small but it was a very decent size! and it looks great. You only have to use a few squirts and it will last all day. Some days I do have to go re add since I do have frizzy, wavy hair. Its been a month now and I still havent used much of it so I know it will last me till the end of the year. It is worth its money though it has one little updown for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR USE: So after trying this argan oil for a few weeks now I noticed that whenever I used a little it had some funky smell going on. This is a great product though, it keeps my hair soft and shiny and do not have to use very much. It has taken me a while to find oil for my hair that was organic and didn&#x27;t leave it too oily. As long as you use it with a leave in conditioner that smells nicely you wont notice the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; FACIAL USE: I have applied it on my face as well and I do prefer using it instead of lotion as it dries quicker and does not make my face feel all sticky. I noticed that my face was also clearing up and looking healthier. The smell doesnt seem to linger when I use it on my face so it may only be affecting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this review helpful and give it a try.I do reccomend you use it with the leave in conditioner by Renpure Coconut Whipped Creme. It is very lovely and it will last months! They are both great sized bottles.</li>
    <li> About 1/4 leaked during shipping, but otherwise works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> My skin has gone through the winter more easily since I began using this product. I am now on my second bottle. It&#x27;s good all over the skin. I have less wintertime hangnails. I use it all over directly after showering. It&#x27;s quite a bit less expensive and more effective than the moisture cream I used to use on my face. Hands, feet, face, skin everywhere in good shape using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my nail tech some of her clients had some real problems with their feet and almost immediately after using this product experienced great improvement.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday on my face.  I started using cocunut oil, but by the afternoon my face was dry again.  With the argon oil I have found it to be a deeper moisturizer that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Thanks so much !  I use it for everything every day!!!</li>
    <li> I got this on a very good doscounted price and i really love this oil. It has made my skin really soft and smooth. Also it hasn&#x27;t break me out. This is a multi purpose oil which can be use on body, hair and face. This oil has really improved my skin alot. And i highly recommend this oil to people who wants smooth and supple skin and shiny soft hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of VoilaVe Argan Oil. The price is right for a nice quantity of pure organic oil, and the pump makes for no fuss application. I love this oil for it&#x27;s lightness and use it daily on my face, decollete, and anywhere that might be feeling dry. Mixed with a little rose oil and it&#x27;s heavenly! It absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I have tried other aragon oils in the past that have and haven&#x27;t worked and I didn&#x27;t really like this one,  it was greasy and didnt do it&#x27;s purpose.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Arrived as promised for prime shipping. I use it for my hair and nails. I love it!!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have used the product just a few days now...so I can&#x27;t really comment on any long term effects.  I purchased the product because of my dry brittle hair.  I used about 2 pumps when my hair was dry and just rubbed it into my ends and rubbed my hands through my hair.  It gave my hair a healthy shine.  You do need to find the right amount of pumps for your hair or it can look oily if you use too many.  I am satisfied with the product an hope that it will keep my hair looking healthy and grow longer in the long term.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very excited to use this product for skin care. Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Good but getting smaller oz - I had to trash half the bottle as it expired. I would get &amp;#60;2 fl oz every 6 months</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing hair treatment. It keeps my hair soft and manageable. The bottle is huge and a little really goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the oil, and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product. I bought it to use on my cuticles and nails, and after two weeks I notice my nails breaking a lot less frequently.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my beard but it greatly reduced stretch marks</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;m a male with long hair that breaks easily and this stuff feels like it protects my hair, keeps it from tangling, keeps down on frizz and makes my hair very smooth. Supposedly works well on skin and nails too. Smell isn&#x27;t bad, I don&#x27;t have to use much. Just a drop or 2.</li>
    <li> I thought this was good until it ran out and I bought another brand.  Pura d&#x27;or beat it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I heard it would get rid of acne. I was skeptical about it doing this, but thought I&#x27;d try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it daily for just shy of a year and it had done wonders for me. I use it on my face and on my hair ( just a small amount or hair looks greasy), and on dry patches of skin. I&#x27;ve also cut it with my hair conditioner which made my hair shiny and smooth without the greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not completely get rid of my acne as mine is caused by hormonal issues, but it greatly lessened my breakouts and gave me smoother, more even skin. Plus even when I do break out it lessens the redness and irritation helping me feel and look better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the one bottle lasted for almost nine months! Will continue to buy this product long term! It is the best moisturizer for skin!</li>
    <li> This product is far better than the Argan oils I&#x27;ve tried before. Because it is pure with no additives I am able to use a lot less than I did before. I used probably a handful of my last oil now just couple of squirts. My hair is long (to my hips) and thick, so trust me I have used a lot of to get the results I want. I have already received several complements on how pretty my hair is. I will continue to use this Argan Oil</li>
    <li> This is a good value. We are pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  My comparison is limited as I have only purchased Argan oil from one other source .. but the quality, viscosity, and absorption seem comparable (but this product is at a much lower cost).  The only difference noted is the smell.  This product has no discernible scent while the other was nutty.  I will not hesitate to purchase from this company again</li>
    <li> I have been using VoikaVe Organic Argon Oil For Hair now for 6 months..I just Love it!!! ☺ I wanted to wait until I used it for awhile before giving a review..A little goes a long way..Just after I wash my hair, I use a few pumps and work it through my hair with more on ends..Then I use my boar brush to make it even from root to tip..My hair is soft and beautiful! Thanks!!! ☺</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. All you need is drop or two for good results. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> moisturize very well, and i love the fact that it contains only argon oil. i have an oily face, so it does make my face a bit greasy feeling especially during summer.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this two different ratings. I got a deal from Snagsgout.com and I was amazed at the price I got it for. My roomate swears by the stuff so I counted myself lucky to get it at such a discount. So I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks. The 4 star rating is for when I use it on my hair. It&#x27;s magic. It&#x27;s light yet does what it has to do as far as oiling my hair. Not so great for the scalp but does wonders on the hair. It was nice &amp; soft. I put it on instead of the normal mixture I use and it held its own, I must say. A little goes a long way. As far as my face goes. I see no improvement. It&#x27;s still breaking out but I will say the lightness of the oil does make for a great night moisterizer. Again, a little goes a long way. Especially on the face. So for my face I give it 3 stars and that&#x27;s because the smell of it is so light and it&#x27;s not a heavy oil so it does keep my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my hair after showering but I didn&#x27;t actually see any difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Argan oil. It smells and feels like the real deal. This oil can last really long depending on what it is used for. My husband uses it for his wrinkles and the transformation has been amazing. The only facial products he uses are a trader joe&#x27;s cleanser and this argan oil...nothing else!! I marvel at the effectiveness of this oil, My daughter and I use it for our hair and skin and it takes care of dry hair and skin like no other. I love how it relieves my dry, cracked heels with long lasting effect . This is an awesome product one which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argon oil for years and this is a very good product especially for the price. I use it on my face and neck as well as on the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> The argan oil was bought for my fiance. He loves it. It gives wonderful conditioning for his hair without weighing it down or making it oily. He said it&#x27;s also good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> High quality. Excellent for skin and hair</li>
    <li> excellent product will order again</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had to request a refund for this product. I was a fake and smelled HORRIBLE like manure and was really liquidy. So disappointed with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is light even on my fine hair.  I use a tiny bit and avoid the roots. Gets rid of fizz without making hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again though I think this will last me over a year!  I&#x27;m buying more as gifts that are very much appreciated.</li>
    <li> This is really nice oil. I&#x27;ve tried using it on my skin and hair. It made my hair feel a bit oily, so I probably won&#x27;t keep using it as a hair product, but it made my skin feel soft and moisturized without leaving an oily residue. It has a pleasant but very mild scent -- hardly noticeable. And I like the pump nozzle as well. Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My rating cannot be above 3 due to a distinct strange oder of this brand of Argan oil. An oder was not noticeable in other bands I&#x27;ve used. Otherwise, the product, VoilaVe, is acceptance.</li>
    <li> I have thick, somewhat course curly hair and this stuff makes it shine! I take a few drops, rub it in my hair before I blowdry and it comes out shiny and soft with almost no frizz. Its so lightweight you dont feel it in your hair. Ive also used coconut oil in my hair before but it weighs it down alot, and leaves an almost greasy residue but this does not! I even use it on my face as a moisturizer and its seems to be helping clear up acne. So far I love it! I cant wait to see what else it can do!</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this Argan oil. I use it on my face and for my hair. I have combination skin. I mainly put this on my dry part and it absorbs pretty fast. I also mix it with essential oils to have different flavors. Love this product and will continue purchasing it in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this on both my hair and skin. It leaves my hair controllable with a nice shine. The scent is pleasant. For my skin I actually mix it with olive oil and others. I find oils work better in the hotter climates to moisturize and protect both hair and skin</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have had it for about 6 months now, use it almost daily and still have half a bottle. I squirt 2 pumps into my hands rub briskly to warm then put it on my face and the left over into the ends of my hair. This leave hair and skin silky without feeling oily. Make sure to warm the oil in your hands first or it will be think and oily on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous oil. Feels so rich as it goes on, yet sinks right in so that I am not left oily. I use it all over my body, and my skin drinks it up. I use it on my face, and my skin feels soft and moist. I also find this company wonderful to do business with.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased to keep my over-60, thick, curly hair looking and feeling healthy.  It delivered on everything PLUS after applying it to my hair, the oil proved to be an excellent product for my hands and face as well.  I purchased this product on the advice of my hairstylist, who also has thick curly hair.  The oil was not given to me or purchased with a coupon.  This product is excellent, especially if you blow dry your hair and/or use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I continue daily use of this product.  It makes my skin feel soft &amp; silky.  No allergies to product.</li>
    <li> I use it to condition my hair a day or two before I have to wash it. I apply it to the end of my hair and from the ear down. tame frizz and softening and very moisturizing for hair</li>
    <li> No improvement..! Just using it as all other carrier oil</li>
    <li> Worked great in my hair made if feel nice strong and smooth. Have not used it on my face yet I will update at a later time .</li>
    <li> This oil has a strong, chemical diarrhea smell. Not sure if I just got a bad, expired bottle but it is truly repulsive. Cannot put on hair and skin because of the scent. I do not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my hair so soft and smooth. Its so easy to flat iron my hair now with this product. It smells great too!!!</li>
    <li> I reserve this oil for my face, hair, elbows, knees and feet only.  It is too precious to use all over your body, unless you are fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where you can afford to purchase it frequently.  I use Neutrogena light Sesame Oil for the rest of my body and on my legs after shaving since it more cost effective for me.  This brand of Argan oil works wonders for the hair.  I wear it under a plastic cap for a few hours, and it is effective as a hot oil treatment.  It has no fragrance or odor whatsoever, which is great.  Overall I am very pleased with it and will continue to use it on those special areas only.  I would recommend a light sesame oil or a light baby oil for all-over body application, as this Argan oil is too special in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice on my shoulder length hair and I love it. Makes my hair smooth and shiny. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I just put my 2nd purchase in our cart. This product works well on skin, hair and nails.</li>
    <li> I purchased organic argan oil for my wife and she loves it. Great follow-up customer service from the seller also. Thanks!</li>
    <li> not my hair greasy and effective thanks you</li>
    <li> This arrived today--on a Sunday so I was very excited to try it.  I had freshly washed hair--so I was ready.  My hair is very dry from many years of color and products.  I pumped out just a tiny bit and rubbed it onto my hands before applying to my towel dried hair.  I then dried it with a hair dryer.  It felt wonderful. My hair felt smooth and there was no frizz.  I then applied just a tiny bit more to make my hair nice and shiny.   After the success using the oil on my hair--I decided to try it on my cuticles.  It felt great on them as well.  It also really enhanced my fresh manicure. I love how this product is organic and very natural with no added ingredients.  I also love the money back guarantee that you will be satisfied.  I highly recommend everyone try this product--there is no risk to trying!  The only con I felt with this product was the scent.  Since it is an all natural product; there is no scent added.</li>
    <li> Best buy for pure Argan oil.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Sorry but I don&#x27;t like this as much as the  ELMA&amp;SANA® Golden Argan Oil that I purchased from Amazon.  The pump on the bottle is awkward and the other brand feels better on my skin.  This product is less expensive though.</li>
    <li> Worked amazingly well. Used it when my hair was half dry and then blow dried my hair after. It was so silky and smooth after the oil didn&#x27;t make my hair more oily but just helped it feel great. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> This is the only Argon Oil I have used, but I&#x27;m impressed with it. I love how healthy my hair is and it takes care of the frizz of my natural curl. I love that I can use it on my skin too.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  i use it for my scalp.</li>
    <li> Big bottle... i really liked the product</li>
    <li> This oil is above all the other argon oils I have tried for my hair. Just a little does the job on dry frizzy hair and makes blow out so much easier. And it also doubles as a skin cream. I use a little all over my face and it makes it soft without being greasy. I am totally happy with this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I had bought another brand at the local store before I found this one.  This is a bigger bottle for less than what I was spending.  It also smells better than the other brand that I was using.  I put it on my face after showering, it makes my skin feel better than it did with expensive creams.  It has not caused me to break out at all, love it!</li>
    <li> Has done wonders to my facial and neck skin. Use it to massage my scalp and rub on my hands too. Face looks glowy and radiant! Have received a lot of compliments since then. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> After only 4 days of use I have to say that this is a quality product. During the winter months my facial skin tends to get very dry and sometimes flaky. I&#x27;ve used tons of other moisturizers but none really work through the entire day. I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil which does work but for my skin leaves me with slight breakouts by the next morning. This product so far does the trick. Keeps my skin feeling soft the entire day without feeling oily at all. I would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for high quality organic argan oil that won&#x27;t break the bank.  Given the rising popularity designer versions are crazy expensive for a single ounce.  This product is certified organic, packaged in the US and I think better than the big name brand options.  Plus it&#x27;s four ounces - it&#x27;s HUGE.  The pump cap also makes dispensing super easy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for hair, nails and skin.</li>
    <li> Just perfect this is either my third or fourth bottle.  Obviously I love it and it is, at least, as good as its more expensive sisters. You are going to love it too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the greatest product on earth! All 100% Argan oils are supposed to have a slight smell. That&#x27;s why I questioned my Josie maran Argan oil. It not having scent means the Josie stuff was heated and therefore not as pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this stuff in my hair after I shower. I have thick and long hair so I usually use about 6-8 drops. I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore. It&#x27;s great! I also use 4 drops on my face as my daily moisturizer. I have super dry skin. The price is amazing. I will keep buying this product as long as it remains on the planet and stays a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I also use this on my ears. I massage it on my earlobe to increase blood flow</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and skin feel so great and you really only need a small amount. Add to your lotions or leave in conditioner and you will definitely see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Love everything Argon! Use this in my hair</li>
    <li> I like the organic argan oil very much.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product very much. I had problems with my scalp being itchy all the time but since I&#x27;ve started using VoilaVe Organic Argan Oil my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair is very soft. I use it on my face too and it doesn&#x27;t break my face out like with other oils and my face is even softer than usual.  I am a customer for life. Thank you VoilaVe!</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a truly organic argan oil that was both usda and eco certified organic because so many oils say they are organic but do not have both of these certifications. When I saw that the voilave argan oil had both, I bought it right away! I am so happy I did. This is by far the best argan oil I have ever used. It has a beautiful rich color and no smell. Works great on my hair and as a body oil. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I put it on the ends of my hair and all over my face at night.</li>
    <li> Soothing when used after shaving and shower.  Quality product at good price. And quantity puts it over the top. Will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> I love my VoilaVe Argan oil! I have suffered from severely dry hands all my life and  this is the only thing that has ever worked! My hands used to bleed, peel, crack, scab, and scar until I started using it. I will warn you, it has a very strong nutty odor that I don&#x27;t personally mind, but many others do. I definitely recommend this item, and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for a couple years now as my exclusive moisturizer.  I used to have combination skin that was mostly oily and would use all sorts of moisturizers- most of them oil-free because god-forbid any oil touch my face, it might break out more.  Well wasn&#x27;t I fooled for so many years.  Oil moisturizers balance the face&#x27;s production of oil and my skin has been remarkable clearer since I switched.  At the beginning I started out with Josie Maran but it is ridiculously expensive.  I&#x27;ve been buying non-Josie Argan Oil on amazon for some time now and just recently chose this brand because of the beautiful price and large 4oz bottle size.  It is just as great as Josie Maran and is packaged in the USA (imported oil from Morocco of course).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but smell is strong, I had to add rose oil..</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I love it for my biracial daughters hair and scalp! Keeps their scalp moisturizer and smells awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I started &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; my face with this oil a few weeks ago and my blackheads are disappearing before my eyes! I love how gentle it is on my very dry skin and the fact that it removes ALL of my makeup at the end of the day. This is so much better than the expensive cleansing oils you see at Sephora.</li>
    <li> I love Josie Maran&#x27;s 100% pure argan oil but it is very expensive. I feel this is a good alternative. This product has a stronger nutty smell compared to JM&#x27;s lightly pleasant smell. It also has a &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; viscosity so it feels a bit greasier when applied as compared to JM&#x27;s  that is lighter and seems to be more readily absorbed into the skin. However the price is way cheaper, so I have no regrets slathering this oil all over my skin, hair and nails. For roughly the same price, a 0.5 fl.oz bottle of JM is no match against a 4oz bottle of Voilave!</li>
    <li> I dye my hair a lot and recently it has started drying out and breaking from it, but no longer since I&#x27;ve started using this I have noticed my hair becoming stronger. I also use it as a moisturizer on my hands and feet and it has worked wonders to clear up my excessively dry skin. I must say I&#x27;m extremely happy with this line of products!</li>
    <li> unbelievable, i had problems with my face  , i  think rosacea and i was using aloe gel. that worked ok but when combined with thr argan it is all gone.</li>
    <li> it is great I have very frizzy dry hair and it works wonders for my hair</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome, I used it all winter everywhere - hands, face, hair, feet! It&#x27;s super moisturizing and absorbs quickly. You need this product!</li>
    <li> Fabulous! My third purchase! The quality is excellent! Use on face, body and hair!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say I cannot endorse this product.  It is a nice size, but the bottle arrive cracked and broken.  I tried to transfer the oil to another bottle but the pump was jammed.  In frustration I threw the broken bottle and pump in the garbage.</li>
    <li> got as gift ... oil leaked within and onto box ... unsightly in presentation ... the jury is out re argan oil itself ...</li>
    <li> This stuff did nada for me. I saw great revews and was hoping to get great results. I used it in my hair - OIL CITY! Used it on my face for anti-aging purposes. It didn&#x27;t do a thing. The only positive is that it lasts forever!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Organic Argan Oil for Hair &amp; Face for only 4 weeks, using the oil on my face everyday. It does absorb very rapidly and does not leave your face feeling greasy.  I have to put 2 applications on my face because I have dry skin. So far I can&#x27;t tell any difference and my face does not feel as smooth as it did with the other lotion I was using. I tried only a few (2-3) drops (as suggested) on my hair to control the &#x27;frizzies&#x27; but that didn&#x27;t work too well either. I thought I didn&#x27;t use enough drops so used a few more (2) and my hair became stringy greasy. Although I wash the oil off my hands after I use it because I wear contacts and have gotten oil on them it does seem to have helped moisturize my hands a little. Was hoping for better results. Giving this a 3 star because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s terrible and it could probably work great on other skin types. I&#x27;ve had problems finding good moisturizers before.</li>
    <li> Love argan oil, and that this one is organic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s and have fine lines, and I don&#x27;t see immediate results after using daily for a week.  However I do have dry hair, and my hair felt silky and not greasy after the first use. I have dry skin too and I find shea butter works better than argan oil.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmologist and this is the best argan oil I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a very long time a lil bit goes a long way. The texture is creamy silky feel that warms as it emulsifies. It blends well with other oils. I mix with jojoba, which I also get from VoilaVe. I appreciate the quality and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I used it for my hair tip every day and i got a lot of compliments how healthy my hair looks! I used it also on my face as a serum at night time. I really liked to use it on my face as well. I would highly recommend to those who look for a natural hair serum. It is not too oily. Very light. No artificial smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Use it on my face and body.  Wonderful results.  Also put a little on my hair and it gives it a nice shine.  Will definitely be buying more.  Great Price for this size!</li>
    <li> I had never known about Aryan oil, until I implemented it into my daily routine. It acts so positively in giving my skin beyond any results I expexted. There are so many chemically/pharmaceutical products that people use. With these products, not only are they natural, but they feed my skin with everything it needs! I am still bewildered at the positive results that I am continuously receiving!</li>
    <li> I have used the Argan oil to control the eczema on my elbows and the hair line. It has controlled my breakouts better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Tough to surprise me but I was surprised at the conditioning it provided my hair without making it oily.  I use it on my face every night.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is wonderful! I use it along with Evening Primrose Oil and Neem oil.  I absolutely love it because it soaks into the skin effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Works as well as other organ oil I have tried in many price ranges. I really like the pump it&#x27;s in. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good either. I am thinking I might add lavender or something to some of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just a couple weeks and my hands feel so much better already. They were cracked and bleeding from this crazy midwest winter we&#x27;ve had, but finally they&#x27;re getting back to normal! I was using other moisturizers constantly, but they just weren&#x27;t doing the trick. This has been just what my hands needed! My face and hair are looking better, too, but nothing has been more relieving than feeling my hands no be torn to shreds!</li>
    <li> This is my second time of ordering. Best skin product that I&#x27;ve found1</li>
    <li> Smells very good. Could tell right away skin was softer. Used in my hair after washing and didnt leave hair oily and controlled frizz. left hair feeling soft to. Good for lotion and skin!</li>
    <li> Just a small drop of this oil goes a longggg way! It will leave your hair so silky and bouncy and healthy! I use it with my flat iron and it feels like silk. This is so healthy for you hair. I didnt use this on my face, my hair need much repair so i used it on there.</li>
    <li> Love the pump dispensing, much easier than the droplet. Oil is super moisturizing and great quality.</li>
    <li> Ohhhhhh my GOD. Love this oil. Am delirious if I forget to put it on in the morning before I head out. Thinking about buying another bottle just to keep in my purse. LOL!  Light and rich, love the scent!!</li>
    <li> Good item...I&#x27;ve owned one before and it&#x27;s the same thing. This oil is light weight and is good for hair and body. I also got this as a discount to review the item.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for your hair and skin. I have mixed it into our skincare and hair are products along with vit E oil, jojoba oil, sweet almond oil and rose oil. I have also mixed all of this, plus some retinol serum in some of our skin products.</li>
    <li> So far I am liking this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling in my hair or skin because I also use it on my face at night as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> There was mold in the bottle when I opened it.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  The sellers are very nice.  Sunday delivery!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, smells great and moisturizes my face without it feeling greasy. I am looking forward for the results I will see in the weeks to come! I would recommend that you try it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my usual drugstore brand of argan oil for hair. I did not like it for that purpose. I prefer the silicone based less natural product for my hair. This argan oil was a little to heavy and greasy for my hair. I did like it however for a body and face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo34F83JN9LIZOJ]]I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for several months and it has helped soften and nourish my dry hands. I&#x27;ve also used it on my nails and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite versatile and this particular product is certified organic and pure (no additives.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil has an earthy, nutty type of fragrance. It&#x27;s not obnoxious in any way. The benefits to dry hands and nails is immediate. Continued use will really help nourish your hands and nails. I&#x27;ve also used it in my hair and it gives hair a nice natural sheen and helps control the frizzies. It&#x27;s supposed to be very beneficial for split ends although that is not an issue I have. And you can use it on your face to help reduce fine lines. It has quite a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all Argan Oil products are organic or pure so be sure you know what you are getting. This is pure, certified organic and priced well at the time of my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free sample for review.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and on schedule.  I&#x27;ve been using it on skin and hair, and it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent - I&#x27;ve paid more for bottles that were smaller.  You do not sacrifice quality here, I think it&#x27;s a great product and you only need a little bit to be great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub into skin after your shower and onto the ends of your hair after styling and you&#x27;ll see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Seller even followed up via email to ensure satisfaction with both shipping and with the product itself!</li>
    <li> This oil feels as rich and luxurious on my skin as the bottle it comes in looks. It rubs in easily and leaves my skin soft without making it oily. I also use it in my hair as a treatment before showers and as a smoother after I dry my hair to keep my hair soft and touchable. (and get rid of the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;)  My hair has never looked better and it also has helped keep my scalp hydrated and flake free. It&#x27;s way better than any moisturizer I could think of using-it&#x27;s all natural and leaves my skin soft and touchable without the added chemicals or greasy feeling some oils leave behind. It has even replaced my regular facial moisturizer. A must have in any beauty regime.</li>
    <li> I truly love this organic argan oil. It helps my daughter&#x27;s hair not be frizzy and dry. It keeps it shiny and healthy looking.  Just a couple drops goes a long way.  This bottle will last a long time.  It works great on dry cracked skin as well.  We use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Have used it for about a week ,really like the way my skin feels ,it is not greasy absorbs into my skin quickly ,yes I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I had previously posted that I believed the oil went bad - it didn&#x27;t, it must have been my nose at the time when I wasn&#x27;t feeling well.  This oil is awesome and the pump works beautifully unlike other pumps I&#x27;ve used which get clogged or stop working.  It&#x27;s really strong.&lt;br /&gt;I use the oil on my face twice a day after toner and before moisurizer - it may sound like too much, but I&#x27;m in my late 50s and this oil keeps my face really young looking.  The price is awesome!  I also use it on my fingernails and sometimes on the ends of my hair if it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m making my own skin care products and have been using argan oil as one of the main ingredients of my facial serum for years with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organic argan oil is wonderful! And for the price, I&#x27;m hooked for life. I used to use Aura Cacia argan oil and I honestly, I see/feel/smell no difference. Same quality. Same texture. Same color. Same slightly nutty fragrance. Non comedogenic. Absorbs quickly. Moisturizes wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but no – this is the real deal. The same argan oil we get in Europe directly from Morocco, and the same quality as the best argan oil available in the U.S.</li>
    <li> Good oil, but has a bad smell.</li>
    <li> Great size for travel! And the pump gives the perfect amount every time. A little goes a long way. I think the oil smells a little weird, but that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m used to using other oils such as coconut and olive oil. Just one pump does the trick for my hands and the ends of my hair!</li>
    <li> Great to use for hair growth and softening!</li>
    <li> Initially, I was on a hunt for a new hair oil. I&#x27;d purchased a very pricey Moroccan hair oil from a cosmetics store and though I loved it, I did not love the $50 price tag, so I took to Amazon, read reviews, did a little research on the Internet and decided that Argan oil is what I needed to try. I found this particular brand intriguing because the price was so reasonable and the reviews were so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this purchase. I never thought I would dare put an oil on my face, fearing that I would break out, but I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for more than a week and my skin is beautiful. It absorbs quickly and my makeup brushes over the oil base without issue. And even though I use a foundation powder, I can still feel the softness of my skin under the powder. My face has a soft somewhat dewy look...not oily or shiny!  I&#x27;ve just got a soft glow that peaks out from behind the makeup in all the right places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also goes on very light and not at all greasy!  The trick is to not use too much!  When they recommend 1-3 drops that&#x27;s all you need. I just push out a small pump and rub it between my palms and smooth it over my face. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed someone&#x27;s complaint that for treating their hair it was too thick and heavy...again, you only need a little bit. The first time I tried it in my hair, I used way too much, but the second time, I just pumped once into my palms and rubbed them together then I ran my hands through my hair making sure to rub it in to my split ends. My hair looks amazing now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started using it on my breasts to remove stretch marks. I&#x27;m not sure how well it can do, but I do believe that moisturizing your breasts with the oil can only help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works great with dry patches of skin. My elbows get ashy...common Filipino burden and when they get ashy they get dark. I&#x27;ve started to slough my elbows and then rub this oil into them and after just a few days my elbows are soft and no longer discolored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also saw that there had been complaints by some that their product smelled like rotten walnuts?  I haven&#x27;t experienced this. My oil has a very faint scent if it has a scent at all. I think that if you happen along a bad batch, which I can&#x27;t imagine is often if you take into consideration all of the favorable reviews, that you simply do an exchange for a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this Argan oil. I&#x27;ve never been one to have much of a beauty routine, but this oil has become mine and it&#x27;s all I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan!nd no longer discolored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also saw that there had been complaints by some that their product smelled like rotten walnuts?

    <li> This is an excellent product the oil in very small amounts moisterizes my hair.</li>
    <li> Love love this!  I&#x27;ve used other oils for skin and hair in the past (including coconut), but this is my favorite. It&#x27;s not too heavy, so it&#x27;s great for hair, but still moisturizing. It cleared my husband eczema up overnight. I used it as an eye makeup remover and it was perfect!  It got my waterproof mascara off with just a few rubs.</li>
    <li> This oil left my hair feeling moisturized without that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel that can sometime happen when dealing with oils. It was super absorbent. The only issue I had was the smell. It had a nutty smell to it and I wasn&#x27;t fond of it.</li>
    <li> Where do I start? This oil is like butter on your skin! It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin so dang incredibly soft! I mix this oil with essential oils, put it in a roller ball vial and use it on my face every night and morning. I have very long hair and this has helped in keeping it strong and shiny. I have wavy/curly hair that poofs in the Florida humidity and this is the only oil that has helped keep it tame and not look oily/greasy/stringy. It is also a wonderful oil for your nails and cuticles. I use it after a foot soak and after shaving and it has not disappointed me! Just ask my husband!</li>
    <li> I overheard someone telling my daughter that her hair felt soft and looks good and asked her what she used in it.  She told the person that she uses Argan oil for hair and skin.  I never heard of this product before, so I went to the internet to find information about it.  My search was for a pure natural organic organic form of the product and selected the voilave ECO certified Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have nothing but praises for this product.  The first thing I noticed was that, it was so easy to apply to the hair and skin.  WOW! - It seems like magic; in a very short time my hair felt soft and moist and my skin felt soft and smooth.  I also noticed that the palm of my hands was also soft and smooth –instead of greasy as with other products- and fingernails and cuticles looked much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in my family are now using the voilave Organic Argan Oil for hair, skin, facial  and nail care and  we have gotten rid of almost all the other products we bought for the same purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I and my family highly recommend this product with no reservations.</li>
    <li> Sharing the oil with the men in the family, they liked it so much I had to purchase an extra bottle.</li>
    <li> Use this on my face at night- mostly around eyes.  I have used it for dryness around my nose during cold season also- works great.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price.  I use it nightly on my face.  Not to heavy.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone.  It has help me personally with my hair. Keep my hair very silky and shiny. I honestly felt like I came out of the salon.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it use it for the skin</li>
    <li> Be aware that this does have an unpleasant odor! It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not a good smell either. It has sort of a motor oil smell to it. That said, it does wonders to moisturize my dry skin in winter and protect my hair. I&#x27;m glad there isn&#x27;t any artificial fragrance, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it smelled just a little nicer. I&#x27;m very self conscious about how my hair must smell when I wear this.</li>
    <li> I simply haven&#x27;t had this long enough to give it the extra star.. But, so far so good.  I&#x27;m transitioning from products containing silicones and sulphates - The curly girl technique, rather than fighting my natural waves &amp; curls.  I&#x27;ve been using a lot of silicone-laden products along with a blow dryer and flat iron to keep my hair straight.  It&#x27;s been so high maintenance I decided to give up and make the most of my curls.  This Organic argan oil is part of my regimen to put precious moisture back in my hair so that my curls are soft and shiny.  Nice large bottle of argan oil for a good price.  Note: I was using Josie Maran&#x27;s prior, for face &amp; nails.  That gets expensive, so I was delighted to find a comparable product for much less.</li>
    <li> great product,thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this VoilaVe argan oil.  It&#x27;s easy to apply; it&#x27;s light, and it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The oil is very thin and way too &#x27;oily&#x27; to actually put into my hair. I was hoping for more of a syrup consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Instead I mix this with my other products - especially for lotions. I add a couple of drops to give my scented lotions to keep my legs mostizured.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my hair to rebuild some of the damaged follicles and it&#x27;s been crazy how much stronger my hair has gotten. It&#x27;s been falling out less, and the more that I use it the shinier and more lush it looks. I occasionally use it on my skin as a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s mostly for my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other brands as well but sometimes they make my hair seem a little too greasy... not with this product. I never have to worry about putting too much in. Next bottle on it&#x27;s way soon!</li>
    <li> Love this product for so many reasons. This product seems to be the best one so far. Care and concern for the customer is definitely shown. I will buy this oil on a regular basis as well as their other products.</li>
    <li> I like the oil.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it comes with a glass dropper closure instead of plastic splay cap.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil! I was using another brand that cost way more - this is the same thing at a better price!!!</li>
    <li> This is not good.  It reeks like rancid walnuts.  It also doesn&#x27;t absorb nicely like others I&#x27;ve used from trusted brands the health food store.  I&#x27;ve given it a fair try on 3 occasions for a week or more each time, my husband even commented all 3 times that whatever I was using smelled &amp;#34;unpleasant&amp;#34; (not actual word) and I should take it back because it must be bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading farther into the reviews it seems many people were given the item for free or insanely cheap in exchange for their &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review.</li>
    <li> I love my Organic Argan Oil for Hair &amp; Face!! I have sensitive skin and some products i have put on my hair get on my skin and have caused some type of irritation. But this product is organic and 100% pure and has not caused any reactions. It also leaves my hair silky and shiny.:)</li>
    <li> love it!!!!  I have tried many produces including WEN for my 5 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair, She has spirual curly hair and it gets pretty dry at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;so after washing her hair i would apply it to her towel dry hair, i would rub two pums on my hand because she has long hair, rub to her ends of hair than work my way up, blow dry warm. I WAS AMAZED ON HOW SOFT, SILKY AND EASY IT WAS TO CUMB THOUGHT HER CURLY HAIR!!!  So i have dry ends and i have colored treated hair as well and it made my long hair soft and silky feel to it as well. i would highly recommend this produce to an one.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my skin and hair!! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is cold-pressed oil from the kernel of the seed of the fruit of the Argania spinosa tree, native to Morocco. It is 100% pure and organic and has the expected natural scent, slightly sweet and rather nutty, with earthy components consistent with its high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz. amber glass bottle has a pump cap for easy dispensing. Just a few squirts goes a long way to condition and protect the skin and hair. It is quickly absorbed and locks in moisture, leaving the skin smooth and moist, and the hair shiny, but not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it at least a couple of times a day, after bathing or showering and whenever my skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voil&amp;agrave;Ve provided a sample of this 100% pure and organic argan oil for evaluation and review and I definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> The delibera was verte fast and o lose the product</li>
    <li> This is 100% Argan oil and I was not expecting much from it because of the low cost but I must say it has made a difference in my wife&#x27;s skin she has sever psoriasis and this as helped help make hers skin flaking a lot less that without the use of the oil. We will  be buying the product again if the results stay the same. I can&#x27;t give it five stasr because the jury is still out on will this have a lasting effect on her skin condition.</li>
    <li> This argon oil is really good. And has a slight nutty scent which tells me it is pure and unrefined. Very good on the skin.</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase. Have bought argan oil before but not from this vendor. When I opened it and smelled it I thought it smelled &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; or like a slight vinegar smell and was initially disappointed. Applied to skin on hands an forearms and the smell goes away quickly and the skin was noticeably softer and smoother. Had another person smell the oil and they didn&#x27;t agree with me on the smell so I was reassured. I like the  included pump that makes it convenient to use without trying to recap the glass bottle with oily hands. I plan to use as a carrier oil in my own homemade lotions and body butters with essential oils. I would purchase again. Everyone has a different concept of fragrances and I am glad that I did not return the oil when my first impression was not the same as a different purchase of argan oil. I did contact the vendor via email and they were very polite and very helpful to me. I was most convinced when I had another person smell the oil and their impression was not the same as mine but instead they liked the smell and did not perceive it the same as I did. As I said the slight odor does not linger.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and love, love, love it! I also got my daughter started on it. It works great  on your hair, just  2 pumps after you wash your hair and you don&#x27;t have frizzy hair, even when you sleep on it wet! And it&#x27;s not oily. Also works great for dry skin and as a moisturizer for my face.</li>
    <li> I really like the Argan oil.. I got it for my skin - I quit smoking so the damage is done, but the Argan has made the skin feel and look much better. I have even received unsolicited compliments. I have also used in my hair - which is thinner and graying and my hair feels nice, not so dry. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love it ! Keeps my skin clea and hydrated perfect for acne prone skin</li>
    <li> This is a nice Argan oil at a great price. I have used Argan oil that is three times this price and I can tell very little difference in the two</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my curly hair so soft and manageable. It&#x27;s also great for my dry skin. It&#x27;s also quite a lot of product for the price. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was gifted the Argan Oil for my birthday and have been thrilled with it.  I have used Argan Oil in the past, but this product is superior to those I tried before.  If the Vitamin C serum is as good as the oil, this will have been the best gift ever.  The sunscreen factor is particularly appealing.</li>
    <li> Give this Argan Oil a try! I have been using this product for a few months now  for dry skin - hands and neck area in particular - and have found it it be gentle and effective. It did not cause any irritation, redness or excessive greasiness. A little goes a long way, so keep that in mind when using it on dry hair issues. I have waist length hair and a drop less than the size of a dime can be to much. The shine is beautiful and the oil aspect actually can last through a hair washing. A great addition to help with your winter hair problems. Be conservative in the amount you use for your hair treatments, but in that respect, this bottle is really an economic deal! I do apply it on my hands etc. in the morning &amp; evening for best results in the exceptionally dry weather. Try it and enjoy the results!</li>
    <li> 100% Argan Oil. Smell is tolerable I ordered 2 already and gave them to my sister . Recommend thier product and the shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> I used this oil for about 6 month now ! And it didn&#x27;t broke me down ,it&#x27;s very light ,doesn&#x27;t have asmell at all and it did hydrated my face very will the bottle last for  avery long time !so you get a good deal for your money .i love it .</li>
    <li> The oil is great . Is not sticky and does not leave greasy feeling in your hair . It doesn&#x27;t smell all that good but that is only because how pure it is and it does not have added ingredients harmful for your scalp and hair . Only reason I&#x27;d give it 4 stars is because it does not function well when I put it on my wet hair before blow drying ... It makes the hair look dull and fried if used before any kind of heat treatment . With that said, I should also add it leaves a glossy bounce to flyaway hair if you rub a pea sized amount on your hair after shower and let them air dry naturally.</li>
    <li> This is some great stuff. It&#x27;s light and smells great. I have locs and this is perfeict. I did receive for review. I use on my face and nails also. Just a great product. I combined coconut oil and this smells so good</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried Aragon oil. I bought this to use in my hair and on my nails. I have always had split ends, and frizzy hair no matter what products I use or how often I cut my hair. So I have been putting this on my hair mixed with Now Almond Oil. So far my hair has been silky smooth, no frizz and no split ends. I don&#x27;t have to use my normal leave in, frizz-control serum. Just the oils and I&#x27;m good to go.  I would definitely recommend this Aragon oil. The company has had amazing customer service. Checking if I received the product on time and wether I  Iiked it or not. I was very impressed with Voilave, and will be ordering more of their products.</li>
    <li> love it, use this daily as my morning and night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Argan oil ever since I saw it on America&#x27;s top model!  I have super dry skin and it really makes my rough skin feel so soft.  I was also amazed at how it soaked right into my heels, they haven&#x27;t looked that great in forever!  I use it sparingly on my hair, and it keeps the &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; away!  And right now its so dry I need all the help I can get.  Love that its organic.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Love how it makes my hair and skin feel!</li>
    <li> What a great product!  Don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; scare you. This is the most amazing moisturizer. I use it on my face at night, in my hair, on my dry elbows, knees and rub it into my cuticles and hands at night,  This will feel slightly greasy at first but absorbs into your skin immediately. I have noticed such a difference in the smoothness and texture of my skin. I rub it thru my hair at night, wash it the next morning and my hair has the smoothest texture and a healthy feel. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Nice size bottle for the price. I have been using a more expensive argan oil(smaller bottle) and finally ran out and ordered this. Works just as well. I have been using this product for my daughter hair and I use it on my skin especially around my eye area.</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic product at a the best price point i have come across. it comes in a glass jar with a pump applicator. use it on your face, legs, arms, nails.... wonderful moisturizer and no bad smell whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few days now. I don&#x27;t really see a difference. I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair. Even when i tried it on my cuticles, it didn&#x27;t do anything. The smell is what i don&#x27;t like the most and makes me dislike the product. It has this weird food oil smell. I expected it to smell somewhat like the Jose Maran argan oil,  which i own and is more expensive, since they both are essentially 100% argan oil. the jose maran argan oil doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent but it is not bothersome. This VoilaVe one has a scent that bothers me. I&#x27;m thinking that it smells a bit like soy sauce? not 100% sure but it does remind me of soy sauce. Ugh, who wants that smell in their hair or skin. In addition, do not overload your hair with it because it WILL make your hair look a bit oily, unlike the jose maran one which dries on your hair.</li>
    <li> A lot of argon oil for the price! I use this as my face lotion and have noticed a  huge improvement to my skin texture and less breakouts!! The oil had a little bit of a strong smell (more so than the usual argon oil i have purchsed at my local health store) but I added lavender oil to it, which is also good for skin and now it&#x27;s smells great.</li>
    <li> The product was as described and at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;The seller bothered me on multiple, multiple occasions to write a review. So annoying!</li>
    <li> I wanted to stop using coconut oil on my face because I was afraid it was causing me to break out. I started using this and I am so glad I did. I don&#x27;t break out as often anymore and my skin feels so soft and moisturized. I also love it on my hands.</li>
    <li> You would think adding oil to your skin would create a problem.  Actually, this oil balances the skin and rejuvenates it, making it look and feel younger and more beautiful.  I have passed this bottle on to my niece who has a problem with the skin on her hands.  When she uses the oil on her hands, the very dry red skin goes away and her hands look normal.  I had such a wonderful experience with it I wanted to give it to her.  I will definitely continue to use Organic Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a little baby and she had come into some cradle cap.  I got a small comb and worked the big flakes of skin off her cap.  Then I put quite a bit of argan oil on her scalp.  Amazingly, the Argan Oil moisturized the healthy skin under her dry skin, and the rest of the dead flakes released themselves from her scalp without any discomfort from her.  I combed them out with a comb.  I then put a little more oil on the healthy skin underneath.  Plus, the argan oil moisturized her little head and helped prevent the cradle cap from reoccurring.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  For years I have had a dry scalp.  It would start itching after a day and half.  I&#x27;ve used medicated shampoos, prescription products and tea tree shampoos.  Now I just massage this oil into my scalp, let it sit about and hour and then wash my hair as usual.  I can go 4 days instead of 2 between shampoos....The four ounce size is great, pump works fantastic and overall this is a great product.  I&#x27;ve reordered and even bought a bottle for my mother.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to find a more natural alternative to some hair cremes and oils.  I usually used a Moroccan Argan oil that helped repair damaged ends and bring shine back to the hair but there were a lot of other chemical fillers added as well.  I started using this product and I found that a very tiny amount, a couple drops, blends well into all my hair and doesn&#x27;t look too oily at all (the first couple tries, using the same as the old products I had been using was too much - now with this product I really only need a few drops).  It really helps nourish my hair and I am very satisfied with the product.  The company co-founder even personally emailed me to see how I liked the product, showing how much they value their customers.  Definitely happy and will continue to purchase :D</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Its a light, no smell oil and can be used on hair and skin daily with no side effects what so ever.</li>
    <li> I got it yesterday and used it this morning. So far I love it. I found someone on a tutorial using argan oil so I had to buy it. It was worth it. It came quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of Argan oils over the years, and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Argan Oil, but sometimes some of them are not as 100% Pure, which is why I love the VoilaVe Argan oil, because it is! Also sometimes you find that some argan oil can have a weird, sometimes even nasty smell, but this Argan Oil has a very pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used Argain Oil, they really are an all-in-1 beauty treatment AND totally affordable! I love using my VoileVe Argan Oil for my skincare regimen, as well as my hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, super dry hair, and It&#x27;s always in major need of moisture. This Argan oil is so incredible moisturizing, I have absolutely noticed a difference with my hair right away! I apply a little (you only need a drop or two) to my hair at night. I smooth through it, then throw it up on top of my head, and wake to super soft, moisturized strands. I also concentrate mostly on the ends of my hair to help seal in the moisture at the ends where I need it most. My hair has been so incredibly soft and manageable and I&#x27;ve also had no frizz since I started using this product daily! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my dry hair, I suffer from dry skin and nails too. I love using this argan oil daily on my cuticles to help moisturize them. It works as a really great moisturizer for nails! My cuticles have been softer since using! Also, I&#x27;ve recently been suffering from hang nails, but not since I&#x27;ve been using my VoilaVe Argan Oil daily on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, you guessed it, I have dry skin on my face as well. I wash with a foaming cleanser morning and night, then apply my VoilaVe Argan oil as a moisturizer, and have not suffered from any dry skin while using it! A little goes a long way, you only need a drop or two, then pat your face, and that&#x27;s it! Takes two seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used lots of argan oil on my face before and to be honest have not liked it because it tends to just sit on my skin and make it look and feel oily. The VoilaVe Argan Oil soaked into my skin right away! I only had to wait for a minute or two and then I could lie my head on my pillow, and no oil was coming off and onto my pillowcase (which has definitely happened with some argan oil products I&#x27;ve used in the past)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes an amazing moisturizer and is really so great for your skin! I also used it on the front and back of my neck, as well as the back of my hands, where I normally apply a night cream, to keep my skin looking moisturized, healthy, and youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve absolutely loved using this Argan Oil from VoilaVe and highly recommend it to anyone looking for smoother, softer skin, hair, and/or nails! You will absolutely not be disappointed with this product!  AND you will save lots of $ by not having to buy several different products for your hair, nails, and skin, because this Argan Oil works for all three of them!Ve Argan Oil soaked into my skin right away!

    <li> Bought this a few months ago and I must say this is probably the best argan oil I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s light and absorbs almost instantly into the skin. It also helped my eczema. I even use it on my nails and cuticle oil! Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this argan oil after seeing the reviews. The price was reasonable compared to what were sold in beauty stores. You get a lot with this product. I used 4 drops on my face at night. It smells good. The pump is a nice and convenient feature. I generally don&#x27;t like droppers for facial products, because it can get messy. I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on my skin after using the product, but in the winter time, it did help with dryness. I will continue to use this product as a moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t used any argan oil by a different brand, so I can&#x27;t compare the performance of this particular brand of argan oil.</li>
    <li> 100 % Argan oil at great value. This is.a large 4 oz. bottle that will last a long time for skin &amp; hair use. It is an incredible oil that moisturizers while leaving no oily residue. It just seenes to disappear while leaving all the benefits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the  Organic Argan Oil for a few weeks now on my skin and hair, Ive noticed an immediate difference in the texture of my skin on extra dry elbows, I apply the oil after I shower and my elbows stay moisturized and soft all day.and I don&#x27;t have to reapply my skin remains super soft:) with no greasy after feeling and I also use it as a hair treatment I apply a few drops to my hair and hair ends and I&#x27;ve notice a complete difference in my hair before using the argan oil I had lots of split ends since using the oil my hair has no split ends and is very soft and silky....I really enjoy known that a few drops of oil goes along way:)I have an amazing shine on my hair without it being weighed down</li>
    <li> I have a wonderful 100% Argan Oil that I wanted to share with you today called VoilaVe Organics Argan Oil that I think you are going to love, especially if you have dry hair like I do. Of course, there are many other uses for this Argan Oil but I mainly wanted it for my hair and the other benefits are icing on the cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle comes in a pump action bottle so be careful about getting too much when you press the pump. I did the first time and I got way too much, but was able to run it through my hair and have some left over for my hands and nails. They use a pump instead of a dropper so it can be used in the shower and because it will reduce bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and hair, so this was a welcome relief to have something natural and organic that I could use on just about everywhere and not have to worry about harmful ingredients. I have thyroid issues along with several other health problems and do take a fair amount of prescription medications so I am sure those help make my skin even more prone to problems. So, it was very important to me to try to stay as natural &amp; organic as I could so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about more things entering my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Argan Oil absorbs quickly and does have a slight scent but not overpowering and you shouldn&#x27;t notice it that much. As I have stated before in numerous posts, I really prefer products that are light and can easily be absorbed as I don&#x27;t like having a greasy or shiny face, and this one did just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as I also stated, I used it mostly in my hair and for that, and I was extremely pleased that it did make my hair more shiny and less frizzy. When I put my hair up in a ponytail, I have a nice sleek look and not one with wild hair sprouting all over the place.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for restoring that shine and luster that&#x27;s lost over time. This needs to be part of your daily or weekly hair regiment! I love the way it ends up leaving my hair, smelling good, looking healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural ingredient&#x27;s in this product is a win win for all hair types, and we all know Argan Oil is one of the best products to use on our Hair and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed directly onto my hair and combed it and put my hair up , and it worked fabulous! I am going to keep using this and I am getting my daughter to use it too.</li>
    <li> This argan oil doesn&#x27;t penetrate my hair and scalp as much as the famous blue label all over TV and internet.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a sticky and greasy residue on my hair for hours and wont wash off easily. I suppose this would be good for general purpose skin moisturizer but not for hair</li>
    <li> Smells good. I have used this on my face, my hair and my skin when I&#x27;m feeling dry. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> My hair and skin love its.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use it for my hair and skin. I See already the improvement on my hair, it looks healthier and I don&#x27;t see make splits like before, my skin is softer even when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except weigh it down. It made it look dull and greasy. It must be this product because the store more affordable brands do more for my hair for shine and sleekness than this product. I am so upset I wasted my money on this!!</li>
    <li> Saw this in a beauty salon , decided to check it out on Amazon, and was half the price. I have used it only for a few days and it is the very best oil for everything. Hair nails face etc.. I would recommend this to my best friends. An added bonus was their free trial with absolutely no tricks. I asked their customer service about this and they are the best... Good Good buy.. 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> The oil feels wonderful on my skin! I would recommend this to everyone! I also received it the next day and just love the product:)</li>
    <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.  It just takes a little bit for your hair. Make sure its rubbed in to your hands and then start at the bottom of your hair.  I started at the top and it was too much.  It looked like a grease spot on one side of my head. The rest of my hair looked and felt nice and soft. I rubbed any excess in to my hands and cuticles. Made them super soft!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use 1-2 squirts on my face in the morning &amp; at night as a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve stopped using expensive moisturizers - as a result, my skin looks better and I&#x27;m saving a great deal of money. I also use argan oil on the ends of my hair before bed, on my hands, and on my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like VoilaVe&#x27;s product because it&#x27;s one of the best values on Amazon (cost per ounce) and the bottle is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This oil s packaged in a nice pump bottle which I love because I always forget to screw the dropper bottle back on the oils I have used in the past, causing chance of spilling. it is a large quantity at a great price and is good quality.  I had read in another review that it has a order but I do not find that to be the case.  It is odorless and light and makes my skin silkie. It absorbs well leaving my hands and skin soft. My cuticles need all the help they can get, they respond very well with this Argan Oil and heal quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My skin is very dry, I a live in the mountains where the climate is brutally arid causing an itchy uncomfortable condition. I have been using VoilaVe rose hip oil  which I love, on my face, in my bath oil and it is luxurious. I have now added my new Argan oil to the concoction of rose hip oil, argan oil and almond oil, scented with lavender which creates the best bath oil I have used.. It is lovely and very effective after shower oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, good customer service, quality product at a good price-good value.  Seller backs the product with a  100% guaranty.</li>
    <li> Good quality and value for money</li>
    <li> I have used other Argon oils int he past but they have left me greasy and with acne around my hairline. GROSS This one however was recommended by a friend of mine and she was on point. I use it on my hair my cuticles my elbows.. Super absorbent and effective. LOVE it Great value too</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t many products that would make me write a review, but this one did. I love it! I had never used any hair oil before, but some friends encouraged me to try it because I was complaining about how dry my hair is getting during my (ahem) perimenopausal years. I was dubious - my hair is very fine and I figured hair oil would make it look greasy or stringy. I looked for an argan oil with no added silicones, which was tough to find, but that was important to me. I have used the VoilaVe three times - just THREE! - and my hair looks thicker and lusher already. No greasies. Just...wow. I guess I need to try it on my skin and nails next. So thrilled with this purchase, surprisingly so.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair shiny and manageable without stickiness or buildup.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> love. i use it for my face too. goodbye to all face creams this isnt greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used argan oil before  and really liked it but this brand is even better. I mix it with a little water and smooth it on my face at night and my skin looks amazing. I&#x27;m finding that I want to smooth it all over my skin. Even on my hands that have eczema it seems to help a lot when other creams don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> A tiny bit in the hair goes a long way and makes it soft and shiny.. also, I never thought I&#x27;d put oil on my face but this is awesome. I did decide that it&#x27;s too much during the day in the Texas heat/humidity, so I&#x27;ve only been using it on my face at night until the fall arrives. It seems to be as good or better than my expensive estee lauder products in terms of skin clarity! Also makes nails look shiny and smooth like I just buffed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the service was great, someone contacted me after I bought it to see if I had any other questions.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am just a regular woman who wanted to try a pure Argan oil product. I did not receive this as a free sample and was in no way enticed into buying it. I have thick curly hair and for a year or two have been using a silicone hair oil (with argan oil &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34;) and loved what it did for my hair. However, in a goal to be a bit more natural and to remove the silicones I started a search on Amazon for pure Argan oil. This one kept popping up based on the good price, large 4oz size, and excellent reviews. I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the reviews are a little fishy, but I wanted to add my own input. So for my first experience with Argan oil, I am nothing less than thrilled. I purchased it as a hair product, and for that, it is ok. I have to be honest and say I like with the silicones do to my hair (softer, shinier, less tangled, good bouncy curls) and will likely keep using those products. However, I didn&#x27;t realize that this product is recommended for skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it for that up a storm. I have been struggling with scalp psoriasis for years and using topical steroids, but they have only kept it mild, and not resolved it. Within 2 weeks of daily to every other day use of this oil (and stopping steroids completely) my scalp is almost completely normal. Just for that I am ecstatic. My 2 year old daughter has also had a dry scalp for months now, and I had tried lots of home remedies (zero shampooing, olive oil, massaging conditioner onto her scalp) and within 3 uses of this product (let it sit on her scalp for 10 minutes, then washed away with shampoo) her scalp is back to normal. I will only keep using it on her if it the dry skin returns. I&#x27;ve also been using on my face as a nightly moisturizer, and I love it. It makes my skin incredibly soft (but it&#x27;s much too oily for a morning product before makeup). I have also been using it as a moisturizer on my legs after shaving (excellent) and on my hands andcuticles (works ok--I actually prefer a hand lotion that seems to last a bit longer). So regardless of some of the moderate uses, the excellence in scalp and face moisturizing makes this an absolute must have product for me and one that I am super excited to have found.</li>
    <li> Great for skin and hair, what could be better</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 2 weeks now, and I have used it on my hair and face. I am a TRUE believer! NO BS. I&#x27;m 52 years old and although I don&#x27;t want to use the word &amp;#34;miracle,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s dang close!</li>
    <li> This argan oil is very light and delicate and works well in my handmade moisturizer.  Most oils have an eye dropper but this one has top that depresses to dispense the oil which makes it special.  It&#x27;s just easier to use in a number of applications like applying to my hair and scalp where I work it in and let it set a bit before washing my hair.  I really appreciate this delivery system because sometimes when using the oil, my hands get slippery, so repeatedly dunking an eyedropper cap to extract the right amount gets to be awkward.  With this bottle that isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good sized bottle and the oil seems somewhat lighter than some other brands, but still says it&#x27;s pure and organic.  That combination makes it ideal for certain applications.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about Argan Oil, I decided to try it. I&#x27;m glad I did! I have dry, coarse hair. After a few weeks of using this Argan Oil, my hair feels much healthier and it looks incredibly soft and shiny. It only takes a couple of drops to condition my short, thick hair. This is my favorite hair-care product!</li>
    <li> The product was well package and is exactly the item that I ordered.  The shipping was super fast.  I used it right away in the morning and at night and it does not leave my skin oily.  It works really well with my moisturizer.  The price was very reasonable for the size of the bottle.  It&#x27;s a really good buy and I will buy it again.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> This argan oil is rancid upon arrival. It smell so foul and there are black spots floating around the bottle when I poured it into a clear glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t trust this brand or put it anywhere near my face.</li>
    <li> I love this, I&#x27;ve tried others and they have a weird smell.  This one has no smell. Feels amazing on my skin and hair! I use with the the insta naturals vitamin C serum and just using them both in two weeks I have stopped wearing foundation that is how good my skin looks. My hair feels amazing.  I know hair loves argan oil though. I&#x27;m excited to see the long term effects of this oil being used on my 3B ,3C curls.  Definitely a lot of product also. Great product to have always.  It never feels oily either as long as you use the directed amount.</li>
    <li> This is a really Wonderful product for hair , I have very dry processed hair that really need help . using this argan oil has made my hair so nice and shinny I think and a little goes much farther because you only need to use a bit of it to work . its good also for so many other things Its really great for all kinds of protecting the skin and making hair so pretty and younger looking even at my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to try in order to make an informed review for my blog and amazon but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Pros: shipped extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged very securely... if not waste fully so lol&lt;br /&gt;As described pure argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Felt great on the skin, face, feet, and hair. But do follow instructions carefully and do not over use on hair... you will look like a great monkey with even slightly too much!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: seems thinner than a different brand I have used. Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the outcome just yet but I have only used it a few times. Will let you know in a further detailed update in the future.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3CLWCNQFSO55W]]I began using Argan on daily basis this winter after my hairdresser recommended that I began using it in my hair because she noticed that the hair on top of my head felt dry. She called it \\&quot;hat hair\\&quot;. She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter. A few drops does not make the hair look or feel greasy. My hairdresser said it can be applied to dry hair or wet hair with the same effectiveness. The key is not to apply too much not have a greasy hair look. On my next appointment she said she could see the difference that the hair felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VoilaVe Argan Oil comes in a 4 oz bottle with a spray applicator. The oil is practically unscented, it has a slight nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried bottles with different applicators: spray bottles and bottle with droplets. I found bottle with droplet applicators for the use on hair (easier not to get oil on things you don&#x27;t want to get oily) and for controlling the amount you dispense. When I use it on my legs to treat dry skin the spray works okay as I can see where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil provided by VoilaVe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an organic Argon oil for a while now but they were expensiive.  This oil is in a much bigger bottle than most others.  My hair is very long so I try to keep it moisturized.  With this oil my hair is very soft and shiny.  I was apprehensive to put it on my face because I have sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t irritate at all.  My hands are soft.  I will definitely make this part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> This VoilaVe 100% Organic Argan Oil is really doing wonders for my face. My main goal on using this exclusive product is to get rid of my acne marks and nourish my skin. It&#x27;s being only a couple of days, but I am seeing results. Thanks for providing such a remarkable product.</li>
    <li> Argon oil is a wonderful moisturizing/ anti-aging product. I especially loved this product because it is 100% Argon oil so I use it on my skin and hair. Love it</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair and like the results</li>
    <li> Great for homemade lotion</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my hair and my face! My hair is a bit dry so I have tried many hair treatments products trying to bring some life back. Wow! This argan oil literally restored the moisture and my hair looks better than ever. I also used this on my face since I had some dry patches, it works on my face just as well! I am sold on this oil and will buy again</li>
    <li> I was given a full size sample of this organic argan oil by the company VoilaVe to review.  To be honest, when they first contact me I was surprised as I had never heard of them.  However I have found many times that much smaller companies tend to provide better quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This arrived to my house a little over two weeks ago and I was totally surprised by the size of the bottle.  It was a 4 oz size bottle which is considered massive (in my opinion) compared to the other companies that sell argan oil.  It came in a dark opaque glass bottle with a pump which was a first for me!  I actually loved the idea of the pump because it was great in not allowing unnecessary air, light or bacteria into the bottle.  This argan oil is also 100% certified Organic &amp; ECO and USDA Certified.  So you know you are buying the real thing when you purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied this serum, I was impressed by the texture.  This serum was so silky.  This for sure was something I have never felt before.  It didn&#x27;t feel heavy weight or greasy (though we know its an oil) and adsorb really quick on to the skin.  It didn&#x27;t have any rancid smell and no settlements so far have come out the bottle.  It was yellow clearish color (if that makes sense) and wasn&#x27;t runny or watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided first to try this on my hands as a moisturizer because of the pump.  I tell you I was freaking in love with this pump.  I first applied it to my hands, arms and elbows and it really helped with the dryness with no greasy feeling left behind.  I then moved on to my face at night when it was time for night time skin care routine.  I normally use argan oil at night as my final step when I wash my face.  I loved on how great it felt on my skin and again no heavy or oil residue left behind.  However I did have one issue.  Since this is a pump; I normally only use 2-3 drops of agran oil on face, neck and chest and this gave me way to much.  I had to rub the rest on my arms and elbows.  In this case I think the pump backfires by giving you more product then what you need if you plan to apply it to your face.  So try pumping it less then half way in order to get the right amount of oil you need for smaller areas of your body.  After that, I applied some more on my hair since I had just washed it in the shower.  I love it didn&#x27;t leave it greasy or weighed down and really smelled and looked beautiful when blow dried the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I am in awe of the size of this bottle and the handy little pump it comes with.  When I first tried argan oil, it was a sample I received from my beloved Sephora for Josie Maran 100% argan oil.  However the price for that 1.5 oz bottle was outrageous and I refused to pay almost $90 for a bottle of that size let alone for a product I was unsure about.  I then went and hit the internet and found what argan oil needs to have in order to be considered &#x27;real&#x27; and what the actual price ranges would be and trust me they were way more reasonable then Josie Maran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this company has impressed me and I plan to keep using their product for all my argan oil needs!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best Argan oil I have ever used by far! I have used about 10 different brands of Argan oil over the past 5 or 6 years including Josie Maran, pura d&#x27;or, and several others. This oil from VoilaVe far surpasses them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this order, I really didn&#x27;t expect too much. I figured at this price, this could not be a very good oil. Boy was I wrong! The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that this oil was in a very large 4 oz GLASS bottle. Many Argan oils I have purchased in the past were 2 oz or less but cost me much more. But what I liked most was that it had a nice pump vs many that use droppers. I prefer the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I broke open the seal and tried the oil for the first time, I was struck with the rich color of the Voilave oil plus it had a faint scent so I know it was very fresh and pure. When I applied it, the texture was smooth and silky and it had no greasy feel at all. It absorbed beautifully into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked great for my hair! I have very dry and frizzy hair and the voilave oil worked perfectly. It made my hair look shiny and took away my frizziness. My hair has never looked better. In fact, I had lunch with a friend yesterday and they commented on how nice my hair looked. I was so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this Argan oil. It is the best deal I have ever found on Argan oil but most of all, it is the highest quality. This has now become my new go to Argan oil!</li>
    <li> Argan Oil has definitely been a miracle in our household. We love Argan oil and anytime we can get our hands on it, we jump for joy. My daughter and I have some really frizzy hair. I have wavy, frizzy, dried hair and my daughter has super tight, kinky, curls, it’s frizzy and hard to tame. Since we’ve discovered how well Argan oil has worked for us, it has become our go-to hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VoilaVe 100% Organic Argan Oil clearly states on the front of the bottle that it’s a “Miracle oil in a bottle“. Yes!! It is true. Well at least it is for my daughter and I. This has to be one of the best Argan oil’s we’ve ever used!! I love how it’s 100% PURE certified ORGANIC oil. This oil has really made our hairs shiny and healthy looking. Not only is it great for your hair but its amazing for the skin and nails too. It keeps your hair, skin and nails looking healthy, smooth and hydrated all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Argan oil feels fresh, light and not greasy at all. It absorbs pretty fast too.  A little goes a long way, that’s for sure. I found that the best way to use this oil is to pump 2 pumps (more if needed) of oil in your palm and massage it onto your scalp and roots of your damped hair. Then using a comb or brush and brush it down to the end of the strands of your hair. This is to make sure that it coats nicely over your entire head. We usually leave it on overnight and wash it out the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m definitely going to use this Argan oil in some of my DIY beauty recipes! It’s so simple and easy to use that you can easily incorporate it into your daily beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking to bring youthfulness back into your hair, skin and nails then I suggest you check out VoilaVe 100% Organic Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Great price and still figuring out if it&#x27;s really helping, I&#x27;m using it for hair, skin and face. My skin is dry.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I love it on my hair and my face. I wish there was a scent to it, however, I may add that myself. It is a great value for the price and being organic makes it a winner. I highly recommend Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love this. I&#x27;ve tried several brands of argan oil and this is the best by far. The pump is extremely helpful as well. Don&#x27;t waste your money on overpriced argan oil! This is the best!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin care product I have ever used.  I tend to have oily skin and I put this on my face, neck and chest before bedtime.  When I wake up my skin is never oily, it is in fact hydrated. I read a few reviews of people who said their face broke out.  My skin actually feels like it is getting more clear and smooth.  In the morning, I mix a tiny bit with my day cream.  I used it for my hair too.  I made the mistake of putting too much the first time.  You only need a very small amount.  My hair feels silkier and has more body.</li>
    <li> Works REALLY well on my hair. Customer service is tops with this company. Fantastic product that leaves my wily hair smooth and soft without weighting it down. Pretty much zero odor other than a very, very faint earthy smell, which is probably exactly what argan oil smells like and is quite pleasant. If you don&#x27;t like it, it goes away after about a minute anyway.</li>
    <li> I ordered Organic Argan Oil from VoilaVe, 1) Because it came in a 4 oz. size at an amazing price, and 2) It&#x27;s 100% Pure and ECO Certified. I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for my facial skin for quite some time to smooth fine lines, soften skin, and even out my skin tone. VoilaVe does all that and more--true liquid gold! I&#x27;ve since started using it in my daughter&#x27;s hair to soften and moisturize her dry, brittle hair, and it&#x27;s done wonders to add shine and life. There&#x27;s no other company that can boast the amount of product you get for such a low price. I&#x27;ve paid more for a 1 oz bottle! The scent is neutral, which I like, because it doesn&#x27;t compete with my scented lotions, and it works wonders smoothed on your skin right after a bath or shower. I would recommend this product again and again!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair once in my whole life and believe me I made a lots of mistakes in my whole life but that one was one of my biggest mistake I have ever made!For a long long time after bleaching my hair, it has still looked  frizzy, dry and damaged and I have to apply a lots of oil before styling my hair. Usually I use olive oil to treat its dryness but it makes my hair a bit heavy, greasy and dull. This time, I applied “Organic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil” to hydrate my dry, damaged hair. I surprised by it’s results. Compared to other oils or other brands, it is fast absorbing light weight oil which left my hair smooth, shiny, non-greasy and frizz-less.&lt;br /&gt;Even after I styled my hair, I became more surprised because it wasn’t necessary to apply any oil before using flat iron. It is amazing and I love its fantastic results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this Argan oil for several weeks so it is way too early to give it a fair review. I apply the oil after I use my Derma Roller to my face and neck. The oil feels good to my face, but not sure if it is doing any good at this point.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this compares to &#x27;other&#x27; argan oils, but from my month-long use, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  I did some research on the varying price points of the oils, and I think this one is the BEST deal for organic and pure.  The pump works great, and the glass bottle is a bonus. (Of course it doesn&#x27;t hurt that the seller is knowledgeable and pleasant!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added this to my nightly regimen after fearing my early-thirties skin changes.  One squirt covers my entire face, as WELL as my eye area.  And this is where I have to draw attention: it&#x27;s SO gentle, it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it gets in my eyes.  The bonus of this is that one can really slather it on and get every possible &#x27;eye area&#x27; covered -- gently -- without worrying about stinging and sensitivity.  It&#x27;s a lovely texture, earthy smell, and really moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I actually liked this product upon use. just a little amount leaves my face feeling velvety soft and it does not feel greasy all. But i noticed after one week of daily application(with regular washing) to my face my skin became very rough, like i was on the verge of having a massive breakout, so i stopped using it, then my skin started to clear.  after reading the amazing reviews i decided to try it again and my skin is really rough again. Will have to stop using for my face and use it just for my hair, too bad. I almost liked the product. but i wonder if this could be because i mixed two bottle of voila ve organ oil together(an almost finished bottle to a new bottle, from my mum).</li>
    <li> Works well,  Just make sure to not put too much on any one place</li>
    <li> I adore argan oil for hair. it is light weight, doesn&#x27;t leave hair or skin feeling greasy. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take very much. Great for dry scalp too..Been using argan oil on my hair for over 2 months now and am LOVING the results. My hair and skin look fabulous.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, upon receiving I did a hair mask (putting a liberal amount then covering overnight) and I saw a definite change in my hair. I would agree with other reviews that it does have an interesting smell, but any form of Argan oil does have this which helps show it&#x27;s authenticity. I&#x27;m excited to try it on a regular basis to get my hair back to normal (I damaged it going blonde). I also plan to start using it on my skin, lots of pool days mean dry skin. A great buy!</li>
    <li> One of the best Argan Oils I have ever tried, this VoilaVe is of the highest quality with a lovely sized bottle and easy to use pump top. I place some in my fingertips  every morning after the shower and run it through my dry, crazy curls. It works like a charm. my curls are soft, supple and separated. They look healthy and springy. I love this oil and will be using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is my first argan oil so I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s authenticity. Having used it a few times, though, I can say that it leaves my hair incredibly soft and shiny. This oil&#x27;s odor is very faint.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to the positive effects of using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for my hair for a very long time, but decided to try it on my face. I&#x27;d suggest applying it while your face is still damp after a shower and just let it absorb. It lasts very long so you can only apply every other day. And I do like that this is all organic and its 100% argan oil with no other additives.</li>
    <li> i have used it on my  hair(obviously!) , body, on my dry hands and dry cuticles!! It&#x27;s just makes everything so soft , smooth and healthy.You can also use it on your hair mask for extra supple. Did you check the packaging?? It&#x27;s just so pretty! Love the pump applicator and the bottle is nice. This big bottle is enough to use for a year I guess!! and it is so affordable as well. I am glad to try this out.♥&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy to use it and willing to purchase again! I highly recommend this to give a try if you are looking for the best argan oil.</li>
    <li> Not oily at all. Super moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is nice for hair and for skin.  I bought it as a gift for my mother who likes to use these types of natural products and she said that she loves it!  Definitely worth it</li>
    <li> This product stinks. Literally smells bad. I can&#x27;t really use it as I wanted because of the smell. I have even tried to mix it with an essential oil. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Best face oil I&#x27;ve tried. I have tried the more expensive brand, but this oil seems to work better for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product...I use it mainly as a beauty product as it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
    <li> i absolutely adore argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;from my hair to my skin its amazing</li>
    <li> This is NOT argan oil.</li>
    <li> A lightweight and non-greasy way to keep hair sleek and shiny. Surprisingly, it&#x27;s also quite effective on skin - relieves cracked and dry elbows, knees, and feet. Lovely texture and scent, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, argan oil is argan oil, so the biggest differentiators are the convenient pump bottle and the generous amount of product offered for the price. From that perspective, there&#x27;s no better choice than VoilaVe.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is an awesome aid against the herpes zoster. It not only soothes the itch but disappears the blister.&lt;br /&gt;For preventing this trouble I apply the oil every day after shower.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do exercise and I suffered this annoying condition, I think because of the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the pure and organic Voila Ve Argan oil :)</li>
    <li> I tried this only one time on my scalp, but I didn&#x27;t feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll try it on my nails.  Not much to say until I see results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil!! Absorbs so well into my skin I keep touching my legs and arms because they feel so soft. I was hesitant to try it on my face but was pleasantly surprised. Also tried in my hair and was amazed. I will definitely be purchasing this again as well as recommending to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this Arga Oil and I have tried many of them. It&#x27;s perfect for restoring that shine &amp; luster that&#x27;s lost over time. This needs to be part of your daily / weekly hair regiment! This was pretty much a miracle worker! Not only did it make my hair soft and shiny, it fixed my damaged ends and smelled amazing! I love it :)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality argan oil! A little goes a long way and I use it every day. It also comes in a nice spray bottle so you can control just how much you use.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time.  Item as described.  Works well for the defined purpose.</li>
    <li> Just received VoilaVe Argan oil a week ago, and I love it! It hydrates my skin and manages my frizzy colored hair,  just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I went to my brother house for the weekend. I forgot to bring me own hair product but fortunatly my bro had the voila argan oil that he bought from amazon. I used it and the effect was instant. My hair looked health and shiny. Took home the remaining small amount that lasted me for more than 2 weeks. I must say this product is awesome. I recommend others to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil - it&#x27;s light and is absorbed easily.  Both my husband and I really like this product ( 2nd bottle) and have found that it has made some definite changes in our skin.  It looks more hydrated and some of the fine lines have evened out.  The price point is much better than some other Argan oil products on the market.  Thank you for a very good product.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this feels in my hair.  After I take a shower I put a small amount onto the ends of my hair. When my hair dries it does not feel or look greasy. My split ends seem to disappear. It does not have a weird scent or anything either. I will definitely make sure this is in my home at all times.</li>
    <li> This oil is actually very good. The bottle and packaging is superb and extraordinary because it allows you to easily control the amount you want to use. It&#x27;s like &amp;#34;I FOUND IT&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very good oil. The only little problem is that the bottle is too small!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my skin after every shower and my skin feels great and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Best organic argan oil I&#x27;ve found, and the best value.  I have used this every day -- lots of it -- as basic moisturizer, several times daily throughout the day, on face, neck and body.  Once a week or so, I do an extensive hair treatment with it before double-washing.  This argan oil is light-textured, easily absorbed, and utterly odor-free.  Delightful to use, and inexpensive enough to use lavishly.  The bottle protects the oil, is comfortable to hold, and dispenses just the right amount.  My tip:  moisten the skin first with a spray of George&#x27;s Aloe Vera juice (small spray bottle available on Amazon or local drug or grocery store), then dispense the argan oil onto the back of one hand, and apply to the face with the ring ringer of the other hand (use of this most sensitive finger prevents damaging delicate skin, especially around the eyes).  I&#x27;ve used nothing but VoilaVe since I discovered it -- thanks for this great product, can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I have used the Argan Oil and really like the way it makes my hair feel and look, it is very soft and not heavy at all.  I am very pleased with the fact that it is 100% USDA Organic, that is especially important to me- especially with so many things that are making us toxic. I appreciate a company that would  take the time and money to invest in having their product  USDA certified. When I need more Argan Oil, I will make sure to order from this company. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very good oil . Get absorb very quick &amp; does not stink as some of cheap quality one . Will buy again</li>
    <li> Very nice product! Can&#x27;t believe the immediate difference it made on my hair, skin and nails.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  Absorbs quickly, very faint but fresh smell, easy to dispense with pump top, and is in a brown glass bottle to preserve freshness.  No adverse reactions (skin breakouts) as with so many other organic and healthy products.  Use in AM and PM on face.  NO oily, greasy feel or residue and is great for use with BB foundation creams (which are usually thick and a bit dry).  Was concerned the product would be inferior due to the lower price, but instead found it to be a superior product at a superior price!</li>
    <li> I guess it is how the pure argan oil smells, I didn&#x27;t expect the heavy smell though</li>
    <li> VoilaVe Organic Argan Oil is a great product. It&#x27;s not too oily, and great for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Really great  oil. I put it on my hair and it made a huge difference with the split ends and fly always from blow drying. It also brought my hair&#x27;s color to an even focus.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller&lt;br /&gt;and good price.</li>
    <li> This has changed my hair and left it feeling so soft and with a great shine! I can use this in place of my other hair products that have chemicals since this argan oil is organic and chemical free. It also came with a guide to help me learn how to use the argan oil plus the guide had so much in it about taking care of your hair and skin! I will be buying again and will tell all my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! This oil is nice and weightless and has a very mild scent to it. When I put it on my my hair, it gives it a nice luster but at the same time not too greasy. The price is worth it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  My hair mixture is 66% African American and 34% Caucasian making my hair and also my skin feel soft and hydrated.  Expensive, but a little dab will do so one bottle lasts about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this product! Not only that, but the seller followed up with a great email with more product information and how to get the most out of it.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair as soon as it arrived..  I&#x27;ve tried various products to prevent dryness, but this has the best results.  Her hair is so soft and shiny.  In addition, my daughter and I have dry skin and this moisturizes our skin and leave it so soft.  What a great product!</li>
    <li> Used this product before and so tickled to be able to get it again and at such a great price!  Makes such a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using Josie Maran argan oil for at least 3 years but only used it on my face due to the high cost.  This bottle such a generous size and I can honestly say that I have paid $100 for that same amount of Josie Maran&#x27;s product.  It is just as rich and moisturizing and now feel that I can afford to use it on other parts of my body.  It absorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any scent.  I have applied it to my dry heels and it softened them up quickly.  I would recommend this product to my friends and daughters.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: just received my refill order (3-4th bottle I&#x27;ve ordered) and the smell is HORRIBLE. It smells like a barn mixed with rubber. Is there a new supplier or has this particular bottle gone bad? Never had I had a bad experience with this product until now. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous review:&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my face and I have had much fewer blemishes and radiant skin tone. I&#x27;ve stopped using concealer and foundation after using this product for a few weeks. I love the smell, as it&#x27;s very mild and love how long my skin stays hydrated, even while living in the 0% humidity desert.</li>
    <li> Use this every day as a moisturizer on my face and neck at night. Love it because it absorbs into my skin and gives me a glow verses looking greasy.</li>
    <li> I received the Organic Argan oil on the estimated date.  Well packed.  I use this oil on face and hair, I love it.  I would recommended.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;For my hair it is greasy and hard to wash off the next day. For my leg, it is average, just a tad better than VS lotion because it is natural and organic but a lot more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face, it seems too thick for my pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Voila Ve argan oil twice now and I am very pleased with the product.  I use it as a moisturizer on my face, hands, and nails, as well as in my hair.  It seems to be well-priced on Amazon and the delivery is prompt.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil.  I use it for everything.  It&#x27;s great for just about every part of your body.  I&#x27;ve found my new best friend!</li>
    <li> I love the way it calms my curly/frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and noticed an improvement almost immediately!  Works great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real argan oil at all.  It was like colored water coming out of the bottle.  My hair looked worse and twice as frizzy after using it.  Sending back right away.  Very disappointed after all these glowing reviews but this stuff was horrible.  I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality - great price!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it on my hair and skin. The price was reasonable compared to local stores.</li>
    <li> I like this brand and will order again when I run out.  Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> Received it today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Nice light feel, not greasy and just a very faint smell which I like. I put it in my hair but rubbed some on my cuticles also.</li>
    <li> I have so far very much enjoyed this formula - I have used for a week now on my hair and skin. It does not leave my hair greasy (and my hair tends to get a bit greasy look with oil products) and absorbs into my skin to leave it soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. My hair was dry from sun exposure and hair color. I use a small amount on my hair every day after washing and on dry hair. I was amazed at how quickly my shine has returned. I tried it on my cuticles and found the oil quickly absorbed. I am hoping that it will improve the health of my nails. It works really well on dry skin and on my face. I previously purchased and used two products that said they were argon oil but they were not pure or organic. One spray had about 10 ingredients with argon oil extract as one of the last. The other didn&#x27;t list ingredients, just said it was argon oil infused. These items cost around $15-$20 each. Therefore this is a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that left my hair feeling stiff. This is a very good, quality product.</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil! I have curly hair and it is always a bit dry, especially since I dye it blonde. But this oil keeps it looking shiny and healthy. I used to use a ton of product in my hair- leave-in conditioner, mousse, hairspray, smoothing spray. Now, most days, I just use this! I put it mostly in my ends, so it doesn&#x27;t make my roots greasy. It is lightweight on my curls and keeps them from looking frizzy.</li>
    <li> I AM STILL WORKING ON THIS</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair very soft</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd order of this oil. I&#x27;ve had the second order for a couple of weeks now and it has developed a really strange smell. Can this oil &amp;#34;go bad?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It worked wonders for my hair!!</li>
    <li> Good product.  I put in hair the night before washing.  Hair comes out shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for two weeks now.  I do not have much to compare it to.  I had a bottle of Josie Maran and my cat knocked it over like immediately after I got it!! My hairstylist always put Moroccan Oil in my hair when she cut my hair and I loved how it made my hair look.  I looked on Amazon for Moroccan oil but the bottles that are being sold are fakes, there is a lot of outrage in the reviews section. So I steered clear of that scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then searched for another Argan oil that had good reviews.  So I chose this one.  I like it, I&#x27;m not in love with it because a pea size like is only enough for the ends of my hair, then I have to use a little bit more for the rest of my hair.  I then blowdry my hair and my hair looks kind of stringy and a little greasy.  I guess I need to use less but I feel like if I use less then the oil soaks in so quickly that I am not able to rub it into all of my hair.  Which i am now just putting it in my ends and that seems to work better, but I&#x27;m just not seeing the shiny soft hair that I was hoping argan oil would do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, I am just left here confused unsure what argan oil to purchase!!!  I have nothing bad to say.  I will continue to use this though, maybe I just need to find the right amount to use for my own hair.  I will update my review later after more time has passed using this product., I am just slightly suspicious because of the cost and lack of scent.  I will continue to use this though, maybe I just need to find the right amount to use for my own hair.  I will update my review later after more time has passed using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the Organic Argan Oil for Hair &amp;amp; Face.  It has helped to clear up some dry skin issues and I love mixing it with my Essential Oils for various uses.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;m using to moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! It is high quality and makes my skin feel so soft . I have tried many other brands of argan oil and this brand is my favorite!</li>
    <li> It will probably be a while before I can decide if it&#x27;s five stars or three (effectiveness). But I like it so far - it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores (I don&#x27;t wake up with random zits) and it has a rich nutty aroma that makes me want to drop it in my mouth rather than my skin!</li>
    <li> Only using it to moisturize my hair ends. So far I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very soft not greasy.</li>
    <li> Excelent product. I use it everyday in my face never mind if it is summer or winter time. It absorbs quickly and not oily</li>
    <li> I use this Argan oil every day, sometimes several times per day.  I use it for both skin and hair.  The pump makes it easy to use small amounts with less waste.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! I have very thick hair and my hair not only absorbs this instaneously it looks so resilient and so shiny, and not to mention more importantly, it&#x27;s so silky smooth. I&#x27;ve tried many argan oils for my hair and by far this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever laid my hands on.</li>
    <li> amazing oil! I bought this for my hair because a lot of my favorite hair products tout this oil on their label, so I figured I&#x27;d experiment with the pure thing. My hair is very fine but also very curly and can feel dry easily; it&#x27;s a challenge to find products that moisturize without making it feel limp and greasy. One pump rubbed into my palms and smoothed over dry hair resulted in soft, shiny curls with lots of volume and the oil itself just disappeared into my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with it for both my hair and my skin. I love that the product comes with an expiry date (bought early August, 2014 and expires July 2016), argan oil is best within 2-3 yrs. Very high quality product and the pump makes it easy to use without wasting. I will be buying from this seller again for sure.</li>
    <li> I put this on every night before I sleep and I can&#x27;t explain how great it feels on my skin when I wake up!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the smell of argan oil but I absolutely love how my skin feels like baby skin every morning.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes my dry skin well and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all!</li>
    <li> i just recive it&lt;br /&gt;i will let you know the result</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Love the pump feature and great for my face and hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived quickly.  Just as I expected it to be, so unpleasant smells.  Order with confidence, this is a keeper!!</li>
    <li> GREAT customer service and wonderful Argon oil.  Very happy and I will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil with I adore. This is not the same quality. It&#x27;s thinner and doesn&#x27;t absorb like her product does. That&#x27;ll teach me to try and go cheaper. You just can&#x27;t on some things.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t usually write reviews. This might actually be my first and i was pretty upset because i hate when things&lt;br /&gt;are false advertised. I purchased this item because the 100% pure argan that i purchased from morocco personally&lt;br /&gt;from the village where these oils are produced was running out. It came in today and i naturally compared the&lt;br /&gt;consistency and smell of product from the one i purchased from morocco, and just as a thought this product&lt;br /&gt;is watered down (a lot lighter) and the smell is strange, i can&#x27;t even smell the argan oil smell?? which is strange&lt;br /&gt;for a 100% PURE product. The oil i purchased from Morocco is thicker and rich..also has a wonderful argan smell.&lt;br /&gt;Which leads me to believe this is a highly watered down product. I did not use it, and it is being returned.&lt;br /&gt;The pure 100% argan i have from morocco has transformed my skin and is truly magic in a bottle but believe me&lt;br /&gt;this is not it! so for the people who have noticed a difference with this watered down version, imagine what the real thing&lt;br /&gt;would do for you:)</li>
    <li> I have tried 4 brands of organic argan oil and this is by far my favorite brand. It absorbs quickly, has no scent to it, I love the pump application and it is extremely moisterizing.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Price!</li>
    <li> Time will tell if the oil works wonders.  So far, it is a light moisturizer for face and hair.  Company communicated twice about the product and my reaction to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent for skin and Hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I had been buying &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; at the grocery store for my hair, but noticed there were lots of other ingredients in it.  Then almost bought from QVC, but found this on Amazon (thanks Amazon!!!) for a fraction of the cost.  Has a much better effect on my hair than the grocery store product, and also like to use it on the skin of my arms and legs, on my nails and my lips.  Great stuff, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Prompt service.  Seems to be the real thing.  A little goes along way.  Price great.</li>
    <li> i wanted it with the same smell as Keihl´s.</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil. Use as a moisturizer for my face and it works great. I used to purchase the more expensive Josie Maran. Never again. This works even better. Use as directed and just 2-3 drops warmed in your palm will cover even my dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great organic Argan oil.  Use on hair and face.  Works great!  Will order again in future.</li>
    <li> Started using. Will update with the results.</li>
    <li> Love it will reorder.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for skin and hair.  Keeps cracked dry skin away.  Keeps frizzy hair away.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not.. It fixed my skin.i love this</li>
    <li> Smells nutty like it should but smell dissipates when applied. Quality packaged in dark amber glass to help prevent breakdown by light. Great value.</li>
    <li> kind of thick and sticky compared to other brands</li>
    <li> I tend to get very dry hair in the summer, especially after applying consistent blonde highlights to it. Even though my hair is very dry, I tend to stay away from oils as they quickly make it feel oily. I really enjoyed the texture of this particular oil, as it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily. I have yet to try it on my skin or my nails, but I would recommend it for hair, for all types of hair as it does not seem to leave any oily residue to it. The smell is also pleasant.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is wonderful, I bought it for my Mom and she is very happy with the results, she said her hair feels very smooth and is shiny now.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this product over a month ago and have been using it daily. I want to point out that I am in fact a guy, so I don&#x27;t have any experience on what this product will do for your long luxurious hair. However, i suffer from really dry skin on my hands and face, and I tried all kind of different lotions and oils before I&#x27;d learned of argan oil. I perused Amazon looking for a quality, 100% organic bottle of argan oil and VoilaVe seemed to have the best value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I noticed that the bottle had leaked a little, which was a bummer because this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, but i felt it wasn&#x27;t enough to make waves. It isn&#x27;t the first time that I purchased something off of Amazon that leaked during shipping and I suspect that my local UPS guy is punting my boxes onto my porch from his truck. That&#x27;s the only explanation I have for it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to only use a few drops, but I&#x27;m a rebel who likes to watch the world burn so I proceeded to bathe in it head to toe. You should probably follow the directions. After about an hour of looking like a glazed donut i took a shower then reapplied a little more conservatively. A little bit truly goes a long, long way and one bottle will easily last you months. I immediately noticed a huge difference on my hands, which quickly absorbed the argan oil. There was no greasy feeling and no residue left over like you get from some hand lotions. This product is definitely 100% argan oil, as the stuff smells... funky. Like almonds with a bad case of body odor. As other reviewers have said, the smell does go away, and now that i&#x27;ve been using it for over a month i&#x27;ve grown to like the scent. In all seriousness, this argan oil is amazing. It moisturizes my hands in a way that lotion never does, and my problems with dryness and cracking is completely gone. I really wish I had head about this stuff a long time ago.If you&#x27;re here reading this, you already know that argan oil is an incredible product, and this particular product is easily the best bargain you&#x27;ll find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is normally where a review would end, and if you check my history you&#x27;ll see that I never review any products that I purchase on Amazon, but I was so impressed with VoilaVe that I had to. So about a week after I had received my bottle of argan oil, i received an email from a delightful woman by the name of Susan, asking me if i was satisfied with my purchase. I casually mentioned that the bottle had leaked during shipping, but not enough for me to be upset about, and otherwise than that I loved the stuff. Susan not only apologized (which wasn&#x27;t necessary, I think my UPS guy hates me) but she sent out a replacement bottle at no cost to make up for the spillage that occurred. My mind was blown. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I received a personal email from the Co-Founder of a company to ask me if i&#x27;m a happy customer, let alone the level of customer service that came after. VoilaVe is awesome, and I will continue to give them my business for as long as I have skin.</li>
    <li> I am using this as a face moisturizer and I like it a lot makes my skin feel silky.</li>
    <li> I use argan oil for my skin and hair and it&#x27;s been amazing!!!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on his face and loves it. It has a pleasant but nearly odorless aroma. A little goes a very long way. We are very pleased and will definitely reorder when this bottle gets low!</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple types of Argan Oil and this is by far my favorite. I use this everyday on my thick, curly hair. The quality is good and I have not experienced a rancid smell as some other reviewers of Argan Oil have experienced. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a high quality argan oil but not as expensive as Josie Maran. After encountering this brand I am very impressed.I am very pleased with this product. It is light enough to use on my hair and face. It does not have a strong smell. It mixes well with my lotion when I use it on my body and is a great moisturizer. For the price this is such a great deal!</li>

    <li> I LOVE this product, I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks in my hair as a leave in, and am already seeing results. Great product, awesome seller, very personable, and helpful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe the reviews at all. Most seems like an ad from the seller. Also, most of the reviewers are new profiles, no history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil doesn&#x27;t have that nutty argan oil scent to it. I am suspicious it is not real or pure. so Beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t expect much for this cheap price tho. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love it. The Organic Argan Oil is wonderful. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I first purchased this producet. First of all its a 100% pure argan Oil and for the price its not that bad!! After 1-2 weeks I noticed a significant change in my hair. I have some what of thin hair and when I started to use this product my hair growth and increased and my hair isn&#x27;t as thin as it used to be!! I will definetley be re purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. This oil is great for loose African American curly hair...not sure if it would be as effective if you have a tighter curl pattern.</li>
    <li> Great price and I like the brown bottle to protect the oil inside. Shipped quickly. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Very good product for dry skin...fast and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Make sure you use as directed as it will leave your hair very oily.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shine and feel soft!</li>
    <li> Nice consistency and price was good too.. would recommend a friend for purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about a month now and I have to say, I am impressed! I have tried many different brands of Argan oil over the years and this is one of the best I have tried and definitely the most affordable (but not at the expense of quality). I use it as my day time moisturizer mixed with either a drop of Neroli or Lavender essential oil. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin soft and smooth. I struggle with dry, sometimes cracking skin, underneath oily skin in some areas and am prone to breakouts. This oil has quickly taken care of it those issues and my skin looks amazing. VoilaVe&#x27;s customer service has been excellent! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out some of their other products and will definitely be back for more of this oil!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after a month of using a different brand of argan oil with wonderful results. I figured with this one being organic that it would be much better, but sadly it is not. Even a few drops makes my hair oily and gummy. It is awful. I will be going back the brand previously used with much better results. Very unfortunate.</li>
    <li> Soured, vinegar is what mine smells like. This is a perfect example of your get what you pay for. I can not even believe this could be sold. There is no date to see when it was packaged either.  I love the natural smell of argan oil, so there is no mistake this is either gone bad, very bad or it is not argan oil. Are the post here fakes?  I just am not to sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this on my dry, flaky scalp, face, and nails, and it&#x27;s doing wonders for them. My face, especially, is looking and feeling better than it has in a while. I tend to get flaky patches around the sides of my nose and my eyebrows, but this has cleared that right up.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, she said it makes her skin less dry and smoother. However, it has a unique scent that takes a little while to get acquainted to it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Great price for the qty.</li>
    <li> the pictured item is not what I got!  Mine came in an unlabeled bottle, in a small cardboard box that only had a small barcode with the product name on it.  I have used other brands of Argan oil for over 6 months and wanted a larger size.  This one has a slightly &#x27;sour&#x27; smell and not at all like the others I have purchased.  I am returning it and will go back to the ones I have previously purchased</li>
    <li> Leave my hair soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful. Assume it will work well.</li>
    <li> This product is what I was looking for. I spray it on my hair when I am having a &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;, unruly day and it brings new life to my hair. Besides it conditions my hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> The argan oil from VoilaVe is fantastic. It not only moisturizes and balances my skin, but also gives it a certain glow I haven&#x27;t seen with any other product. I&#x27;ve used argan oil from another company in the past, but I never liked the odor (maybe it wasn&#x27;t as pure s VoilaVe?). But VoilaVe Argan Oil smells really good and *natural* (but don&#x27;t worry: the scent is extremely light and not noticeable, once it&#x27;s applied.)&lt;br /&gt;From my POV argan oil works better as a moisturizer than even the most expensive lotions and potions in my medicine cabinet... plus I can use it on my hair and cracking cuticles, too! With great results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend argan oil from VoilaVe for anybody looking for a fantastic, cost-effective and youth-maximizing multi-purpose moisturizer. (The seller is extremely nice and helpful, too!)</li>
    <li> I was contacted by VoilaVe to try out some of their natural beauty products. Once I saw what they offered I jumped at the chance to try the items out. The first one I have tried out is the 100% Pure Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;  Argan oil is a type of plant oil that is produced from the kernels of the Argan tree that is native in Morocco. Natural Argan oil has a raw, green and nutty aroma, but what is so great about this type of oil is that the scent disappears minutes after being on your skin as true Argan oil absorbs very quickly and without that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;  The Argan Oil comes in a 4 fl. oz (120 mL) glass bottle with a squirt top. Trust me while experimenting with this a little goes a long way. VoilaVe&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil is so natural that the only ingredient is : 100% organic argan oil (Argania Spinosa).&lt;br /&gt;  The 100% Pure Argan Oil is a multipurpose oil.  This is mainly used cosmetically. For cosmetic uses you can use it as a leave-in conditioner, frizz remover, moisturizer, lip exfoliator and softener, hair/scalp treatment, face mask and nail care.&lt;br /&gt;All directions for different uses such as those are on the bottle in pretty large print (at lease as large as you can on a bottle) and are easy to see and use. Most of the time you only need a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;  My favorite use of VoilaVe&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil was as a moisturizer. I could not get over how in only one application my skin looks more radiant with a soft and supple appearance. It definitely filled in any lines and scars that I had. Plus as a moisturizer it also lasts for almost twenty four hours and protects against UV rays. When I used it on my body it also moisturized very well.&lt;br /&gt; I have dry skin so I use about three drops on my face and then some on the rest of me and I am moisturized for a good twenty four hours. It got rid of any rough patches on my feet, hands, knees and elbows in about two to three days of once a day application and I have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;  I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair. I rub only 3 drops into my hair after I get out of the shower. I have thick hair so if you have thin hair you will barely need any otherwise your hair will look oily. It protects my hair from any heat damage I may do to it as well as make it shiny, soft and frizz free!&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives VoilaVe&#x27;s100% Pure Argan Oil 5 Stars!&lt;br /&gt;  The only problem I could find with this product is if you are allergic to nuts you cannot use it as the Argan oil is pressed from nuts.ke it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.

    <li> Worked great the first day I tried it.  After that, I accidentally broke the entire bottle, so that was my bad.  But I had a positive experience when I did use it.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this argon oil, I was looking for a pure organic argon oil, I simply love it so far, used it on my face, nails and hair, it&#x27;s amazingly&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy and very smooth, just a few drops is enough, I don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining about the smell, off course it does not have any fragrance since it&#x27;s pure argon oil, what you girls don&#x27;t understand is that fragrance oils are not good for your skin, especially your hair, it has actually a neutral smell, so no smell actually. I would rather have it like this the way it is, than have fragrance oils being added to it and compromise in its quality, just got it today, loving it, will wait and see the results, will order more, good price and it feels pure argon oil</li>
    <li> Really like this product. It is a little heavy on my fine hair so I can only use about a pea size amount before I flat iron. It is also a good moisturizer and absorbs into the skin great. I have a lot of praise for the company. When I received my product from amazon it had leaked out about  and inch down. The company had contacted me to find out if I liked the product and I told them about the leakage. They immediately sent me out a new bottle and have been in contact several times to be sure everything went OK and that I like there prodect. I will definitely  do business with the company again they are one of the best I&#x27;ve  done business with.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle in a bottle! I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for over 20 years and I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter medication you can think of and some prescription ones too. They all did nothing to get rid of it. They just kept it from getting worse (some didn&#x27;t even do that). I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little under 2 months and my psoriasis is almost GONE! I wish that I&#x27;d have researched this years ago! I&#x27;ll never be without this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Been using this on my dry toe-nails. Works like a charm. In addition, since receiving Chemotherapy and use it on my shaved head, keeps it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a reduced price to give my honest opinion. I purchased this product without reading any reviews so I can give my own review. I have long hair and I needed it repaired so I put some on my hair right away. It works good and not too oily on my hair but I think time will tell if you don&#x27;t see a appended review here then it works really good. I also applied some to my face and again it not too oily. Since it is multipurpose I really like it for all the things it does. I would recommended it.</li>
    <li> Good good product... all my family is happy with the Argan Oil</li>
    <li> Nice product if you can tolerate the smell!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic for hair AND skin!</li>
    <li> I just bought this recently and I love it! I used it on my cuticles, and have also been using it as a leave in conditioner on damp hair after I get out of the shower. Just a couple drops is enough! Makes my hair so shiny and straight even just air drying. It does not have a strong scent which is great for me. The price was amazing for the pure oil in such a large bottle too. I have used other brands which were not pure (had added silicones etc) and they can&#x27;t compare, this soaks right in to my hair and does not leave it feeling greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for face and body. Please do not let the low price fool you. It is a wonderful product and I will certainly be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just beginning to try different Argan oil brands, but I thought it worked rapidly at moisturizing and my favorite part was not having to worry about my hair touching my face and causing breakouts and the convenience of being able to use for face AND hair!</li>
    <li> Compared to other brand that i was using, this one is too greasy for my taste. It leaves my face very oily for hours and won&#x27;t absorb. Not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine this on my hair</li>
    <li> I like the product. I like that it has a spray pump which makes it easier to use. Would buy again however I&#x27;m sure if it doesn&#x27;t all it says on the bottle because I haven&#x27;t seen a massive change in the condition and growth of my hair but it does give it a shine.</li>
    <li> first time user ,don&#x27;t know what to expect. I use it on my hair makes &#x27;em looks shiny.good customer service</li>
    <li> I adore this argan oil!!! I moved to a town with harsh water and it has been rough on my hair. My hair was feeling course and frizzy. I have been putting the oil in my hair after towel drying and within two weeks it is soft and feels healthy again!! I have also put in on my face after showering and no breakouts. I don&#x27;t have a bad thing to say. I don&#x27;t notice a scent and it is quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Argan Oil.  It is doing everything the label reads.  My skin feels smooth and my face is not oily.</li>
    <li> Love Argan oil - I use it for my face, hair, feet, hands.  It works so well and keeps my hair from fizzing, hands and feet soft.  I like that it has a pump rather than an eyedropper.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face, hair and body.  It leaves my skin/hair very soft but not greasy. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well but smells HORRIBLE! Needs to be mixed with a fragrance!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil, no adverse odor. Compares favorably with higher priced oils. Use it daily on skin, hair and nails.</li>
    <li> I moved to the Pacific Northwest 2 years ago and my skin went nuts.  The dryer climate really wreaked havoc on my face.  I started getting dry patches that were all flakey around my nose and eye brows.  So embarassing!  I went to MAC and tried their products and several other moisturizers.  Nothing helped.  Went to Sephora ready to pay anything to get something that worked.  I bought an expensive little bottle of something that had Argan Oil as the key ingredient.  I checked on Amazon and saw that I could just buy Argan Oil for SO much less $.  I have been using this for 10 months now and my 40 year old skin has never been better.  My friends have asked what I use because the change is noticable.  It takes a while for it to soak in, so I use it before bed.  My face doesn&#x27;t dry out or get greasy anymore.  I use it on my hand and hair when needed too.  It&#x27;s just an all over great moisturizer!  I will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> not the highest quality</li>
    <li> I just bought this. Haven&#x27;t had it but a few days so don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s working. A little bit goes a LONG way. You get a lot of it for the money, so it will last forever.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. I would definitely buy it again, I use it for my hair and face. It&#x27;s a little thick so I make sure that my hands are damp before applying it and that helps make it easier to spread on evenly.</li>
    <li> Works great on hair. My bf even commented that my hair was noticeably softer (without me having to point it out to him) and wouldnt stop touching it . Havent tried it on skin yet.  SOO much cheaper than some of the the other brands out there. A small amount goes a long way so dont overdo it with this stuff.</li>
    <li> This oil has made my face softer and the skin younger looking. The price and shipping were low. Better than anything from the local drugstore or beauty supply shop and probably better than most $100 beauty creams. (I would never spend that much unless I won the lottery.)  The oil cleared up a dry spot on my hand that I&#x27;ve been treating for a year now with different hand creams.</li>
    <li> I carefully smooth 4 drops in my palms and apply evenly to my fine, easily-frizzed hair, reduces frizz and adds shine.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> wonderful brand, Price is incredible, will never use any other Argan oil. Love the pump bottle, dispenses the perfect amount of oil with each pump. Use on my face and notice the difference immediately Not greasy, absorbs into skin instantly. I am a forever customer!!!</li>
    <li> i am a big fan of argan oil for many reasons, but i am glad i found this company because this is a recommended product! it has so many uses for this oil &amp; always good to find a true organic argan oil for a good price!! i have fine hair and i find that this brand doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it too greasy like so other brands i have used, and great thing is you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the results you are looking for!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil and it keeps my skin smooth as silk. Great price on Amazon. It is big (4 oz) so I will have it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT FOR FACE , HAIR, AND NAILS USE IT EVERY DAY UNDER MY MAKEUP</li>
    <li> First off, VoilaVe has exceptional customer service.  Susan will personally contact you to make sure you received the Oil and to see if you like it, have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week and half of using the Argan Oil on my face, my skin for appears more radiant in color.  The oil absorbs into the skin very quickly w/no heavy oil residue.  I used to use Olive Oil on my face...Argan Oil is much more compatible.  But I still use Olive Oil for my body, which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the Argan Oil as my day face cream, which will eventually replace Active Moist that I use during the day.  I also use the Argan Oil on my neck and chest morning and evening.  At night I use a cream prescribed by my dermatologist to help get rid of my pigmentation.  So using the Argan Oil for day has really helped in retaining my skin&#x27;s moisture, in addition to keeping my skin healthy w/o the use of harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W/re to my hair (I have thick curly/wavy hair), I have noticed my hair is not as dry and more manageable since I have used Argan Oil.  I apply the Oil after I wash/condition my hair and keep it in.  In between washes, I apply a lil Oil throughout the scalp, hair/ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already ordered a second bottle of Argan Oil and will be a dedicated customer of VoilaVe.</li>
    <li> I received the Argan Oil last week and love every drop of it!  I have been using it on my face and my hair and love what it does for both.  I am especially thrilled to see the results on my face - I&#x27;ve already seen fine lines dissipating and more clarity to my skin tone. This is a must-buy for every woman.</li>
    <li> I like natural skin and hair care and occasionally make my own lotions. I&#x27;ve used coconut oil as a body moisturizer and in lotions and have tried jojoba oil in lotion as well. Then the argan oil craze hit and I got curious about this non-oily oil, seemed bizarre. I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands but so far I LOVE this stuff. I ran out of my usual face moisturizer so I look a pump of this argan oil and put it on my face. No oily residue, no build up, just moisture. I have oily skin and usually after a few hours my skin is oily, my skin is not nearly as oily as it usually is and I didn&#x27;t even put on the sheer powder for oil control I wear on some days. I imagine that like jojoba oil argan oil resembles the natural sebum produced by the body that controls oil production.</li>
    <li> Love to use this on my hair--a little goes a long way.  Makes it looks shiny and healthy</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I use it under my extremely expensive skin care, on my hands and feet and smooth it in my hair.  You can buy it on a home shopping network at 8 times the price - $19 per 1/2 ounce - so this is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> Very slight, but not unpleasant odor (others have described it as slightly &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34;. I would agree with that assessment).  Hydrates the skin and is absorbed well.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like a top coating on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a very limited amount on my daughter&#x27;s hair when it starts to look dried out.  Gives it a nice shine.  Just have to be careful not to overdue to or it can make hair look oily. Would recommend this product to others interested in argan oil.  Good price for the amount in the bottle.</li>
    <li> My hair is recovering, I like it so much.</li>
    <li> Works great! And you can not beat the price. I used it on both my hair and my (embarrassed to say rough from leaning on a desk in front of a computer all day) elbow (yes just the one LOL) and it worked wonders. Kept my hair (which I wear in its natural state - African American) soft and supple during these winter months. I do prefer the smell of Moroccan Oil (which is also a bit less oily initially, but this product does absorb relatively quickly when you rub it into your skin) but the price difference makes this product worth incorporating into my routine. I would highly recommend this product. I am definitely purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have moderate Psoriasis, and have used many treatments over the years. This stuff works better than most of the steroid medications I have been given. I use it twice a day, and my psoriasis cleared up in a few short weeks.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Argon oil but now that I have it I&#x27;m not real sure how to use it. it seems quite heavy, it doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the skin that easily but I may not be using correctly.</li>
    <li> Great bargain!! Love this oil, I use it on myself, husband, our pets, and in my grooming salon!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil helps with split ends on your hair and softens dry skin.  I use it on my face, hands, knees, elbows, etc</li>
    <li> Let me see, I have one on my work desk, one on my side of the bathroom, she has hers, (got the lady turned on as well) one in the kitchen, another in the bathroom in the mancave.  I got them everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Over 60 but this makes the skin younger, back of the hands and arms, the legs too..  Use Rosehip on the face and neck as they get massaged at night but during the day and midday the argon takes the lead.  Only got one sibling and sent sister a bottle and she loves it. .  We are talking about the 4-fl oz bottles,  Readt to replenish my stash.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brand after reading all the reviews, the product was so well absorbed I used it all over daily, a little goes a long way. By spring my skin was ready to debut and meet the sun once again. Living in a cold dry climate does a drying job on your skin. I am out doors walking all year round so finding this product and getting such great results it has been a bonus. As for some who commented about fragrance, none absolutely nothing which was fine for me. It absorbs best if you apply right after bathing, although when going out I add a little extra light touchup coat on my face and neck never felt greasy. I tried a drop on my hair but did not see the results I was hoping for, that was fine, my skin aloves it. Highly recommend and yes I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Loved the Argan oil for my daily moisturizer.  I use it at night after a shower and in the morning before putting on makeup.  It&#x27;s wonderfully moisturizing, but not oily.  I&#x27;ve used a few times on my hair as well, but I try to avoid the roots, so they don&#x27;t get oil.  Usually just after blow drying.  Great product overall.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my skin and nails are the best they have ever been and it also lasts a long time. It is worth buying, you will see the difference.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is SO much better than any other I have tried. I use it on my hair, my nails, etc. (basically everywhere!) and I see improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and hydration, and my hair&#x27;s flexibility and shine.&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I like the most is that it does not have the overpowering, sickly sweet smell that others have had.</li>
    <li> The oil is great!  I use it for my hair and skin.  I even use it to moisturize my newborn.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to see how this product of 100% Argan Oil, $18.00 (4 fl-oz) compared to Josie Maran 1.7 fl-oz Argan Oil for $48.00. Why is one product so much more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is runny and has an oily feel to it when applied, my hands stayed oily for a while, and it has a strange smell, and my hands still felt dry after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil is not as runny, does not have a strange smell, in fact, no smell at all, and my hands felt better and did not feel dry after applying, but smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep the VoilaVe product because it would cost more to return it, but I will not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product smells like rancid oil and is greasier than argan oil should be.  It didn&#x27;t cause a break out on my skin but it didn&#x27;t really help at all.  It is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Arrived safely. Using on my nails, so we will see!</li>
    <li> Seems to work great. I mix half Argan oil and half jojoba oil. It mixed well.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Like magic, my hair is so smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I am still evaluating</li>
    <li> Argan oil is awesome! I have mild acne and this is a perfect moisturizer! It keeps my oiliness at bay while also not letting my skin dry out. It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. My face looks so smooth and radiant after using this. I can wear it under makeup without my face becoming slick. Argan oil has many purposes, i can also use it on my hair, which moisturizes that and keeps it shiny. This is a really great deal, 4oz is quite a lot of product, and it;s less than 30 bucks. No need to waste so much money for argan oil at other stores!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying the Argan Oil on my nails and my hair. So far I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use it everyday.  It is very light and does not have a strong scent.</li>
    <li> This is not pure argan oil. The argan oil has a specific nutty smell, this oil smells just like canola oil. I did not like it and is going back.</li>
    <li> very pleased with use on hair</li>
    <li> This is such a light oil, and it great for your body and hair.  I personally only use it on my skin.  It&#x27;s a great on the go moisturizer, and it also is good for mixing with foundation for a smoother application.  It makes your skin soft, and leaves NO oiliness. It&#x27;s pretty amazing actually. Also, the pump on this is so convenient, and it helps you use less product. Honestly you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that this helps me balance out my skin (I have super annoying combination skin.)  Most of the time my cheeks get dry through out the day, and my t zone will get at least a little oily.  I have to use gel based moisturizers because of the oily spots on my face, but it doesn&#x27;t give enough moisture to my super dry cheeks.  This stuff is perfect for all skin types though. It keeps my cheeks moisturized and my t zone nice doesn&#x27;t get as oily.</li>
    <li> I like this oil is a good product for the price. Not a strong smel, and soaks into skin easily.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful skin treatment at twice the price( so glad it isn&#x27;t because I boulder afford it!</li>
    <li> Best quality Argan oil I&#x27;ve found. Works wonders on my hair. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> First of all, Argan oil requires hard labor to produce a small bottle. That&#x27;s why Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil is so dang expensive. So to find a big bottle like this for $15, don&#x27;t expect the same quality. My mom recently bought a 0.5 oz bottle for $20 from my local health store and I&#x27;ve compared this to that, seeing as it had more of the qualities of pure argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product has been watered down (or oiled down). It&#x27;s much runnier than my mom&#x27;s oil and the color is clearer. Plus, my bottle didn&#x27;t particularly smell like anything, which is a sign that the oil&#x27;s been tampered with. And when argan is mixed with other ingredients, it becomes less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not to say that the more expensive the oil sells for, the more reliable it is. Just warning y&#x27;alls to be careful with the brand you&#x27;re buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto better news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does absorb quickly as argan oil should. But I find myself using a couple more drops on my face because it doesn&#x27;t penetrate as deeply as I hope for (I have combination skin with mild acne that I&#x27;ve been treating with tea tree oil). It helps soften my elbows and I&#x27;ve been applying a little bit onto my burn scars, seeing little improvement (didn&#x27;t expect them to improve much anyway). I relaly only used this oil for my skin, not hair or nails (tried on hair and nails only twice and didn&#x27;t see major differences).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an okay oil. Argan oil&#x27;s been dubbed the \\&quot;liquid gold,\\&quot; but this brand is not it. I would try other brands here on Amazon, though, just to compare (and they&#x27;re so darn cheap!). This would be good for body oil, though.</li>
    <li> It does not work well</li>
    <li> I use immediately after washing my hair feels and smells great</li>
    <li> It really  makes my hair soft and it is growing so nicely.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil and it&#x27;s hard to beat Amazon&#x27;s price. I use this as a face moisturizer and I like it much better than traditional face lotion. It&#x27;s easy to use too much, but one pump is perfect for either my face or the ends of my hair. I have oily skin and this product does not make my skin any more oily, in fact my complexion has really evened out after switching to an all natural skin care regimen. This oil absorbs fairly quickly and lays well under makeup. I like that it has multiple uses because you get a lot out of it. It&#x27;s also organic (yay!) and it does have the USDA organic label.</li>
    <li> As expected, Have been using this type of oil for two years.  I use it on my hair, face, and skin.  I tried this brand because of the price per ounce.  It does not seem quite as fine as some other brands I have used, but it does it&#x27;s intended job.</li>
    <li> This is some pretty good argan oil. Nice smell, nice amount of oil and makes everything soft.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job. Using on face and can see a noticeable different. Have used on feet and keep them soft and pretty.</li>
    <li> Love this. I&#x27;ve recently started to transition to clay for shampoo and adding a few drops of this makes my hair feel amazing.  I have very dry skin and this works very well on it. Love this</li>
    <li> Too expensive for me. Suits me better to just use organic olive oil for my dry scalp, though the product is good for what it is.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite organic argan oil so far!  It was shipped quickly, with terrific follow-up customer service to make sure it arrived.  I recommend this brand and seller very highly!  In particular, I appreciated knowing that it is not &amp;#34;deodorized,&amp;#34; as I was interested in the most unadulterated form possible.  This product met all of the criteria I was looking for: organic, cold-pressed, un-deodorized argan oil.  Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> It seems to be working well on my face and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality that you get and the shipping was very fast even tho I didn&#x27;t pay for speedier shipping. I didn&#x27;t really think the smell was bad as some mentioned but I opted to add a few drops of lavender oil to it and now it smells divine!!  I&#x27;m also glad that it came in a glass bottle whereas some put theirs in plastic which is not conducive for oils.  I will purchase my oil from this vendor again!~</li>
    <li> This oil works wonders on my nails, cuticles and feet. I am glad Itried it.</li>
    <li> I love the Argan oil. It fixed my split ends and took out the ridges in my nails. It is very high quality and absorbs easily. No greasy stains on my shirts. It was packed very well and arrived as promised. I will definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this to treat my dry scalp but ending up using it for my skin and nails. While the smell may be a bit much for me, I overlooked it for the results and value. My skin and nails look great..couldn&#x27;t be happier. Very good product and a great price.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff and so does our dog...great product and great price to boot</li>
    <li> paying for packaging.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to know if Argan oil does reduce the anti aging effects it&#x27;s supposed to. However I do absolutely love a wonderful it makes my skin and hair feel! Also works awesome healing new tattoos! The company has also been wonderful! they genuinely stand behind their products and want you to be happy! I highly recommend this product from this company specifically!</li>
    <li> This is a pure natural product and with consistent use does make a difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Is excellent for my skin and hair, I fell how this oil work in me!</li>
    <li> I love the spray bottle and the price.  It seems to work as well as the oil I have purchased from MUAC.  I use the oil on my nails and hair.</li>
    <li> Absorbs beautifully.  Skin is soft.  Compliments on appearance of skin.</li>
    <li> I normally use Moroccan Oil on my hair. Then I discovered that Moroccan Oil is just Argan oil and I thought &amp;#34;why pay for the name brand, if this is all it is?&amp;#34;  This product came in a .5 oz larger bottle and cost half as much.  More product for less money? Great idea!  However, when it arrived, the seal around the neck of the bottle was not on correctly and it had leaked in the package. I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway, instead of just returning it. The product is not nearly as thick as what I&#x27;m used to using, so I used too much the first time and had to rewash my hair. Then I used an appropriate amount, but couldn&#x27;t even really tell it was on there. My hair feels dry and brittle, so I am returning the product. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very fine product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Such a good Price! My nails are looking better a little difference in my face. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Been using this for many months and just ordered my second bottle. My skin is dry due to aging and this oil feels so good on my skin. I use it several times daily. Try it and decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It has changed my skin.  I use twice a day, (most of the time.)  My skin is moister, healthier looking and younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;This Argan Oil is fairly priced, in fact a real bargain.</li>
    <li> This is very nice oil.  I&#x27;ve used Strivectin for years and decided that since I&#x27;m organic in my diet that I needed to be organic on my skin.  The oil is light, has no detectable odor and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I tried lots of oils and I really like this one the best because I believe Argan oil will not break me out.  After several weeks it does not seem to do so at all.  I also like how it does not look greasy at all and still nourishes my skin.  I had tried other Argan oil and I felt that they were not as good.  I really like this brand and I will purchase again.  I also use it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. I used this in my lotions and I use 3 drops nightly on my face. Its amazing!</li>
    <li> Exceptional product. Quality product which includes speedy shipment and processing, honest description and a happy customer. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to write a review for this product. However, I have to admit that I like this argan oil very much. I used it when I growing my beard, it made my beard look and grow healthy. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a VERY expensive Josie Maran Argan Oil which worked miracles on my extremely dry face.  The smell is a little off-putting, but it only lasts while you apply it and goes away.  Once I started using this my skin became somewhat dry again.  Not as bad as it used to be, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best Argan Oil you can buy.  On the plus side, you can use it on your hair and as an all-over body moisturizer.  Overall it&#x27;s ok if you&#x27;re on a tight budget or using it for your hair or body, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for my face.</li>
    <li> The oil worked very well. Using few drops on face daily after a bath. No allergic reactions encountered. Feels awesome! A sample was provided for a review.  Argan oil has so many use cases and this oil came in excellent package.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very hydrating.</li>
    <li> It may not help cystic acne, but it sure tames my frizzy hair while enhancing the natural waves. I mixed mine with a coconut oil hairspray and put in a spray bottle. I spray my hair carefully as getting too much is easy, three sprays fore the split ends on each side, otherwise sticking with one spray for every other section (6 besides ends). I blow dry minutes later in order to get the extra waves. I love the bit of shine when I haven&#x27;t used too much. And I&#x27;ve throne out, sold, or given away every other anti-frizz hair product I used to use.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, and for such a great price here!  I will definitely order more when I run out.  At the rate that I&#x27;m using it (just once a day on my face) I think it will last me a whole year!  I had spent about the same amount on a tiny bottle (1-2oz) last year at a grocery store in Colorado, and it never smelled very good.  After using this one, I think the other one I had bought (I won&#x27;t mention the brand here) was rancid!  This one is so much better and economical!</li>
    <li> The item came quicker than expected and the bottles were a nice size. Makes skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this and another brand of argan oil on amazon to compare. They both had the same rotten smell. Made me wonder if they were from the same source. Although they were bottled from different locations. I REALLY wanted to love this. The price was too good to be true for the quantity. The reviews were raving about it. I use argan oil for everything. My face, hair and all over skincare. Well, sorry to say but this stuff smells ROTTEN. Spoiled rotten. It&#x27;s so off putting. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this bottle, but it didn&#x27;t have the nutty smell of argan oil. And it certainly didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin like argan oil usually does. It just sits on top. I didn&#x27;t even bother test it on my hair. I had to return it. I&#x27;m really bummed out it didn&#x27;t work. I usually get my 100% argan oil from Marshall&#x27;s &amp; TJ Max and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it smelling so bad.</li>
    <li> aloha! Thanks for the fast shipment. I really like the colored container and especially the pump feature.  The amount from one pump is a perfect amount and if I need more,just pump again. This argan oil absorbs fast in my skin and I really appreciate this is organic.</li>
    <li> I have long hair down to my hips, and though I don&#x27;t use any styling products on it, keeping it well conditioned and moisturized is a constant task, especially on days when I am out in the field (I am a landscaper). What I found is that this argan oil is a great solution for after conditioning to keep my hair feeling smooth and supple all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply apply to pumps to my hands after my shower, rub my hands together, and rub the oils on the bottom of my hair, combing it through after. I will occasionally also rub my oiled hands over the exterior of my braid to keep flyway strands under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of oil is one of those miracle beauty products that you can use for just about any type of moisturizing. I often use it after shaving as well to keep my skin from becoming irritated or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this brand has a pump dispenser and is organic, because I try to support organic agriculture wherever possible. I received a sample of this product for testing, but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly to dry hair I use plenty of products and tools. This Oil is not only organic but it&#x27;s multi use. You can use it on your face, dry patches on your body, and your hair. I will most definantly buy this product again , and maybe even a few backups lol !</li>
    <li> First of all this product is amazing!  I use on it both my hair and my skin and both LOVE it!!  What is even more awesome is the service that this seller has provided.  Reaching out to me see if the product was what I had expected and the quality that I was looking for. They also encouraged me to ask any questions that I had and quickly responded.  You will not regret purchasing this product if you are looking for REAL 100% pure, organic Argan oil.</li>
    <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW!!!!&amp;#34; This Organic Argan Oil really does work!!! I use it as my conditioner. It has a nutty smell, however, the smell leaves and the magic begins. My hair feels softer, the friz is under control (some of the friz is due to new hair growth) and I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through my hair! The Company is also very attentive and has WONDERFUL Customer Service. I received helpful tips on the use of this great oil. Thank you Voila! This is my GO TO OIL for hair care!!!</li>
    <li> incredibly low price and great quality!! will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I do like this oil.  Have purchased another brand before, but find this one lasts on my skin longer.  Would most definitely purchase this product again! Love using this instead of those heavy creams, makes such a difference on my skin and hair.  People ask me what I use on my skin because I have such a healthy glow.... Just made another order....great product!</li>
    <li> I finally decided to try Argan oil to see what all the fuss is about. I read what seemed like a million reviews and knew that I wanted organic cold pressed 100% argan oil. I chose this brand based on the positive reviews on Amazon and the very reasonable price. I have never used argan oil before so I can’t comment on how this compares to more expensive brands but so far I’m a fan.  The customer service from this seller is excellent - I was contacted by the seller to check that I received the product and asking for my feedback.  When I enquired about international shipping the seller responded promptly and even offered to research courier options for me. She also reminded me about a card that came with the product that I had overlooked, with a link to an e-book describing uses for this argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil as my night-time facial moisturizer and for my hair. I have combination skin and mild hormonal acne so I was nervous about using an oil on my face. I had chosen argan oil because it is said to be non-comedogenic. The oil itself is light, has a mild nutty scent that doesn’t linger and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.  It made my skin soft and kind of “glowy” and didn’t cause any breakouts. However, after 1 week of nightly use I noticed a few milia on my cheeks that I don’t normally get. I think I may have been using too much: the other reviewers are right, a little goes a long way! I find that the oil applies more easily (and I can use less) if I rub the oil between damp hands and massage it onto a slightly damp face.  I took a break from the argan oil until the milia cleared and have started using it more sparingly every night. It hasn’t replaced my daytime moisturizer because I prefer to use something with sun protection during the day. I also still use coconut oil as my body moisturizer because it’s cheaper and I don’t feel guilty slathering it all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use argan oil on my hair, applying it to towel dried hair.  Again, a little goes a long way and it took me a few tries to get the right amount (if I use too much it ends up just weighing my hair down and looking greasy). When applied with a light touch it helps to tame my frizzies and helps keep my hair shiny and soft. Overall, I’m very happy with this product and will continue to use this brand.ing it to towel dried hair.

    <li> I love this product and it comes at an excellent value. I love the fact that the oil comes in a convenient &amp;#34;pump bottle, that dispenses approximately 2-3 drops...not sprays. I highly recommend this product and vendor as I will be making additional purchases myself.</li>
    <li> After using this product, I stopped using conditioner. My hair has never been nicer. I will be a life long user. It helped get rid of most of my frizz, and leaves the hair soft.  You will have to experiment with the amount you use though depending on how long and thick your hair is. I also use it on my beard.</li>
    <li> Works good on fine hair if you just use a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is one amazing product! You can use it as a hair conditioner by sleeping in it over night and if you&#x27;d like a soothing bath, just put a couple of drops in with your bath water. It helps to relieve aches and pains. I have found it very effective to use on any part of your body to relieve pain. What a miracle product and a little goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my dry skin. Not oily. Keeps my skin looking hydrated!</li>
    <li> So far, I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> A skin saver of a product. After discovering Argan oil, I find no need to buy any other skin moisturizer nor hair conditioner. One of the few products my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react too. Terrific  product and nice easy dispensing pump.</li>
    <li> Fantastic facial moisturizer and works well as a pre-shave oil.  Does not block my pores and smells delicious... like roasted coffee beans.  I have bought the twice already and hope that it is always available.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve bought yet!  I love the fact that there is a website you can go to for skin care information. I will be buying more!!!!</li>
    <li> I think the product is good however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me.  It made my hair soft but it also made my hair flat. It was great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is great oil, just need a teeny bit for your hair to tame flyaways. It&#x27;s a lot of oil for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion... I&#x27;m sorry... I&#x27;m biased... I LOVE THIS STUFF... it makes my hair smooth and shiny. It has a subtle aroma I cant quite put my finger on but I find it soothing. I will buy more of this oil.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with how this works on my skin. Keeps it moist and supple. Sinks right in and no oily feel. I can even use it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this argan oil  twice and been pleased with it. I find it just as effective as the pricey model brand.</li>
    <li> My skin has been so soft &amp; clear since I started using this argan oil. I don&#x27;t have any dry patches where I normally would in the change of seasons. It takes very little oil to moisturize the entire face (1 or 2 drops) so this bottle will last a long time. I also like it on my limbs. I haven&#x27;t really liked it in my hair. I can&#x27;t seem to use it so that my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, even with tiny amounts.</li>
    <li> Have bee using for couple of weeks. Non greasy but moisturizing. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Upon receipt, my product had a strong fruity smell. After consulting with the supplier, I was reassured that this is how unrefined, pure argan oil smells. My first thought was that it was going rancid. The smell does dissipate shortly after applying, I just hope I was told the truth about the product freshness. It&#x27;s too early to give any feedback on how well it works. I will update if I see profound changes in my overall complexion.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and the Customer Service!</li>
    <li> Love It!!  I have oily skin and was concerned about putting oil on my face but it seemed to balance it out. Noticeably smoother skin in just a few days. Fine lines are disappearing!!  I AM HOOKED!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice nutty smell and is thicker than other Argan oils that I have used in the best. Good price as well.</li>
    <li> Not as thick and effective as MoroccanOil, but works in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Argan oil is very good for your skin and great for putting in the ends of your hair to keep it smooth without weighing it down. A little goes a LONG way for hair. I use this and coconut oil in my sugar scrubs (along with other goodies), and it holds well with the type of sugar I use, without breaking it down. Thanks VoilaVe for a great product, I will order again.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful!  I was out shopping today and couldn&#x27;t find 100% Argan oil, let alone organic and it was still over priced. Thank you for making a great product.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my hands before I go to sleep. It has softened my cuticles, moisturized my skin and strengthened my nails. My hands look younger and feel great. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of moisture. It does have a light nutty smell. A little goes a long way. Will buy again for myself and as gifts to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week but I absolutely love it!! I&#x27;m using it on my face because it is so dry and my skin looks so good!!! I hope my skin keeps looking this good because I will continue to buy this!</li>
    <li> Great price for the bottle. All natural. No smell.</li>
    <li> I had bought a one ounce bottle at local health food store for nearly $20 and I compared this to it. I found this VoilaVe oil just as good for much less cost. I use it on my skin and face and on my long hair. It gives my hair that smooth look without looking greasy. I would recommend this and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Got it and it smelled rancid. I had never smelled Argan oil before so I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, but I used it once and it felt awful and oily. I later found a local health foods store and smelled the Argan oil they had there. I am 100% sure this &amp;#34;Argan oil&amp;#34; had gone bad.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first because I have sensitive skin.. But I&#x27;m in love and have become a customer for life!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a shave oil and body and facial moisturizer for my very dry and sensitive skin.  Any time I switch to another product my skin either breaks out or I cut myself shaving.  For best results in my case, I layer the oil under other moisturizing creams, giving it about 20 minutes to fully absorb before applying the top layer.  It does the job as I always get compliments on my &amp;#34;glowing and young-looking skin&amp;#34;--even from dermatologists--and I will be turning 45 soon.</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged from heat styling and hairspray. The first use of this stuff returned my hair to uniform color, the same as my roots, where the color had faded from use of the appliances. So far so good. Great price, as Prime memver delivery was in 2 days as normal. I will order again from this company. Great product, best ever for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long ways.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is every bit as good as the argon oil brands that cost  many times more the price. I will never buy another brand of argon oil.  this stuff is really great</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Wonderful  all around moisturizer for hair, nails, and body.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work wonders on your skin! It is totally amazing. It leaves your skin feeling soft and silky! I also used it on my dry scalp and i no longer have dry scalp! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this specific brand is multi-purpose. I am able to use it on my skin, hair, etc. The only ingredient is organic argan oil, and it was imported  fron Morocco. This is such a good product, that came in a decent sizero bottle.</li>
    <li> So I have been using the Expensive Josie Maran Argan oil for a while now and I really liked it. However the price is so high for a small bottle that I decided to give this product a try!&lt;br /&gt;You can tell from my picture that VoilaVe is about 8 times the size of my mini Josie Maran for the same price! (I almost feel like I should stop reviewing right now cuz nothing beats that! haha JK(&lt;br /&gt;The appearance of it comparing to Josie Maran is really smiliar too. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;VoilaVe has a slightly strong scent (pleasant tho) while JM is almost odorless.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have applied it to my skin, nails and hair and it worked so well on everything, it absorbs right away on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy and nasty after application. I feel like it has a more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; texture to it comparing to Josie Maran, it is not as thick and absorbs faster, leaving my skin softened without the oily texture. I also tried mixing it into my foundation and the application is smoother!&lt;br /&gt;It works well with taming the fizziness of my hair after waking up and gave my nails a healthier glow after removing my polishes.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I&#x27;ve never tried JM on my hair and nails as it was too expensive haha.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this for a placement of JM, it works so well and last you way longer.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil!!! This product is amazing!! It makes my hair soft and manageable.  It controls the frizzys also!!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Strong smell which is proof it&#x27;s all natural! 0 in poor clogging ratings. :) yah!</li>
    <li> great price for argon oil. It is basic &amp; a little bit of it goes a long way. It is the base oil, without the scent, for Moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> Great product and terrific price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It does not have an unpleasant odor like some other pure Argan oils.  I much prefer the pump to the dropper. I use Argan oil on my skin, cuticles and hair.  It helps, doesn&#x27;t cure, eczema.  A little goes a long way.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This is really nice Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve only tried one other to compare with, and I like this one better. It&#x27;s a generous size bottle. So far I&#x27;ve only used on my face, but after reading some reviews, I &#x27;m going to try it on my hair too. I love that it&#x27;s certified organic!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb, sits on skin, hair, etc like regular oil.  Thin and clear consistency, not liquid gold.  Smell is slightly nutty, smells edible.  I am not sure what this oil really is, or what is wrong with it, but it doesn&#x27;t look, or perform like argan oil is supposed to.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than a few bucks a bottle for this stuff, probably really canola oil with some scent and glycerin added to it.....Disappointing!</li>
    <li> for me its just a similar oil to baby oil, etc</li>
    <li> I started to use the VoilaVe Argan Oil for a little over a week, I have to say this oil is amazing, I have used it on my hair, brittle, split ends you name it thats my hair. On my face, I could go on and on but to sum it all up, I will keep using the VoilaVe Argan Oil for Face and Hair as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Love everything but the smell...yuck!</li>
    <li> I love the pump bottle and I love Argan Oil and the way it makes my skin feel.  This particular brand has a very nutty smell.  This nutty smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it is just bearable.  I am kind of wondering if the argan oil is old.  It seems to work as well as my other brand of argan oil but it does have an unpleasant odor.  I am now on my second bottle.  I added a few drops of lavender oil to my first (and now to my second) bottle of VoilaVe Argan Oil.  I now love the smell and I use it frequently.  I apply to my face but also love to rub my arms and legs to help with the dryness.</li>
    <li> Works well to soften my way over processed hair.  It smells a bit &#x27;organic barn-ish&#x27; but it more then redeems itself by how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair, which is very frizzy. I bought this hoping it would help with the frizz, well it fixed the frizz and my split ends. I could not believe it! Love this stuff so much. But don&#x27;t use to much at once, it will make your hair look greasy. It really is a miracle product!!!</li>
    <li> Simply Excellent!  I use it for my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It feels great on my hair and skin. Really recommend it</li>
    <li> ABSORBS QUICKLY, SOFT SKIN, THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and it loves it but I stopped applying it to my face because it made me breakout. I use it on the ends of my hair as part of the loc method.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. My hair prefers light oils as opposed to olive oil or shea butter. Those tend to weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last week &amp; received it so quickly. The service was very prompt &amp; the customer service is outstanding. The argan oil itself is of very good quality &amp; works wonders on my naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my skin and it smooths into the skin like silk...it also absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for good quality argan oil.</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin soft, but have a little odor which dissipates from your skin after a while. I like to mix it with my lotion, it helps with the odor.</li>
    <li> The oil has no bad smell, more like Sesame seed oil, but is way too oily for my skin. I had break outs all over my face after just 2 days of using it. Had to be careful adding it to hair conditioner, just 1-2 drops, one extra drop and I had to wash my hair again. Maybe the oil is great for somebody with dry skin, did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I received one bottle of VoilaVe Organics Argan Oil to review!  Argan Oil is one of the newest beauty products on the market. It has made my skin smooth, super soft and has reduced my fine lines.  The Argan Oil helps to eliminate wrinkles and other signs of aging, over time.  It does a great job on dry or irritated skin, due to the fact that it&#x27;s full of rich antioxidants.  The deep penetrating fatty acids and nourishing vitamins help to give your skin a beautiful healthy glow.  The oil is so nourishing for the skin, plus it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or leave your skin feeling greasy!  The Argan Oil is an AWESOME product and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it mixed with my hair cream for my curly hair and my curls are much more defined and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Love this Argan Oil. I began using it for face washing with the oil cleansing method (OCM) in mid-August and it has done wonders for my skin. Not so oily that it leaves my face oily in the humid air of the coast of Texas, but also moisturizing enough to protect my skin in the dry mountain air while skiing in Colorado. Also, negligible amounts of acne even during the stress of final exams and that time of the month, ladies. Great product. Great customer service. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!! I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair, my face and my elbows. I&#x27;ve seen a significant difference in appearance and feel. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to have beautiful soft, clear skin &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> OMg this stuff is AMAZING!! I absolutely love it can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value!! I would buy again and again.  At this price, I use every day on my hair and on the driest areas of my skin (in addition to lotion).</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I really like this product.  My daughter likes it for her hair.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> No odor that I can detect.  Just what I wanted.  Will last a very long time for my use.</li>
    <li> Best pure argan oil and the best price. I use it on my face, and hair and it works great! Never clogs pores, or leaves a greasy feel. The bottle lasts several months with me using it every day.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a new moisturizer for my face after using mostly high quality coconut oil for awhile.  My skin is ultra sensitive. Lotions with added ingredients and fragrances irritate my skin and cause breakouts. I decided to try the VoilaVe brand after using the Now brand of Argan Oil and discovering I really liked Argan Oil on my face and hair. I must say, I am even more pleased with the VoilaVe brand. The packaging is perfect. The size, the amber bottle, the pump, all work perfectly and are a pleasure to use. More importantly, the quality of the argan oil is excellent. It&#x27;s a very smooth high quality oil that absorbs beautifully. It&#x27;s  fragrance is practically undetectable. I&#x27;ve been using it every night after I wash my face and I also use it in my hair if it begins to look dry or calm my curls and frizz. My skin is definitely softer and more moisturized than before with zero breakouts or irritation. It&#x27;s rare and always great to come across a product that exceeds my expectations. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve managed awful eczema on my hands for years with natural home based remedies, (all-nat&#x27;l apple cider vinegar) but there was still  roughness &amp; some itchyness from multiple outbreaks adding to the appearance of ugly age spots.&lt;br /&gt; I started putting 2 drops of VoilaVe Argan oil on the backs of my hands every night &amp; within 1 day my once beautiful 65 yr old hands showed amazing improvement!  They feel baby-soft again &amp; damage from past excema outbreaks is only a memory.&lt;br /&gt; The soft, smooth skin on my hands now, even reduces the appearance of those age spots!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered this. The price is great. I use it on my body every day and it keeps my legs, arms and face nice and soft. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. I use this in making my own hair oil blend and love the way it smooths the hair shaft with out making it oily or weighed down. Good sized bottle with an easy to use pump, also.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels (silky, not greasy), love how it smells (not at all overwhelming, almost neutral), and love the results.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Awesome seller!!!</li>
    <li> excellent product, I recommend it, it is good quality and it is observed that is orginal. I loved it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s argan oil and it&#x27;s inexpensive. Very mild oil smell, no perfumes and quality seems good.</li>
    <li> for sure a good proudcuts, and the seller was one of the best</li>
    <li> This oil has been a godsend. It is rich and luxurious and feels do good on the skin. It absorbs super quick and absorbs so efficiently into the skin that within a minuet of applying it your skin feels soft smooth and hydrated. It I&#x27;d not heavy at all and works with everything I have used with it. No matter what other products you use, this heavenly oil adds wonders and complements anything paired with it. Considering the BENEFITS of hydrated skin, younger looking face and being able to use this product for many things like hair, skin and nails and considering the size of the bottle (4oz )and price I recommend not hesitating on this brand , you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it. I can&#x27;t tell you enough about this product and I it has fully has surpassed my expectations of it . I have been a Dr. Perricone convert for 4 years and when I could not afford it I would go back to Philosophy which is what I was using 1st. But now, Philosophy has some kick ass new products like Miracle Worker &amp;#34; day. &amp; night &amp;#34; and the vitamin enhanced formula smells great and you can use just a tiny quantity because it goes a long way and is highly concentrated. I use the viola triple c w / huyrlonic acid 2 st on a freshly washed face , then the voilaVe Argan oil then my miracle worker  for face and eye . I get so many complements on my skin and hair now that it&#x27;s ridiculous . BUY IT. YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO</li>
    <li> i love it i use it every day and night. i wrote on your sight. please stop sending me this .. too busy.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several months and I really like it! I use it more on my face and skin than on my hair because it leaves a greasy look to hair, so I use it at night when I&#x27;m not going out or anything.</li>
    <li> Great product at an even greater price!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ARGAN OIL FOR ABOUT A YEAR. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE TRIED THIS COMPANY&#x27;S OIL.  I FIND IT TO BE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY AND MY SKIN LOVES IT.  I LIVE IN THE SOUTHWEST DESERT AND ON OCCASION I USE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT IN MY HAIR. I AM SO HAPPY THAT I FOUND THIS PRODUCT AT A MOST REASONABLE PRICE. THERE IS NO OFFENSIVE ODOR.  THIS OIL IS REMOVED FROM THE BEAN VIA COLD PRESS METHOD, AS I UNDERSTAND.  SO IT IS ALL NATURAL!!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight oil that has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argon Oil for my face for two years now.  I didn&#x27;t take care of my face for far too long, before that.  This absorbs well and has made quite and improvement in my skin!  I do, however, add 1/2 a 15 ml bottle of Young Living Orange Essential Oil, and 20 drops of Frankincense.  I just shake the bottle well and then squirt.  No issues with the oils not coming out, or messing up the straw inside.  I can smell the yummy scent of the EO&#x27;s in my hand.  One bottle will last me about 6 months and I use it every night.  Beats other expensive creams with God knows what inside!!  I&#x27;m hooked, and this is a good brand!  I know two Estheticians who use Argon oil, too.  They said they mix Jojoba in with it.  I may try that, one day.  But, I love this as-is.  Stored on my counter.</li>
    <li> 5 STARVoilaVeS! I dye my hair from medium mouse to a gold/ platinum, every 6-8 weeks. I&#x27;ve never gotten a comb through it in 2+ decades. Since birth?? LOL!  ; D. After 4-5 uses (2-3 drops-per manufacturer&#x27;s directions), my hair is blooming! I use it rubbed between my hands, then apply it to the last 8-10&amp;#34; of my hair. I can actually comb it! I&#x27;ve never gotten a comb through my wet hair (I know better, but it won&#x27;t get through knots without a rigged pulley system in our bathroom.)😁 After a trim &amp; a few months of this product, my hair will be like satin!! It&#x27;s great for hands &amp; nails too, I&#x27;ve noticed. These are results. People are asking, &amp;#34;what did you do to your hair?&amp;#34; And I tell them VoilaVe / &amp; Amazon!! 5/5 STARS! My Stars won&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Only need small amount</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil everyday for my hands and my hair. I love this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and absolutely loved it, but my most recent purchase just doesn&#x27;t seem like the same product, or it has gone bad? It is thicker and has a distinctly sickly sweet smell. I had a little bit left from a previous purchase, and I could easily tell the difference. I guess I just got a bad batch this time, so I might try to find somewhere in store to buy my argan oil.</li>
    <li> Just got it last week and I started to use it right away. Works perfect on my hair and skin.. Worth a try.. Highly recommended... Thank you!</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is the latest beauty craze and this oil does not disappoint.  I do feel that it is not the greatest oil to use on the face, but after every shower I do apply this from the neck down (maybe 8-10 pumps depending on dryness) and it is just amazing.  My skin does not dry out and just *feels* good.  It does not feel oily at all after I give it a minute to absorb.  It gives my skin a supple and silky feel and I absolutely love it.  This is an incredible value and I will buy it again.  I have not used it on my hair, as I feel it would be too thick for that purpose, but it could work.  My husband also uses this for his dry hands from time to time and he loves it - especially since it is not &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not too oily. As a matter of fact I use it on everything from head to toe. Love it.</li>
    <li> I like the pump dispenser on this bottle.  Argan oil is easy to overdue - that&#x27;s why a lot of commercial products (Like Pantene and Suave&#x27;s hair oils) say WITH ARGAN.  A little can go a long way, so know this if you&#x27;ve never used the pure stuff before.  If you use too much, you can end up with hair that looks super shiny but super oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, with my long hair - I only use 2 pumps and it goes ONLY on the ends.  It smoothes it down and makes it much more manageable and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the brown bottle as it protects the product, and it comes well sealed.  The oil I got was fresh - it had the characteristic argan nutty smell that I am used to, and it was slightly gold in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s differences in argan oil.  There are different grades, and the filtration can be different.  I like this - it&#x27;s really good on my skin and nails too.  This bottle should last a long time.  This looks and smells a lot like a lot of other brands that have sent me their oils for my opinion, but I really prefer the pump dispenser on this one.  It is SO MUCH BETTER than the eyedroppers.  Also, this one is very tightly sealed and tamperproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing and evaluation. If you see my reviews, you&#x27;ll see that I have reviewed for other producers of argan oil as well.  This one and a few others carry the same ecocert certification.  Their standards requirement is listed on the ecocert site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The argan used in this product was produced in Morocco, and the production there helps poor women have gainful employment at fair wages with renewable resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip I&#x27;ve learned reviewing argan oils- until you know how a brand is going to perform for you - and even within a brand I find that batches can vary a bit - keep some dry shampoo handy in case you use too much.  The last argan I used required about twice the amount as this one, so I started off with 4 squirts.  It was too much.  Dry shampoo fixes that EASILY.  For me, with below chest length but above waist length hair, 2 full squirts just on the ends is the sweet spot.h but above waist length hair, 2 full squirts just on the ends is the sweet spot.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair sooooo soft.  Love it!  Also when used under face cream it increases the benefits.....what could be better????</li>
    <li> I think that you can find Argan oil for a cheaper price, but I really wanted something in a glass bottle that I could reuse for homemade skincare that included essential oils (which eventually break down plastic) and so I spent more to get this. I love the bottle, the dispenser is perfect and doesn&#x27;t pump out too much. Great value for the price if you reuse the bottle like I am.</li>
    <li> Great oil for moisturizing your hair</li>
    <li> i use this oil daily. however, you just need to use a little. i use it at night and also over the make up. one little drop &amp; rub your hands, than pat over the face. leave a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I like the product but miss the unique light fragrance of other Argan oils I have used.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Delivered right away.  The pump on the bottle is a new wonderful change from an eye dropper.  The best was the price!!  Not even one third of what Josie Maran charges for the exact same product.  I&#x27;d like to add I&#x27;ve been using her product for years and paying a very high price.  This is extremely reasonable and is the exact same product.  Kudos for this product.  I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
    <li> French Women Don&#x27;t Get Facelifts: The Secret of Aging with Style &amp; Attitude by Mireille Guiliano stated that French Women use Argan oil.  Armed with that information, I was on a quest to find a reasonably priced organic oil.  This product is used from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet as I live in the dry southwest.  It has a mild smell that dissipates quickly; no clashing with your perfumes, etc. It leaves a sheen that is absorbed into the skin; I never have had it leave its mark on clothing.  It is used by itself or mixed with a moisturizer. As a side bar, I have been told that my face glows (even for an old broad!) and my hair shines. Without reservation, I provide the link to this product for those who inquire as to where I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I use this Argan oil instead of a moisturizer.  I have literally tried everything.  This seems to be one of the few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I have extremely acne prone, sensitive skin.  I would definitely recommend.  Also, the price is very good, and this is 100% pure and ECO certified.  So you know you&#x27;re getting a good product.</li>
    <li> Not for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil didn&#x27;t do a thing other than makes my hair and face greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Better put on olive oil on my face. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. Tossed it in the trash because it is a trashy product</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin but this product is able to hydrate the complete night.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel so soft</li>
    <li> I found this Argan oil to be just fine. It wasn&#x27;t rancid. To me it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell at all. I use it for my curly hair after I take a shower. It is light enough that it moisturizes my hair without making it heavy. It makes my hair extremely shiny and magnificently flowy. I haven&#x27;t tried putting this on my face but I do occasionally use it on my hands and it makes them feel very nice. Sorry, but I am not sure what everyone is complaining about.</li>
    <li> The perfect amount is dispensed with one pump.  You never want to use too much oil, and the pump insures that none is wasted.  And the oil has a VERY mild smell.  I used it on my face and hair and haven&#x27;t had any issues with either being oily after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product that I&#x27;ve purchased two of them in two weeks. I was impressed with how it&#x27;s helped my flatiron-damaged hair, and I also use it as a moisturizer and rub it into my nails. I took my first bottle along when visiting my 91 yr old mother recently and used it on her &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; overdyed hair. She liked it so much that I gave it to her and ordered another one for myself.</li>
    <li> Really like the feel of this in my hair</li>
    <li> Makes my really dry chemically processed hair so soft! Put it in my curly hair after showering the night before, woke up and I looked like I just came from the salon. Only thing is make sure you don&#x27;t put it on the top parts of your head it weights it down, there&#x27;s a card that comes with instructions.</li>
    <li> I like the results. The natural argan oil scent takes some getting used to. The price makes it a very good deal compared to other brands of pure organic argan oil. I use for mustache and beard grooming. Very good to keep mustache and beard smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Great for hair. I was losing too much hair in each shower (normal routine is Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; rinse off). I stopped using conditioner and substituted with Argan Oil + Redken Leave-In Conditioner. No more hair loss and hair is soft. (2 pumps oil + 2 pumps Redken Leave-In Conditioner). Avoid putting on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! I use it as a face moisturizer as well as a leave in conditioner for my hair. It is a dry oil so it is completely absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling or looking greasy. I like that the bottle is dark glass to protect the product. I&#x27;m not super happy with the dispenser but I spoke to someone at the company and they are looking into giving other options. My complaint with the dispenser is that it&#x27;s hard to control how much product you take out. For example, it&#x27;s difficult to do a half a pump. They are considering giving the option for droppers which I would love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am completely satisfied and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product and I am pleased. I was surprised just how large and nice the bottle is and has a convenient pump. The oil itself has a slightly nutty scent that shouldn&#x27;t be bothersome unless you are very sensitive to smells and it dissipates quickly. After using for several days my skin is silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy for long. No word on whether it breaks me out or not yet, but I still would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy high quality argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin abd hair look and feel fabulous. I will purchase again. Everyone should try it, I think you will love it as much as I do:)</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! I use it before going to bed, and the next morning my skin is smooth and soft, not oily. The price is right. The top of the bottle is a push bottom style. Some might prefer an eye dropper style.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have very dry skin and I use it as a night cream or in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different Argan oils and while some have been very good there have been many that were not very pleasing for several reasons. This particular Argan oil is by far my favorite. It is simply wonderful and goes a long way. It feels very luxurious and makes me feel I am doing something truly wonderful for my skin. I will no longer be shopping for the best oil, I have found it.</li>
    <li> This was my first bottle from this company. I have been using their Rose Hip Oil and Vit C Serum with pleasing results. Both products are now a regular part of my beauty regimens. So, adding the Argon Oil was a next step. As with the former products, I do not think I will have look any further! I love the sheen it leaves on my hair when applied as a finishing product. I use it also as a bedtime facial and hand treatment. It soaks right in and leaves my skin hyrdrated and glowing. This definitely is the Argon Oil to buy!</li>
    <li> this is the best Argan Oil I have ever tried, I use it on my face and my hair every day. It makes my skin feel soft and a life. Its a great product to use under make up or at night. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have gotten compliment after compliment on my skin.  I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I hv cmpleted using this and never had any break outs .i seriously adore this product</li>
    <li> I just recently received the Argan Oil as a gift. I absolutely love it! I use it for my old battle wounds or as most people call it horrible stretch marks due to having kids. It hasn&#x27;t even been a month and my stretch marks have diminished in color. Even my dark ones are lighter. Reading all the other reviews I will certainly now also use it for my cuticles and hair. Great product and the fact that its organic makes it even better. Will definitely purchase myself once I run out.</li>
    <li> I had damaged my hair with a keratin treatment which turned it to frizz. I have the right shampoo and conditioner that worked for a while. I didn&#x27;t realize until it was too late that it was the keratin product that totally damaged my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had about given up on anything to correct my hair, although I had tried every product on the market, spending too much money and nothing worked. I heard about Argan oil and decided to try it. I could not believe the difference in my hair. Each day it got better. I hope to never run out and am not going to try any other argan oil. I love this product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I recently had the opportunity to try 100% Organic Argan Oil by VoilaVe. One of the many things that I love about Argan oil is the relief my scalp gets from the severe dryness I experience as a symptom of psoriasis. Right before bed, I just put a few of drops on my fingertips (a little goes a long way) and massage my scalp with the Argan oil, I then put my hair up in a bun and leave it on my scalp overnight. When I wash my hair in the morning, my scalp feels great instead of the usual dry (almost burning) sensation I feel because of the dry cracking that the skin on my scalp has to endure due to having psoriasis… It can be extremely painful at times. Luckily, I have not experienced this since I began using 100% Argan Oil as a scalp treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is not only for those who suffer with psoriasis. It is commonly used in spas and in beauty treatments all around the world. It is really great for improving your hair, skin and nails. I even use it in some areas of my face! I have combination skin though so I only use a very small amount on the drier areas of my face. Also, as you get older, your skin loses its moisture. Using Argan oil everywhere on your body is ideal to obtain soft, silky and nourished skin. It is a natural and safe moisturizing solution that is safe for anyone to use. It is commonly referred to as the “miracle in a bottle.”  I have to agree with that notion. I highly recommend 100% Argan Oil to anyone who experiences dry skin and anyone who would like to strengthen their hair and nails.</li>
    <li> Great for skin and hair, I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> Great quality! REAL 100% ARGAN OIL for under $20. I order this in December and now 2 months later I still have half the bottle. Absorb quickly into skin and hair. I use it for my hair and face. It also helps with eyebrow and lash growth.</li>
    <li> What a great price for this much magical argan oil.  LOVE IT!!!!  I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be as high a quality as my last purchase because it was so much less.  But I was pleasantly surprised!!!  Same great oil for a much better price!  I use this on my nails, hair and skin.  Faithful daily use on nails will work wonders on difficult problems!  I&#x27;ll never be without it again!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Works wonders on my sensitive skin and keeps the dry patches supple. I was using coconut oil and that totally destroyed my skin. This argan oil rescued it from the depths of pimpledom.</li>
    <li> I love that this product doesn&#x27;t use a dropper. The pump makes life so much easier. The product itself seems to be very good, and my skin is enjoying the moisture. going to try it on the ends of my hair next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of Argan Oil over the past year, including the Josie Maran brand. If the only ingredient is 100% pure organic Argan Oil, why pay so much more for just a brand name? When I saw how much Argan Oil this brand (VoilaVe) was giving for the price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I&#x27;ve been equally pleased with this brand as I was the Josie Maran brand....actually more pleased because I can use more of it since it&#x27;s so much more affordable! I use it on my face, hands and cuticles. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My wife love it. I may want to buy more in the future</li>
    <li> very good, has a slight olive type odor but not unpleasant, very good for chapped hands.</li>
    <li> Love it. It has a really nice, light, nutty smell to it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27; t sure how I would feel about this oil, or any oil on my hair...I love it! I noticed a few gray hairs which never wanted to stay put and felt brittle, I started using a few drops,( long hair) and the grey hair became flexible and even looked darker...so weird, but true and I love the healthy look and feel.</li>
    <li> Best product out there to get rid of frizz.</li>
    <li> Works well on damaged hair. If you&#x27;re a blonde, it will turn your blonde into an orangey color. Don&#x27;t worry about it, just retone your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil and it came within 2 days...it was beautifully packaged and the oil is just wonderful ...I have used Argan oil for about a year but not 100% argan oil so I look forward to seeing even greater results than before&lt;br /&gt;This oil is great to use ....it&#x27;s not sticky and has an easy to use pump that pumps out just small drops..so you can easily control the amount of oil you use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great on my hair too ...the cure for humidity frizz here in the deep south ...go ahead  treat yourself</li>
    <li> Great product! Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 year old son who has severe eczema. He can&#x27;t use any lotions--only oils. He really really likes this oil; he prefers it over our usual coconut oil because it soaks deeper into the skin. The natural scent of it is not pleasant, but I&#x27;d much rather it be a little stinky than have it have an artificial fragrance added to it.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> First I would like to mention I love that the bottle has a pump so I can apply as much or as little that I desire. Contolling the amount is always a plus. This Organic Argan Oil is great for my hair. It has a strong scent that is almost smoky like and when applied to my hair it fades and I do not notice it. It works well on my hair and leaves it with a beautiful shine. However for my face, the scent is too strong and it is a bit to heavy. I am not sure if my Argan Oil is suppose to smell like this. I have had other argan oils and they have a softer more pleasant scent.  I also like to apply it to my feet and heels. Oils tend to work so much better than lotions or creams for those areas. I was sent this for review via Tomoson.</li>
    <li> Great price and quantity, and great customer service. My only issue is, does argan oil smell like this? Has a faint olive oil-y smell compared to the one I tried by Josie Maran. Hmm too cheap to be true?</li>
    <li> Lite,non-greasy. Good product</li>
    <li> Thank you for fast delivery and Hight quality product! Love it!</li>
    <li> Argan oil is an old French beauty secret for gleaming, healthy skin, hair and nails. This is an excellent quality oil, I have purchased it three times and will continue to get this brand. I go through about one bottle every 2 months and the shipping is always quite fast and the bottles are well-packed. I am Caucasian and I have very dry skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip is to use a light touch with this oil! A little goes a long way. I use it every day before bed on my face, neck, chest and arms (up to my elbows) -- after washing and drying my skin thoroughly. I use about two pumps from the bottle each night -- it goes a long way. If I&#x27;m going to be outdoors on a particular day, I wash and dry my face/neck/shoulders and apply a light coat of argan oil, let it dry, then apply sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on my hair, I get about 3-4 pumps of the oil in my hands and work it thoroughly through my hair. I leave it in my hair for as long as I can, ideally 30+ minutes, then I take a shower and wash it out. After my shower, I put just a TINY bit in my hands and work it into my wet hair, concentrating on the ends. I have very long hair. If you overdo it on clean hair, you will end up needing another shower -- lol -- so use a light touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any leftover oil I just work into my hands and make sure I get some rubbed on my cuticles and fingernails. I used to have really dry cuticles and would pick at them, but since I&#x27;ve been using argan oil my hands are soft and my cuticles are healthy. Argan oil is better than 99% of the beauty creams out there, and very rarely do you find something that can be used on skin, hair and nails. I don&#x27;t know how this would work for someone with oily skin, because my skin is very dry. I don&#x27;t use as much oil on the places where I used to break out -- my chin mostly -- and since I&#x27;ve been following a strict skin care routine of washing my face day and night, and using argan oil, I have not broken out. I get compliments all the time onmy glowing, healthy skin. I&#x27;m 35 and I almost never wear makeup ... with really healthy skin you don&#x27;t have to!</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is light, fragrance free, and very soothing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband&#x27;s seborrheic dermatitis because he used my Argan Magic brand and it calmed his skin down within 24 hours. I bought this because the reviews were great and you get twice the amount! Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t believe this is real argan oil. It doesn&#x27;t absorb the same, smell the same or even have the same texture as the ones I&#x27;ve owned from Josie Maran, Argan Magic or Garden of Wisdom. To make matters worse, my husband&#x27;s skin has gone from flaking because of the s. dermatitis to scabbed over, red and angry. All argan oil is sourced from the same place, so it shouldn&#x27;t vary so wildly! Please use caution with this product.</li>
    <li> Please read before buying!&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to buy this product because of all the hype over 100% argan oil. However when I got this product in the mail and put a drop into my hair I was very dissapointed! The oil did not absorb at all and was a very thick greasy texture, which is very odd because argan oil isn&#x27;t usually greasy unless you put too much in your hair, and it is supposed to absorb all most instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I am not convinced that this is real authentic argan oil. I have returned this product and will not be repurchasing from this brand again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, much cheaper than what can be found in any of the stores in the Seattle area. I thoroughly enjoy this product for keeping my hair/scalp neat and attractive. It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It is also outstanding for use on sensitive skin - I use it for dark circles under my eyes and have had no problems with applying it directly to my face.</li>
    <li> As in all Argan oil, this product has stopped the breakage in my 11 year old daughters hair.  It&#x27;s leaves your hair soft and NOT greasy at all.</li>
    <li> A very good quality product! We use it for our hair mostly and sometimes for the skin too! It is pure and works really well for us!</li>
    <li> This argan oil works great! It is TOP QUALITY. It is by far the best argan oil I have used even better than an expensive brand I had been using. I use it on my hair, legs, and face. My hair looks so silky smooth and my skin feels wonderful! And what a VALUE...it is the best value I have ever seen on a 4 oz bottle. Oh yes, I love the pump which makes it so easy to dispense.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves my skin soft. Truly high quality.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I read reviews on it and of course I was skeptical about putting it on my face, but I did and it works wonders.  Moisturizes my skin without the oiley feel.  Makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> I use this only on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am African and this oil works great on my natural black hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gives is a shine without being oily and I can easily comb through.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I do keep my hair short, but if you have my kind of hair you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how smooth my hands feel after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> This oil is priceless. I hope never to be with out it. My hair and my skin, even my nails are healthier, since using this oil. I love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother in law who happens to have some skin issues and this has helped to heal those issues up.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Really like the way this product feels on my skin; didn&#x27;t like it for my hair.  A little pricey.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day after using toner on my clean face. Very moisturizing and affordable.</li>
    <li> wonderful product thanks</li>
    <li> Great product, perfect for hair and skin</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time on my hair, face, hands and feet.  Very good oil at good price</li>
    <li> Great for hair and cuticles a little dab will do very useful</li>
    <li> I recently discovered Argan oil and it is is wonderful. I use it on my face and hands and my nails have never looked better. It makes my skin feel soft and my face does not feel &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; a short time after I moisturize. I have since bought other Argan oil products (shower gel, hand soap, etc) and have great results.</li>
    <li> I never, ever write reviews. but this argan oil is some of the absolute BEST I have tried. In under a week my skin is hydrated, and not oily. This is a dry oil, doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin, an absorbs extremely quick. I use it on my face, or mixed with unscented sensitive body lotion for the rest. On hair, it&#x27;s just PHENOMENAL.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this. your skin/hair will thank you!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product because of the good price compared to my tradition brand. I wont name it here.&lt;br /&gt;BUT this brand of argan oil is not very moisturizing. I use it as an after shave and it would just dry up my skin and cause a bit more irritation than necessary. I won&#x27;t be using this again for after shave. But it might suffice in other application as my hair but I am not too brave to try it yet.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. I use it for my natural hair. I use only natural organic products when it comes to my hair and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is really good just a little goes a long way. I love how this oil has a pump on it and it makes it so much easier to use. Also it smells pretty good to me.</li>
    <li> This oil is horrible! This is not what argan oil is suppose to be like, it smells really bad and broke me out like crazy. I don&#x27;t think it is real argan oil because argan oil is very moisturizing and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is very drying and oily in a bad way. Its slimy and wont absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer another brand that is more absorbant and more moisturzing and smells good!</li>
    <li> I first bought argan oil in Morocco in a supermarket and ever since then, I can&#x27;t live without it.  A tiny squirt smoothed on your face each morning leaves your skin glowing. I have dry skin so it&#x27;s especially nice as a moisturizer. When the oil gets absorbed it&#x27;s not greasy at all and it leaves your skin soft. A little goes a long way. I smooth some on my hair too after a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Wish I&#x27;d discovered it earlier.  Great on hands, hair, body and face,  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Great product and super price. This stuff can make your feet smooth again within a week.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some people are complaining about this oil having a bad smell?! It does NOT have a bad smell at all..it doesn&#x27;t have any smell really! It&#x27;s very, very lightweight and the size of the bottle is very generous for the low price. I just started using it so i can&#x27;t wait to see how it does on my hair..NO SMELL!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a person of South Asian origin in his mid thirties who has a very dry (brown) skin and steely hard hair.  I have been on a quest to find a natural moisturiser that works on my skin and does not leave my skin feeling sticky throughout the day.  Being from Indian subcontinent, I have been using virgin coconut oil, and I also have tried Shea butter and Cocoa Butter so far, none of which worked for me.  They would make my skin soft, but they also left me feeling sticky throughout the day and the itchiness on my skin never really went away when I used these natural products.  Since the body and skin types are so different for each of us, what works for one may not work for other and so the aforementioned natural products may work wonders for others but did not for me.  I also switched to using Dudu Osun black soap few years ago which is a wonderful soap but also a little drying for the skin.  I found out about Argan Oil last year and how much of a miracle oil it is for hair and body.  While I was sceptical it would work for me, I decided to test it myself if the oil is as amazing as it is claimed.  Being a resident of Singapore, my choices of buying the oil was only through Internet and I first bought a bottle from Akoma Organics, a UK based online retailer of natural products.  The Argan oil from Akoma smelt bad and not nutty like how it was described online.  It did not work for my skin or hair nor was it quickly absorbed as Argan oil is supposed to be.  Discouraged but not ready to give up, I decided to try a different manufacturer before ticking Argan oil off my list of tried and failed products.  I purchased the Argan oil from VoilaVe as it is one of the top reviewed Argan oil brands in Amazon.  And the difference between VoilaVe and the Akoma could not be more contrasting!  The smell of Argan oil from VoilaVe was more nutty, crisp and fresh!  And the difference it made to my skin and hair was wonderful!  For the first time in my adult life, my hair was soft &amp; pliable for 8 - 10 hours after application of Argan oil.  My skin just soaks up the oil within 20 - 30 minutes of application and remains soft &amp; itch free for up to 12 hours after application.  My skin care regimen is very simple these days thanks to VoilaVe: shower daily with Dudu Osun black soap and apply Argan oil all over my body after showering, followed by 7 - 8 drops on moist hair.  On hair, I apply &amp;#34;bottoms up&amp;#34;, i.e., start from root and apply upwards.  I part my hair so I comb my hair immediately after applying to let the hair and the parting &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; properly.  I let the skin absorb oil for 10 minutes before dressing up and the skin remains soft and pliable for 10 - 12 hours!  I re-apply Argan oil on very dry parts, i.e., leg and hand before going to bed.  I am so happy to have found an all natural product that finally works on my skin &amp; hair!!  I&#x27;m very glad that I can now stay away from chemical moisturisers for the most part.  For those days when I have to wear a business suit and can&#x27;t risk oil getting absorbed into the suit, I use Physiogel, an expensive but fragrance free moisturiser that keeps my skin moisturised without feeling sticky.  I&#x27;ve been using VoilaVe Argan oil for 7 months now and I&#x27;m very, very happy with the results!  I need to order replenishment since my second bottle is almost finished, and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order VoilaVe again, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t ship to Singapore.  So, I&#x27;ve had to order Pura D&#x27;Or Argan oil through Amazon since they ship to Singapore.  I&#x27;m hoping Pura D&#x27;Or will be as good as VoilaVe and I truly hope that VoilaVe start shipping internationally through Amazon!</li>
    <li> It had a problem with the packaging causing it to leak on its way to me, but amazon exceeded my expectations and made it right to me. Amazon has the best customer service. Using what I have left, it&#x27;s super moisturizing, easy to dispense, and non greasy. It&#x27;s also a great price. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel like smooth leather. It absorbs into the skin very quickly, which is a sign of good quality Argan Oil. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product at a very reasonable price. Love, love, love how well it moisturizes the face as well as the rest of your body. Makes you glow, not greasy at all. Will definetly buy again and again.</li>
    <li> It was all the reviews that got me to &amp;#34;go for it&amp;#34;. Thank you to all who shared. This is like gold. I use it everywhere. My hubbie didn&#x27;t have a fit when I asked his to rub it on my back. His comment was &amp;#34;well, my hands are as soft as surgeons hands&amp;#34;. I was shocked. If my VoilaVe  shampoo and cream rinse disappear I&#x27;ll know were to find them.  I&#x27;m getting this for everywhere I know I&#x27;ll be and want to use it.  Like the kitchen, where I watch TV and so on.  I will get this as gifts.  What a nice present, especially coupled with their other products.  I don&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34;.  It isn&#x27;t greasy so if I use it on my hair my pillow case is just fine.  NICE! This will be a staple from now on.  I don&#x27;t want to try any other argan products because if it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil. After I received the oil, I immediately put some in my dry frizzy hair, and the change it made for me was AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never been so smooth with as much luster as it is right now. I also tried on a scar that is in the healing process on my face. Once again it amazed me how soothing it is on that area of my face. I am going to add a little to my shampoo and try that as well. Thank you VoilaVe for this liquid gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00IT1HKV4 ORGANIC Argan Oil For Hair &amp; Face - 100% Pure &amp; ECO Certified Organic - Larger 4 oz Bottle - Miracle Oil For Every Skin Condition, Hair, Nails, Anti-aging &amp; More! Pure Moroccan Argan Oil - 100% Guaranteed to Work Wonders for Your Body</li>
    <li> I have used a different organic argan oil in the past and I don&#x27;t think there is any difference in effect - both have had outstanding results for me in terms of anti-aging and general skin softening.  It&#x27;s very non-irritating and I have sensitive skin.  The advantage to this particular brand is that it is not only less expensive, but has a spray nozzle instead of a dropper.  I find this easier to use with less chance of a spill.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I was afraid that the product might not be real argan oil because the price was so low for so much of it.  No need to fear, it&#x27;s the real deal and at a terrific price too.  It comes in a dark amber bottle to help protect this precious oil.  I have combination skin and use it every night after I&#x27;ve cleansed my face and neck.  I use daily on my hands, nails and cuticles with great results on anything I use it on; even my legs after shaving.  This is a great product and I&#x27;m so glad VoilaVe is able to offer it at such an affordable price.  Glad I found them!</li>
    <li> Bought this to fix  my nails.  Been splitting and peeling.  Helped by using it everyday.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute must for those that have problems with dry skin. I am a dentist and am constantly washing my hands and wear powdered examination gloves in my practice. These actions can really dry out one&#x27;s hands. I have found that using argan oil works wonders in keeping my hands moisturized. I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nice.  A little goes a long way. I used to much the first time and my hair looked greasy. So don&#x27;t use to much and stick to using it on your ends if your getting it for your hair.</li>
    <li> Medium weight oil to use on face, hair and nails.  I only use on my face and what whatever is left on my hands I rub into my nails.  Since I started using Argan oil regularly my skin is less red and inflamed, I have roseaca and it has helped tremendously.  This bottle does have a small pump, only 1-3 pumps is needed, start with one to get used to it, melts in quickly.  Shipped quickly and well packed, did leak slightly but the bottle was sealed so no way to get around it.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> quite a quality product</li>
    <li> I was buying Argon oil from QVC for $109.00 per bottle. This is the exact same thing for less than $20.00. Glad I found it!!!!! LOVE.</li>
    <li> An awesome deal on 100% argan oil! I just started using it. It gave my hair a fantastic shine and smoothness immediately. It&#x27;s also great on my skin. The verdict is still out on whether it makes a very good beard oil, by itself.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. Great on face, body and hair.  Great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a skin moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used organic plant oils as moisturizing lotions for years. It&#x27;s odd that, used sparingly, oils never leave you feeling oily or stickily.  Commercial moisturizing lotions always do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used pre shave oils to moisturize my dry skin. They work well, smell great, but are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I though I&#x27;d try a true skin oil with healing properties. This one&#x27;s almost water thin and has essentially no scent. When smelled close up, it has the faint scent of sesame oil, the oil used in Asian cooking. Not particularly pleasant or unpleasant, there&#x27;s so little scent that it doesn&#x27;t matter. The bottle has a pump top which makes it easier and less messy to dispense.</li>
    <li> Smells old and stuff.  This is the 1st time I used this Argan Oil, I usually purchase another. I thought I would try this.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I hope they take this back.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and great product, thanks!</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR YOUR ENTIRE BODY, I HAVE ACNE PRONE SKIN SO I HAVE TO USE WATER BASE MOISTURIZER WHICH MAKES MY FACE FEELS SO DRY SO I USE 1/2 PUMP MIXED WITH MY MOISTURIZER IT WORKS WELL, NO BREAKOUTS.</li>
    <li> Someone had given me a sample of Agadir argan oil, and I really liked it. I did some research and decided to try this one. What a mistake! I used the same amount as I had with the other sample, but it left my hair flat, greasy and dull. Also, it has a slightly sour smell. I can&#x27;t return this, since I opened it, but I&#x27;m going to give it away and purchase the Agadir brand instead. Bummed!</li>
    <li> This product is one of my worst purchases ever. Well! Before I start, I just need to emphasize that this is NOT a fake review. I am an Amazon customer who was really harmed due to believing fake reviews and purchasing worthless products based on people&#x27;s reviews. So I&#x27;m just posting an honest review based on my own personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair wasn&#x27;t in its best condition, may be due to extra work and being restless for a very long time so I thought to browse Amazon for some products that would help get it back to its normal condition and that Argan Oil happened to be the first thing that I saw. I read the five stars reviews and didn&#x27;t waste the time. I instantly ordered it. The oil arrived and I was so excited but once I opened the bottle and got it close to my nose, it was so obvious that the fluid in the bottle contained a good amount of &amp;#34;castor oil&amp;#34; which gives it the thickness and the smell cannot be mistaken. This is not pure argan oil as it says. I just thought to give it a real chance and tried it on my hair as instructed and OMG! OMG! My hair never in my life looked so greasy, frizzy and weighed down. I was instantly turned off and On the same day I had to order the HSI serum which I love from my heart. Well, I don&#x27;t want to sound like paid reviewers who write fake reviews to promote other products. This is my honest review and I am not promoting any products here, I&#x27;m just saying the truth. And I&#x27;m not comparing the two products as they both have different functions but at least HSI does what it says while this product claims to be faaaaaar better than what it is and it&#x27;s really, really overrated. Long story short, this is not pure argan oil, this is castor oil mixed with, maybe, a very small percentage of argan oil and other stuff, God knows what!</li>
    <li> Very hydrating love it!!! Use carefully or hair will look oily</li>
    <li> Love it, my skin feels like new.</li>
    <li> Nice oil for the price and I love the spray which makes dispensing so convenient.</li>
    <li> LOVE the Oil  Great trader Thank You A++++ i will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have bought just the 2 other brands that cost more and this one is just as good and it as the wonderful pump like the $20 an ounce brand I tried had. My skin is picky I get breakouts at times mostly in summer and dry and rosacea like rash when my autoimmune disorder kicks in. If this stuff was not as good as the $20 an ounce brand my skin would let me know it! I admit that I rarely use this oil alone for my picky skin I blend it with equal parts coconut, rose hip and Argan. Took me 4 months of playing around as my usual coconut oil was letting me down last winter and none of the oils alone worked but the synergistic blend does. This is just a great deal. I will defiantly buy this again with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> This oil is great.  Very nice oil for a good price.  Have ordered it twice and will continue to do so as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it everyday on myself and my kids</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use it as a carrier oil with my essential oils.  Have had good results for many skin conditions.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is simply the best quality I have found. A little goes a long way. Great price points. I am looking forward to trying VoilaVe&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> I use it faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;It is terrific</li>
    <li> Very happy with this for hair conditioning...and the bottle has lasted a good long time. Goes on light and moisturizers without being greasy looking.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. My wife uses it for her skin. We&#x27;ll see if it works.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. I have tried many including the very high priced brands and this one performs as good or better than any of those. My hair feels great and the oil absorbs so nicely into my skin. Would buy again and highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It does wonders for my hair. :)</li>
    <li> Great product ! I bought it in July after a good friend of mine has been using Argan oil for 10 years and advised me to try. She has a beautiful skin. I bought this brand because of the great reviews, the price and the warranty. I decided to finish the bottle before writing a review. I have been using it for 4 months and have amazing results. I left on a 3 weeks vacation when I started using it and when I came back my coworkers said very nice comments on how my skin was beautiful, they call it the &amp;#34;sexy glow&amp;#34; ! I use it twice a day on my face, neck, hands and my skin tightened and became softer and some dark spots are gone, the color of the skin is uniform now. I am buying a second bottle !</li>
    <li> It absorbs nicely into the skin, but too oily for the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for use on my skin, specifically my face, after reading several recommendations. I&#x27;m in beauty product purgatory, too old for acne fighting/teen stuff but too young for anti-aging/wrinkle stuff, so I was looking for a new routine all together. I was skeptical, argan oil seemed like the recent coconut oil craze (COCONUT OIL CURES EVERY POSSIBLE PROBLEM!!! Like oil pulling- SWISH IT IN YOUR MOUTH FOR 20 MINUTES AND IT REMOVES IMPURITIES! Silly me, I thought that&#x27;s what I brush my teeth for). Plus how could oil not cause breakouts? But it has worked great. I wash my face, rub in a small amount of oil, and my skin has been clear and well moisturized without any problems. Will definitely keep using</li>
    <li> We winter in the desert and with sun, chlorine, and wind my skin and hair was so dry.  My stylist recommended using Argan oil after each shampoo so I purchased this product and began using it and right away could tell the difference.  My hair looked healthy again  Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this oil. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy. I&#x27;ve been trying it as a moisturizer and it works nicely with my foundation.</li>
    <li> Very good product for my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using rose hip oil as facial treatment.  A friend told me about argan oil so I ordered  this one and so far (a month)  I really like it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS DISGUSTING! How on earth does this have so many positive reviews?  IT SMELLS LIKE OLIVES!  so gross- I am so disappointed- total waste of money- how did 300 people give it a good review.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this argon oil! I use it on my face, hands, body and hair. It tames my frizzy hair and is great on my dry hands!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  A little bit goes a long way. The co-founder of VoilaVe personally contacted me to ensure that the product arrived on time and to confirm product satisfaction.  I am very pleased with their product and attentiveness toward their customers. This product is excellent and makes my dry frizzy hair feel smooth and healthy.  Definitely a great price for 100% natural and organic Argan oil.</li>
    <li> This Product is great!  It leaves my hair silky smooth.  I am also using it to soften my hands, elbows and knees.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love using it on my face but it smells like old gorgonzola.</li>
    <li> This is honestly not what I expected... it smells like peanut oil &amp; is sort of thick &amp; yellow. Argan oils I have used prior were lighter or clear (probably highly processed I&#x27;m sure) &amp; odorless. This does not penetrate the skin or hair or cuticles the way others I have used in the past have. This honestly just sits on top of the skin for me. A much more expensive brand I used prior, I used to put it on my face, let it sit for a few mins &amp; then apply my mineral makeup - it would be soaked in totally before makeup application, this stuff sits on top of my skin &amp; never soaks in, I actually gucked up a makeup brush trying to apply after use, On my skin, this looks greasy - not dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good for use on the body I guess, I use it on my face at night time still, though it shows up on my pillowcase... Also NOT good for hair, wet before blow drying or after - &amp; I have thick, naturally curly hair... this weighed my hair down &amp; made it look dirty even when using 2 pumps on waist length wet hair, then blow drying. Even if I use 1 pump &amp; rub it into my hands first, then over my dry hair, its still too heavy. Sometimes products like that soak in after a while, this did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product would be amazing if it were lighter... somehow thinner.</li>
    <li> I received today and the bottle was already opened.  Did I purchase a used product???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for a few years now and this brand is great. The bottle is dark glass and the pump dispenser gives just the right amount. 4oz lasts a long time as well.</li>
    <li> Very velvetly oil for face and hair. smells good feels great on my face</li>
    <li> love this stuff.... use it on my face, elbows and heels.  After using for over a month, everyday, it hasn&#x27;t clogged pores or caused any breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love the oil. I would make one recommendation. Make the bottle plastic instead of glass. I used it twice and it slipped out of my hands and broke.😢 I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve adding this oil into my soap recipes and I&#x27;m in love! The sad part is that the bars won&#x27;t be cured until 4 more weeks so I can&#x27;t use them until then! I must say that every bar will be well worth its due date! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precious</li>
    <li> My hair is lustrous,shiny and soft-I was amazed. My winter dry skin is no longer the Sahara Desert. I am so happy to have discovered. it.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of this Argan oil. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect at first with my sensitive skin. I started using it on my neck and chest to see what would happen. After a week, and no breakouts, I was brave enough to try my face. I ADORE this product. It has become a staple in my nighttime routine. I was my face in the shower and when I dry off, I put one pump of the oil on my hands and run into my face. I use two pumps for my neck and chest. They I proceed to massage the oil in with the sponge attachment of the facial rotary cleansing brush I have. Not only have I had family members comment on how great my skin looks (I hardly wear makeup), my mom even bought a bottle and just over the weekend we were talking about how much we love it. She uses it mainly on her hands and she has even used it in her hair. I have not tried it in my hair but with hair that isn&#x27;t that thick, I am pretty sure it will weigh it down. So, I keep it all for my skin and I am LOVIN&#x27; it.</li>
    <li> Good for face. Leaves hair a bit too oily looking......</li>
    <li> This is 100% Organ oil and worked well on both my skin, and hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is the only one I will buy for now on. It made my skin and especially my hair extremely soft. The pump-top made it even more better. I&#x27;ve told friends and family to buy this product before they consider any other brand. It actually feels weightless and is will not leave you feeling greasy.... unless of course you use too much, which you won&#x27;t have to do..  One or two pumps goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. It has a mild nutty aroma that dissipates rather quickly. I use this to condition my beard with direct application and cut it with Infusium 23 in a shaken pump spray bottle for my hair. It absorbs quickly without leaving me greasy.</li>
    <li> what a great value! this oil is fantastic for hair, skin, and nails, and the price is excellent for organic argan!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in a big bottle and it works well but it has a strange grainy feel to it. I definitely prefer the Aragon oil I bought in morocco but this will have to do for now.</li>
    <li> Good oil for the price! I used Josie Maran for a while and while I enjoy the smell of her oil more, this one does the job just fine. 4 stars because of the pump, it shoots out a little strongly and I would prefer a dropper instead.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product because of great reviews but was disappointed. the smell was so bad i couldnt use it. after doing research online i learned that argan oil should have a nutty popcorn like smell and if it has a foul odor DO NOT USE. althought the price was ok it wasnt worth the headache of now having to send it back.</li>
    <li> Great oil.  Works wonders on hair and skin.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The oil is good quality. Minus one star for the packaging... some of it leaked into the package.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone else and I am sure they will appreciate the product, and of course the gift.</li>
    <li> Rather light as compared to the Josie Maran I usually purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It does not sit too heavy in your hair and does not dry greasy. I love the pump, which makes it easy to use. I miss a scent but that would not make it organically pure. I did not find have any offensive odor.</li>
    <li> Im 26 and I&#x27;ve recently started seeing signs of aging, fine lines etc. I use this on my face every morning and there has been a significant amount of improvement. My deep lines are even lessened. No breakout issues at all.</li>
