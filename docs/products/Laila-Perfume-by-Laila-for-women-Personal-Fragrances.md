<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My boyfriend took the logic that my favorite perfume was Issey Miyake to Nordstrom.  He learned that it was a white floral essence and was led to several other perfumes with a white floral essence.  He bought several but Laila blew me away.  It is sheer perfection.  To top it off, I  love the fact that it is not a loud or over powering scent.  Something in your soul just says &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;.  If your favorite perfume&#x27;s essence is a white floral, you will give everything else away once you smell this.</li>
    <li> The price was great.  We tried this on vacation in Epcot and thought it was great.  I bought it as a gift, very refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> My better half loves it, was a great purchase.  fair price for a great fragrance, will be back when she runs out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful light floral fragrance. Nice packaging. Hard to find in my locale so happy Amazon carries this delightful fragrance. New to the fragrance but will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> BEST EVER!!! I have had so many people ask me what fragrance I am wearing when I wear this! One of the best I have ever smelled!!! If you are one the edge, BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Love this Parfume.  Light scent,.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume at EPCOT in October of &#x27;08. For a few months had been wanting to buy it but never did because of the pricing. It is worth the money!!! Smell is not too strong and not weak! One spritz can last 2 days at a time so you wont need to waste it. There is still over 3/4 of it left in the bottle and I use it all the time. :)</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful parfum. We first encountered this at the Norway pavillion in Epcot Center at Disney World and fell in love with this most unique scent. My husband absolutely loves this and I do too. This parfum is long lasting and doesn&#x27;t seem to fade throughout the day but also not too overpowering...just right.</li>
    <li> Laila, a perfume from Norway, is my favorite scent. It was developed using the mountain flowers of Norway, and one can easily imagine walking in the mountains on a lovely spring day.</li>
    <li> Bought it on the Disney cruise and couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.  I was so happy to be able to buy it on line !!!  It is really a light smell and I get lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I, too, discovered this perfume @ the Norway section in Epcot... me &amp; my sister loved a lot. So we bought it on the spot for our other sister who had just had a baby girl &amp; named her Layla. A lovely name 4 a lovely scent. i am ordering this for a friend this time, a Laila, i&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s going to love it too. it&#x27;s a very nice perfume 4 any occasion.</li>
    <li> This summer we had the privilege of a week long vacation in Disney World. While visiting Epcot&#x27;s showcase of the World, my wife came across this perfume. The scent was indescribable, but memorable. For some reason, we didn&#x27;t buy it that day. Her birthday rolled around and overheard her talking about it with a friend, so I ordered it through Amazon. It has been by far my favorite perfume that my wife has worn! Glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Discovered\\&quot; Laila in Norway on my recent visit to Epcot. Immediately fell in love with it and bought it on the spot! Even bought a bottle for my granddaughter, who liked it as well. It&#x27;s unique as it&#x27;s suitable for all ages... no \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or \\&quot;overwhelming,cheap perfume\\&quot; smell. Just a subtle, clean fragrance. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume since my children were small.  I wear it daily and it is perfect with jeans and a hoodie yet elegant enough for an evening out.  Over and over people stop me in public and comment on how lovely I smell.  It always catches me off guard until I remember how captivated I was when I walked by the Norweigan shop in EPCOT and the light mountain flower smell wafted out the doors.  The smell just draws you in and you fall in love with it.  Wear it and you will see!</li>
    <li> I, as most of the reviewers, first expierenced Laila in Disney World and fell in LOVE with it!!  It smells so fresh and not overpowering!  It lasts all day!  I was so excited when the package came, i have been dying to buy this since December and finally found it at an unbelievably great price!!</li>
    <li> My wife love it great perfume for the ladies. Guys go for it you will not disappoint your lady.thank you</li>
    <li> A soft perfume. My daughter in law loves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Scandinavian descent and live near Epcot, so every time I go there I head to Norway because it smells so magical, mystical and beautiful there. I have many perfumes by Dior, Chanel, Gucci and Prada, but nothing seemed to compare to it. Yesterday I finally bought the fragrance for myself and now realize that this will be my signature scent forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Laila for almost 10 years now. I wear nothing else...I tried switching to new perfumes, but I always get complaints from others. Over the years, I have gotten so many compliments on this I lost count. Its subtle, not overpowering, and its a clean, feminine scent. Love it!</li>
    <li> I first smelled Laila while I was in Norway at Disney World. I had debated about buying it but last month I went back to Disney and purchased it. I was lucky enough to meet the creator Geir Ness who had been flown in for the day. He signed my bottles and gave me the small bottle that he created especially for the Grammy Awards. This is the only perfume allowed at the Grammy&#x27;s because it does not irritate allergies. So if you have bad allergies and have never been able to wear a perfume. This one could be the best for you! It&#x27;s a wonderful clean smell that I just love! My husband compliments me all the time. He actually wheres Geir (Laila&#x27;s male version).</li>
    <li> This perfume is an absolutely refreshing, delightful scent!  The perfume lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;fade\\&quot; away like some!</li>
    <li> I first smelled this in Epcot.  It is subtle but classy,</li>
    <li> Everything was splendid, my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Like most people, I discovered this scent at Disneyworld in \\&quot;Norway\\&quot;.  I have been using it ever since and have had many compliments on its light, but enticing scent.  Not fruity, or too flowery - just right!</li>
    <li> Bought for wife&#x27;s birthday. Ordered the product 2 weeks in advance, however it still arrived late. When she did get it, 4 days after her birthday, she loved it. Great scent and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> love the lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers - this is just a wonderful fragrance.  It never goes off, smells clean, and really does help lift your spirits.  I discovered it at Disneyworld at our last trip.  My teenage son came out of the Norway souvenir shop saying, &#x27;wow it smells good in there.&#x27;  That&#x27;s high praise for a fragrance.  Been using it ever since - wish there was a bath gel, too.  lovely stuff</li>
    <li> Great fragrance . Bottle was not as shown but I live the &amp;#34;squarer&amp;#34; bottle better.</li>
    <li> Very light and different from what I normally use. I was looking for something with a honeysuckle note.  Will have to give this a chance. This is an update, the fragrance is a little heavier than I normally wear but I do enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This is a very light and pretty scent. Not overpowering at all. I had tried it at Epcot years ago, and it is still one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This perfume is sold at EPCOT in Norway.  You can&#x27;t help but smell it in the gift shop and lingering outside because people have sprayed the tester.  It&#x27;s got a nice clean scent.  It seemed expensive there so I bought it on Amazon instead.</li>
    <li> Very nice frangance. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Delivered promptly. First tried at Epcot . Its super fresh and clean .  I think is appropriate for day a d night time as well.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift because the person said how great it was and it was not available on the local market.  Looked it up on Amazon.  There it was, and at a unbelievable price.  The gift receiver was thrilled.  Are we happy.  You bet.</li>
    <li> When I went to Epcot last year, one of the lingering smells was the perfume at Norway.  I just remembered it the other day and looked to see if Amazon sold the perfume.  Lucky me, they did!  I put it on this morning and it brought back great memories of my trip.  The smell reminds me of linen drying outside in a field of flowers on a beautiful spring day.  You will not be disappointed ordering this perfume.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent.I discovered it at Epcot and could not return there to purchase another bottle. Excellent delivery on my order at a very good price.</li>
    <li> light and the fragrance stays with you! I love how people always complement me when I wear this- I think it is because it has a very definite smell.</li>
    <li> A wonderful light, clean, long lasting scent.  I originally purchased it at Epcot Center in Florida and was so bummed when it ran out.  I had no idea Amazon could sell it.  I receive many compliments when wearing it....great for dinning out because it&#x27;s not too strong or overbearing.</li>
    <li> I bought this online because Nordstrom has discontinued this perfume after I bought it because my other perfume was discontinued. It has a nice fragrance and it is not cloying. I think of Europe when I wear this. I never smelled it on a lot of people. It&#x27;s unique.</li>
    <li> This perfume is so wonderful!  It&#x27;s very light and not too overpowering!  Reminds me of Norway!  Wish I had the lotion too!</li>
    <li> blind purchase, gave it away</li>
    <li> Laila Parfum  Spray--  Thank you so much for your prompt and efficent responce in delivering the order for my favorite parfum spray to us.</li>
    <li> First smelled this at Epcot in Norway. I&#x27;d wished I&#x27;d bought it while there. Was so happy to see it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Great clean soft feminine smell. I get stopped a couple times a week with men and women asking me what I&#x27;m wearing!! I also like Daisy by M Jacobs. They are similar in that they are both light pretty scents</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to review a fragrance, it smells wonderful to me or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. The shipping was on time and the packaging was sturdy. No problems and I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, and like others, I first found out about this at Epcot in Disney World, USA. However, I did not look at the amount (fl oz) the perfume was going to be and when I recieved it I was a bit disappointed. The bottle at Disney was larger, contained more perfume, and was roughly the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I&#x27;ll just buy it at Epcot.</li>
    <li> I found &amp;#34;Laila&amp;#34; in Norway at Epcot and I love it.  It has a light but nice fragrance and is not at all overpowering.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume. I&#x27;ve smelled it the past few times that I&#x27;ve visited Epcot at Disney World and always loved the way it made the Norway Pavilion smell. I finally decided to order online and I have been pleased with my purchase. I find myself passing by my basket full of fragrances and perfumes and just opening this up to experience the scent. Love it!</li>
    <li> I first sampled this perfume while in Norway at Epcot.  All day I kept smelling my arm - saying I&#x27;d go back to get it.  I didn&#x27;t!  I tracked it down when I got home and received at Christmas for a gift.  Love it!  Light and unforgettable.</li>
    <li> I discovered this perfume in the Disney Epcot. The first time I smelt it, I loved it. I bought it then. I still wear it today. It is so clean and bright. This is my favorite scent now.</li>
    <li> The first time I experienced this scent was at Disney&#x27;s Epcot.  I walked into the Norwegian store and the whole place smelled of Laila.  I didn&#x27;t get it at the time but later I purchased this through Amazon.  Next time I would get next day delivery as some of the cologne leaked out but not too much.  This is definitely one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Same stuff as Epcot only cheaper!! My girl loves it and so do I!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, light fragrance! You won&#x27;t need anything else. . . sweet for all occasions.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and great price. I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> All the women like this</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s clean and lasts all day. I do not wear any other scent. I get so many compliments when I wear it. it&#x27;s not overpowering at all and it lasts all day. just perfect for summer</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love!!! I cannot get enough of this wonderful perfume! One smell and I&#x27;m back at Epcot&#x27;s Norway pavilion! I hope they never change the scent as some perfume companies tend to do... I would be soooo disappointed! It is perfect the way it is!</li>
    <li> I love Laila. It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent. It smells clean and wonderful and reminds me of Epcot&#x27;s Norway everytime I wear it,  which is almost everyday. The shipping was fast and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Smelled this at Epcot center in Orlando. Loved it that day but didnt want to spend the money on vacation. My hubby ordered it on amazon for me for xmas later.  I save it for when I want to remember the vacation.  Scent is the #1 sense to evoke a memory...</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume and the bottle was empty when I opened it on Christmas morning. The bottle leaked out all of the perfume!!!!</li>
    <li> Living 15 minutes down the road to EPCOT is like living next to an International Mall.....  My Wife found this perfume and had me take a whiff WOW what an awsome smell and even though she wears almost daily every time I smell it on her it is just like the firt time.  Do yourself a favor  pickup a bottle of this for the that someone special in your life you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I wonder if anyone &#x27;discovered&#x27; this perfume other than at Epcot!?  I remember buying this years ago in Norway, (Epcot&#x27;s).  We were Disney fanatics, usually going to the &#x27;world&#x27; every year and Epcot is my favorite of all the parks.  Now that I&#x27;m older, I don&#x27;t visit the &#x27;World&#x27; as I once did.  Its fantastic that I can purchase my favorite scent of all time, Laila, without leaving my home.  Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Geir Ness, the creator of this fragrance, has an amazing story about his creation -- Laila (Li-la).  Google his name for his history.</li>
    <li> Great scent, and great price!</li>
    <li> Back in 2003 I was visitng Epcot Center in Orlando.  I was walking by the Norway building and their was this lovely scent that just waffed out of that building which arose my curiousity.  Well, needless to say and inquisitive as I am went inside and discovered this wonderful Parfum scent. I knew that I had to take it home with me.  It&#x27;s made of Norwegian wild flowers and it&#x27;s fabulous.  When you have a moment, you should read the history and bio on Geir Ness and how Laila came to be.  I must say I had a hard time locating it when needing to purchase again.  The only place I was able to locate it in the Northeast was through Nordstrom&#x27;s which is bit more expense than through Amazon.  One day when I was browsing the Amazon website I happened to notice that it was available here and a bit less expensive.  Therefore, I now purchase it here.  I think that you will love this.  I&#x27;ve had men ask me about this scent in passing.  Another signature fragrance of mine and and is one of top 2 that I wear most frequently.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter who loves this fragrance!  She will be delighted that I was able to locate it..........not an easy thing to do!</li>
    <li> I smelled this product when I was at Epcot in the Norway center.  I fell in love with it and bought it the next day.  I love the fragrance and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Smells perfect. I wear it whenever I feel homesick for disney.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine at yoga class wears this all the time; it smells fabulous!  You need just a small amount of this perfume to smell heavenly all day!</li>
    <li> this is by far my favorite fragrance!  I bought this on a trip to Epcot over the Summer and used the whole bottle by Fall.  Everyone compliments me when I wear it.  I was happy to see it on Amazon.  I ordered it immediately and the seller had it at my door in 2 days.  great transaction!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this perfume after I visited the Norway exhibit at Epcot.  Wearing the perfume brings back great memories of my trip.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing this fragrance, and I agree, this scent is very clean, feminine and lasting...you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000WZIV72 Laila By Geir Ness For Women Eau De Parfum Spray, 1.7-Ounces]]    My mother, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants, has wanted this perfume for 10 years.  She finally got it for Christmas 2007.  She was thrilled and calls it \\&quot;elegant, fresh, and natural.\\&quot;  She wears it all the time.  Thank you for carrying this product!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume!!  It lasts all day and stays light and fresh, never overpowering.  Great spirit-lifter on a gloomy day.</li>
    <li> Such a good scent but no staying power.  I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent that I absolutely love.  My boyfriend went crazy when he first noticed I was wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Its not fruity and not to flowery either. Its a perfect balance but then we have to remember each persons chemistry is different and so will mix with fragrances differently also. The mens cologne by Geir Ness is awesome too.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume.  She found it at Disney world, but the cost was over $80 in the park.  While thinking of things for her birthday, I remembered the name, [[ASIN:B000VOJOMA Laila By Geir Ness For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle]]searched online and found it at Amazon for half of what we saw it for in the park.  She&#x27;s thrilled and we got to give her something she really wanted.</li>
    <li> ...but far cheaper!  My wife loves it and the scent brings back fond memories of EPCOT.  And yes, it is the same perfume sold at Norway and France!</li>
    <li> its good but not exceptional  .</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this perfume online, my daughter always gets a bottle when we visit Epcot - Disney World in the Norway pavilion.  I must admit it is more fun buying it there, but we didn&#x27;t have a trip planned in the near future so I was very happy to find it available to purchase online.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my GF and she loves it. She first smelled it at the Epcot and said it&#x27;s a great all around Parfum. It isn&#x27;t too strong for the workplace, and can still be worn for a night out. This is identical to what you can get at Epcot and Nordstrom. The other I saw on amazon didn&#x27;t have good reviews. The price was better as well.</li>
    <li> I first tried this scent after visiting EPCOT.  I had been switching between D&amp;G Light Blue and Chanel Chance for a number of years.  I love both of these perfumes when someone else is wearing them, but when I wore them, both scents seemed to sour with my body chemistry.  I tried Laila about 2 years ago and it&#x27;s the perfect scent.  Although I don&#x27;t smell it on myself, even after a full day of work, people will comment about how nice it smells.  I recently tried the deoderant stick and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Light, clean, fresh floral scent. Not over powering or old lady like. 1st tried it while at Disney&#x27;s Epcot park and have wanted it for years, finally got a bottle and no buyers remorse.</li>
    <li> Just the perfect scent for me. Try others, but keep going back to Laila.</li>
    <li> My boss found this at Epcot in Orlando in the Norway section and loved it.  She always talked about how it was her favorite but that she could only find it there at Epcot.  So when I found it here on Amazon, you could imagine the surprise on her face when she received it for a birthday gift without me going to Orlando.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I have ever worn.  It is light and clean smelling.  People ask me what perfume I am wearing.</li>
    <li> The first time we smelled this perfume was at Epcot in Florida.  It was kind of pricey so all we could buy was a smaller bottle at the time.  When I found it on amazon, I was elated!  Have already ordered three bottles!  The price was very reasonable for a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves the smell! The scent is not over powering at all like some other high quality perfumes. This one is definitely a daily wear!</li>
    <li> As with the other reviewers of Laila, I too smelled it at the Norway Pavilion at Epcot, WDW and something about it totally sparked my interest. (And, okay, I didn&#x27;t know they had perfume samples at every single pavilion in the world showcase so I flipped out thinking I&#x27;d hit the girlie jackpot and got a little too happy with the sample bottle.) I actually managed to dump half the bottle on my shirt which caused for a complete change of clothes to avoid giving the entire Epcot park a perfume headache and simultaneously giving myself brain damage. Even without an incident like mine, this perfume is STRONG. STRONG. S-S-STRONG. Are you getting what I&#x27;m throwing at you? STRONG, dude. Spray it into the air then run into the area you sprayed some10 minutes later and you will have just enough on not to gas everyone around you. :)  The smell itself is very flowery and bold, and if you use too much you can go into &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; zone pretty quick, so less is more with this one. I really dig that affect though. It has Viking qualities in that if you use too much, you can hammer induce headaches in an entire village. The bottle should last me a while. And each time I smell it it takes me back to posing with the troll at Norway. O, Valhalla!</li>
    <li> We smelled this perfume, coming out of the boat ride in Norway at Epcot in Disney World. My husband&#x27;s exact quote was, &amp;#34;whatever that smell is, I&#x27;m buying it for you. it&#x27;s amazing!&amp;#34;  We bought it there and I loved it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased it 3x now from this seller. Would definitely recommend. I constantly get complimented on it. It&#x27;s light and not too flowery or strong.  My other fave is Tommy Girl, to help gauge my typical scents preferred. I&#x27;m very particular about my perfumes. I only wear Laila, TG and Versace&#x27;s Bright Crystal!</li>
    <li> I first found this product in Norway.  I give it to my wife and she loves it.  She also gives it to friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume. My boyfriend even picked out a less potent smelling conditioner for my hair so the scent of my perfume wasn&#x27;t over shadowed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of overly-floral scents, but this one is just the right combination of sweet and soft. It reminds me of honeysuckle and sunshine. A little goes a long way and the scent lasts all day. I love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter in-law had been wearing this years ago..and I always loved the fragrance, so I have been ordering Laila ever since.  It is a light beautiful fragrance.. I love, love it!</li>
    <li> I love the scent .  My order arrived on time.  I had read a review that a bottle leaked in shipment, and  mine  too had leaked out a bit.</li>
    <li> Love the soft fragrance of Laila.</li>
    <li> Love the simple, unique sweetness of this fragrance, however, it gets lost and fades WAY too quickly.</li>
    <li> Typically, I don&#x27;t wear anything floral. I am more of a crisp, fresh laundry, clean linen, citrus, spring rain kind of girl.  Basically, I like to smell like dryer sheets!  With that said, I too discovered this perfume while at Epcot in Orlando.  I was given a sample strip and stuck it in my bag and continued throughout my day.  The next morning, when I opened my bag, I still smelled this perfume and it lingered and really started growing on me from like to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is the one who encouraged me to buy this perfume.  He is more of a floral person.  And not only does he like this scent, it is also our daughter&#x27;s name! This scent is a hybrid between both of our likes - it is a soft floral scent, but has that crisp clean undertones so it isn&#x27;t overbearing or too flowery.  It is feminine and light.  It reminds me of a spring meadow with flowers scattered around the grass and just a hint of honeysuckle. &lt;--- gosh that sounds like a silly over-the-top greeting card!  By the way... Nordstrom sells this perfume for $73 a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as if it lingers or not:  A bit of perfume 101 for the readers - perfume&#x27;s life span generally depends on the user&#x27;s own skin as well as the makeup of the perfume. The ones that linger the most are silicon based.  Oil-based perfumes also tend to linger too.  Alcohol-based ones don&#x27;t.  Laila is an oil-based perfume.  For me personally, a lot of scents don&#x27;t linger on my skin unless they are silicon based.  Laila does have a mid-range staying power, but it does linger on my clothing more than my skin.  Also, if I touch up with it about mid-day then it is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a year later and I use this perfume not daily but a few times a week. My bottle is starting to run low. I do believe I will replenish this scent and buy it again.  Point of advise tho:  This bottle does leak around the sprayer seal.  I took it into my car once and most of it leaked out all over my console.  The plus side is after the strength faded my car smells clean, fresh, and a little like flowers~!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you that long.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. Kind of disappointing because of all the reviews I read..</li>
    <li> I had first sampled this scent in Epcot in the Norway pavilion and loved it. I bought 5 of these for presents for older relatives/friends we would be visiting, and they all LOVED it too. Nice, light, and not obnoxious to others nearby as some scents can be LOL.</li>
