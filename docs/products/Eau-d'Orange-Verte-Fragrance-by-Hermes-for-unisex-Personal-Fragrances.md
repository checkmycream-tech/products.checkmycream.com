      <li>I love spraying this on after a shower when I&#x27;m going to be home.  </li>

      <li>If you love orgasms, buy this.</li>
      <li>I have been able to get this affordable by purchasing from Amazon vendors.  </li>
      <li>It has become one of my favorite colognes to wear.</li>
      <li>The smell of orange and spices is one of my favorites and it is my go to cologne for work most days.</li>
      <li>I am able to use it instead of deadorant.</li>
      <li>I love how this scent can be used by either men or women.  </li>
      <li>Scent is the magic.</li>
      <li>Very clean soapy strong orange.</li>
      <li>Whoever put this scent together is an amazing alchemist, since it smells like a mix of neroli, sweet orange, petitgrain and maybe some lemon, but somehow, the fresh citrus top notes manage to hang on for hours.  </li>
      <li>Orgasms are great while they last.      </li>
      <li>, some people may enjoy changes in their colognes.  </li>
      <li>I love citrus scents but find a lot of them are too sweet when made for women and this one hits all the right notes for me.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased the travel size of this cologne to see if I would like it.  </li>
      <li>scent is an earthy citrus, not an overly sweet or cloying scent.  </li>
      <li>I had a Eau d&#x27;orange verte which was excellent and complex.</li>
      <li>if you are expecting a sweet smelling cologne than this one is not for you.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is subtle and one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Would probably buy another as soon as this one has finish.</li>
      <li>Most citrus scents last an hour, at the most.  </li>
      <li>Orange Verte is a fresh, cool scent, not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>They enjoy the migration from top, to middle to bottom note.  </li>
      <li>Amazon wins.</li>
      <li>When I opened THAT bottle, I smelled the old familiar fragrance, fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>so I would try it out at a department store first before buying here.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this at an over priced store.</li>
      <li>i love Hermes colognes because they are distinctively different from all the run of the mill brands.</li>
      <li>Its not heavy, just light and yummy.</li>
      <li>It is light and definitely masculine (if that makes any sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not easy to find this good fragance with that price.</li>
      <li>Ordered as an annual Christmas gift for my son; it arrived very quickly (Prime), in the sturdy Hermes box (perfect for packing in suitcase), and I know I&#x27;ll order it again at least a few times this year.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but it&#x27;s a natural and clean citrus smell</li>
      <li>I really like this cologne as it is very different and refreshing.</li>
      <li>It has a rich and earthy scent that is very distinct which makes it stand out against the sea of other fruity perfumes.  </li>
      <li>A very &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent if that can be used as an adjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this cologne for 20 years, and it&#x27;s becoming harder to find.  </li>
      <li>i would tell anyone interested in buying it for the first time to definitely find a tester before ordering.</li>
      <li>But this Hermes cologne stays fresh and true, and changes very little from the heady scent you experience on the first spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The scent is soft, very feminine, with 2 hour longevity.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money, especially considering the savings.  </li>
      <li>If you like a fresh simple fragrance, this is it!</li>
      <li>I am a true sucker for Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte, and always pick it up first, especially during these summer months, when I want that amazing green, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>They have a new COLOGNE that lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
      <li>styles of today...... yet dynamic enough to fit a man&#x27;s personality.</li>
      <li>or if it was, it was so old it had lost all</li>
      <li>Very competitive and low price.</li>
      <li>It lasts nearly all day on your skin, but for someone to smell it, they have put their nose on your skin.  </li>
      <li>So far, consistant quality.  </li>
      <li>this one in particular is really different.</li>
      <li>I also have a 10 ml little decant for the rare days I want to reapply outside (look for a seller named lynssy123 that sells plastic 10 ml atomizers on ebay).  </li>

<li> Not overpowering, very subtle and fresh!</li>
<li> /&gt;I find it leaves a soft scent without being overly heavy</li>
<li> I like to try new scents and always have 3-4 on hand but for the past 10 years</li>

<li> When I opened this package, it did not smell quite the same as previous bottles.  </li>
<li> This subtle scent deserves its classic standing.</li>
<li> it smells tart and citrusy enough to stand out of the &amp;#34;watermelon, Cinnamon, or dried deodorant&amp;#34;</li>
<li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is actually very complex with notes of citrus; it has a lingering smell that is very masculine, although the fragrance line  is unisex.  </li>
<li> Scent is a very subjective thing and anything Hermes is expensive</li>
<li> You might hear people say it is a harsh, one note</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;off,\\&quot; just weaker and less complex.</li>
<li> Not entirely sure how to describe it, but it smells like a feminine product with an added perfume scent.</li>
<li> Subtle and not overpowering but noticeable up close.</li>
<li> Very disappointing especially since I cannot return it as it&#x27;s a flammable substance.  </li>
<li> expensive</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had a Eau d&#x27;orange verte which was excellent and complex. I ordered this from Amazon as a replacement, but it does not have the same fragrance, dont know if it is watered down or if hermes changed their product but would not recommend. Will try and get it from a department store and confirm.</li>
    <li> This subtle scent deserves its classic standing. The spray allows controlled application. It&#x27;s my regular &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34;; I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Women follow me home when I use this cologne....lol Just kidding.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Men&#x27;s after shave cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I find it leaves a soft scent without being overly heavy and it lasts all day. Makes a great gift as well.</li>
    <li> Orgasms are great while they last.      This cologne doesn&#x27;t project after 30 minutes, but it smells AMAZING.  I love the lime smell followed by a grassy smell.  It lasts nearly all day on your skin, but for someone to smell it, they have put their nose on your skin.  I love spraying this on after a shower when I&#x27;m going to be home.  I also have a 10 ml little decant for the rare days I want to reapply outside (look for a seller named lynssy123 that sells plastic 10 ml atomizers on ebay).  If I&#x27;m going outside after the shower, I would use something that can actually be smelled by others.    If you love orgasms, buy this.</li>
    <li> Very clean soapy strong orange. Need to reapply often as this is a cologne concentration.</li>
    <li> I have been able to get this affordable by purchasing from Amazon vendors.  So far, consistant quality.  I am able to use it instead of deadorant.</li>
    <li> I love how this scent can be used by either men or women.  I like to try new scents and always have 3-4 on hand but for the past 10 years, I have always made sure to have a bottle of d&#x27;Orange Verte by Hermes on hand.  Scent is a very subjective thing and anything Hermes is expensive so I would try it out at a department store first before buying here.  The price listed is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is an earthy citrus, not an overly sweet or cloying scent.  I love citrus scents but find a lot of them are too sweet when made for women and this one hits all the right notes for me.  It has a rich and earthy scent that is very distinct which makes it stand out against the sea of other fruity perfumes.  It makes me think of beaches on the St. Tropez or dining al fresco in the Italian countryside.  I wear it spring through fall but it not in the winter (a green/orange scent and winter don&#x27;t work for me but it&#x27;s a personal taste).</li>
    <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is actually very complex with notes of citrus; it has a lingering smell that is very masculine, although the fragrance line  is unisex.  The scent lasts for hours so you don&#x27;t need to keep on reapplying it.  Definitely worth the money, especially considering the savings.  It has become one of my favorite colognes to wear.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at an over priced store. I loved the scent. It is light and definitely masculine (if that makes any sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on from Amazon was a larger size and was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the travel size of this cologne to see if I would like it.  Which I did, so I bought this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love citrus based scents, this is about as good as it gets.  Whoever put this scent together is an amazing alchemist, since it smells like a mix of neroli, sweet orange, petitgrain and maybe some lemon, but somehow, the fresh citrus top notes manage to hang on for hours.  How is this possible?  Most citrus scents last an hour, at the most.  But this Hermes cologne stays fresh and true, and changes very little from the heady scent you experience on the first spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, some people may enjoy changes in their colognes.  They enjoy the migration from top, to middle to bottom note.  And some may not like what could be perceived as a harshness in the citrus mixture of this cologne.  You might hear people say it is a harsh, one note cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do not listen to these (imaginary) critics!  I am a true sucker for Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte, and always pick it up first, especially during these summer months, when I want that amazing green, fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Bought the cologne assuming it would smell the same as the Eau d&#x27;Orange bar soap... it does not. Maybe I received an expired, or skunked, bottle but, it does not smell anything like the bar soap. Not entirely sure how to describe it, but it smells like a feminine product with an added perfume scent.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and my husband loves it too!  Not overpowering, very subtle and fresh! If you like a fresh simple fragrance, this is it!</li>
    <li> i love Hermes colognes because they are distinctively different from all the run of the mill brands. this one in particular is really different. if you are expecting a sweet smelling cologne than this one is not for you. i would tell anyone interested in buying it for the first time to definitely find a tester before ordering.</li>
    <li> Very competitive and low price. It is not easy to find this good fragance with that price. I like it..</li>
    <li> Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte by Hermes for Men is one of my all time favorite colognes. The smell of orange and spices is one of my favorites and it is my go to cologne for work most days. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> or if it was, it was so old it had lost all it&#x27;s fragrance. I bought this as a replacement for a bottle I had just finished up that was a gift from a Hemese store. Very disappointing especially since I cannot return it as it&#x27;s a flammable substance.  I&#x27;ll be sticking to brick and mortar stores for my cologne.</li>
    <li> He loves this and only wears this. it had an orange woodsy smell that does not bother my Asthma, I would recommend to any man who wants to smell great but not smell perfumed.</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing smell. I really like this cologne as it is very different and refreshing. Smells like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Subtle and not overpowering but noticeable up close. A very &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent if that can be used as an adjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its core it is a citrus based scent reminiscent of oranges, hence the name.</li>
    <li> great scent for all seasons</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but it&#x27;s a natural and clean citrus smell that&#x27;s pleasant to most people I&#x27;ve met.</li>
    <li> Item came in as promised and was as described</li>
    <li> Hermes sells this for BOTH men and women.... for me. it smells tart and citrusy enough to stand out of the &amp;#34;watermelon, Cinnamon, or dried deodorant&amp;#34; styles of today...... yet dynamic enough to fit a man&#x27;s personality. It is in the same scent family as  Eau Sauvage By Christian Dior For Men.......  Buy the biggest bottle you can afford!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and well received by recipient.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this for years, it&#x27;s the only cologne he uses. He is 25, my husband also uses it and on occasion, so do I!  Orange Verte is a fresh, cool scent, not overpowering at all. It is not inexpensive, but it IS Hermes. Amazon has excellent prices on it and you can be sure it&#x27;s not a knock off.  I recommend this as a great hot weather cologne. Very light and citrusy. Try it at a good department store and compare the price to Amazon&#x27;s. Amazon wins. Ordered as an annual Christmas gift for my son; it arrived very quickly (Prime), in the sturdy Hermes box (perfect for packing in suitcase), and I know I&#x27;ll order it again at least a few times this year.</li>
    <li> I had a tester of this fragrance and the product that was shipped to me smells nothing like it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you like colognes with 2 hour longevity, this cologne is for you! I don&#x27;t think this is a knock-off of Amazon. The longevity of this cologne is it&#x27;s nature. The scent is soft, very feminine, with 2 hour longevity.</li>
    <li> Great COLOGNE. Scent is the magic. Doesn&#x27;t last long enough. They have a new COLOGNE that lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive but I still like and use it,.. since 2001.  Bring back shampoo, talc and toilets..</li>
    <li> The fragrance is subtle and one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Would probably buy another as soon as this one has finish.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for 20 years, and it&#x27;s becoming harder to find.  When I opened this package, it did not smell quite the same as previous bottles.  It wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;off,\\&quot; just weaker and less complex. A few weeks later, I had to travel overseas for a few days for business, and found Hermes&#x27; Orange Verte in duty free.  When I opened THAT bottle, I smelled the old familiar fragrance, fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and I do to. Its not heavy, just light and yummy. It came as described and I would use this company again</li>
