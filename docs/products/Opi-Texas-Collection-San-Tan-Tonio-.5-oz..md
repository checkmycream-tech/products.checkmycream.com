      <li>I was thrilled to find the colors at Amazon.</li>
      <li>A really nice, neutral color.  </li>
      <li>You know it is NICE if you get compliments from them!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a nice color for anyone of any age.</li>
      <li>Please make sure the product is in better condition!</li>
      <li>LOVE this color.</li>
      <li>but that is their favorite thing.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it.</li>
      <li>I also like the top coat they offer.</li>
      <li>Much more convenient to buy online than searching the mall.</li>
      <li>I love this color, is my all time favorite polish.</li>
      <li>LOVE this color &amp;</li>
      <li>I love OPI most of the time, but this one&#x27;s going in my \\&quot;never again\\&quot; box.</li>
      <li>This is one of my top three favorite shades because it is SO elegant and versatile that it will go with almost anything you wear.</li>
      <li>I did get many compliments.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it has worked for others.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shade.</li>
      <li>Maybe a better color for the Fall and Winter.</li>
      <li>I experimented with some Sally Hansen Nail Prisms on top of this OPI color and it made great new duochrome colors!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great pedicure color to compliment your favorite pale nude mani, or beautiful as a mani also.  </li>
      <li>: you only need one coat, long-lasting, very elegant, discreet, versatile, good on any skin tone, enhances your hands and makes your jewelry stand out rather than the nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>OPI is the best nail color and stays on longer than any other nail polish I have ever used.</li>
      <li>husband immediately noticed when I first tried it and my mother-in-law liked it too.</li>
      <li>However, this color is such a great neutral, I have been persuaded.</li>
      <li>Great lasting polish too.</li>
      <li>San Tan Tonio is a nice neutral tan that really complements my caramel skin.  </li>
      <li>This color matches my skin tone very well and goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a great nude color that&#x27;s a little more colorful.  </li>
      <li>It is best bought with a thinner as it gets too thick when you get just below halfway.</li>
      <li>Fast Top Coat .5 fl oz (15 ml)</li>
      <li>It has the classiness of a French manicure and looks great with my complexion, which is a medium tan (think caramel) but looks great on my mother-in-law who is a pinkish pale blond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did not go on as smoothly as OPI polishes normally do, and the color on my nails was a light brown with a greenish tint.  </li>
      <li>And, since it&#x27;s OPI I already knew the quality would be excellent and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Not too dark and not too light and will look good no matter your skin tone.</li>
      <li>Love this color, very natural looking.</li>
      <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s disturbingly similar to the color of baby poo.  </li>
      <li>They are very opinionated on colors and they just went on and on about how much they enjoy it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Suggest you wear a quick dry top coat so it does not get smudged.</li>
      <li>the color is not as consistent, but once well-shaken, it is just as pictured &#x3D;</li>
      <li>I did the first two coats using this color then went over it with OPI Peach-A-Boo and it made for a bronze outcome.  </li>
      <li>The first day I wore this color, I received dozens of complements.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all there is to say.</li>
      <li>It is very neutral with my skin tone, yet gives my nails a very polished look!</li>
      <li>/&gt;CONS: you need to shake it very well otherwise</li>
      <li>Light enough for the summer but deep enough for a nice fall shade too.</li>
      <li>This will get much use in my rotation.</li>
      <li>but no one wants it,</li>
      <li>It looks good on yellow and pink undertones.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice, neutral color for the winter since I have worn pink and white for years.</li>
      <li>so at first i had written a positive review for this color, but then i went back to use it</li>
      <li>I know they may seem old for stockings</li>
      <li>I was surprised at this polish.  </li>
      <li>I am a dark skin black american and the nail polish looks good on my skin.</li>
      <li>It dried pretty fast.  </li>
      <li>Love this cor but the Polish was sooooooo thin, had it been diluted or thinned out.</li>

<li> I didn&#x27;t see any green tint that other reviewers have complained about.</li>
<li> and i saw this nasty green undertone.</li>

This one is THE best one I own: Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat .5 fl oz (15 ml) Apply it about a minute after application while your nails are stick tacky so you can start using your hands five minutes later. It is best bought with a thinner as it gets too thick when you get just below halfway. Seche Restore Restoration Thinner .5 fl oz (14 ml) This thinner can also be used to thin out your favorite nail polish colors that have gotten too thick.</li>
    <li> I love this color! A nice neutral that looks great with any color of cloths that you wear. OPI is the best nail color and stays on longer than any other nail polish I have ever used. I also like the top coat they offer.</li>
    <li> I love the Texas collection from Opi,finally something for us cowgirls! This shade is one of my favorites! Great lasting polish too.</li>
    <li> Packaged well and arrived timely.  The local Ulta stores ran out of the Texas line.  I was thrilled to find the colors at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a nude color that matches my skin tone. This color matches my skin tone very well and goes on very smooth. If you are looking for a polish that goes with everything this is the perfect polish for you. I will definitely be purchasing this polish once I run out!!!</li>
    <li> Excelent product. The color is as it appears in the photo and it has a great durability in the nails.</li>
    <li> perfect color for all of those neutral tones</li>
    <li> I actually puchased this shade by mistake (I was looking for Samoan Sand). I absolutely love this shade. I dont even want to purchase Samoan Sand anymore! Its a very nice, neutral shade. Light enough for the summer but deep enough for a nice fall shade too. This will get much use in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Out of all the colors I chose in the selection of colors, this one is not worn as much and hardly ever chosen to wear as it is a little dark. Maybe a better color for the Fall and Winter.</li>
    <li> I love this color, is my all time favorite polish. I go to the salon with it when I get my nails done and I have the nail tech paint my nails with it</li>
    <li> I love this color!  It is very neutral with my skin tone, yet gives my nails a very polished look!</li>
    <li> This is a great nude color that&#x27;s a little more colorful.  It&#x27;s a great pedicure color to compliment your favorite pale nude mani, or beautiful as a mani also.  I think it&#x27;s discontinued now, so buy up!</li>
    <li> Love this cor but the Polish was sooooooo thin, had it been diluted or thinned out. Please make sure the product is in better condition!</li>
    <li> I had a pedicure with this polish.  I did the first two coats using this color then went over it with OPI Peach-A-Boo and it made for a bronze outcome.  It was just beautiful.  I did get many compliments.</li>
    <li> A good color if you don&#x27;t have the best nails or the prettiest hands.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s pretty much all there is to say. LOVE this color &amp; if you have medium to tan skintone and are looking for a perfect, Olivia Pope-inspired color for a neutral mani, this is your color ;)</li>
    <li> so at first i had written a positive review for this color, but then i went back to use it and i saw this nasty green undertone. it looked like my nails were caked it mud, or as another person said \\&quot;baby poop\\&quot;. i keep trying to get rid of it but no one wants it,</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girls ( 27 and 24 ) for their Christmas stocking and they loved it!  They are very opinionated on colors and they just went on and on about how much they enjoy it! I know they may seem old for stockings but that is their favorite thing.  One is an educator and now stay at home mom and they other is in law school.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice, neutral color for the winter since I have worn pink and white for years. The first day I wore this color, I received dozens of complements. It blends in so well with everything. It is a nice color for anyone of any age.</li>
    <li> I am a dark skin black american and the nail polish looks good on my skin. It matches well with my skin tone very pleased with this product. OPI has great quality nail polish.</li>
    <li> I took a chance ordering this color I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it. What a surprise! It is just what I was hoping it would be. Not too dark and not too light and will look good no matter your skin tone. As for the brand, OPI is one of the best on the market. Minimal shrinkage and chipping and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect nail color for the winter season. I plan to order it again.  This OPI product is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> love the color, difficult to get even color</li>
    <li> Love this color, very natural looking. And, since it&#x27;s OPI I already knew the quality would be excellent and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I selected this item after reading reviews, but after applying it to my nails, it simply was not for me.  I&#x27;m glad it has worked for others.</li>
    <li> San Tan Tonio is a nice neutral tan that really complements my caramel skin.  I didn&#x27;t see any green tint that other reviewers have complained about. I applied a thin first coat which came out a little streaky.  However, the second coat made the color opaque. It dried pretty fast.  There was no visible nail line, if that concerns some. I experimented with some Sally Hansen Nail Prisms on top of this OPI color and it made great new duochrome colors! I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing this now in the winter and in the coming warmer months as well.</li>
