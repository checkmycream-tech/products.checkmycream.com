      <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>and they were creamy and complimented the liners wonderfully.</li>
      <li>arrived in great packaging too.</li>
      <li>and I will be happy to change my review.</li>
      <li>The price is great as well.</li>
      <li>so im happy...</li>
      <li>great colors, creamy application and good quality.</li>
      <li>This product is great if you&#x27;re looking to extend your eye/lip liner collection, I love it!</li>
      <li>but its all good.</li>
      <li>couple colors aren&#x27;t good at all.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>The colours are great, and they glade on very smoothly.   </li>
      <li>you could have just added more colors, lol.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these because I liked the colors</li>
      <li>One color that would have been nice to have among the choices was white.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These pencils are nice</li>
      <li>The liners are exceptional for the price, however, I would like them more if they had the colors written on them</li>
      <li>This item came very quickly, and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>they came in a clear box saying perfect liner pen,however the sticker on them say shany, which they are not.</li>
      <li>The pencils are creamy and apply very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Also, many of the colors are suited for lip pencils not eye pencils.</li>
      <li>This was a spur of the moment purchase, however I am pleased that I decided to go with it.  </li>
      <li>they are better for lips than eyes</li>
      <li>The plus with these pencils is for the price the quality is better than anything that you would find at Claire&#x27;s or Icing; also the colors don&#x27;t rub off immediately.</li>
      <li>It was an okay product....</li>
      <li>one.they are not shany products too,on pencils its written..\\&quot;Diris\\&quot;.kids can colour with this pencils though.atleast of some use... :)</li>
      <li>so I do not plan to use them for travel mostly just for use when I am home.  </li>
      <li>The quallity and color will be better.</li>
      <li>Light them with a lighter and they work better.</li>
      <li>The application is smooth but the color isn&#x27;t very rich.</li>
      <li>but you can easily look at the bottom for the color swatch.</li>
      <li>If could just star on the low cost, quick, and damage free part of this Item, I would have give five, lol.  &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Some colors are just too light</li>
      <li>Feel free to send me the correct item</li>
      <li>They really need to change that and for $10 you&#x27;d expect better looking merchandise...</li>
      <li>I really liked how smooth the pencil glides on the eyelid and the multiple colors.</li>
      <li>shany might have eyeliners infused with aloe vera but this brand wants to make their cheap product sound like the shany brand just so you can buy them -____-</li>
      <li>One color that would have been a nice addition would have been white.  </li>
      <li>i got safe colors as well as some playful loud colors.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a little more pigment ...a little more \\&quot;easy glide\\&quot;, but for the variety of colors &amp; the price, I suppose its okay.  </li>
      <li>There are a LOT of browns which will make great brow pencils and the silvers, reds, raspberry, light blue, silver, gold, and pink have decent intensity.</li>
      <li>,delivery was ok.quality: very very poor.they are not well pigmented,i scratched back and forth so many times</li>
      <li>So I bought this product to try out some more Shany products, however, once received, these are a completely different brand.</li>
      <li>So just be aware that it&#x27;s not a shany product.</li>
      <li>Also all the colors did not work for me but enough did that made the purchase worthwhile.</li>
      <li>I bought them as a Christmas present but tried them out just to make sure they were ok since i&#x27;m not familiar with this brand.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still very opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazon use to be so great on the products I never had any problems unfortunately here</li>
      <li>These pencils are fine and have colors that work with dark skin.</li>
      <li>The black is mediocre at best.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a little hard to get started depositing color, but once they&#x27;re going they are great.</li>
      <li>you have to push so hard and go over many times to show color.</li>
      <li>I thought they would be soft.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had them on the back of my hand for an hour or so now and the only one with any fade is the light metallic blue</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really talk about the lasting time of the colors</li>
      <li>If they were soft, I would&#x27;ve give five stars.  </li>
      <li>The pencils aren&#x27;t marked with the color name</li>
      <li>I do recommend this for budget conscious individuals looking for quality.</li>
      <li>The white pencils displayed are nothing like what you actually receive it more like the one the other person posted up!</li>
      <li>You really have to use the old lighter trick though, if not you will pull half your eyelid off</li>
      <li>i researched so much before buying it.i always used black liquid liner,so i thought to buy something which wil give me options to match my dresses.and</li>
      <li>The dark blue, however, is my least favorite.</li>

<li> but i cudnt see any colour on my eyelids..literally after scartching  for 15 mins i was able to see some dull colour.iam very unhappy with this product,shouldnt have gone for this cheap</li>
<li> real problem is that they are soooo hard.  </li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t really long, but for the price they serve their purpose.</li>
<li> The worse it&#x27;s so hard and does not glide smoothly and you have to repeatedly draw in the same spot to get the color to show.</li>
<li> but I got 2 dark blue ones and not a silver.</li>
<li> They were all dried out, hard it was really a waiste of money.</li>
<li> cause they are a total waste of money!</li>
<li> i got brown,black,red,pink,blue,purple,sliver,gold,brass,and 3 other reddish brownis colors.</li>
<li> Not very pigmented, doesn&#x27;t go on easily, hard to sharpen, low quality, and is not even shany brand.</li>
<li> They dull after a short time...</li>
<li> was not happy, at least she didn&#x27;t know, but it very upsetting to have ordered something that isn&#x27;t what you ordered.&lt;br /&gt;shannaginns</li>
<li> Not the blackest black, but it will work.</li>
<li> i wish i got green.</li>
<li> They are a waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on</li>
<li> It was very stiff and the color looks patchy.</li>
<li> I guess they are alright for what they are, but a bit hard for my tastes.</li>
<li> They are hard and won&#x27;t mark on my skin.</li>
<li> I was a little confused but then thought about how cosmetic companies do that all of the time - buy a bunch of products from another company and sell them.</li>
<li> My package looks nothing like anyone else&#x27;s that has been shown in the customer images, but on the plus side, my pencils are at least numbered so I can memorize them unlike those who complained of lack of names.</li>
<li> lately it has been a nightmare.</li>
<li> They could be worse.</li>
<li> The product received isn&#x27;t poor quality</li>
<li> Nowhere on these pencils are Shany, I feel like it was false advertising.</li>
<li> Can you say \\&quot;False Advertising\\&quot;?  </li>
<li> These pencils are very difficult to smear on the eye.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was a spur of the moment purchase, however I am pleased that I decided to go with it.  The pencils are creamy and apply very smoothly.  I have a deep complexion and not all of the pencil colors will compiment my skin tone, but still the ones that I can use are sufficent, who knows later on I may find use for the ones I thought I could not.  The caps do not stay on well so I do not plan to use them for travel mostly just for use when I am home.  I do recommend this for budget conscious individuals looking for quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I liked the colors and they were inexpensive. You really have to use the old lighter trick though, if not you will pull half your eyelid off</li>
    <li> These pencils do not work. They are hard and won&#x27;t mark on my skin. Every time I look at them I get upset cause they are a total waste of money!</li>
    <li> My problem with these pencils is that they are a totally different brand than they are listed to be. I was a little confused but then thought about how cosmetic companies do that all of the time - buy a bunch of products from another company and sell them. But this was a littleee different than that. The box said an entirely different brand name than they are listed as(Shany), which was Diris. All they did was slap a sticker with a bar code on the box that said \\&quot;Shany pencils\\&quot;t. My package looks nothing like anyone else&#x27;s that has been shown in the customer images, but on the plus side, my pencils are at least numbered so I can memorize them unlike those who complained of lack of names. Brand names aside, I swatched them all and they&#x27;re so-so. They could be worse. There are a LOT of browns which will make great brow pencils and the silvers, reds, raspberry, light blue, silver, gold, and pink have decent intensity. The black is mediocre at best. Not the blackest black, but it will work. The dark blue, however, is my least favorite. It took several runs back and forth on my hand to get it to show up. It was very stiff and the color looks patchy. I do like the metallics though.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really talk about the lasting time of the colors but I&#x27;ve had them on the back of my hand for an hour or so now and the only one with any fade is the light metallic blue and it&#x27;s still very opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Okay for the price&lt;br /&gt;Many colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A couple colors aren&#x27;t good at all.&lt;br /&gt;And the BIGGEST ONE...&lt;br /&gt;the ingredient list does not include Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all else, I had to rate the product low for inaccurate advertising.</li>
    <li> The liners are exceptional for the price, however, I would like them more if they had the colors written on them so I can distinguish between the darker colors.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. The colours are great, and they glade on very smoothly.   As a lover of any type or brand of make-up I do recommend this to anyone   The price is great as well.</li>
    <li> i researched so much before buying it.i always used black liquid liner,so i thought to buy something which wil give me options to match my dresses.and i ordered this,first they shipped it after 1 week,delivery was ok.quality: very very poor.they are not well pigmented,i scratched back and forth so many times but i cudnt see any colour on my eyelids..literally after scartching  for 15 mins i was able to see some dull colour.iam very unhappy with this product,shouldnt have gone for this cheap one.they are not shany products too,on pencils its written..\\&quot;Diris\\&quot;.kids can colour with this pencils though.atleast of some use... :)</li>
    <li> These pencils are nice but I got 2 dark blue ones and not a silver. They also say d&#x27;iris instead of Shany</li>
    <li> This product is great if you&#x27;re looking to extend your eye/lip liner collection, I love it! They&#x27;re a little hard to get started depositing color, but once they&#x27;re going they are great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking I was going to receive Shany liner pencils.  When I received my product, it said nothing about Shany, except on the box.  They printed out a label that said Shany but on the pencils, it says d&#x27;iris.  Can you say \\&quot;False Advertising\\&quot;?  The product received isn&#x27;t poor quality but you definitely get what you pay for.  The application is smooth but the color isn&#x27;t very rich.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again they are better for lips than eyes you have to push so hard and go over many times to show color. Light them with a lighter and they work better.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product to try out some more Shany products, however, once received, these are a completely different brand. I guess I could be mistaken, however it doesn&#x27;t say SHANY anywhere on the box or the pencils. Also they are nothing like the ones pictured. I guess they are alright for what they are, but a bit hard for my tastes. I wanted them especially because the description claims to contain aloe vera, but I cannot find any proof of that either.     Feel free to send me the correct item and I will be happy to change my review.</li>
    <li> obviously this isnt shany because it says sold by makeup and gift shop. the name of the product might say shany but it isnt shany. shany might have eyeliners infused with aloe vera but this brand wants to make their cheap product sound like the shany brand just so you can buy them -____-</li>
    <li> This item came very quickly, and in good condition.  Yay!!!  One color that would have been a nice addition would have been white.  Some of the colors were doubled, and I&#x27;m thinking...you could have just added more colors, lol.  One color that would have been nice to have among the choices was white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem is that they are soooo hard.  I thought they would be soft.  I don&#x27;t know why I thought that. If there was a white in there, I would&#x27;ve given four stars.  If they were soft, I would&#x27;ve give five stars.  If could just star on the low cost, quick, and damage free part of this Item, I would have give five, lol.  &#x3D;)[[ASIN:B0032P3FRA Shany Cosmetics Perfect Liner Makeup Pencils with Aloevera and Vitamin E,6 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I like my liners. they came in a clear box saying perfect liner pen,however the sticker on them say shany, which they are not. but i didnt care. I got 12 pencils. they work well. i got brown,black,red,pink,blue,purple,sliver,gold,brass,and 3 other reddish brownis colors. i wish i got green. but its all good. i got safe colors as well as some playful loud colors. so im happy...</li>
    <li> These pencils are very difficult to smear on the eye. They are obviously extremely low quality. Also, many of the colors are suited for lip pencils not eye pencils. I only found 2 out of the entire package that I could use for eye pencils. Now I worry that I&#x27;m stretching my eye tissue because of the pressure I need to apply to get the color to come off the pencil. Don&#x27;t buy these. They are a waste of money. Go to Wal Mart. The quallity and color will be better.</li>
    <li> It was an okay product.... They dull after a short time... They seem to blend with the skin color... Not enough color pigment in the pencils</li>
    <li> These pencils are \\&quot;okay\\&quot; ...I was hoping for a little more pigment ...a little more \\&quot;easy glide\\&quot;, but for the variety of colors &amp; the price, I suppose its okay.  I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing them again.  But that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> These pencils are fine and have colors that work with dark skin. The pencils were advertised as SHANY brand and having aloe as an ingriedient; not only do these not appear to be Shany brand they also seemed not to have Aloe added. On the outside of the plastic container someone did slap a Shany sticker on there but if I slap a BMW sticker on a shopping cart does that make it a BMW?    The plus with these pencils is for the price the quality is better than anything that you would find at Claire&#x27;s or Icing; also the colors don&#x27;t rub off immediately. Also all the colors did not work for me but enough did that made the purchase worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on but these pencils are definitely not Shany brand products. The pencils say D&#x27;Iris and they&#x27;re alright for the price i guess. Does not have anything to do with aloe Vera. I bought them as a Christmas present but tried them out just to make sure they were ok since i&#x27;m not familiar with this brand. So just be aware that it&#x27;s not a shany product.</li>
    <li> I really liked how smooth the pencil glides on the eyelid and the multiple colors. The pencils aren&#x27;t marked with the color name but you can easily look at the bottom for the color swatch. They aren&#x27;t really long, but for the price they serve their purpose. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Some colors are just too light</li>
    <li> The worse it&#x27;s so hard and does not glide smoothly and you have to repeatedly draw in the same spot to get the color to show.</li>
    <li> Nowhere on these pencils are Shany, I feel like it was false advertising. There not even the same length or color as the picture shown. They were all dried out, hard it was really a waiste of money. Amazon use to be so great on the products I never had any problems unfortunately here lately it has been a nightmare. I hope you guys get back to quality..</li>
    <li> I got these as an add on gift for my bf&#x27;s sis but know I don&#x27;t know whether or not to give them to her anymore. The white pencils displayed are nothing like what you actually receive it more like the one the other person posted up! They really need to change that and for $10 you&#x27;d expect better looking merchandise...</li>
    <li> great colors, creamy application and good quality. arrived in great packaging too. I also purchased the lipsticks with this and they were creamy and complimented the liners wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Not very pigmented, doesn&#x27;t go on easily, hard to sharpen, low quality, and is not even shany brand. Just don&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
    <li> This was a gift so I still gift it to my friend cause i had no, after ordering this and all.&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy, at least she didn&#x27;t know, but it very upsetting to have ordered something that isn&#x27;t what you ordered.&lt;br /&gt;shannaginns</li>
