      <li>Despite the two drawbacks I mentioned I feel like this is an excellent product!</li>

      <li>It keeps the skin from getting too oily during the day, and the added SPF is a nice bonus.</li>

      <li>but i have very very light skin.</li>
      <li>It is very light and it does not sting the skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Color aside, the product is easy to apply evenly and leaves your skin with a nice, matte finish.</li>
      <li>This product has a nice feel and it is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>much lighter coverage than meisha perfect cover and for my skin tone ( very fair with pink undertones)</li>
      <li>Makes skin more oily...</li>
      <li>Love this BB cream.</li>
      <li>In couple hours I already need to apply more concealer and powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my skin looks healthy..</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
      <li>The color is somewhat light even on my fair skin, but it gives a make-up free look.</li>
      <li>I absolutely positively LOVE Missha Matte Vita BB Cream.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this BB cream.</li>
      <li>Love this product-will order again.</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin has gotten MUCH better</li>
      <li>But it works okay.</li>
      <li>if anything the consistency is more of a tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My sister thinks it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>but i love it.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would work better on someone else.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s almost a bit dewy glow that looks very pretty when you wear this BB cream on its own.</li>
      <li>but thats fine</li>
      <li>but I found it a bit too light for me.</li>
      <li>Timely shipping, and I am happy with the entire process of ordering.</li>
      <li>This cream matches my tone, makes my face look smooth, and covers redness.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and it gives my skin a refreshed look.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to those who plan to use it to cover acne scars and marks because this item is too light to do that.</li>
      <li>People shouldn&#x27;t be cheap with their money for beauty products anyways, so this is just screaming at you to buy it.</li>
      <li>This bb cream make my face so smooth.</li>
      <li>Missha Matte Vita BB Cream gives me great coverage all day long without looking or feeling like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  </li>
      <li>I will state first that the image here is a bit deceiving: the BB cream shown here is not that light in color!</li>
      <li>so i use blotched paper to clean it up.</li>
      <li>Benefit&#x27;s Dr. Feelgood works much better for mattifying and covering up large pores, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a more than fully grown woman with very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>all you need is one pump, u really dont need more than that.</li>
      <li>This bb cream is not bad</li>
      <li>I believe the product aims for combination/oily skin, so if your skin is kind of dry, make sure you use moisturizing lotion before it.</li>
      <li>but when u first apply it is easily blendable and you can build it which i do for my under eyes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent, I am just not in love with it.</li>
      <li>More important, the color is natural.</li>
      <li>I have a very fair skin tone, so many foundation/conceal could make my face looks like a fake one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money because it lasts quite some time.</li>
      <li>This one gives more dewy glow and it lets your skin shown as opposed to the complete coverage look.</li>
      <li>Powder foundations get absorbed within a couple hours.  </li>
      <li>i love this because i am young</li>
      <li>This is ok, but I have combination skin and it has mineral oil as one of it&#x27;s ingredients, with the result being a super greasy face by mid day.</li>
      <li>it really does not match my skin tone but with a little setting powder works great</li>
      <li>My mother tried it as well (she is french and irish) and it made her skin look great as well.</li>
      <li>I love how its very personal instead of business like.  </li>
      <li>Besides my own imperfections on my face, my skin usually feels pretty smooth after showering (which it didn&#x27;t 2 months ago)</li>
      <li>at first it doesnt look like it covers up blemishes</li>
      <li>it was the first one i bought.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well: covers blemishes (but you should also use a blemish stick), smooths out the skin, minimizes pores.</li>
      <li>This is my first BB cream, I was drawn to the BB creams because of my acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>also i do have some acne scars which gets mostly covered but you might need concealer for really red ones or build up the product.</li>
      <li>i have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily stop that i still have to blot even with power on top.</li>
      <li>, i get really interested in it.</li>
      <li>it also stays on pretty well through the day.</li>
      <li>Thanks Seoul Glamour!  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t expect this to be a big problem for most customers since people who take lots of care of their skin</li>
      <li>sure about the texture of the product, and definitely need a bit something under it before putting it on.</li>
      <li>packaging is very nice, looks expensive, and the pump/tube combination makes it easy and hygienic to</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is by far the best bb cream that you can buy! It covers perfectly, is a perfect match for my skin tone, just perfect, perfect, perfect!!!! I&#x27;ve never been complimented as much on my skin before as I have now that I&#x27;ve been using this product. I&#x27;m totally satisfied and would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> While the color of this product blended really well my my skin (pale with yellow undertones) and I have never found a product before this that matched my skin well, it made my skin look oily and shiny, and I had to cover it up with powder to get a matte look. It didn&#x27;t cover my blemishes either, and was sticky and waxy and hard to apply. It also did not benefit my skin, but rather made me break out. Benefit&#x27;s Dr. Feelgood works much better for mattifying and covering up large pores, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Even though it&#x27;s clear, it covers up blemishes well and doesn&#x27;t give the fake, caked-on look that this product gave me. I guess I&#x27;m sticking with that from now on.  [[ASIN:B000FBLTIQ Benefit Cosmetics Dr. Feelgood]]</li>
    <li> I actually just received it in the mail. The shipping time say approximately a month, but it came within 2 weeks, love the quickness of the shipping! It came in a pink paper bag taped up securely and the product inside was also thoroughly wrapped in bubble-wrap, also giving me a little packet of another BB Cream sample. I&#x27;m mainly reviewing the shipping but the BB Cream itself blended with my skin pretty well, a little lighter but I&#x27;m okay with that. We&#x27;ll see how it develops to my skin over the next couple weeks. Thanks Seoul Glamour!  UPDATE: It&#x27;s been over 2 months since I&#x27;ve used this product and it is almost gone! Maybe 20-30% left inside, maybe less. As I said before, the BB Cream blends to the skin well IF it&#x27;s on a small area. I apply it to my entire face every morning after I shower and some people think I got extremely pale... this is probably because I go to class less than 10 minutes after I apply the BB Cream so it didn&#x27;t have enough time to blend with my natural skin color. I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned Asian male so I don&#x27;t expect this to be a big problem for most customers since people who take lots of care of their skin are light-skinned Girls (just from my vague experience). So this product is a Matte cream so it makes your skin look like... maybe it&#x27;s been powdered so oil doesn&#x27;t show? (Sorry I don&#x27;t use makeup or anything, just recently started getting interested in skin care so I&#x27;m new to this :D) Not sure if this is what people are looking for, but it is what it is. So for 2 months I&#x27;ve been applying it daily and I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin has gotten MUCH better but maybe a little better. Besides my own imperfections on my face, my skin usually feels pretty smooth after showering (which it didn&#x27;t 2 months ago) so I guess it has worked. I&#x27;m sure most people are pretty impatient since everything in the world is instant now, but using the cream faithfully until it runs out will show improvement even if it&#x27;s small improvement, it&#x27;ll be an improvement nonetheless. I just purchased the MISSHA Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ No. 23 which came in the mail last week.  Pros: Blends well to skin after applying it (AND letting it blend with your natural skin color). No icky feeling on your skin after you put it on.  Cons: Takes a while to blend with natural skin color (I have very limited time in college). Not much else!  All in all, great product to buy if you&#x27;re trying out BB Creams of all types. Come on, it&#x27;s retail for $50 but sold from SeoulGlamour for $8! People shouldn&#x27;t be cheap with their money for beauty products anyways, so this is just screaming at you to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is the only one BB Cream I feel so regret to purchase! It&#x27;s too dry for me even I am oily and combination skin type.  After applying, my skin is not smooth at all and skin tone becomes so unnatural.  I am so disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark spots due to the sun damage and also some acne blemish. After moisture and sunscreen, I use sponge to apply this and it works well to cover up all the flaws. More important, the color is natural. I have a very fair skin tone, so many foundation/conceal could make my face looks like a fake one. But this is just very soft and blended into your skin color. I believe the product aims for combination/oily skin, so if your skin is kind of dry, make sure you use moisturizing lotion before it.</li>
    <li> This bb cream make my face so smooth. This products is soothing redness, irritated skin and provides even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost a bit dewy glow that looks very pretty when you wear this BB cream on its own. It gives light skin coverage and feels moist and not too heavy on my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with an oily complexion like mine; however, I don&#x27;t discourage it either. It works pretty well: covers blemishes (but you should also use a blemish stick), smooths out the skin, minimizes pores. If you do have oily skin, just carry around blotting paper like I do. If you don&#x27;t want to waste your money on that, little sheets of paper towels work, too.   I&#x27;m not pale, but I&#x27;m not tan, either. From a non-Korean perspective, people would probably say I&#x27;m very light-skinned. In american make-up brands, I usually wear light beige. So if you&#x27;re any darker than me, this make-up is not going to work for you.  Also, keep in mind that this make-up was designed by Korean people for Korean people. So the tint of the make-up might be a little different than your skin. This can be remedied with an additional application of a powder foundation in your color.  A little bit goes a long way with this stuff, so don&#x27;t squeeze out any more than a rice grain-sized amount (if you know what that looks like) at a time.</li>
    <li> it feels like a normal foundation when i apply it, i don&#x27;t feel any magic of covering facial uneven tone.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t have all the ingredients listed on the amazon page, and though this looks nice, it&#x27;s pretty pale (think porcelain). This is ok, but I have combination skin and it has mineral oil as one of it&#x27;s ingredients, with the result being a super greasy face by mid day. I use a primer, but this is way greasier than other bb creams I&#x27;ve tried. It does look nice in photos and maybe works better for people with dryer skin.</li>
    <li> omg  i have always been using those concealer all over my face, never really try anything. but my friend suggested bb cream and all out of a sudden, i get really interested in it. when i bought it, it feels a little thicker than usual thing i put on my face. but after putting it and looking in the mirror, my face shows a healthy glow and it is soooooo beautiful. MISSHA BB CREAM IS NT A FRAUD. vry highly recommended</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the price since it doesn&#x27;t cover and it is not smooth when you use.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my little sister since it didn&#x27;t work for me...My sister thinks it&#x27;s ok. She has heavily tanned skin color but not even. This one sort of helps her skin looks even.</li>
    <li> finally i found the right BB cream.. perfect coverage natural look.  i use it after my sunscreen  my skin looks healthy.. i always order 2 at a time.. although 1 lasts for a long time.. for that price u cant find better quality.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I am of hispanic and white decent, and finding my shade of cover up has always been a hassle. This cream matches my tone, makes my face look smooth, and covers redness. It lasted all day in 90 degree weather and I only had to use a small amount for my face. My mother tried it as well (she is french and irish) and it made her skin look great as well. It wasn&#x27;t cakey, and my normally oily skin was much fresher looking by the end of the day. Love this product-will order again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this BB cream. It is perfect for those who have lighter skin tones. It goes on smoothly and it gives my skin a refreshed look. It evens out my complexion and covers any flaws. It&#x27;s worth the money because it lasts quite some time. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice cream it goes on very smooth. I just wish they had it in a darker shade, I use the perfect cover missha in no.27 and no.31 in the summer I like how they have different shades.</li>
    <li> Timely shipping, and I am happy with the entire process of ordering. I will order again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the texture of the product, and definitely need a bit something under it before putting it on. Some Caucasians friends of mine tried it on and loved the skin texture afterward, but found the color refused to mix in with their skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Also a bit tight to the skin, feel like there is no air flowing in and out, if you get what I am talking about. Still going to use it occasionally though since it is very photo-genetic.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have oily skin and while it does it make me look \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; it makes me glow as well. I look natural and it feels natural too!</li>
    <li> This is my first BB cream, I was drawn to the BB creams because of my acne prone skin. Once I stated using the BB creams I saw a dramatic improvement in terms of the feel of my skin through out the day; it was much less oily then usual. After a few weeks I saw that my pimples and blemishes were appearing less often and a really big bonus to is that my dark circles have faded by a significant margin after several months of usage.     The only draw backs to this is that when first applied it make your face look pale, and takes a couple of minutes to fade back into the correct skin tone. As such I try to apply the cream at least 20 minutes prior before leaving my house, or encountering anyone. Also be sure not to over apply and only use a small amount as this will reduce the pale look and allow for the cream to settle faster.     Another drawback (for me) is that this does have an SPF factor of 20, and I live in a area that has a strong sun year round. As a result I see that my face is slightly whiter then some of my body, especially my arms, and feel like i should find some body lotion that has equal SPF. And this effect comes with the little sun i do get, as most of the time i spend is indoors.     Despite the two drawbacks I mentioned I feel like this is an excellent product! It really does improve your face without having to use makeup while still looking natural and being far superior to other face lotions and moisturizers. I definitely recommend this to anyone that has acne prone skin, or oily skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely positively LOVE Missha Matte Vita BB Cream.  I&#x27;m a more than fully grown woman with very oily skin.  Any liquid foundation I&#x27;ve tried in the past just feels like paste on my face within a couple hours.  Powder foundations get absorbed within a couple hours.  And no matter what, I&#x27;d always have a \\&quot;nice\\&quot; collection of pimples.  Missha Matte Vita BB Cream gives me great coverage all day long without looking or feeling like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  You don&#x27;t have to do a layer of foundation, then a layer of oil-absorbing serum, then concealer, then finally foundation.  A very small amount of BB cream does everything all in one step.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since switching to it (I&#x27;ve been using my same original tube for almost 4 months - that should tell you how little you need).  This truly is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, one of my faves</li>
    <li> Love this BB cream. It blends really well with my skin (asian, of course :)) and there&#x27;s some SPF in it. I wouldn&#x27;t just rely on it but would put on actual face sunscreen underneath it. Great product and a little goes a long way. One full pump is too much for me personally.</li>
    <li> I will state first that the image here is a bit deceiving: the BB cream shown here is not that light in color! It was much too dark for me, so I gave it to my younger sister to use. She is much tanner where I am milky-white in complexion, so it matches her much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color aside, the product is easy to apply evenly and leaves your skin with a nice, matte finish. It keeps the skin from getting too oily during the day, and the added SPF is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Coverage isn&#x27;t all that great and it definitely did not keep my face matte. Sorry oily girls, but this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it wasn&#x27;t right for my skin because it was a little oily. But it works okay.</li>
    <li> it came before the shipping date, so happy when i received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it takes a while to set but i love it. my skin looks flawless and vibrant. at first it doesnt look like it covers up blemishes but thats fine, least it covers up most of it. all you need is one pump, u really dont need more than that. it says matte on it but i wouldnt say it gives me a matte finish, i still found myself a little oily so i use blotched paper to clean it up. i use this on special occasions and just wished that it would last me forever!!</li>
    <li> much lighter coverage than meisha perfect cover and for my skin tone ( very fair with pink undertones) its a little too beige. I don&#x27;t see anything about it that&#x27;s matte...if anything the consistency is more of a tinted moisturizer. I use it for days when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup but still want some spf</li>
    <li> Covers everything. My skin was recovering from a bout of terrible acne and this is the only thing I could use to first cover it, and now even out my complexion now that my acne is gone but I&#x27;m left with some scarring. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like some bb creams and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Nice clean product blends well and can be worn alone or with foundation for more overage but is perfect alone for week day wear.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the classic red tube one from Missha. This one gives more dewy glow and it lets your skin shown as opposed to the complete coverage look.</li>
    <li> Just ok.....goes on a weird gray color, but eventually evens out.</li>
    <li> Makes skin more oily...</li>
    <li> The perfect light coverage my skin needs, and remember to pat it in, not smear it on, looks way better.</li>
    <li> I know I just opted for regular shipping and had my mind set that it would take too long since the item was being shipped from Seoul, Korea (If Im not mistaken) but the good thing was it came in earlier than expected. Plus I loved the packaging, If I remember correctly the items were in a bubble wrap just to avoid any chances of it spilling or coming out of its tubes. They also included 2 free samples of their other items and attached a note on there--- I love how its very personal instead of business like.  Hands down on the item, the reviews were right. It wasn&#x27;t greasy and it left my skin smooth and clear. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to those who plan to use it to cover acne scars and marks because this item is too light to do that. I suggest they look for a concealer for those marks and they can use it hand in hand with Missha BB Cream. I go through chemical peels monthly to maintain my skin and this is one of those products that you can use with no problems after the peel/ microdermabrasion. It is very light and it does not sting the skin.</li>
    <li> This bb cream is not bad but I found it a bit too light for me. It cover blemishes but leave the skin looking natural. It looks that you have nothing on your face. The thing that I don&#x27;t like is that if your face brushes your clothes it leaves a stain just like foundation .</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this product! The cream made my face look pasty and it really did not do much to keep my blemishes at bay.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great it conceals my old acme scars and unlike other products it does not cause new acme breakouts</li>
    <li> Has a nice texture and spreads nicely. Unfortunately though, it is a bit too dark for my complexion. (Natural redhead, so very pale)</li>
    <li> It is a bit on the oily side.  I have not worn it enough times to tell you if it does all that it claims.  Maybe it would work better on someone else.  It&#x27;s decent, I am just not in love with it.</li>
    <li> The color of the cream is too light on my face, even though I am Asian.  It took quite some time to receive the package, as it is sent from Korea.</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it felt very heavy on the skn and you really have to let it settle on the skin A WHILE before you can see if you need concealer and power etc. After letting the product blend and settle on the skin it still feels rather heavy and is way too dark and pinkish for my VERY fair neutral caucasian skin. Also maybe cos of the heaviness, it doesn&#x27;t stay nicely on my oily skin. In couple hours I already need to apply more concealer and powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So not the best for me. But if you got more of a dry skin, try it out.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice feel and it is easy to apply. The color is somewhat light even on my fair skin, but it gives a make-up free look. This will cover only slight imperfections such as mild redness, flat acne scars, or capillaries, but will do nothing for dark circles or full blown acne, or any other imperfection that requires full coverage. I found that less is more with this product as \\&quot;extra\\&quot; layers will look cakey and are not easily blended without streaks. Some people will like that it has 20 spf but it made this product very oily and therefore not good for my combination skin and definitely not Matte. I found that after 4 hours of regular wear (no sweat), I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked, it was blotchy, way too oily, and there was barely any coverage left on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very nice, looks expensive, and the pump/tube combination makes it easy and hygienic to use.&lt;br /&gt;The product has significant flowery scent but it will dissipate after half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery takes long time since it&#x27;s shipped from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it is a good product for someone with normal or more on a dry side skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the price since I was running low on my Skin79 pink bb cream. I have combination skin, with dry acne prone cheeks and an oily t zone so I&#x27;ve tried a few bb creams and cc creams. I like this best for texture and coverage. It doesn&#x27;t smell, it doesn&#x27;t shimmer or feel tacky and I don&#x27;t need a concealer like I did with skin79 not even under my eyes! Since it took so long to get through customs I just ordered 2 more :) Highly recommend for combination skin that wants a no fuss way to cover uneven skin tone and scars.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream!! its less than $20 and it shipped in about 5 days i think a little less than 1 week. i am so happy about this. i am 16 and i have a light medium asian skin tone and this bb cream is amazing. it was the first one i bought. i have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily stop that i still have to blot even with power on top. also i do have some acne scars which gets mostly covered but you might need concealer for really red ones or build up the product. its pretty thick, dont misunderstand like when you pump it feels compact but when u first apply it is easily blendable and you can build it which i do for my under eyes so it covers. its definetly less coverage than a foundation but more than a tinted moisturizer. i love this because i am young so i dont want to wear cakey makeup or cover my pores but this product improves my skin. really cant go wrong with it!</li>
    <li> I have VERY VERY oily skin, and I have always used dry mineral makeup because of this. However, even the most expensive mineral matte powders would become oily by midday and smear about on my face and look unnatural. I would continue to use them though because liquids are to heavy and I break out from anything but powders. This stuff however, stayed matte all day and left my skin not too dry and not too moist. I also did not break out at all, and touch ups did not cake up. This also blended very well with my light skin tone without making me look unnaturally dark or like a china doll in any way. Because this was such a strange brand I had never heard of before I was worried, but I am glad I listened to the majority of positive reviews and ordered it.</li>
    <li> I love it! it&#x27;s a really nice product.</li>
    <li> it is very matte and not like other bb creams that glide on it is also a bit white. it really does not match my skin tone but with a little setting powder works great</li>
    <li> this product is a good product if you&#x27;re looking for great coverage. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s considering buying this.</li>
    <li> this stuff looks soo good on my skin! im part african american but i have very very light skin. ive tried using american products but i end up looking kinda orange and fake. the fact that its a korean product means it has some of a yellowish undertone somewhat like my skin does. i would soooo recomend this product to anyone who is part arican american and has issues finding the right shade of make up. id also recomend it for people with acne prone skin. mines finally clearing up and i want to show it off as naturally as possible and wow does this stuff do it. it doesnt irritate my skin at all! one small downside is that it stays dewy for a while after i put it on but if you use a bit of finishing powder you wont have to worry! it also stays on pretty well through the day. im totally going to keep using this product!</li>
    <li> I had no idea you needed another product to work with this one. I love Missha products! But this one really did nothing for me. However if I could read the sample of skin cream they sent ( gold bottle looking sample) I would buy that up in a heart beat! Please tell me what the product name for that is! If you have perfect unmarked skin and looking for protection this is for you.</li>
    <li> This cream works so well on my adult ance roscea skin!  I don&#x27;t break out, I don&#x27;t feel as if my skin is smothered in heavy foundation either.  This BB cream is wonderous!</li>
