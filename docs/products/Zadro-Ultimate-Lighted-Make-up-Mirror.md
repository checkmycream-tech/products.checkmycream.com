      <li>Great magnification and light.  </li>
      <li>light is compact and great for home use.  </li>
      <li>, so I am being pro-active by purchasing my own makeup mirror.</li>
      <li>I would recommend, am going to order ac cord, didn&#x27;t do it and don&#x27;t want to remember to make sure batteries are good.</li>
      <li>and she liked it a lot.  </li>

      <li>I tried plugging it in, and then I did get a good light.  </li>

      <li>I love, love, love this make-up mirror!  </li>
      <li>But I love it since the light is so bright.</li>
      <li>Between the 8x magnification and the very bright fluorescent lighting, every pore will be clearly visible.</li>
      <li>The additional bonus is being able to fold the mirror which minimizes the size for packing in a suitcase.  </li>
      <li>The Zadro Ultimate Lighted Make-up Mirror was the best one I tested.  </li>

      <li>Therefore, every time I try to use the bottom mirror, top one would fall on my head.</li>
      <li>I have bought several of these mirrors because I have been so impressed with the lighting/magnification/compact design.</li>
      <li>The replacement order came in and the top mirror has fallen out twice now; thankfully I was there and caught it before it broke to pieces.  </li>
      <li>The top mirror broke off both times.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad they have them in this mirror.  </li>

      <li>Baby Boomers will love this...</li>
      <li>I  had this mirror for many years and was now looking for a magnifying mirror for my vacation home.  </li>
      <li>you wanted and the lighting was better on it that way.  </li>
      <li>I bought the mirror in June and was thrilled with the 10X magnification with light.  </li>
      <li>it would just be one more thing to forget.  </li>
      <li>The lighting is excellent -- mimics natural light well.  </li>
      <li>A defect for sure, but I was willing to overlook that if the mirror was a good mirror</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say is that the mirror itself was of good quality.</li>
      <li>I feel so clean!</li>
      <li>this one has amazing lighting output with a magnificatation mirror better than my large one at home!</li>
      <li>The light also was not as bright as on my first one.</li>
      <li>I like the size of this mirror and the light is better than on cheaper versions.  </li>
      <li>Guess I can use it without any light at all, but that sure defeated the purpose of buying this lighted mirror.  </li>
      <li>Excellent light, great magnification and convenient for home or travel, also versatile using batteries or an outlet but the \\&quot;permanent light fixture\\&quot; died on my first mirror in less than a year of use</li>
      <li>The light works great if the batteries are brand new - however, that level of brightness lasts maybe two mornings.  </li>
      <li>It does fold up nicely for traveling though and the price was right.</li>
      <li>Easy to pack</li>
      <li>Easy to pack.  </li>
      <li>adjustment of the mirror will easily brake it.</li>
      <li>The magnification is very good(too good) but you could spend a fraction of the money for a drugstore cheap version.</li>
      <li>I really liked this mirror when I first got it.  </li>
      <li>This mirror does a fine job as a mirror.  </li>
      <li>light adjusts to the amount of light in the room and is adjustable for easy viewing.   </li>
      <li>What I was looking for is bright natural light in order to truly see how my make-up look.  </li>
      <li>This mirror is fantastic for tweezing your eyebrows.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My mirror&#x27;s light went out after only one month. After reading reviews that this seemed to be a common problem, I returned the mirror for a refund. I&#x27;m going to research another product.</li>
    <li> I thought I had a winner with this makeup mirror, but was quickly proven wrong.  To begin with, it wouldn&#x27;t work at all with batteries.  I tried plugging it in, and then I did get a good light.  I was disappointed at that point because I wanted to take it on a cruise and use the battery.  But because of poor performance with the battery, I had to take the heavy plug on the cruise.  The second time I went to use it - nothing!  Nothing we did could get it to work.  And it was too late to return it.  I was so mad, I didn&#x27;t even want to carry it home.  Guess I can use it without any light at all, but that sure defeated the purpose of buying this lighted mirror.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I bought the mirror in June and was thrilled with the 10X magnification with light.  I used it everyday until August 24 when the cord developed a short.  Now all that I have is an unlit 10X magnification mirror.  I am so disappointed in the quality.  For the price and only 2 months of use this item is a rip off.</li>
    <li> This mirror was in our stateroom on a recent cruise.  Immediately, I knew I had to have one.  It is great for traveling.  Warning:  You will see every imperfection on the magnified side.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my wife as a gift, site unseen, which turned out to be a mistake.  Mirror was too small for everyday use, but good size for travel.  The 10x power was really too strong.  Wife found it difficult to even see herself in the mirror so I tried as well and sure enough it was just too hard to see.  Never even tried to plug it in to wall unit.  Wife just did not like it, so I packed it back up and returned it.  Kudo&#x27;s to Amazon for an easy and quick way to return products, even from third parties.    Just  not the mirror for her.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a birthday gift.  The lighting was very poor.      Further, when obtaining information about a return to this vendor, I received an email that said, if the mirror was in pristine condition and in original packing they would consider refunding the money less a re-stocking fee.  Nowhere in the product information is a re-stocking fee mentioned.  They did do a refund but charged a re-stocking fee of $10.00.  Additionally, I had to pay $12 in postage to return it.</li>
    <li> I find this mirror much too small and unless you are putting it on a shelf too low. The lighted mirror is the lower one and it only raises an inch or two up making it necessary to bend down to look into.  If you have a shelf for it, that would work.  I kept it anyway to use when traveling as it is portable and will run off of batteries.  I just hold it  so I can see!</li>
    <li> this item would be perfect if not for poor quality. The lighging is very dim and the mirror does not stay in place when the height is adjusted.</li>
    <li> I travel quite frequently, and wanted a travel makeup mirror comparable to the one I have at home.  The magnification of this one is good; and, unlike other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the upper, 1X mirror staying on.  The light works great if the batteries are brand new - however, that level of brightness lasts maybe two mornings.  I am very careful to shut the mirror off when not in use; yet, I cannot get top quality batteries to light the thing for more than one business trip before I find myself gravitating toward a light in my room to actually see.  It does have a port for an adapter.  But, first, it doesn&#x27;t come with an adapter; plus, I&#x27;m already packing charging cords for my phone and computer...it would just be one more thing to forget.  Oh, and if I extend the neck, it tends to slide right back down.  Apparently, it&#x27;s a little too heavy for the design.</li>
    <li> mirror on top is only attached with double faced tape and fell off and broke.  Made very cheaoly.  When mirror falls off could break and shatter.  Very dangerous</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror over others because of its functionality.  However, a year later the bulb died in the mirror.  The outside of the packaging indicates \\&quot;Lifetime Bulb\\&quot;.  However, when I contacted Zadro regarding the bad bulb, they told me that the bulb is not replaceable, and they will not warranty it after 60 days.  All I can say is:  Don&#x27;t buy Zadro products! They are expensive and not worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I read all the customer reviews for \\&quot;lighted mirrors\\&quot; on Amazon, and this one was given 5 stars by 2 people - so I bought it.  The mirror&#x27;s 8x magnification is really great - you&#x27;ll see everything up close and in detail that other mirrors won&#x27;t show you.  The lighting is bright and pleasing.  However, the quality of adjusting the height is pretty lame.  It slides up and down easily even when it&#x27;s tightened to full capacity.  Also, the clock/alarm in mine is messed up.  The alarm goes off even at the slightest touch of the mirror, and the buttons are very stiff and it&#x27;s impossible to program the day or the time (and yes the alarm is still going off all the while).  I don&#x27;t want to buy another cell battery to see if that is what the problem is.  I&#x27;ve spent several hours already trying to make it work.  I am sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for travel purposes but like it so much that I use it for every day at home, too. I really like how you can plug it in at home but don&#x27;t need to when away. It outperforms my other mirror in every way and only takes up 1/3 of the space. Since my dresser space is shared, the DH is grateful! ;)</li>
    <li> After spending a lot of $$ on hand mirrors that either were 2 large, 2 heavy or poor quality mirror I finally hit the jackpot.  I find the price to be worth the product as I&#x27;ve hadother expensive mirrors that were not up to snuff.  This one is all around and folds up compactly for travel or making up in the car.  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl friend as a christmas gift. She was looking for one for a while and was getting frustrated with the selection in local stores. When she tried it she was happy with it. I told her I would return it if she didn&#x27;t like it but she said no and still has it and uses it. I think she is happy with it, but wasn&#x27;t super-wowed by it. I was disappointed that the A/C adaptor is not included I mean really?(that cost a star)but other that that it was ok.</li>
    <li> It is great for someone needing glasses to apply make-up or to do your eyebrows.  Also great to take along for travel.</li>
    <li> The Product is well made, however, I find it difficult to use.  Both mirrors should be a bit larger in circumference.</li>
    <li> Very compact. Good for home use as well as travelling. Unfortunately, the clock didn&#x27;t work (battery was ok) &amp; to return I would have paid $10 + shipping charges. Too much for a defective product that only cost $40.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror for travel that was compact and I have finally found it.  Great magnification and light.  Easy to pack.  Since I am a makeup artist I am in hotels all the time and the lighting is so bad in the rooms I needed a light that would give me true daylight.  Very happy with this mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a while now, and my mascara has never looked so good. I&#x27;ve never plucked my eyebrows as well, and my eyeshadow has never been so expertly blended. I can&#x27;t say enough about this mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife a few years ago.  It lasted about 1 year before the glass fell out and broke.  It still had the 10X mirror so she used it for another year or so until it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I searched for a replacement, but this model won again, and I purchased another.  It died after just a few weeks.  I replaced it again, and that one died after a few months of use (after the warranty expired).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would fix their quality control issues.  I am willing to pay more for something that works for longer than the warranty period.  A great idea poorly executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if/when you get the quality up to a reasonable standard.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror based on the reviews here.  The first issue I had with it is the height of it.  It is so low that even if you bring your face low enough to actually see it in the mirror, you inadvertently get makeup on the mirrow (powders/shadows) since it is below your face versus straight forward, so shadows and powders fall on it and are then magnified.  Second problem was the light was so dim that I thought it was a problem with the batteries (brand new batteries) so I tried external power, same problem.  Another reviewer said she uses a tissue box to raise it.  I had to do that but then I thought, why should I?  For $50, why do I have to improvise?  Just not worth it.  Also, in order for the upper mirror to be lit, you have to rotate it to fit on top of the base mirror for the light to shine through the outer circle which makes the lighting fainter than the base lighting.  As a side note, I also had a problem with the built in clock/alarm, it just would go haywire with the digits flashing and not maintaining the correct time.  A defect for sure, but I was willing to overlook that if the mirror was a good mirror but it is not (at least for me).  I sincerely think my cheapo $15 old Conair makeup mirror is better than this one.</li>
    <li> I loved this mirror the first time my husband bought it as a gift for me, so much that I bought another one when the first one went out within the first year.  Well guess what, the second one did too and the company WILL NOT warranty it for more than 90 days.  This is a great mirror while it lasts, but I promise you that I will not purchase a 3rd one.</li>
    <li> Just got back from a trip to Europe with 4 girlfriends.  I knew mirror space would be an issue in the mornings, so I purchased the Zadro Ultimate Lighted Make-Up Mirror.  The size is nice though it is a bit on the heavy side, but I suppose that says something for the quality and helps with balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other people complained that the mirror fell down and would not stay upright.  I did not experience this at all. The dial on the lower right can be dialed in to lock the mirror in place or release it.  Seemed to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a one week work trip and then another two week trip 3 weeks later.  Used every morning and did not run out of battery power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame that the 10x mirror at the bottom is the only one that is lit up, but it puts off enough light that you can still see for the non-magnified mirror above provided there is a little surrounding light in the room.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and poor lighting. Good idea; not well made!</li>
    <li> I  had this mirror for many years and was now looking for a magnifying mirror for my vacation home.  Went to several stores and purchased 3 of them and returned all three because they were all too bulky and  too tall for me to see myself well from my makeup table. This mirror is somewhat more compact and a perfect size for me.  Since I&#x27;ve had such good luck with this mirror I decided to order the same one through Amazon.  Came immediately and works well. PS- in all these years, I never knew there was a clock on the mirror because I never pulled up the neck of the mirror,  so I can&#x27;t comment on that aspect of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: A few days after receiving my merchandise, the top mirror fell off (it is only held on with strips of double-sided tape). I contacted Amazon, and they immediately arranged for a replacement mirror to be sent to me.  I left it sitting on my tabletop, and this one lasted a whole three weeks before the top mirror fell off.  The phone rep. for the company told me they would not send me another one, and that I should go to a hardware store and buy a specific adhesive to glue the mirror on. She said they would not send me the adhesive nor a new mirror.  So, although I love the mirror when it stays in place, there are some major quality issues with this merchandise that the company should be addressing. Changed my rating from a 5 star to a 3 star.</li>
    <li> Between the 8x magnification and the very bright fluorescent lighting, every pore will be clearly visible. Plenty big enough to put on all of your makeup, though I set it up on tissue box to get it even with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1/24/11) After six years, mine is still working.  I&#x27;m buying a second one for my office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3/12/11) Bought a second mirror and had to return it.  The light only worked with batteries and quit working whenever I plugged it into an outlet.  The light also was not as bright as on my first one.</li>
    <li> I travel all of the time for work, and have one of these mirrors for travel, and one for home use.  The last one I purchased was the 4th one I&#x27;ve owned...no matter how good you pack your suitcase, things will get damaged from being thrown around the way luggage can sometimes be.  I don&#x27;t mind paying a higher price for this mirror if need be...it&#x27;s SO WORTH IT!  Great for tweezing eyebrows and just wonderful for every aspect of applying makeup.  I recommend this mirror to anyone who really cares about how well their makeup is applied.  There should be no reason for makeup errors using this mirror!!!!  IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE ONE, GET ONE...YOU&#x27;LL BE VERY SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> I received the Zadro mirror about a week ago.  While I liked the quality of the light, I was disappointed in several ways.  First, the height only adjusts a little bit--maybe 2-3.\\&quot;  So even the top mirror wasn&#x27;t really high enough for me to use it easily for makeup application.  Second, the hinged style of the mirror was annoying, because it wouldn&#x27;t really stay in place.  Third, only the bottom of the two mirrors (the magnified one) was lit.  The top one wasn&#x27;t lit at all, and that was the one I really wanted to use.  Overall, I was very disappointed.  I am returning the item today.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror when I first got it.  I was excited that it seemed portable.   It ended up being a pain.  The weight of the mirror would collapse itself when I was using it.  The weird design ended up being bad because you cannot maneuver the mirror very well.  The cord was really short so I couldn&#x27;t use the mirror in very many places.  There&#x27;s a built in alarm that would go off every day and I never set an alarm on the mirror.  The bulb eventually burnt out and almost electrocuted me.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND AS A GIFT AND SHE LOVES IT, AND SAYS IT&#x27;S THE BEST MAKE-UP MIRROR SHE&#x27;S EVER USED. ONLY PROBLEM IS HER TWO DAUGHTERS KEEP TAKING IT FOR THEIR USE, GOOD THING IT HAS BATTERIES AND A PLUG IN. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WILL BE BUYING TWO MORE REAL SOON.FOR THE MONEY THIS IS THE BEST MIRROR OF IT&#x27;S TYPE OUT THERE, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> I would like this item if it worked.  I rec&#x27;d it, put the batteries in and tried it...no problems.  Went to use it again and the LED lights aren&#x27;t working.  I replaced the batteries even though I knew that wasn&#x27;t the problem...still nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I&#x27;m very disappointed and am more disappointed that I cannot contact the seller.  I feel the customer service should be improved and the seller should stand behind his product.</li>
    <li> good quality and great for travel as well - just what I ws looking for</li>
    <li> Not good for traveling, it&#x27;s too heavy and bulky. Not well made considering the price, it feels like any wrong turn/adjustment of the mirror will easily brake it.</li>
    <li> Although the mirror on this is acceptable, it was sold as a lighted mirror WITH an alarm and clock.  Not true at all!!!  There is absolutely no clock or alarm.  If I weren&#x27;t in need of this mirror for our upcoming trip it would be going back to Amazon.  I hate when a product is advertised to be something it is NOT!!!!  Buyer beware.  You are NOT getting what you are paying for with this item.  NOT AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for a good lighted mirror for make up purposes.  What I was looking for is bright natural light in order to truly see how my make-up look.  There are hardly any reviews online for lighted mirrors, so I had to go to the stores and test them out myself.  I bought a couple of them ranging from $15 to $100.  I was disappointed with all of them.  Either the light is too dim or the color of the light is weird, like orange light, even when I changed the bulb!  The Zadro Ultimate Lighted Make-up Mirror was the best one I tested.  It&#x27;s very bright, so bright that I have to get closer to the mirror to see better b/c the light is overwhelmingly bright that that&#x27;s all I can see, it makes everything else so dark.  I didn&#x27;t like that at first but I rather have that than the other dim lights on other mirrors.  There are other features that I didn&#x27;t think was important before turned out to be pretty useful and I am so glad they have them in this mirror.  Those are the 8x magnifying side.  It becomes so useful when I&#x27;m putting on mascara, plucking eyebrows or cleaning out my pores.   Another feature that I started to like a lot is the little clock on it.  It keeps me from spending too much time putting on make-up.  &#x3D;).  The light stays bright even when you use batteries and it doesn&#x27;t produce heat like the other lighted mirrors I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s portable, foldable so I can take it anywhere.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the price I bought at Brookstone for $60 but then found it on Amazon for $30.  I was so happy!  Highly recommend this if you&#x27;re seriously after a bright white light mirror.</li>
    <li> Excellent light, great magnification and convenient for home or travel, also versatile using batteries or an outlet but the \\&quot;permanent light fixture\\&quot; died on my first mirror in less than a year of use but I liked the other features so much that I bought another one and hopefully this one will last.</li>
    <li> I bought the travel mirror for my wife at Christmas.  She loves it so much she uses it more than her regular vanity mirror.  Very good lighting and magnification.  The only slight drawback is programing the clock, we have had a couple random late night wake up beeps.</li>
    <li> I like the portability and adjustability of this mirror.  It takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly.  It serves my needs very well.  I was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit.  I tend to use the normal mirror more often.  The other is the clock loses it&#x27;s setting when I stow it away.  It has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature.  As far as I am concerned...I was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock.</li>
    <li> I paid Fifty some dollars for this mirror and I was ver disappointed.  It has terrible lighting and the only lighted mirror is the magnifying Glass.  i did not like it at all.  It is also extremely small.  Too much money for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because my Sharper Image travel mirror broke. I really loved that mirror bacause it had a nice snap on cover for traveling and the light source was bright. The Zadro mirror is a an acceptable replacement even though it could use a few improvements. I do not like the flip style mirror because it is not removable. This causes  the mirror topple over when I am using the magnified mirror side. I also think the light source could be much brighter. It does fold up nicely for traveling though and the price was right.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this make-up mirror and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if they hadn&#x27;t changed what is included.  This is the third one she&#x27;s had since she first found them.  The other two came with the AC Adapter.  So when I ordered this one I ASSUMED it would be the same.  Stupid me!  They now makle you buy one separately!  And if you try to purchase from Zadro (the manufacturer) they will soak you more for the shipping than for the adapter! (The adapter plus shipping is almost one-half of the price of the mirror!)    WHAT A RIP OFF!</li>
    <li> Zadro Ultimate Lighted Make-up Mirror two times I have had to have the mirror replaced. The top mirror broke off both times. Too bad, because otherwise it&#x27;s a great little mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is fantastic for tweezing your eyebrows.  My one complaint is that the top mirror broke off after a few months, meaning I had two separate pieces.  The battery doesn&#x27;t last terribly long for the light, but if you use it under a bright light, you won&#x27;t need it.      Bottom line: One of the best mirrors I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this make-up mirror!  It lets me see everything so I can take care of my eyebrows and after I apply make-up with a brush, I can see if I have any of those tiny little brush hairs on my face.  &lt;br /&gt;The price here is awesome, I found this mirror at a retail store for $30 more. The only problem I have had with this mirror is that sometime the adjustment to make it taller does not work well, but thats not a big thing. Try it you will love it also!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect size for my small bathroom and the magnification allows you to see everything.</li>
    <li> The Zadro Lighted Mirror is a quality product when compared to a previously owned Sharper Image product that cost twice as much.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The light adjusts to the amount of light in the room and is adjustable for easy viewing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The light is compact and great for home use.  The additional bonus is being able to fold the mirror which minimizes the size for packing in a suitcase.  Another great quality is you can either use batteries or the provided supply source. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Great mirror...electric OR battery operated!  Great magnification!  I love this mirror...I&#x27;m on my 3rd one.  Now the negative....If you flip it over from regular to magnification frequently (and I do) the screw doesn&#x27;t seem to hold too well and the plastic housing cracks.  There is no way to fix this and thus I have had to replace it.</li>
    <li> Now here is a mirror to take traveling.  It works is low light conditions, is well protected with it&#x27;s folding style, and provides adequate magnification. The lighting within is well positioned, so that  you can rest it on a counter and use both hands if necessary to perform your touch-ups .</li>
    <li> It is ok.  I would have preferred a bigger mirror and the magnifying side is low and heard to use.</li>
    <li> this is great, I can do my make up better and perfect when I travel; thank you Zadro, great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reyna&lt;br /&gt;Garden Grove, CA</li>
    <li> AWESOME travel mirror</li>
    <li> Got this as an Xmas gift for my wife.......I am pretty certain she likes it...now instead of her taking an hour to get ready to go, it takes an hour &amp; a half....sometimes a guy just can&#x27;t win!</li>
    <li> Excellent travel mirror.Wonderful magnification. compact for packing. Like having a battery option when electricity is not available tho the light is not as intense. I have bought several of these mirrors because I have been so impressed with the lighting/magnification/compact design.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that if you want a lighted makeup mirror, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one because it has \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;.  It apparently has an LED clock and alsrm clock, but I could never get it to work.  The light does not work, but the alarm goes off every morning at 4am and I am not able to reset it.  The magnification is very good(too good) but you could spend a fraction of the money for a drugstore cheap version.</li>
    <li> Great light and magnification.  I&#x27;ve had it for 4+ years and it&#x27;s still running like a champ with daily use.</li>
    <li> Mirror too small to see entire face and only sits 4&amp;#34; up from table or desk so you have to crouch to use it.</li>
    <li> Very handy and has a bag for travelling. For the price I paid; I was expecting a bigger mirror than what I got.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a ridiculous price for the quality. It started falling apart 1 day after using it and never did work the way it was supposed to.  It would not even stay propped up and then the mirror started coming unglued and falling off the backing.</li>
    <li> Had this same style miorror for several years without any problems.  First recent order can in and mirror wouldn&#x27; open correctly to make it useable.  The replacement order came in and the top mirror has fallen out twice now; thankfully I was there and caught it before it broke to pieces.  Apparently the quality of the products being made now just don&#x27;t compare to my older version.</li>
    <li> I do wish this mirror had a plug-in adapter instead of just running off batteries, but oh well. The magnification is great, the light just perfect, and I&#x27;ve never gotten a better cleaning of my pores, and been able to see every hair to pluck between the brows. I feel so clean! The price is great also - I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase on Amazon instead of over at someplace like Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Their prices were so high, and when I looked up reviews for most of their mirrors after browsing, they had horrible scores anyways.   My mirror&#x27;s still new, so I&#x27;m hoping it has a long life, but so far so good! Can&#x27;t wait to bring it traveling.</li>
    <li> I Love this make-up mirror. I have bought and taken back mirror after mirror and this one is staying. The light is bright enough that I can see everything clearly, even tho the mirror is not large it is big enough to do what I need but the light was the thing that sold me.  I am thinking about getting another one just to have so I don&#x27;t have to go looking again</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. I returned two others before she finally found one that gives off the correct light and can be used while traveling.</li>
    <li> bought this item as a present for my mom and she raves about it.....she says the lighting and the magnification are perfect. highly reccommend!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001MXRQRO Zadro Ultimate Make-up Mirror]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mirror.  It&#x27;s very useful having both normal and magnified views, one above the other so that you can move between them easily, without having to manipulate the mirror.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use the magnified part but actually I now use it more than the normal mirror.  The lighting is excellent -- mimics natural light well.  I really like being able to close the mirror and have it fold really flat -- not just good for traveling but for when you don&#x27;t want a multiple mirrors staring other people in the face or you just want it out of the way.</li>
    <li> I found using the regular lens mirror makes the stand collapse.  I see the picture with the two mirrors standing tall, but mine does not.  I am disappointed with the function on my first trip.  Not as steady or stand-alone as I hoped</li>
    <li> I am about to purchase my fourth Zadro Ultimate Makeup Mirror because I cannot find anything better.  What I like about this mirror is that it folds up and fits into my makeup bag, has both normal and 10x magnification and a battery so that I can use it anywhere.  The worst part is that the hinge between the mirrors breaks after about a year or two and cannot be fixed.  This design flaw needs to be fixed.  Also, the lighted part and the clock ends up not working.  Too bad that the quality of this mirror cannot be improved because the basic idea is very good.</li>
    <li> Product was wonderful. The size was great and to fold up and store was very easy. I would recommend, am going to order ac cord, didn&#x27;t do it and don&#x27;t want to remember to make sure batteries are good.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and she liked it a lot.  It folds as well as lights up which are both very useful features.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best items I ever purchased for travel.  I do wish the magnifying mirror was a little higher but I just prop it on something.  It&#x27;s great and very compact.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The wife got this for herself to take on trips.  She has used it on two trips and seems very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this mirror for a year and the LED light  already stopped working. It is not a battery issue. Piece of crap. I highly advise against purchasing this.</li>
    <li> product as advertised</li>
    <li> I use a makeup mirror with magnification at home daily and get frustrated with hotel bathroom lighting (and I stay in 4-5 star hotels). I will soon be traveling with 3 other women sharing 1 suite (yes, I know...), so I am being pro-active by purchasing my own makeup mirror. I looked at quite a few before choosing this one. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! this one has amazing lighting output with a magnificatation mirror better than my large one at home! I am so glad I made this purchase. The only downside is it&#x27;s small, which is a plus for travel but negative for daily use. I will get used to it. Now I never have to worry about hotel lighting again! This is the only travel mirror you should ever consider!</li>
    <li> I like the size of this mirror and the light is better than on cheaper versions.  It unfolds stiffly and I am bit afraid that I will crack a hinge over time when trying to extend it.  It&#x27;s relatively difficult to position the mirror in such a way to optimally use both the regular and extended power mirrors without fiddling with either its position or yours.  But overall I am happier with this model that others I bought mainly because of the brigher illumination.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror with a really bright light which is what I need in the morning to see my makeup.  I like the magnifying mirror to see all the pores.  The only bad thing is the built in alarm clock.  It seems to reset every time I fold the mirror down.  But I love it since the light is so bright.</li>
    <li> looking forward to the mirror arriving. It worked great for one day and then........nothing.  The light would not work, what a disappointment. The only good thing I can say is that the mirror itself was of good quality.</li>
    <li> I previously ordered a smaller mirror....way to small.  This one is great. Easy to pack (case comes with it), takes up very little space, gives good light and very easy to use....Baby Boomers will love this...I can see again to put on mascara!</li>
    <li> This mirror does a fine job as a mirror.  However it has a serious flaw. There is a tiny alarm clock that you may not even notice. A couple of years after purchasing this, the alarm battery started going haywire. I could not figure out where the beep of an alarm was coming from in the middle of the night, and finally traced it to this mirror. The bad news is that the battery on the dumb alarm has now been going off intermittently for some time, but it is impossible to replace the alarm batteries. We have tried-- believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it goes off at odd times all during the day and night. I thought it would run out of juice, but it is not doing so. I now have to either continue to listen to the stupid beeping, or  discard this mirror and purchase a new, different one-- one without an alarm on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throwing it in the trash!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror for more than 3 years and haven&#x27;t had any major problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just after using it for years, the hinge for the top mirror got loose. Therefore, every time I try to use the bottom mirror, top one would fall on my head. It just will not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after installing 4 AA batteries, it got kind of heavy. So I gave up taking it on airplane.</li>
    <li> Works good but really wanted the mod that plugs into the wall socket. I assume you don&#x27;t make that one antmore</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money. It already fell apart. The plastic casing is cheap and the mirror quality is really poor. I wish a company would come out with a cordless light up mirror that actually is of value.</li>
    <li> too big and bulky. magnification not good</li>
    <li> I really like the size of this mirror, and its adjustable height &amp; horizontal swivel. In that sense, it is really good for traveling. But it simply fails because only one of the two mirrors is actually lit. What a poor design choice. Note to Zadro:  if you&#x27;re going to include two mirrors, you should include two lights. I really don&#x27;t need my face in the regular mirror to be lit from below like some creepy horror-movie face.  So I end up: 1.) using natural light (which sort of defeats the purpose of having a mirror with a light), or 2.) tilting the mirror on it&#x27;s side to use the light from the magnified mirror, in addition to some other light source for the other side of my face. That is a pain.  I think if they included a light on the regular mirror, and not just the magnified one, I would give this mirror 4 or 5 stars. Please, Zadro, fulfill my perfect-travel-mirror-dream and light both mirrors.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old Zadro Mirror with this one because I really liked the one I had before.&lt;br /&gt;New one works on batteries only - I liked the old one better because you could plug it in&lt;br /&gt;if you wanted and the lighting was better on it that way.  We travel a lot and I need a&lt;br /&gt;mirror to use in hotel rooms - looked everywhere and this is the best I could find.</li>
