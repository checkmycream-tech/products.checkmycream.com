<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I sprayed this perfume. It&#x27;s awesome for the price. I just ordered a new bottle, I couldn&#x27;t risk running out of this perfume. Save yourself some money and buy this perfume. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I usually get compliments on every single cologne I wear however I never, not even a single day of wearing LOMANI received a compliment. I think it has got a very plain air freshener smell... I would only buy this to spray in my car or my house, however make sure it is your complete last resort if you want to use it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell and I got this for him as a gift he doesnt know the cost but he thinks it a expensive perfume it smells clean and stays all day.</li>
    <li> its all me the smell is swell lol</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this perfume. It smells GREAT and lasts the whole day. Not to mention that it&#x27;s so cheap. Great product.</li>
    <li> smells a little too old but i like that it seems to mix with your own sweat to make it stronger and more pleasant</li>
    <li> i was surprised when i got the perfume in ma hand! the product is very big (in good way) it came in perfect condition and the perfume smells very good, it has a soft fragance. i was looking for a diferent perfume and i founded this one, price.... realy nice just 10 dolars and the shipment was great too! even before i spected!</li>
    <li> The color of the deo was not quite right when it came (looked like it had been sitting on the shelf for way too long). The dispenser doesn&#x27;t quite work properly (again sign of being old).</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> I first purchased \\&quot;Lomani\\&quot; at an open marketing in Italy, about 15 years ago...I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was available on amazon.com.  The scent was just as I remembered - although inexpensive, it smells like a high-end designer fragrance (I am always asked, \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; when I use Lomani.  Spicy, masculine, and a large bottle that lasts.  I need to order again soon!</li>
    <li> THIS PERFUME IS AMAZING ! A MUST TO PURCHASE ! I am planning to buy a lot of it soon ~</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend a few months ago on a whim. He&#x27;s finally run out this stuff and requested that I \\&quot;hook him up\\&quot; because he&#x27;s received \\&quot;100&#x27;s of compliments\\&quot; since he started wearing it.  I actually don&#x27;t love it -it&#x27;s just ok for me.  But he does!  He&#x27;s a smoker and it does cover up the smell decently.</li>
    <li> Simplemente un perfume detestable! Huele como vale.. barato, fuerte, intenso.. Prefiero echarme colonia de ni&amp;ntilde;o... el PEOR perfume que he comprado en mi vida!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a nasty smell! It smells like cheap, strong and intense .. I&#x27;d rather give me a child colony ... the WORST perfume that I bought in my life!</li>
    <li> For very VERY cheap fragrance, this smells surprisingly pleasant</li>
    <li> As many other users have reviewed about how long the fragrance lasts - when new, that is within 2 - 3 weeks of purchase, it stayed for about 8 hours. As the perfume got older, it stays for less than an hour or maybe half an hour. Very bad, don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for two of my nephews, aged 19 and 22. They both said they loved it and were using it often.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very elegant, very pleased and would recommend to people. Very good fragrance, very manly, I like all my expectations mucho.Lleno respecto.Muy good presentation.</li>
    <li> Lomani just smells awesome! I get compliments all the time and don&#x27;t have to worry about the smell going away, because it last. However its not overpowering and not to light, its just perfect!</li>
    <li> D NOT BUY THIS FRAGRANCE! it smells  like shaving cream! when i tried it on, every1 said it smells like shaving cream! this would be good for your arm pits but not 4 a cologne!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent price!</li>
    <li> thought by reading the reviews i would like this product. i bought it and used it. not what i like. (it might have been good when it came off the assembly line) sorry.</li>
    <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many scents from Amazon but this is my first time trying the Lomani brand.  Well it has far exceeded my expectations, this eau de toilette smells great and has been moved to the top of my list, to be worn when I go out and am dressed to the 9&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have never heard of Lomani before, but it is awesome.  Hey, it also grabs the young ladies attention~</li>
    <li> The first time I had one of this was like 15 years ago, and I liked it very much, so, I thought it was a very good idea to buy another one, and I did, and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a suggestion from someone saying it had a similar base scent. It did not appeal to me, just gives of that \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smell. fortunately my dad likes this kind of cologne.</li>
    <li> Topnotes smell like Drakkar Noir. Lasts very well. Sillage moderate. Good for office. Also good as a summer fragrance. Excellent value for money.</li>
    <li> A good fragrance for its price. Not really the best, but is mild and pleasing. More suitable for casual use.</li>
    <li> This is true value for money and a great spray for everyday use. I will always choose this any day.</li>
    <li> I get many compliments on this fragrance. Lasts all day and is very light. The price is affordable and I have ordered 3 so far.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and bought this this smells way better than Drakkar, it smells like my $70 cologne called Duc de vervins L extreme, cant wrong buying this.  I dont know about the longevity yet so i gave 4 stars ,but i hope its good.</li>
    <li> This product smells just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;..The scent does not seem to last very long at all..Probably would not recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loved it and said he had a lot of people asking what he was wearing because it smelled good. So I had to reorder it. Good price for a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Prior to my purchase I have never heard of or tried Lomani.  I bought this bottle due to the reviews and the price point and thought I would give it a whirl.  I do the same test to with all my cologne to see how I should wear it.  I sprayed two times on a piece of clothing and it smelled similar to a Coolwater Polo Sport type of cologne.  I revisited the clothing the next day and of course the scent was weaker but not gone.  I like colognes that have a lasting scent.  Due to the overall scent, price point and lasting strength of this cologne I rate it 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like its scent which, I have gotten several nice compliment about it like what&#x27;s that you are wearing it smells good.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance in budget. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for nice musky fragrance within budget. Don&#x27;t expect too much as price matters.</li>
    <li> I first really liked the smell of this cologne, and would constantly get compliments from other guys who also thought it smelled good. But after being told by several girls, this cologne smells &amp;#34;nasty and way too strong&amp;#34; to them no matter how little i sprayed. Then some other times i would get female compliments that &amp;#34;someone smells really good&amp;#34; when i came close. so some like, some hate...</li>
    <li> Bought this based upon the many positive reviews. It is very similar in structure to Drakkar Noir, but there is a mix of berry standing out in the notes that, to my mind and chemistry, make this better.</li>
    <li> About the same with any low priced cologne this was just one to try out and see if I liked, it was o.k. but not a favorite</li>
    <li> Give this  away after a couple usage. Based on the reviews, thought I would have gotten something better but as they say, you get what you pay for and the price was on the lower end</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne for the price. It has a reasonable lasting time and a very pleasant smell. I have had several complements when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Like I said, I love the smell and I get complimented often.  All I can say is try it and see if you like.</li>
    <li> I think this cologne is very cost effective at the same time quality is very good. Same cologne if you go to malls you will find it for $30-$40 so its 3 times cheaper than malls...</li>
    <li> excellent product I love</li>
    <li> I have been using for years as an every day spray. But this new version with the new packaging is different, like it is watered down 600%. It is, as they say on the continent, MERDE. Going to be going from 8 to 10 bottles per yeat, to 0.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MERDE.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot return this waste water either</li>
    <li> Love the smell, worth the money. Got this as gifts and everyone loved it back home. Packing is wonderful too</li>
    <li> Yes its good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a fragrant that I wear only in the winter because of the freshness of the sent my favorite</li>
    <li> have had great satisfaction using Lomani for men toilette spray,the price was right and the service great and I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> So I bought this one in the dark because of three things. Lomani, 3.4 oz, and under $10 with free shipping?! Yeah, this one is definitely a great cologne to add to ANY collection... But keep reading.  The scent:  This one is very easy to describe. It smells like aftershave and lasts for hours with just 2-4 sprays. Because of this, I use it for the morning only, normally right after showering. It works great to freshen up the room as well. I&#x27;d say this is more of one of those masculine colognes and would fit the needs of anyone who has hit puberty.  Bottom line:  Amazon is doing us men a favor for having this brand for the price on their website. If you want an expensive, strong aftershave cologne, buy this one. Seriously, add to cart. Five stars for the smell and the price, although I&#x27;d spend up to $30 for this one again.  Hope this was helpful to you.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this cologne and so do most of the people that have smelled on me.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Great cologne, feels intense at first but over time wears gracefully.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t over power anyone and keeps you fresh.&lt;br /&gt;have been using Lomani for over 15 years now and at this price, you can keep buying from Amazon at a constant rate.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
    <li> a great smell, at a greast price for men, i will recommend this to tohers including women lokking to gift men</li>
    <li> Lasts into the morning, and will &amp;#34;define&amp;#34; your clothing by remaining embedded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for a different scent, a bit heavy, but if you are chemically symbiotic with it,  the scent transforms into &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of the 80&#x27;s in a way, but all said, at least that&#x27;s different than all the generic scents out today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> It was a waste of my money. If i kept my receipt I would return it. It has a strong smell to it.</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance since I was in college and this one os the same and I wi ll be stocking up on it, well recommended.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong, not suitable for women. For men also, I would not recommend this. Too strong and strange for my liking</li>
    <li> I love this spray by Lomani. It used to be one of my favorable spray and I lost site of it for many years. I&#x27;m glad I found it on here. I love it. I want to recommend this product to asll of my friends who is looking for a nice, mile and great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superslim</li>

    <li> I was given this as a gift a couple of years ago &amp; fell in love with it so I had to buy some more &amp; I&#x27;ll be a faithful customer of this cologne for yrs to come.....</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. When I first bought it, since then I have been in love with the fragnance. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different cologne for men and have settled on Lomani. I used to get my cologne from a flea market, but when I moved, I had no place to get my Lomani. I was surprised to discover that Amazon had my Lomani and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Smells good, females ask what ypu wearing</li>
    <li> Lomani could be the best bang for your buck fragrance out there. For under 10 clams you can shpritz yourself up with fabulous results. Yes, the bottle looks cheezy, but the fragrance is exceptional. What does it smell like? Some say Davidoff Cool Water, but that&#x27;s not correct. when first sprayed on it has a similar aquatic aroma but that&#x27;s only until it dries down when the other scents emerge. You will then smell something similar to Quorum. Actually it smells like a blend of 60% Quorum and 40% Cool Water. It has good longevity, it will last for hours. The projection is good. It sprays out very generously, you really don&#x27;t need as many shpritzes as with some other scents. This juice is worth risking a 10 spot. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> It is good to using for toilet. I used as an odor. Buy it if you want to waste your money..</li>
    <li> Have used Lomani in past, this is not the same. Weak and short lived. Not happy at all, stay away.</li>
    <li> Regular men&#x27;s cologne. adaptable to the price.&lt;br /&gt;men&#x27;s cologne  men&#x27;s cologne  men&#x27;s cologne  men&#x27;s cologne  men&#x27;s cologne  men&#x27;s cologne  men&#x27;s cologne</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t use anything but Lomanu</li>
    <li> Love this smell. People usually ask me for the name of cologne.</li>
    <li> Awesome price and quality</li>
    <li> Its good. I recommend it to men. Classic fragrance. I dont have 11 more words to describe it for crying out loud.</li>
    <li> The spray comes out too fast, smells good for the price, I wouldnt pay no nore than ten to fifteen dollars.</li>
    <li> Very nice cologne for the price.  Carries a very pleasant scent.  This cologne can be a nice gift at low cost.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Smells great</li>
    <li> Good Daily Fragrance at the right price point.</li>
    <li> Meh. Nothing special. It smells like soap.</li>
    <li> This is like what everybody else says about it....It smells good but it lasts 1 hour and.....36 minutes...!!</li>
