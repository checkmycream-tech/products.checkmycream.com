<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as crest vivid</li>
    <li> First use was unbelievable omg love it :-) :-)</li>
    <li> i receive this as sample for influenster&lt;br /&gt;its a really great product and it instantly makes ur teeth whiten and it has a good after smell.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this free from Influenster for product review purposes and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! Teeth whiting has always been something in the back of my mind to try and I was excited to try. I saw results after the first use. I&#x27;m on week 1 of using this as my normal routine tooth paste and the results are surprising, I&#x27;ve seen about a 1-1.5 shade difference. Not sure how they do it, but this is magic.</li>
    <li> I recently received my LUSTER Premium Whitening toothpaste from Influenster! (Influenster gave this toothpaste to me complimentary for testing and review purposes.) It lives up to its hype for being an Allure award winner! It really whitens your teeth without having to use strips!</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste through Influenster to try and review. I really enjoyed this toothpaste. It seemed to whiten way more than say the Crest whitening toothpaste. I really like how the toothpaste foams up all pretty blue. lol It doesn&#x27;t taste horrible and I still feel clean after I brush.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product complimentary of @influenster for testing and reviewing purposes! I had never heard of this brand of toothpaste and honestly I would have probably never picked it up in the drug/grocery stores. I am so happy that I was able to test this toothpaste out. It works pretty good as a whitener, although you have to continuously use this product to maintain a lighter shade on your teeth. It has a minty flavor, one that is not overwhelming or too strong, it is about 6.99-7.99 in drugstores. So super affordable! It is slightly foamy but I do not find that offensive like a few of the other reviews. Honestly I used to be a smoker, am currently an avid coffee drinker and a lover of dark sodas. After using this product just 3 times I could clearly see that my teeth are a few shades whiter! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product to test out from Influenster, I have to say that I am loving it. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and have seen a significant change in the apperence of how white my teeth are. I also like the light mint flavor, the one thing I do not like this stuff is really foamy, I mean like you look like a rabid animal while brushing but I guess that helps it it get into all the little small cracks and crevices between your teeth. I also like how it has gradually whitened my teeth with each use so that there is not a fast dramatic difference that everyone notices right away. Great Product over all and I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the best!! My teeth were so white after one use:) Removes stains. Doesn&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive. Expensive but worth it. Thank Influenster for the product.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste is amazing! tastes great, leaves and amazing clean feeling in your mouth and does make your teeth look noticeably white and clean!&lt;br /&gt;i hav only used it a handfull of times but my teeth are already whiter and i find myself smiling more just to show off my new teeth :)</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive teeth-gum issues &amp; rarely get to use whitening products b/c of the sensitivity issues but Luster did not phase my gums but was more gentle than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve used before but whitens super fast &amp; very efficiently..I rcommend it for all ages &amp; anyone :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually go for the whole teeth whitening stuff but I was giving the opportunity to try this product out and I love it! Not only does it brighten your teeth with consistent use (and yes you&#x27;ll notice even an extra sparkle on your first use) but it&#x27;s also very refreshing and leaves no bad after taste like most whitening products tend to do. It wasn&#x27;t harsh and worked great on my sensitive teeth :) enjoy!</li>
    <li> I received this Luster NOW toothpaste complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. I really like it as a fast whitening option. I use it after meals and after drinking red wine or coffee and it really makes a difference in the shade of my teeth. This isn&#x27;t a permanent whitener, so you have to use it regularly to keep teeth looking white. It also has a nice light mint flavor and no weird aftertaste. I don&#x27;t think its meant to be your primary toothpaste (I don&#x27;t feel that it does the best job of cleaning or plaque removal) So I use it in conjunction with my regular paste. Overall, I am happy with it and look forward to trying other (more long lasting forms) of whitening from Luster!</li>
    <li> My friend is getting married and I am a bridesmaid in the wedding. My teeth have never been bad with staining but not the best either. I used Luster TWICE and noticed a huge difference. I even got my husband to use and he has noticed a difference in his teeth too. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this toothpaste to try, 100% free. But now that I&#x27;ve got to try it, it is my next toothpaste purchase! I have sensitive teeth as is, and usually when I use any type of whitening product my teeth get even more sensitive... but not with Luster Premium Whitening Toothpaste!!! My teeth feel clean, are starting to whiten... and how can you not love a flavor called Happy Mint?!</li>
    <li> i had been using whitening strips but those got to hurting my gums pretty badly and making my teeth intensely sensitive, but this toothpaste i tell you is a treasure must have. I got it complimentary via Influenster in a voxbox and i have been using it day and night. i am addicted is a better way of putting it. i love it, has made my teeth visibly whiter without aching gums or sensitivity and also it does not break the bank. recommend 100 percent of the way!</li>
    <li> i love the luster now toothpaste it made my teeth turn white in just 2 daysi thought it was gonna take atleast 2 weeks to become pure white but it only took two days awesome stuff i love it</li>
    <li> ***received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.***&lt;br /&gt;Before Influenster I had never heard of this product, but boy was I happy when I tried it! This product tastes great and makes my breath smell amazing and its very reasonably priced. I was skeptical at first because some whitening products in the past have caused gum sensitivity for me but this did NOT I will continue to buy this and recommend to people in the walmart ISLE.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference after, about, one week. Tastes lovely, foams well, and WORKS! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> Awesome. Keeps My Teeth nice and White. I recommend this product to others. A little pricey but it really works</li>
    <li> Infulenster sent me this toothpaste. I never thought I&#x27;d stray from my current brand, but wow, this stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It foams up and makes your whole mouth feel super clean. The whitening was a plus! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! Super foamy and leaves an awesome minty after taste! I seen a difference within a week an my teeth keep getting whiter !</li>
    <li> I loved the Luster toothpaste!  It really does work wonders on your teeth!  Everyone should give it a try!  It lathers nicely and really does leave your teeth sparkling white!</li>
    <li> Though I was given this product complimentary for testing, I continue to reach for it in place of my other tubes. You will definitely see an instant difference after just one use but not suffer from sore gums or sensitive teeth as is typical with harsher products.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it whitens without being too harsh. It doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and I really love that! Also it doesn&#x27;t taste bad like most whitening products!!</li>
    <li> I received this in my #IDoVoxBox for free from influenster. I have used several whitening products and none of them have worked like this one does. I instantly noticed a difference in my teeth. Slowly(but not too slowly) my teeth are getting whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I love the taste of the toothpaste. It&#x27;s a nice minty taste. The toothpaste is a bright blue color that shows on your teeth while your brushing so you are able to see what you&#x27;re brushing and know what teeth you missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. My teeth looked instantly whiter and it taste amazing. This has my vote for sure. Amazing</li>
    <li> This is really great when you want a more gentle way of whitening your teeth. I didn&#x27;t find it to be instant but after a brushing with it a few times, it seemed to have taken a shade or two whiter. I really like that it&#x27;s gradual. One concern is that obviously it does not claim for this to replace your daily toothpaste. Meaning, it doesn&#x27;t prevent gingivitis, help with sensitive teeth, etc. That&#x27;s a concern with me since I do have a sensitive tooth and I have a horrible habit of not flossing daily. My teeth need all the help they can get as far as staying healthy. So this is good only when you need to give your teeth that extra boost of whiteness for a special occasion.</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster to try and I really like it. It comes out super blue (which made me a bit hesitant at first) and really foams up well. Nice minty taste and I do feel it whitens, though I didn&#x27;t notice a drastic/instant change after the first use. But overall it is a great toothpaste and does whiten. Would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received Luster whitening toothpaste complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great whitening toothpaste because it is not as troublesome as whitening strips or the whitening trays.&lt;br /&gt;I found that the toothpaste foams, which I like and I didn&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product. The paste is blue seemed intimidating at first, but as long as you wash really well you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I could try the product.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to test by Influenster. I have sensitive teeth and whitening products usually leave my mouth very achy, but this toothpaste has not only been effective at whitening my teeth, my teeth don&#x27;t hurt! Even after daily use for two weeks, my teeth aren&#x27;t showing sensitivity (more than usual). I would recommend this for those who are weary of whitening strips, etc.</li>
    <li> I love the way this toothpast foams up in your mouth. My mouth and teeth do feel nice and clean, I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of the taste. It has more of a Pepto-bismol taste to it. Also, the product s... seems to stick to my tongue quite a bit. I feel like I have to rise over and over again to get all of the toothpaste out of my mouth. I&#x27;m also not a fan of the screw on top. As far as whitening, I have a fake tooth in the front and I can tell after the very first brushing that my teeth were whiter because my fake tooth stood out. By the end of the day the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; had faded and my teeth matched again. I&#x27;m on day 3 now and it&#x27;s been the same result each time. This product is more of a temporary whitening.</li>
    <li> This product really made my teeth instantly whiter. I definitely recommend this toothpaste for anyone with stained teeth. This also doesn&#x27;t hurt people with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I loved this tooth paste it did whitten my teeth and my hubbys only set back is that i dont like the fact that its not minty enough but that is easily remided with mouthwash .</li>
    <li> Tried Luster whitening toothpaste free through Influenster and the product works pretty good. Used it a couple days before my wedding and it worked a little better than other stuff I tried</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of whitening toothpastes on the market and was happy when I received a complimentary tube of it from Influenster recently. I love being able to try products out for free first as to not waste money in case they are not to my satisfaction. In this case, I was pleasantly surprised! The toothpaste worked fairly quickly to brighten/freshen up my smile! I am curious to see how my mouth looks and feels after a few weeks of use!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Luster Now! Ever since I have been using it my teeth feel whiter and cleaner! I also love the taste of it!</li>
    <li> I received this tooth paste from influenster in the something blue vox box and its does help to whitening teeth . I dint like the after taste I get in my mouth after I brushed  my teeth . I will give it another try and reconsider my thoughts on this product.</li>
    <li> So, I got to try this product courtesy of Influenster. I was skeptical at first, but now I am a believer! My teeth are whiter and brigher! And better yet, they feel clean! Love it!</li>
    <li> After being a hardcore tea drinker for many  years my teeth were looking stained and dull but after using Luster for a few weeks now my teeth are brighter and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I received Luster Now free as a product test through Influenster.com, the difference in my teeth since I have been using this toothpaste is amazing. The taste is great, not overly minty like most other whitening toothpastes. I totally recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have honestly seen some great results since using this toothpaste !! AND it doesn&#x27;t taste like poop like whitening toothpastes usually do. Will be purchasing this again soon .</li>
    <li> Of course with any new product that claims it is INSTANT, I was skeptical, but as soon as I rec&#x27;d my sample of the Luster NOW! Whitening Toothpaste I opened it and tried it right away!! To my surprise I definitely noticed a difference after just ONE use!! It was great!! I continue to use this toothpaste everyday! Thank you Luster!!!</li>
    <li> I received the LUSTER Premium Whitening toothpaste from Influenster for free to try. I have been using it every day and it definitely makes my teeth a lot whiter. My teeth were actually whiter after the first use. The color of the toothpaste is blue and has a minty taste.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free through Influenster and really liked the results. I felt like my tooth looked whiter immediately and my teeth didnt feel sensitive as they have with other whitening products.</li>
    <li> I received this free from Influenster a few weeks ago. OMG AMAZING. I LOVE it. My teeth are shades whiter then before. I was able to see the change after the FIRST USE. Well worth trying it. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from influenter&#x27;s voxbox. They called the box the \\&quot;Something Blue\\&quot; box and when I opened this toothpaste I could see why; the toothpaste itself is a smurf blue, but that is what helps whiten your teeth. I noticed a difference after the second day of using it, but thought it was just me. I recently had my teeth cleaned though, and the dental hygienist asked me if I&#x27;d been using white strips or something because my teeth seemed brighter. I am very happy with this, when my sample runs out I will most certainly repurchase.</li>
    <li> I recieved this free For Review from influenster. I do however truely like it &amp; can see a signifi,ant difference after only a week. So glad i got this so i now can buy more For continued use. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste for two weeks and have seen significant improvement in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are my teeth looking a little whiter but they also feel cleaner than when I use normal toothpaste like Colgate, crest, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While after two weeks they aren&#x27;t as white as I would like them I did notice significant improvement.</li>
    <li> I received products complimentary and I loved my luster white toothpaste. i really saw a difference after the first few uses. i will continue to use the product. thank you @influenster</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!!!  I was afraid that it was going to be disgusting and leave my mouth tasting horrible but it did not at all.  I love the taste and how clean it made my teeth feel.  I truly saw whitening results after my first use.  I WILL be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I revived a bottle of luster now from influnster to try out. I had not heard of this product proir to this so I was a little skeptical but even after the first week of using it I could definitely see a difference. I will continue to use this until its gone so I can see the full results but I am pretty positive it will just keep working better.</li>
    <li> I received this in my #idovoxbox free from influenster and I truly LOVE it!! Great whitening toothpaste. The taste is pleasant and i love the blue color. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I received the Luster NOW! toothpaste through Influenster and am happy to say that it really does give instant results. Don&#x27;t expect to get a dramatic difference, but for some extra brightness and a clean, minty taste, definitely give this a shot!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste lives up to its name i could see my teeth getting whiter. Not a tremondous difference on first time so keep brushing it does work &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This product is affordable and really works. My teeth are not sore or sensitive after using this product at all. I would highly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> i love the taste that it has, the minti is not that strong to use and the result of it after few weeks is amazing . i love the texture and the bottle is amazing how you can se the result when you keep using it. i change my paste to luster and trust me to change something i use is hard to do . thank you for existing</li>
    <li> I am in love with this toothpaste! I received my first tube from Influenster in the IDOVoxBox and I will definitely be purchasing some more! It whitens your teeth really well!</li>
    <li> I received this product from Influenster to try out for free, and it was great timing! I was in need of a good new toothpaste that focused on whitening. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I got it (so about two weeks now) and i&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference! I brush my teeth twice a day with this toothpaste, once in the morning once at night before bed. My teeth have become whiter since i&#x27;ve been using this, my only problem was that it didn&#x27;t really leave a super minty feeling in my mouth like other toothpastes, I still felt the clean feeling just not that minty feeling that makes drinking orange juice a bad decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will definitely purchase this product once my free sample is all used up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally thanking Influenster and LUSTER Premium Whitening for my white teeth right now! After switching to an all natural toothpaste, my teeth immediately were not as white as they once were due to the extreme amounts of coffee I drink a day. I love this sample, I just wish it didn&#x27;t have blue dye in it :(. Otherwise, thanks for giving me my white teeth back! I also loved that it started working after one day :)</li>
    <li> I was sent this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes. I have to say, I was very doubtful to their claim of seeing results right away since I have tried a lot of the whiting toothpastes and other products out there. I will no longer be buying anything else! This stuff is great and has a great taste. It is no where near chalky or gross like some others that I have tried. I found my winner and hope it works just as well for you as it did for me!</li>
    <li> I like the Luster tooth paste is helps make up teeth white after each use so that way I can have a quick tooth whitten when i need them to be white without having to spend hours or weeks doing it.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. On the first day of using this product I liked it due to the noticeable difference in my teeth and the fresh minty breath.  I am going to buy this product independently but what they could do to expand the brand is to create a formula for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I got this from Influenster and I love this so much! Instant whitening but this is very safe for daily use!</li>
    <li> THis is by far one of the best whitening toothpastes on the market. I loved the taste and how it foams. I definitely saw a difference in my teeth after one use. Will absolutely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this toothpaste. I was able to test it and review it. It made my teeth look whiter and also seemed to foam up really well.</li>
    <li> I received this for free to try from Influenster and my whole family loves it! Big difference in just one use. But be sure you rinse all the blue out of your mouth before you go out. haha.</li>
    <li> I love luster whitening tooth paste.  Just after one use my teeth are considerably whiter!  Its amazing and great priced too!!</li>
    <li> This is a great whitening paste love it. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried and will prolly be the last. Again taste great and works great</li>
    <li> Luster Now Instant Whitening Toothpaste is the easiest, most pleasant way to maintain a healthy white smile. I used to be someone who used Crest White Strips to maintain a white smile, but my sensitive teeth were not having it. I use Luster Now! once a day for one of my teeth-brushings, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the whitening of my teeth, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with annoying strips. LOVE this product, will continue to use this product for a white smile.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a toothpaste to keep your smile white, then you might want to try this toothpaste. It claims to give you an instant white smile after one brushing but I am not sure about that claim, I guess it just depends on how stained your teeth are. This does clean well but doesn&#x27;t have that minty feel. I like to use this with my other toothpastes combined for a whiter, minty feel. If you are looking for a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have that minty feel, you would definitely love this toothpaste. All-in-all, its a pretty good toothpaste. I would love the chance to try out Luster Now! other products! I received this Luster Now! Instant Whitening Toothpaste complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I love Luster Premium White Toothpaste, it helps whiten my teeth and leaves them feeling fresh and clean! I would definitely recommend this toothpaste to everyone! It gently whitens and leaves my teeth looking pearly white!</li>
    <li> Usually I am pretty skeptical about products that can whiten teeth. I am huge on teeth products I love my smile to be white, I&#x27;ve had them professionally whitened, I&#x27;ve used the whitening strips, special pens, other lightening tooth paste.... Anyways when I received it in the mail I had to test it out \\&quot;guaranteed whiter smile with first use\\&quot; . When you open it it&#x27;s a blue paste. Smells Minty. You do need to rinse your mouth a couple times to remove the blue from your mouth. But wow, just wow, right away I was able to notice a big difference! My teeth are super white! I have a few people compliment me on my smile now. But this product is really good I would definitely be buying this product again</li>
    <li> I received a full size of Luster NOW! from Influenster to sample and review. I have always been skeptical of \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes as I never felt they worked. However, after trying this I have changed my mind! Not only does it foam, have a strong enough mint flavor but I actually saw results! Even my fiance uses it and loves it. I can&#x27;t wait to see our sparkling smiles in our wedding photos :)</li>
    <li> I got this product for testing from Influenster and I am in LOVE with it! People have actually stopped me on the street to mention how white my teeth are - you can&#x27;t ask for better results than that! :)</li>
    <li> I tried Luster toothpaste through influenster loved it at first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were slightly whiter after the first use compared to the previous whitening tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to try it out more to see if I love the product and if it continues the whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great item for my special DAY!</li>
    <li> I like the taste of this whiting toothpaste. Has a fresh minty taste and doesn&#x27;t taste like nasty whiting like everything else on the market. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t whiten in one use like it says but after a few days I have noticed a slight whiting. Nothing drastic though but it is working slowly. We&#x27;ll see after long continues use if that helps more.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I drink at least 2 pots of coffee daily, and worse, I smoke on top of it.  I use Luster whitening, and even my children who are 19 and 21, say, Mom how are your teeth whiter than ours, not only do you drink coffee, but you smoke, and you are OLD, thanks kids!</li>
    <li> I received the Luster white toothpaste from Influenster for free for testing purposes.  I must say for the price they are offering on Amazon I would pay.  It did whiten my teeth I used it about 2 times a day. I seen results about 2 day into it.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this toothpaste in a box from Influenster, and I LOVE it. I have done many different things to try and whiten my teeth, but nothing has been as easy and affective as Luster NOW! It really does whiten your teeth almost instantly, and the taste is great. The price is a little more than I typically pay for toothpaste, but it&#x27;s totally worth it for anyone who is wanting to whiten their teeth -- and not have to pay for expensive trays or for it to be professionally done.</li>
    <li> I just recenlty started using Luster, and I can already tell a difference! i love it, and my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
    <li> When I first received Luster NOW it was part of a trial offer from Influenster.com  I tried the toothpaste anyway but had very low expectations. Boy was I wrong. This stuff actually works! Within the first week I noticed a difference and so did my fiancée. My best friend participates with Influenster and she also received Luster Now in her box. She experienced the same great results. I&#x27;m getting married in three months and will definitely make this part of my getting ready for the big day regimen. I would definetly recommend this product and I will be buying it again because I&#x27;m almost out!</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this toothpaste in a box from Influenster, and I LOVEEEE it. I have done many different things to try and whiten my teeth, but nothing has been as easy and effective as Luster NOW! It really does whiten your teeth almost instantly, and the taste is great. Its my new fave. toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I had received this through influenster and with most whitening toothpaste my teeth become very sensitive but with this toothpaste it doesnt make my teeth sensitive. i love how i can use it every day but the only thing i dont like about it is it doesnt whiten has much as other products do. this is a product i most likely wouldnt buy only because i didnt notice a difference</li>
    <li> I got this product from Influenster as a product sample and I love it! It leaves my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh and It truly does whiten your teeth which is fantastic as some other whitening toothpaste don&#x27;t actually help in this area!</li>
    <li> I received the product complimentary from Influenster, but I still wouldn&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s great unless it really is - and this IS! I am always looking for a way to get my teeth just a little whiter, but I am not interested in the full dentist treatment. This toothpaste is great! It does make my teeth clean and fresh and gives them the perfect shade of white. I love it!</li>
    <li> I normally brush with a whitening toothpaste, so I&#x27;m not sure how well Luster works in the long run...BUT it definitely brightens my smile a bit, instantly. And my favorite aspect- it&#x27;s blue! It&#x27;s nice and minty with just the right amount of foam, but the blue somehow makes it very fun. :)</li>
    <li> Luster has a great flavor for a whitening toothpaste, and it actually works, I am impressed with Luster. Ive tried many whitening toothpastes before and they have either been harsh or ineffective. This is a milder taste, and my teeth are brighter than ever!</li>
    <li> Simply LOVE the free tube of LUSTER Premium Whitening I received from Influenster in my Something Blue VoxBox! It works, but I will warn you that it creates more (blue!) foam than normal toothpastes! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. Within 3 days I noticed my teeth were a shade if not two lighter. Also it has a pleasant taste and did not make my teeth sensitive like other whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product. Seen a minor difference after one use. Major difference in more than one use. LOVE IT! Will def. repurchase!</li>
    <li> I got this item complimentary in my something blue voxbox. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, twice daily and I love it! It has replaced my normal toothpaste because not only is the flavor great and really freshens my breath, but I have noticeably whiter and cleaner teeth! When I use up this tube, I am definitely buying more! Even though it is a little more expensive than my regular toothpaste, it is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I got this amazing toothpaste in my something blue voxbox from Influenster. I really love it and will definitely buy it after this! I like how it tastes, its gentle but actually whitens. In love!</li>
    <li> Received this product from Influenster and noticed within days my teeth were more white. The tooth paste has a great taste as well, it&#x27;s not overly minty and it doesn&#x27;t taste like whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample of Luster NOW! Instant Whitening toothpaste from Influenster for testing purposes and I love this product! I noticed a difference after one use, and I have been using it ever since!  Just be warned that a little of this goes a long way. It&#x27;s super foamy.</li>
    <li> I first received this product from influenster.com completely for free. I tried it out and couldn&#x27;t believe how well it actually worked! I will definitely continue buying and using this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> For people who need instant gratification this is your toothpaste!! Results can be noticed after one use and continue with each use after., I noticed my teeth were whiter and I do not have any unpleasant sensitivity. Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I got this product compliments of Influentser! it was a great test they had even greater result. The toothpaste isn&#x27;t too strong, it has a relaxed taste and the results happen pretty fast! I really loved the product and you don&#x27;t even need to use that much so it lasts long too.</li>
    <li> Sooooo excited! This product really works, and I&#x27;m shocked! My teeth were actually whiter the very first time i used it. I drink coffee allot and to see the stains disappear made my day! *Received compliments of @influenster!</li>
    <li> This product will have your teeth looking so white, people will think you have fake teeth. LOL. I love it!</li>
    <li> Influenster send me this toothpaste to try for free , I absolutely love it great taste and just after 2or 3 brushings i noticed the difference . Overall great product</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! Worked just after the first time, it was great i had amazing white teeth after using this product</li>
    <li> So i got the Luster Now!, Instant Whitening Toothpaste and tried it a week ago... I will not use anything else now. This is one of the best toothpastes I have ever used for whitening. It tastes like any other brand, but the results being instant are true. My fiancee used to smoke and his teeth were a little yellowed but using this they were instantly shades whiter. We both use it at least once a day and intend to purchase this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I received this full sized sample from Influenster in a voxbox, complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I got this toothpaste a couple of weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve always used different whitening products so my teeth were pretty white to begin with.  I think this is the product that will really make people say \\&quot;Wow did you notice her smile?\\&quot;  Usually these product make my teeth and gums extremely sensitive but I haven&#x27;t experienced that with this product.  I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing to use it and seeing how long the results last.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times so don&#x27;t really know hoe well it will work out for me or if I will repurchase the item. However, I am currently very satisfied with the results. I love the super clean after taste.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good whitening toothpaste. It isn&#x27;t going to make your teeth WHITE in 2 uses, but it does seem to whiten them a little over the week I have been using it, and I&#x27;m sure it will improve with time. I think it is even making my Crest whitestrips more effective so I love that :) Definately worth a try if you want subtly whiter teeth, but will not give you amazing results instantly (does anything??)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1EEQMQRFB5809]]First time I used this product the taste was not bad but not great but the results are wonderful! I will be using this and would buy again.</li>
    <li> im in love with this tooth paste after about three days of using it i seen a different even my friends...</li>
    <li> I received this through Influenster.com and their voxbox program. I didn&#x27;t see INSTANT results, but after my 4th or 5th brushing I could see a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Unlike some reviews I&#x27;ve seen, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with the taste/aftertaste, but my teeth don&#x27;t feel quite as clean after brushing as they do with some other toothpastes out there. That&#x27;s the only reason I am not giving 5 stars.</li>
    <li> great product that works well, doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and doesn&#x27;t taste horrible. i plan on purchasing this product again and would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Luster NOW! is a great toothpaste. The minty freshness is great, all the while whitening your teeth!! Don&#x27;t pass it up! I received mine complementary from Influenster!!</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening toothpaste i&#x27;ve ever used! blows crest and colgate out of the water. I&#x27;ve also used rembrant vivid white and this works 10 times better! I used it before bed and again the next morning and my teeth were shades whiter when i used crest 3d white for months with no similar results. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste in my \\&quot;I do\\&quot; voxbox for influenster to test out, and I have to say it quickly became my favorite product in the box. its great for those of use with sensitive teeth that cant use the harsh whitening products out on the market. I could instantly tell my teeth were whiter after just the first use! the only thing I could complain about would be the taste its not bad but I like a strong mint taste I guess it makes me feel like my teeth are clean but this mint taste just wasn&#x27;t strong enough but I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am not really much of a believer when it comes to products that claim to work instantly, so I tried this toothpaste with a bit of skepticism.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my teeth were sparkling and white after the first shot!  The toothpaste \\&quot;lathers up\\&quot; (for lack of a better term) INCREDIBLY well, and it doesn&#x27;t have the intense, sometimes irritatingly minty strength of other toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my new favorite dental product!</li>
    <li> LIked it okay... wouldn&#x27;t pay $8 for it... got it free for testing purposes... doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth, but didn&#x27;t really whiten like I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Luster after I brush with my regular toothpaste twice a day and there is a noticeable whitening difference. The taste is nice and minty and there not weird residue or grittiness after the use. Great product for an easy going whitener.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a nice flavor and I love the concept a whitening product without destroying your enamel. However I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all. If anything it sort of makes my gums look redder which is not good! I prefer to use crest whitening stripes for better results.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste really works, I have been using it for about two weeks now and my smile has never been better.The taste is also really surprising and good!</li>
    <li> By fair the best out there whitening system ever! Works quickly and easy to use with awesome results! I have used many other whitening systems and they were messy and the results took many weeks or months and I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for high priced dentist visits for whitening results! A must have product!</li>
    <li> I recently received a complementary test sample from Influenster. The results are amazing and I saw whiter teeth in a matter of days!! I will definitely buy this product again in the near future, and i recommend this to anyone looking to get whiter teeth!</li>
    <li> I love sing Luster Now ! Instant Whitening Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;I love it because of its properties and its contents.&lt;br /&gt;It contains Bluverite, a proprietary formula that creates the optical effect of whiter teeth. Whitens teeth after just one brushing-- results last for hours&lt;br /&gt;Removes surface and deep stains with daily use&lt;br /&gt;Safe on enamel and dental restorations&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it helps boost my smile !!</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste complimentary from Influentser for testing purposes and I love it! My mouth feels so fresh after using it and my smile is visibly whiter!</li>
    <li> Luster is a blue paste that somehow provides an instantly whitened appearance to your smile. It is easy to use, does not require trays or strips, and is gentle enough to use daily. If you&#x27;re looking for a way to whiten, try Luster!</li>
    <li> I love my new LUSTER Premium Whitening Premium Whitening toothpaste that I got in Influenster.It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my mouth like other whitening products I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a difference. It&#x27;s not too minty so it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth. The blue hue of the toothpaste helps whiten my teeth. I would purchase this</li>
    <li> Influenster send me this, i like it because it didnt taste awful xD&lt;br /&gt;REALLY, most of the things that whitening tooth taste horrible. But this toothpaste taste like mentis... it reminds me of child toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now, and I&#x27;m really noticing a brighter, whiter smile!  Love the taste and the fact that I can whiten while brushing my teeth w/o any extra steps!  Thanks influenster for allowing me to try this awesome product.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes your teeth white. It worked well for the price. Using for my pre wedding routine.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I have very sensitive teeth which is usually made worse with whitening toothpastes.  Luster has not had that effect on me!  I will continue to use this product :)</li>
    <li> My smile is whiter than ever thanks to this toothpaste, I love the way it makes my teeth feel after brushing. I reccommend this to anyone that wants to whiten their teeth quickly!</li>
    <li> Unless I drink way too much coffee and wine, my teeth look the same.  :) LOL</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. I suspect the product depends on the heavy blue dye in it to counteract any yellow tint on your teeth.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have a discoloration on my teeth.  After using it twice a day for over two weeks, it didn&#x27;t make any difference, even temporarily.  Maybe it works well for the individual with coffee stains, etc., but from my experience, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> After using this product several days, I have not noticed a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. My teeth do feel cleaner, however. Jury is still out as to whether or not I would purchase this toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product - it does what it says. It has some slight blue dye that basically makes your teeth appear whiter for a set period of time. I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, and that I can brush a few times a day or right before a big event and have a bright smile.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this toothpaste from Influenster and was so happy when I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;The mint was great and so was the job it did.&lt;br /&gt;You have a new customer in me!!!</li>
    <li> I got this product from influenster, and to my believe it did not whiten my teeth! It worked on everyone in my household who started to use it. Maybe i&#x27;m just not noticing myself that my teeth did not whiten, but I guess it works!</li>
    <li> I received this tooth paste from influenster. I hate it. The packaging it wonderful but I&#x27;m not loving the product. It did not whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> The blue color of the paste really makes your teeth white, even after just one use. I got a sample of this from Influenser and I definetly will be buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> great item, instant results after the first use. also a pretty good taste too. I would recommend this to anyone who wants the results at a descent price, compared to one that costs $50.</li>
    <li> Great right before a meeting or night out. Instant results! Would be 5 stars if the results lasted longer. Non the less a great whitening maintainer.</li>
    <li> Don &#x27;t waste your money.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my teeth.  Save your money and go to your dentist&lt;br /&gt;and get their bleaching product.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great! I love the way it makes my teeth feel and look after one use. I like the taste of it also. It&#x27;s not too harsh. It made my breath smell great, my teeth look whiter, and my teeth feel a lot cleaner then most of these other whitening tooth pastes that are out there now a days. I highly recommend trying this brand out if you are looking for  good whitening tooth paste for a good price! I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite toothpaste due to the taste and texture, but I like the packaging and ease of use of the product!</li>
    <li> I definitely saw results with the first few uses. Maybe because of the bold color the actual toothpaste is? Who knows but I did see a difference but overall it wasn&#x27;t a drastic change.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and have been using it for over a month now.  It&#x27;s flavor is okay and sees to clean my teeth well, but I have not seen one change in the whiteness of my teeth.  It&#x27;s expensive.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work,should have known better!</li>
    <li> Funtcional, but not as powerful as described in ad</li>
    <li> No different from any other whitening toothpaste.  Nothing wrong with it, just meh.</li>
    <li> I received Luster from Influenster, and I fell in love with this toothpaste. In a previous box, I am received the optic white system from colgate. I ended up liking that toothpaste, but now I have switched to a Luster girl, although I still use the Optic White powered toothbrush! I really love how the toothpaste tastes, I am typically very picky about that feature.  I would definately recommend this product, as when I run out, I plan on purchasing more!  The product actually won the 2011 breakout award from allure!  Ever heard of any other toothpaste winning an award, I think not.</li>
    <li> The blue tint in this product really does instantly whiten your teeth.  However, it fades very quickly.  I use it when I need to make a great first impression!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, the blue color was a bit of a surprise to me - but to my surprise, it didn&#x27;t leave my teeth or mouth blue! In fact, after 3 weeks of using this product daily, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve noticed a whiter smile!</li>
    <li> It works great. I love it!! It does make my teeth white instantly. The taste isn&#x27;t so good but the results work. I am still using it everyday.</li>
    <li> PROS: Taste, Flavor, Bright Blue Color, Instant Whitening&lt;br /&gt;CONS: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great whitening, awesome flavor, shocking blue colored toothpaste is pretty awesome! Great for instant whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received this item complimentary via influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> Luster NOW! Instant Whitening Toothpaste is just that; it instantly whitening and has a surprisingly pleasant minty taste and perfectly gritty texture. This toothpaste is great as a quick fix.</li>
    <li> I think this is an average toothpaste I would repurchase but so far haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my teeth shade</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using teeth whitening strips but sometimes they take a bit longer than I would like for whiter teeth. Luckily, I found a product that will whiten your teeth with just one brushing. It has a pleasant taste and lasts for hours until you need to brush again. When I&#x27;m in a hurry and want whiter teeth I use Luster NOW! Instant Whitening Toothpaste. Thanks to Influenster, I was able to test and review this product in my complimentary Something Blue VoxBox!</li>
    <li> I received this as a complimentary product from Influenster to test and review. As far as whitening goes, it&#x27;s so-so.  Maybe after several weeks it will make a difference, but it&#x27;s not a shocking WOW the first time you try it.  Some whitening toothpastes have a blah kind of taste to them, that doesn&#x27;t really leave your breath/mouth feeling fresh &amp; clean.  But the Luster NOW does have a fresh kind of minty taste, so that is definitely a plus!</li>
    <li> I am very dissatisfied with this toothpaste.  It made my teeth extremely sensitive and painful.  It wasn&#x27;t the normal sensitivity from some whitening toothpaste.  It felt like I needed a root canal and I almost went to the dentist because I was in so much pain.  It sounds like that many other people did not have the same experiences as me but you can never be too safe.  I will never be buying any Luster product again.</li>
    <li> The blue color of the paste really makes your teeth white, even after just one use. I got a sample of this from Influenster. I definitely will be buying it in the future and the price is just right for the product.</li>
    <li> I receive a complimentary full size bottle of the Luster Now toothpaste from Influenster to test and review. The toothpaste has good flavor, but I haven&#x27;t really seen any results from the toothpaste yet. My teeth still look the same as they did before.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works great and isn&#x27;t harsh on sensitive teeth, as so many whitening toothpastes are. I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have veneers and I was a little worried how this product would work on them. It still did the job just fine. I did notice a small difference in the whiteness of my teeth for a few hours, although it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others said that their&#x27;s did. The taste and smell were great, I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I normally just buy whatever tooth paste that&#x27;s on sale. I have now found my new favorite tooth paste! Best product there is!</li>
    <li> So I received this toothpaste in the mail through Influenster to try and it made claims of being instant whitening. To this, I was really skeptical, but I gave it a go. And, man was I surprised. It honestly lived up to and surpassed my expectations. By like.... Miles. I honestly at first thought it was just an overpriced scam seeing as how it claimed to use that blue whitening technology. I was like \\&quot;psh\\&quot;. Mind you this toothpaste is neon blue. Thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t stain your teeth. The best part about it, though, is I can use it everyday. It&#x27;s safe on my enamel and doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity. Seriously. Smokers and coffee heads, this one is for YOU! Check it out at [...]</li>
    <li> I received a full-sized tube free from Influenster.  I was skeptical but have seen results and quickly.  No sensitivity, no extra time with strips.  All you have to do is brush!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and usually have a hard time with any toothpaste with whitening agents. Not with Luster! I have found my toothpaste for life!</li>
    <li> I received a free full sized sample of Luster White toothpaste from Influenster/ Voxbox. It is an excellent product! There&#x27;s a noticable difference after using this product!! Though the price is a little high for toothpaste, it is worth paying the money for a product that works!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste really works. Every now and then, I&#x27;ll use Crest Whitestrips to brighten up my teeth, but you don&#x27;t need to if you use this toothpaste. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> The tube is almost gone and I use it twice daily. I really don&#x27;t see any difference, but I suppose I&#x27;ll never get &amp;#34;actor white&amp;#34; teeth without veneers.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and will do so with continuous use. I would recommend it and I would order it again.</li>
    <li> It is an ok toothpaste. I finished a tube and my teeth are no whiter really.  I can get a toothpaste in the grocery store for 1/2 the price and no shipping cost. The active ingredient that whitens teeth is 3/4 of the way down in the list of ingredients.  Use baking soda ans hydrogen peroxide for tooth whitening and save your money.</li>
    <li> I work in development at a dental school and always use this toothpaste before any event. I have gotten many compliments on my teeth and have this and the other Luster toothpaste (in the red tube) to thank for my teeth! I&#x27;ve actually had a few dentists who have asked who does my zoom! whitening. SO MUCH CHEAPER! :)</li>
    <li> I got this item for free from Influenster in order to review this product. Over all it was a pretty good experience. I saw a small difference in the whiteness of my teeth and it had a good taste to it. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;re trying to whiten your teeth quickly and inexpensively.</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste from Influenster.com for testing purposes.  I really liked it. The taste is mild and doesn&#x27;t linger after you brush or make anything you eat or drink taste bad right after brushing. It also doesn&#x27;t have that bad gritty sand like feel to it as badly as regular toothpaste.  It&#x27;s thinner and just feels better in your mouth. I wish it whitened a little bit faster maybe, but maybe i&#x27;m being greedy?</li>
    <li> I was able to try the toothpaste via my voxbox from influenster and absolutely love it! I will definitely continue to purchase and use this! I see great results from daily use!! recommend!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the directions scare you. I am actually surprised on how well this product works. I am going to feature this as a product on blog soon.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more excited waiting for this to arrive, and then couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed with what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea what happy mint is, but this tasted like liquorice... my LEAST favorite taste in toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides horrid (and way too mild to make your breath smell better) taste, it also felt horrid in my mouth. It foamed like crazy making me spit multiple times (which is fine but we&#x27;re talking mouth-fulls). My teeth barely felt washed even after prolonged sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, no thanks.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! It definitely works which is awesome! But it may have made my teeth kind of hurt! I stopped using everyday and went to every couple days. I thought the taste was strong but I liked it!</li>
    <li> I received the product from the influenster voxbox and tried it out for a week before my wedding. It was a nice toothpaste, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it as my whitening agent. It had a pleasant taste and didn&#x27;t burn. Plus it left me with a clean feeling. Can&#x27;t ask for more. If you need teeth whitened I would suggest something more than toothpaste (I think it&#x27;s about on par with others in drugstores as far as whitening power goes).</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think I was going to notice a difference but I totally could&lt;br /&gt;Tell! I wish the paste wasn&#x27;t so grainy but otherwise the flavor isn&#x27;t bad and the results are&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste really does work well to brighten your smile! It works pretty fast too so it&#x27;s good if you have an event that&#x27;s coming up soon!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster I was able to test this product for free! I love my newly whitened teeth, so a big thanks to Luster Now! for making a great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product it done a great job whitening my teeth and saw fast results. The taste is not amazing but it&#x27;s fair</li>
    <li> Loved this product. I would definitely recommend this product.  Nice minty ice flavor and noticeably whiter teeth in just days with NO tooth sensitivity...</li>
    <li> I love how this whitened my teeth! I will continue to use this product! I received a sample from influenster.</li>
    <li> BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER. Saw results after 3 days! Can&#x27;t find this brand in stores anymore so have to order it online but well worth it!</li>
    <li> So excited by the easy nature of this product.  Just refresh your smile before that big event.  Makes teeth nice and sparkly.</li>
    <li> You will see instant results using this! My teeth seemed much brighter after brushing with LusterNOW! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Tastes like normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a light coating of blue toothpaste on your teeth, that causes an optical illusion. . . that makes your teeth appear noticeably whiter (instantly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last for a few hours.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. I&#x27;m not blinded by dazzling smile after every brush but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and can see a difference.  I&#x27;m a coffee drinker, having a tinge to my teeth had just become part of my life. Luster NOW seems to be keeping that nasty tinge at bay. Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that. Oh, it doesn&#x27;t taste disgusting either, BONUS!</li>
    <li> This product is great for touch up between whitening and for everyday use. You do see whiter teeth right after you brush. Its an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I received this from the Something Blue Vox Box from Influenster and I love it!  It tastes great and my teeth did start to look brighter after a few uses!</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste as a sample on an influenster box and i realy like the results it has significantly whiten my teeth in just one week use. The only thing i kind of did not like was the taste and after taste it left but using mouth wash after solves that problem.  I will definatly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received this for being a part of influenster.  My teeth feel so clean and look white!  Love it.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Luster whitening tooth paste is a great product. Whitens quick, tastes great and does not leave teeth sensitive. I will be buying this product again soon</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Tastes just like the colgate I have used. I wouldn&#x27;t order agin.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothpaste thanks to a sample from Influenster, it did not give me the whitening results I expected. It tasted minty but not too powerful. It was also very foamy so make sure you are over your sink!!</li>
    <li> Received this for testing purposes and complimentary from influesnter.com. It was my favorite thing in my voxbox and I was very surprised. I love it! I like the taste very much (and the color) and the results were noticeable the first time. I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change lately.</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me a sample of this in the Something Blue Vox Box (#idovoxbox)‬. At first, I was hesitant to try this product, due to hearing that any whitening product can damage your teeth. After reading more about Luster, I decided to give it a go. Boy am I glad I did! I love this! I saw a big difference within a couple of days! I highly recommend this product to anyone! Easy to use and works wonderfully! ♥</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me this in my Something Blue Voxbox. It was wonderful! It didn&#x27;t whiten in one use, but after 2 or 3 my teeth were whiter than they have ever been!</li>
    <li> Luster NOW is a food dye. That&#x27;s it. FD&amp;C Blue dye No. 1 works as an optical brightener — especially in sunlight and in nightclub situations where there is likely to be more UV-heavy light. So it&#x27;s okay for a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it would be mistake to make this your regular toothpaste. There is no flouride content at all. AND FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 can cause skin discoloration and worse. Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend limits on daily intake of FD&amp;C 1.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE MINTY TOOTHPASTE ! IT REALLY DOES WORK WITH WHITENING MY TEETH. ITS THE ONLT TOOTH PASTE I USE NOW.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly I really like this toothpaste. I absolutely hate the taste of most toothpaste, but I don&#x27;t think this one is too bad. The taste is not over powering at all. It does seem to whiten my teeth a little bit. However, my teeth are slightly blue for a couple of minutes after brushing my teeth, but it does go away! I would probably recommend this to a friend who is looking to do a little whitening!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. The packaging is cool so it drew my attention. But I didn&#x27;t like the nickelodeon blue color of the toothpaste nor did I like the sweetness of the product. I also didn&#x27;t think it whitened my teeth any more than baking soda would.</li>
    <li> This really does brighten your teeth after one use. I used it for a month straight and my teeth are a lot whiter than they were before!! The toothpaste is a bright blue color, but doesn&#x27;t stain the teeth. It has a slight minty taste, but not super strong. Try it out!</li>
    <li> I received this item complimentary from Influenster. As the only full size product included in the VoxBox, I was really disappointed once I figured out what this toothpaste was all about. This toothpaste is BS. It&#x27;s a gimmick and I really hate when companies do this. There is no hydrogen peroxide in this toothpaste or even sodium tripolyphosphate. Their patented \\&quot;Bluverite\\&quot; technology is nothing more than a temporary bluing agent. Or, more frankly, a subtle blue dye that does nothing except tint your teeth slightly blue so they appear whiter for a set period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally. That&#x27;s all it does. Definitely would not purchase this of my own volition.</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste through influenster. I was a little sketchy on using it, but once I tried it, I was really impressed. I noticed the whitening right away, but if you&#x27;re using this for your morning toothpaste, have some mouthwash handy. It doesn&#x27;t really have the freshening aspect.</li>
    <li> i got this product from influenster... has made my teeth more white but i do NOT like the taste of it :( glad i try it</li>
    <li> After using the product consistently I started to see a change in the whiteness of my teeth. It feels and tastes like any other toothpaste. Thanks Influenster for sending me the product to sample.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I definitely saw quick results, quicker than the other whitening toothpastes.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the flavor.  I really expected the toothpaste to have a more minty flavor.  Other than that, I liked it.</li>
    <li> My favorite part of this product hands down is the fast results. It really does whiten your teeth immediately. I started using a few days before a big company event and i saw results, i felt extremely confident after using this toothpaste. This is a must have and a definite repurchase.</li>
    <li> I received this thanks to influenster and have to say I saw results after the first use and used it every am.  I have noticed such a huge difference, I use to be a smoker and always use whitening tooth pastes and even kits never saw such amazing difference and so fast.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month now, and have definitely seen a difference.  My teeth look whiter at least by 2-3 shades.  I liked that it didn&#x27;t cause any teeth sensitivity.  The flavor is called \\&quot;Happy Mint\\&quot; and it really tastes good. It tastes like a good stick of gum.  The paste is a bright blue so it forced me to brush longer and rinse additional times to remove the color from my mouth.  I felt minty clean after using the product.  I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I noticed results immediately after using this toothpaste. It&#x27;s a little more than I&#x27;d like to spend on a toothpaste but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love whitening toothpastes and I&#x27;m always looking for the new \\&quot;it\\&quot; product. I received Luster NOW! Instant whitening toothpaste in my Influenster Voxbox. I love this toothpaste now! The mint-y-ness is just about right, and it did not cause sensitivity! Sensitivity is definitely what is most important to me, next to how well the product works. This product, definitely helped whiten my teeth. My teeth were already pretty white, but this gave me that little extra push that I feel my other tooth paste was lacking. This is definitely one of my new favorite whitening products and I am so happy to be able to share my experience with others, especially my family and friends that are always commenting how white my teeth are now!</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS.  I SAW THIS ON WENDY WILLIAMS, AND I GAVE IT A TRY.  IT DOES MAKE MY TEETH WHITE, BUT NOT AS WHITE AS A PROFESSIONAL WHITENING, BUT VERY NOTICEABLE.</li>
    <li> No doubt about it, use this every day along with normal toothpaste and your teeth WILL be white. This product is not a rip-off.</li>
    <li> All these items were great!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this toothpaste! After the second use I noticed my teeth were whiter. After about 3 days of using it two-three times daily and leaving it on for about 3 minutes each time my teeth are a LOT whiter!! I&#x27;ve always drank a lot of coffee and tea and I felt my teeth were starting to get pretty stained. I&#x27;m so happy with the results now. Inexpensive and easy way to whiten your teeth:)</li>

    <li> Kind of harsh. Good to use once a week.</li>
    <li> I did not see much difference between this toothpaste and other whitening toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Tastes awful does nothing</li>
    <li> This stuff actually whitens your teeth several shades with no sensitivity like the strips.  Not only that, but it tastes great!  This is my go to toothpaste from now on!</li>
    <li> I got this from Influenster for testing purposes and I love it. My teeth were instantly whiter! I will use it more i plan on being a repeat customer</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from Influenster for testing purposes and really like it. It&#x27;s like a pick me up for your teeth. THe results are pretty apparent and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to achieve results!</li>
    <li> This product that I received from Influenster is magical. I have already started seeing results within the first week. Just wait till my wedding day! I&#x27;ll have the brightest whitest smile around!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and it actually works fantastic. The color is a BRIGHT blue, the mint taste is very subtle (not over powering), and it whitens very quickly. I was pleased with this brand.</li>
    <li> I received LusterNow in my Something Blue VoxBox from Influenster.  I love it.  It worked super fast.  I was skeptical at first, but after my 3rd use, I really could tell a difference.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The first thing I love about this toothpaste is I experience no sensitivity while using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the affordability of this product.  I see progress if whiter teeth over time.  It&#x27;s defiantly works over time and I totally recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great gentle yet effective!</li>
    <li> I received this whitening toothpaste in my Influenster Voxbx complimentary to try.  I noticed instant results after its first use and I am very pleased.  I will deifnitely purchase this paste in the future.  It is very affordable and you dont have to wait for the results.</li>
    <li> I got my Luster Instant whitening toothpaste with my influenster voxbox. I am loving how it taste, how quick it is, and how it is actually working. It has wonderful taste, which makes me want to brush my teeth more then once, just to get the taste, I have noticed my teeth whiting after three uses. I will be buying this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this product free in an Influenster box and I was extremely pleased with the results. I only had to use it once or twice before I noticed a big difference in the color of my teeth. I was extremely skeptical, but it really does give you instant results. I can&#x27;t wait to see what kind of results I get after using it for several weeks!</li>
    <li> I received this for review from Influenster, and I was skeptical when I first saw it. I attempt to use whitening toothpastes every few months, but typically have to quit after a few days because my teeth grow intolerably sensitive. So when this toothpaste promised not to leave my teeth sensitive, I thought to myself, \\&quot;Yeah, right.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, that was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor of this toothpaste is fresh but not overpowering. The fresh feeling lingers but you don&#x27;t taste the mint hours and hours later. Be careful getting it on your gums because it has a tendency to bleach them slightly, but otherwise I have finally found a whitening toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t make my poor teeth hurt. I have been using this for a little over two weeks and have noticed a lasting change in the whiteness of my teeth. The product has a blue tint to it that helps your teeth appear whiter immediately, but it does wear off after a few hours. I plan to repurchase this after I am done with my current tube.</li>
    <li> Definately worth buying for the price, fast results for just a tooth paste! I&#x27;ve tried a couple other products that work but do get really spendy after a while so this will be my go to product now !</li>
    <li> About time they make a tooth whitening product that&#x27;s instant! So simple to use- this toothpaste is great! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste makes you appear you have whiter teeth and it works and i like it. Great new product to discover and try.</li>
    <li> Through Influenster, we received this item as a promo item. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my teeth look extremely white. Every time I view myself in the mirror, I cannot believe that my teeth are \\&quot;that\\&quot; white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely sure if my teeth are actually white if I stop using it, but this product is amazing. I love the soft minty feeling. My teeth are extremely sensitive, but this toothpaste does not irritate my teeth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Receiving as a promo item does not effect my view of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product if you have a huge day coming up (wedding, prom, photoshoot. etc) and do not like using trays. Anytime I bleach my teeth, they always hurt and become extremely sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of weeks and it works.  It taste good and does what it says it will.  I think everyone should use this you will see a difference.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works amazingly well. I have noticed my teeth have gotten a little whiter since using it and my Husband noticed after one use on his own teeth. We both love this toothpaste now. I feel like you only need a little bit and your all mouth gets a nice clean feeling. I recommend it. I have received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster, but that does not alter what I think of this product. Im not getting paid from giving a good review this is my honest opinion</li>
    <li> This stuff has a great flavour, which is rare for a whitening toothpaste. After one use I noticed instant more white teeth. I really love this stuff and will be purchasing it a lot more in the future.</li>
    <li> Blinded by the Light!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, maybe that&#x27;s overstating things, but wowzers, am I a fan of Luster Premium White&#x27;s Luster Now! Instant Whitening Toothpaste! Influenster sent me this little treat as part of their Something Blue \\&quot;I Do\\&quot; VoxBox. An Allure Beauty Expert 2011 Breakthrough Award winner, Luster promises whiter teeth in just one brushing, thanks to their proprietary Bluverite technology. Whosajiggawhaaa? Whatchoo talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout, Willis? Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluverite technology was developed by dentists to give the optical effect of whiter teeth instantly. It works by subtly tinting your teeth for instant gratification without the crippling tooth sensitivity sometimes associated with other \\&quot;instant\\&quot; whitening products, and with no risk to your enamel or gums. And the effect will last for hours! All that plus fresh breath and cavity protection! Dy-No-Mite!. One word of warning: If you do over-use this product (as Hubby did), there is a chance you&#x27;ll start to see a slight blue hue on your gums and in between your teeth. A quick rinse of your mouth should take care of it lickety-split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, let&#x27;s reel it back in, here, girlie. I have to say, I&#x27;ve been using whitening products on my teeth for years now, almost since they hit the markets, because I do love me some tea and coffee, and those can wreak havoc on your teeth. But I was pleasantly surprised to see instant results with this product for my date night with hubby. I think you&#x27;ll be happy with it too. Sparkling thanks to Influenster for another winner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hubby thought he was being cute by humming this little ditty by The Boss when he saw me taking Luster for a test drive. And he got it stuck in my head. Dork!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product free of charge from Influenster.  I am not obligated in providing a positive/favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experiences with the product, which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> I certainly have noticed a whitening effect on my teeth, my teeth are not stained much, but not as white as they once were. I have noticed a nice difference using Luster, but I worry that they focus too much on whitening and I want to make sure a toothpaste is really taking care of my dental health as well. I think this would work best if you used it as an additional toothpaste, brush 3x a day and this can be in the middle of the day. Received this product through Influenster.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Always leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean. It doesn&#x27;t have a burning sensation, and my teeth have improved in whiteness quite a bit! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I received a tube of this from Influenster to try and review.  I was a little scared, especially since I have sensitive and weak teeth.  I LOVE IT!! I liked the taste okay, but WOW!  What a difference in the color of my teeth in just a few uses.  I am a definite fan for life!</li>
    <li> I would have never heard about this product if it wasn&#x27;t for Influenster sending me it. I have tried a few teeth whitening tooth products but this gave me the best results amost immediately. Has not nasty taste or flavor easy to use and so worth it I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is really great. The taste is pleasant, and the size is generous. My teeth are glowing they are so white.</li>
    <li> i got this product for free from influenster for testing! while the product was free the opinion is my own. i am very much in love with a this toothpaste. i know i know its an odd declaration to make. but it is affordable, works well, BLUE!, and tastes great. plus you actually see results. :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but it worked pretty well for one use! makes your teeth a little blue, but that goes away with mouthwash!</li>
    <li> I received Lusters Premium Whitening toothpaste from Influenster to try. I can honestly say that I am in love with this toothpaste! I have tried every whitening toothpaste out there to no avail. Until now. I have been using it for over a week now and can already see the difference. I will be a lifelong customer of Lusters now. Seriously, everyone needs to go out and try them! You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I received this awesome toothpaste in an Influenster VoxBox (Influenster is a company who sends you a box of free items that you review). Let me start by saying that I am a huge skeptic of whitening products. I&#x27;ve tried the Crest White Strips as well as various toothpastes and nothing has worked. I was not expecting this to work...at all. After 3 days, I started noticing a difference, and then 3 weeks later I noticed my teeth are significantly whiter! This product says everything it claims and is worth the money, which I&#x27;ve noticed on here it&#x27;s like at least 6 bucks for a tube but way better than spending 30+ dollars on tedious white strips!</li>
    <li> Honestly, can&#x27;t see any difference.  Not good as regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth paste. I have sensitive teeth so I get nervous when it comes to whitening products. This product is great though, didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth at all! Plus it taste great &amp; whitens after the first use! I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Received this product complimentary from Influenster in the I Do VoxBox. I absolutely LOVE this product and I will recommend it to all of my friends and family. My teeth look incredible and with other whitening tooth pastes I have noticed my teeth become sensitive however, with this product, I haven&#x27;t had that problem. I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> My teeth are much whiter and brighter noticed 2weeks</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this toothpaste and was kind of weirded out when I saw that it was blue! But it does what it promises; it instantly makes your smile look brighter! It did leave a little blue tint, but a rinse with water took that away.  This product is really reasonably priced and you don&#x27;t have to wait for results like with some other whitening toothpastes. My husband likes it too, and hes really picky about toothpastes. Would get this again!</li>
    <li> I received this whitening toothpaste for testing purposes via Influenster and I must admit you do see a difference after the first wash. I&#x27;m a soda and coffee junkie and you can imagine my the wth have some pretty yucky stains. Love how it foams up all over teeth nicely but, must rinse of quickly and thoroughly because the foam seems to get a bit dry after awhile. Could be a little minty for my taste as well, will see how it goes for me, as of now I can say I did see a whitening improvement on my teeth. Oh yes and how can I forget I love the fact that it hasn&#x27;t affected my enamel at all which is a plus because other whitening products end up affecting my enamel. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received the Luster Now! toothpaste for free to review in an Influenster box. I love this toothpaste for it&#x27;s whitening capabilities, however, that&#x27;s really all it is good for. There isn&#x27;t any fluoride in the toothpaste to help with plaque or with actual cleaning of the teeth. I feel that this toothpaste is good to have in addition to your current teeth cleaning regimen as it will add an extra boost of whitening.</li>
    <li> I received this sample from Influenster and it works great. I tried it as soon as I received and it made a difference almost instantly!</li>
    <li> I received Luster Now! toothpaste complimentary from Influenster to test.  It came at a great time because I had recently quit drinking soda and my teeth were in desperate need of whitening.  I&#x27;ve tried other whitening toothpastes before, and other brands made my tooth sensitivity worse and didn&#x27;t whiten as well as this one has.  This is the best tasting toothpaste I have ever tried also.</li>
    <li> My teeth were instantly brighter absolutely love it! I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends and family</li>
    <li> Glad i was given the opportunity to try this out from Influenster, i love this toothpaste now. I will probably pick this up next time i need toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I drink plenty of coffee and soda so my teeth have a stain to them. I got this product free from Influenster.com to try and the first time I used it, I noticed a remarkable difference in the color of my teeth. They have gotten so much more clean and whiter since I started using this. It is a must have, and so much cheaper than most brands and def cheaper than zoom!</li>
    <li> I find that this is just another whitening toothpaste that does not deliver. I have pretty white teeth to begin with, but always am looking for a little way to brighten them even more. I felt like this toothpaste didn&#x27;t really do much for my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t do anything to make your mouth feel freshly brushed.</li>
    <li> I received a full sized tube of Luster NOW! Instant Whitening Toothpaste compliments of Influenster to test and review. I admit I was skeptical when I read the claim that this would brighten and whiten my smile after just one use. However, it actually did work! I was surprised and kept using this toothpaste once a day (it is not fluoridated, so I use a fluoridated paste at night) and it has continually made my smile even brighter over the past couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference compared to my other, cheaper toothpastes that claim to whiten. My teeth are slightly crooked as well and I&#x27;ve noticed a whiter smile gives the illusion of straighter teeth - something I&#x27;m certainly pleased with. I would recommend this product to compliment any healthy oral care routine.</li>
    <li> I received the Luster Now! whitening toothpaste to sample from Influenster and LUSTER Premium Whitening and I LOVE it! My teeth really were whiter after the very first use! The luxurious foaming made my teeth feel clean for hours, and the minty taste is nice. I am recommending this toothpaste to everyone I know. I will continue purchasing this product after I run out.</li>
    <li> I love that using this the results are instant. My fiance could really tell a difference. I feel more confident to smile big and flaunt my teeth. However, I just wonder how long this last and if it is permenant.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous whitening toothpastes, so when I recieved the LUSTER Premium Whitening toothpaste from Influenster to try out I was a bit skeptical. However, after only a few days usage I have noticed not only whitening, but also some brightening! I love this stuff! I&#x27;ll definitely be checking out other LUSTER Premium Whitening products!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product a couple weeks ago to test out, and like most whitening toothpastes I was expecting a not so good taste, but this stuff actually tastes great and does a fabulous job at whitening. I could tell a difference after the first use, and I have even got complimented on how white my teeth look. Definitely would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste from Influenster &amp; I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I can really tell it brightens my teeth &amp; I feel like my teeth are much stronger!&lt;br /&gt;Will def. buy this!</li>
    <li> This system is so easy. I recieved my full size sample tester from Influenster.com and their Blue Vox box challenge. I use it mornnings and nights replacing my regular toothpaste . Mine is blue and has a faint mild hint of mint. It foams up pretty well and instantly my teeth feel whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a lifesaver since I drink black coffee everyday. Since I started using Luster Now ! I have recieved various comp[liments about how white my teeth look. Another thing is that my teeth has not gotten weaker becasue of the whtening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this product</li>
    <li> Thanks Influenster for sending me this product to try out and review! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! It made my smile noticeably whiter and the taste was awesome! :) Thanks again Influenster!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary sample of this toothpaste from Influenster. The taste is slightly minty, not overpowering, and helps to whiten teeth!</li>
    <li> I love LUSTER Premium Whitening. Since getting my free product from Influenster, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in the color of my teeth. The blue color threw me off a bit, but after using it, I really like it. I like that it has no nasty after taste, like some other whitening toothpastes, and it requires nothing more then brushing to whiten! It&#x27;s a great product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I tried Luster toothpaste and loved it. My teeth were whiter after the first use and felt way more cleaner than with crest. I will most definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I recently got a sample of LUSTER Premium Whitening tooth paste from Influenster and I absolutely LOVE it. My wedding is in 25 days and it has been a great addition to my whitening routine, I will definitely be purchasing this as well as more from the line.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster in my June Voxbox.  Upon un-opening my box, this item was the the most exciting thing that I saw.&lt;br /&gt;I had long searched for a toothpaste which would whiten my teeth faster than my normal toothpaste of choice--Crest Glamorous 3D White.  In this regard, Luster NOW! really excelled.&lt;br /&gt;After one use, my teeth were a half shade brighter.  To avoid confusion though, this effect will wear off and is not permanent unless you continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I noticed slight sensitivity in my teeth.  Do not be alarmed by this though when purchasing, as I have not really heard much about it in other reviews.  The bright blue color was also a bit of a turn off for me, and the toothpaste itself had an interesting aftertaste that I was not too fond of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, if whitening your teeth fast for a date night, or special event is your problem, this toothpaste works wonders.  Would suggest to a friend, and would use again.</li>
    <li> I loved getting a full tube of LUSTER Premium Whitening toothpaste in my Influenster VoxBox. Non-enamel-eroding whitening with my normal routine without needing those icky whitening strips? Yes please! The only suggestion would be a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; version without SLS so it doesn&#x27;t tear up my mouth. It also doesn&#x27;t work instantly, but give it a few weeks and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
    <li> I was a lucky girl and received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. That does not however change my opinion on this product! I really enjoyed the minty flavor, but I didn&#x27;t think it lasted long enough after brushing. The texture was nice and really felt like it was getting all over and in between your teeth. After the first time using this product I really thought I could see a whitening effect, but it didn&#x27;t last. I will continue to use this product and hope that the results will become more long lasting after continued use!</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste complimentary from Influenster to try and actually liked it. Unlike most whitening toothpastes this one foamed up really good so it made my mouth feel really clean and it had a good taste.  While I noticed it starting to whiten after a few uses, it didn&#x27;t whiten in the first use as it states.  It was so blue that I found myself having to rinse an extra time to get it all off my teeth and out of my mouth but its not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;I cant find this product for sale anywhere in stores but if I did I would by it again based on the clean feeling and good taste</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I am an avid tea drinker and also had braces in high school. My teeth have stains I would rather hide than anyone ever see. I was very doubtful that this product could make my teeth whiter, especially after one use as claimed. It lived up to the hype though and I saw an instant whiting effect :) I am excited to see what daily use will do for my teeth. This product tastes great, and leaves my mouth feeling really fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I love the taste and the color of this blue toothpaste. I did notice a slight change of color on my teeth. Its not a miracle toothpaste thats for sure, but it does help a little. A little is better then nothing in my opinion. Well it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> My husband and I tried it the night I received it in the mail and noticed a slight change RIGHT AWAY! Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I received this toothpaste via Influenster for free to try and then give my opinion on the product. I definitely saw results. But not as strongly as using whitening strips. The flavor was kind of lacking, but all in all definitely worth trying for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an every day dark coke or coffee drinker! shhh don&#x27;t judge my caffeine addiction! I noticed a difference right off the bat. After the first brushing I though I was just tripping and saying to my self \\&quot;yeah this is working\\&quot; just because the packaging says whiter teeth after just one brush but then I brushed them again at night and they looked whiter then they did that morning I was freaking out It&#x27;s on the pricier side of tooth paste that&#x27;s the only down fall but I seriously will be repurchasing this because it is the only thing that has stopped my teeth from getting stained from everyday caffeine abuse but has also started whiting them it has combated and controlled it finally!! it also does not make my teeth sensitive Crest 3D white tooth paste made my two front teeth a little sensitive this does not. This was sent to my by Influenster.com in their IDOVOXBOX also know as the something Blue Vox Box which means it&#x27;s a box targeted towards weddings and I definitely know why thy included this tooth paste it works wonders in so little time.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received this product. I got it to try out from Influenster so it was great cus its free. I mean, it was selected by Allure mag so I thought it ought to be amazing. The claim was big, or huge, to whiten your teeth after the first use. First of all, let me say this, I like the packaging of the product. It was red box outside and then the tube itself was blue. I just like the color contrast of it. It was not a big tube as the regular toothpaste is, but I did not mind that. The toothpaste is blue also. The taste was like bubble gum to me, not the minty fresh that printed on the box, but again i didnt mind that either. I think I read somewhere that you think it whitens your teeth cause the toothpaste is blue. I did not even see that. I have been using this product for a month now and I dont notice any difference about my teeth, and trust me, I brush my teeth and floss and mouthwash at least twice a day and I brush them well. Anyway, it was disappointing. I let my bf try it and he also doesnt see any differences. So there, I dont think the claim was right at all.&lt;br /&gt;Well, since it doesnt whiten my teeth, I just use it as a regular toothpaste and spend money on the dentist. But one more thing I notice is that, when I wake up in the morning, my teeth dont feel clean. It feels like bacteria was having a party when I sleep. This is so weird because with other product, this does not happen. I wake up feeling like my teeth is unclean and I hate that feeling since I do take care of them.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a disappointing product. I guess I will go back to my other toothpaste. The claim was big and it did nothing to me, not even keep them clean.</li>
    <li> I received Luster toothpaste from Influenster to test out. My fiance and I are using it -- we&#x27;re less than a month from our wedding date and have seen great improvement in the color of our  teeth. The taste is good, it&#x27;s a bright blue color and although I have sensitive teeth it does not seem to be affecting my sensitivity at all.</li>
    <li> I got this tooth paste from influenster&lt;br /&gt;i was worried because my teeth were turning yellow from lot of coffee&lt;br /&gt;i started using it and saw a big change&lt;br /&gt;its no more yellow but exceptable&lt;br /&gt;i will keep using it and see what more changes it can bring</li>
    <li> A while back I bought a sample size of this toothpaste and didn&#x27;t use it until I went on a trip recently.  The results were seen very fast.  With each time that I used it my teeth look less dingy and more white.  I love it.  Not overly minty.  Would be nice if it had a stronger mint flavor.</li>
    <li> This has sodium laureate sulfate in it, they said they use all natural ingredients. False advertising? I think so. I won&#x27;t be brushing much with this chemical infused toothpaste! There&#x27;s nothing natural in it. I don&#x27;t also want canker sires in my mouth or in my gum line. So, I&#x27;d use with caution, it also doesn&#x27;t say anything about dental peroxide in their active ingredients on this tooth paste neither. More proof that the company itself lied. I bet none of their products have all natural ingredients in them, nor peroxide. I&#x27;ll use this once, then I&#x27;m giving it away. I bought mine from k-mart too. I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t buy it, it maybe enamel safe, but, it&#x27;s not mouth friendly.shame on the company luster for lying to us.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample of Luster Now! Instant Whitening Toothpaste from Influenster. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the past week, sense I got it, and I love it. My teeth are already a shade and a half lighter. Planning on continuing using this product. Now I won&#x27;t have to get my teeth whitened before my wedding!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about every tooth whitening brand out there, and none of them have ever worked and gave the results I wanted. Granted, I am a HUGE coffee drinker (i&#x27;m talking, like, 6 cups a day kind of drinker) So finding a quality product that also provides instant and lasting results can be hard to find...until I received Luster Now! Instant whitening tooth paste in the mail complementary of Influenster.com. I was incredibly skeptical but after the few times I used this product, I have seen RESULTS! I use this product along side my other toothpaste. I WILL be buying this tooth paste from now on and I&#x27;m incredibly excited to announce that this is my FAVOURITE brand! I can&#x27;t wait to go out and see what other products Luster has in store. This is definitely worth the purchase. If you are thinking whether you should try this, just do it. You&#x27;re teeth will thank you and dance... lol. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> dont like the taste of the toothpaste, its a little foamy for me, but i have noticed a difference in how white my teeth have gotten since ive used this</li>
    <li> Your teeth really will be instantly whiter and last all day.  I&#x27;m amazed every time I use this product.  I will never buy another toothpaste again or waste money on whitening strips.</li>
    <li> I Received a full size bottle of Luster now From influenster for free , to test and review. I could tell a difference after one use , and I am a smoker. Those whitening products never work for me but Luster Now has. The more I use the product the whiter my smile gets. To make this product even better , It has a light minty flavor Not the normal Foul taste that whiteners have. I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, so much better then any other whitening toothpaste and it makes my teeth feel awesome. so excited i was able to try this product</li>
    <li> i received LUSTER Premium Whitening Luster NOW toothpaste as a complimentary part of my awesome Influenster Something Blue Voxbox! I&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste for 2 weeks and I can honestly say it really does work! You always hear about how you should wear red lipstick with blue undertones in order to make your teeth look whiter, right? Well this toothpaste is ALL blue and there&#x27;s something magical about the blue toothpaste and how it gives you an instantly polished look. LOVE it! The price can&#x27;t be beat for instant results that just keep getting better. Will be purchasing when my complimentary tube runs out!</li>
    <li> This worked great, it took about 3 uses before I noticed a difference, but I use it every morning and its doing a great job!! I will be buying this again when I run out!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product immediately. I was really skeptical at first and when I tried it I was amazed. I love that even though it&#x27;s whitening it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong taste to it. I use it about every other day in place of my normal tooth paste just to make it last a little longer :)</li>
    <li> I recently received this miracle paste for free thanks to Influenster&#x27;s Something Blue VoxBox and I am so glad I did!!  I have tried one of the Luster toothpastes before and really didn&#x27;t like it since it tasted like tea tree oil and didn&#x27;t really whiten my teeth.  This toothpaste redeemed my faith in them having a good toothpaste.  I am still surprised at how white it has gotten my teeth in just one week.  I had a movie premier this week and for once wasn&#x27;t nervous about smiling while wearing dark lipstick since my teeth looked so white and shiny. I don&#x27;t care about the price, I will be buying this when I run out. It gives me great whitening results without any tooth sensitivity or gum irritation.  I have recommended it to tons of people already and will continue to do so!! I think this would be the perfect way to maintain a really nice shade of white after using the system they make.</li>
    <li> This product came in a complimentary voxbox from Influesnter, and I am so glad it did! I tried it right away, and could start to see a difference after the first brush. I like the wintergreen flavor and the fact that I felt like I had just left the dentist, but even better is the fact that I dont have to give up on my coffee now!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Noticed some slight sensitivity if used everyday, it only lasted a little while and was nothing major.  I now just use it every other day and the problem is now solved.</li>
    <li> This received this product complimentary from  Influenster. I&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste everyday since I received and I do not feel any sensitivity.  You would think that an instant whitening toothpaste would taste bleaching or powder like OJ with calcium, but this toothpaste has a great minty flavor that lasts for hours and the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the toothpaste I received it from influentser.com in my voxbox and I can see the difference in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This gave me whiter teeth instantly! After one brush I noticed a difference and after several weeks I had whiter teeth without the irritation other products in the past have giving me!! Easy to use and works! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. I have been using it for a few weeks and it did make a very little change in the color but nothing to brag about. I also did not like the way it made me feel like my breath was not as minty as other toothpaste</li>
    <li> This product is really interesting. I received this free from Influenster and decided to do a little research before trying it out. This product doesn&#x27;t whiten your teeth with the conventional products...or at all for that matter. It is a &#x27;trick&#x27; whitener, it uses materials to place a light layer of blue dye (you can see how bright blue this paste is when you open it) on your teeth to counteract the yellow. Although that may seem useless, I actually like it for it&#x27;s purpose and I do see an immediate difference in the white appearance of my teeth. I recommend brushing with your own toothpaste first and then this, and know that you won&#x27;t have long-term results only temporary (as in the same day), but if you don&#x27;t like whitening products, then you should check this out! :)</li>
    <li> This product made my teeth noticeably white in 1 brushing. I love that it does exactly what is on the package. A must have for safe, effective, whiting.</li>
    <li> Hi! I loved the Luster toothpaste. It did get me a few shades lighter. It wasn&#x27;t a drastic change. And it definitely doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. I have been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed a change.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try out from Influenster got to say really did like it and would buy it again worked for me.</li>
    <li> I use it after usng my regular toothpaste. slowly massaged it in with my toothbrush (turns blue) and could see a difference . They claim it \\&quot;creates the optical effect of instantly whiter teeth, with results that last for hours.\\&quot; and I would have to agree. Need a little brightening for a few hours, this will give your teeth a pop. I was sent this product from influenster for testing purposes. If you want more permenant results they do have other products to achieve that desire. this is for a pop of white and up keep for an event, few hours etc.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I got my complimentary for testing from Influenster.com in the Something Blue VoxBox.  I was a little skeptical at first at the idea of being able to notice a change after just one use.  But I must confess I was pleasantly surprised.  Immediately surface stains were gone and my smile just keeps getting brighter everyday!</li>
    <li> I received this LUSTER Premium Whitening product complimentary for testing from Influenster and I really love it!! I smoke and drink a lot of coffee and have for many years my stains on my teeth where the worst to were i didn&#x27;t want to smile now I cant stop it works so super fast and doesn&#x27;t taste nasty.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with my free sample I received from Influenster! I&#x27;m now a faithful user! The results I&#x27;ve seen have been amazing. You&#x27;ll love the taste and see changes in the shade of your teeth within days. I definitely recommend this to any one who would like to give their mouth a total transformation.</li>
    <li> I got this product in my Influenster Vox Box and thought OOH!!! Whitening toothpaste!! Sweet!!. Then, it came out and was BRIIIIGHT blue. I was a bit nervous and wondered what craziness this would be. It tasted wonderful, and made my teeth look white almost instantaneously. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks not and it&#x27;s incredible. :) I&#x27;d definitely recommend to friends, and will be purchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> I recently got a full tube of Luster to try out from Influenster and I must say I was kind of iffy about this stuff. But the first day I used it I was blown away because it does not have that disgusting taste that most whitening toothpastes have. It did turn my tooth brush blue though. It foams a lot so when it got on my face it did burn. I had to spit a lot so that it wouldn&#x27;t get overwhelming because it was that foaming.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I was pretty satisfied with this product. It really does whiten your teeth within the first week or two. There isn&#x27;t a right away difference, at least for me there wasn&#x27;t, but the more I use it the more you can tell a difference. I does make my gums bleed but I have very sensitive gums so maybe one day they could try to make a sensitive line?</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product and noticed that my teeth whitened after just the first use. I didn&#x27;t really mind the after-taste as much as other reviewers. It&#x27;s not exactly  wonderful, but nothing too strong to deter me from continued use. I think it really did whiten my teeth and as I continue to use it, it seems to improve more and more. The product isn&#x27;t like any other whitening product I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It doesn&#x27;t require me to leave it on for a length of time, use a light or any other inconvenient method. I just brush it on like I would my regular toothpaste and let it do all the work. Some people mentioned it made their teeth sensitive, I didn&#x27;t experience this during my usage of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster, but ALL opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> I love it and I love the taste. The tooth paste lathers nicely and tastes great. Within 3 days, my teeth were significantly whiter</li>
    <li> I really love the whole Luster line, but this product is one of my favorites! It instantly makes my teeth whiter! I think its amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually suprised how well this product worked! I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for the product but after about two weeks I began seeing a difference. This product is a great investment.!</li>
    <li> I am a Diet Coke addict... &amp; my teeth show it! This stuff was great &amp; seemed to work better than the regular whitening toothpaste I usually buy. I received Luster as a sample from Influenster to try, but will definitely buy it on my own!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste became a favorite as soon as we began to use it in our home. My husband came out of the bathroom and exclaimed \\&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen my teeth this white in forever.\\&quot; Not only does it have instant results you sometimes need the morning after drinking too much wine, it also is long lasting. Not only does this toothpaste work but it also smells really yummy as well as has a nice flavor that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. Oh and before I forget it does make my mouth feel really clean like any toothpaste should.</li>
    <li> This product was very good for whitening but it does foam alot wich kinda annoyed me everytime i brushed my teeth. Becasue it was blue also set me off but i thought it was kinda cool i guess. This doesnt really give me that clean feeling like other brands do but it did feel clean.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster and Luster NOW for testing purposes. I think it&#x27;s the first time I am seeing a difference with a whitening toothpaste. Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a few weeks now and I have seen such a huge difference! Much better then those whitening strips and much cheaper! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This stuff seriously works magic! I used it once and took a before and after picture. I showed the picture to people and have already gotten over six people to buy the toothpaste. It is amazing and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I received this to try as a sample. I have to say, I was not expecting much out of it, but it actually brightens my smile. I use it before weddings, events, or a girls night out to reveal a noticeably whiter smile. I do not know if it has lasting effects as of yet, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth sensitive. Would I purchase this item again, YES!</li>
    <li> Love the taste. Love the results. I saw my mom 2 days after using this and she said my teeth were looking extra white. Great product!</li>
    <li> Saw no worthwhile results from this product. It is simply blue while brushing but no apparent whitening results are apparent afterwards.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I used this twice daily for 2 weeks  with no noticeable difference. Overpriced stick to the Crest or Optic .</li>
    <li> definitely helping me as a smoker and coffee drinker. I use sensodyne in the morning and this at night to avoid any possible sensitivity.</li>
    <li> The info on this product does not lie. If I didn&#x27;t see it I would not believe it. My husband is an x smoker so you can imagine. I honestly could see a difference after only 2 brushings. He loves this and it does work. Alot cheaper with results then the more expensive strips, works for him is all I can say.</li>
    <li> There is nothing &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; about this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and have seen no change. Instead, I spent $20 on a whitening kit from The Smile Clinic and saw desired results after one use. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste for brightening my yellow teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday afternoon from a local store and wanted to wait till this morning to start using it after checking out some reviews 1st. I must say that I did see a small difference! I was actually shocked that it did what it said. It&#x27;s not an immediate \\&quot;going from discoloration to movie star white\\&quot; in one brushing, but it was enough for me to notice. So in brushing more than twice a day, I should see movie star white. I also have the whitening kit as well, and will start using it again in addition to the toothpaste. Most people are impatient to see results and don&#x27;t keep working at it. I do recommend this one. Yes the toothpaste is blue. They did cover up the taste of the whitening agent in it as well, that was another thing I liked! If it doesn&#x27;t start working with brushing only twice a day, try 3 or 4 times a day until it starts working and then lessen it down to 2 or 3 after you start seeing the results. It&#x27;s like bleaching dark brown hair all the way down to bleach blonde, it takes time for the color to lift!</li>
    <li> I received the Luster Now Instant whitening toothpaste free to try from Influenster and i absolutely love it, i&#x27;ve seen results within the first 3 days! great product!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from Influenster for testing purposes and I love it! I drink a lot of coffee so my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they could be. I noticed a difference after the first day. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s the only whitening tooth paste I&#x27;ve used that I could actually see work. I would like it more if the minty taste was stronger, but that&#x27;s just me. Still a great product though.</li>
    <li> I gotta admit, I was skeptical! I have tried oodles of teeth whiteners and being a smoker....have yet to find one that works. Most of them taste HORRID and make me feel like I&#x27;ve just rushed weapons grade chemicals into my mouth! Yuck! But, I received a complimentary tube of LUSTER Premium Whitening for testing and review purposes from Influenster. When my son saw the box, he BEGGED me to try it. 15 and oh so concerned with how he looks *smh* We have both been using it for a little over a week now and I gotta say....I&#x27;m impressed! We both have considerably whiter teeth, and that really was after the very first brushing! Now of course, my son doesn&#x27;t smoke so his teeth are just a glowing white!! This will definitely be in our medicine cabinet from now on! (My son wouldn&#x27;t allow anything but! lol)</li>
    <li> I received Luster NOW! toothpaste complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes. I found that this toothpaste was true to its word about making my teeth instantly whiter. Each time I brush with it, my teeth look less yellow! I like the taste too, and the toothpaste feels like it&#x27;s working and leaves my mouth feeling clean. The only critique I had about it was that my mouth feels slightly sore after, and it might be the sulfates that are starting to create canker sores. I&#x27;ll give it another week to see if that slows down.</li>
    <li> I love, love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth. The flavor is good. It does not cause sensitivity, like most whitening toothpaste. It actually removes stains. Gives you a beautiful white smile.</li>
    <li> I thought the Luster toothpaste did work well. Once you get the knack of getting the extra blue off your teeth, they really do look whiter.</li>
    <li> This product advertises on the box that your teeth will be whiter after one use. However, I didn&#x27;t notice whiter teeth until I used it multiple times. This toothpaste is great, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> @Luster @Influenster After receiving #LusterWhite complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster, I have noticed my new lustrous smile brings an added confidence needed in life! I love it! If you are looking for an instantly whiter smile, I suggest trying this product! It is great for using prior to major events (weddings, graduations, pictures, etc.) #IDoVoxBox</li>
    <li> I currently tried this product and I am in love. This works incredibly fast and you only have to use it once to see results. I love that this is in a toothpaste form, I think its eaier i use then most teeth whitening systems. I am a forever customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I recieved this for free for review purposes only)</li>
    <li> I feel as though most whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t really do the trick, however, this one does!  It&#x27;s great tasting (minty) and you can feel how clean your teeth are.  Afterwards you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference in brightness.  I love my coffee and will take whatever I can get to brighten up my baby whites.  This toothpaste gets the job done without being harsh on your teeth.</li>
    <li> The tooth paste seems to work? ..I guess. I didn&#x27;t notice a wow-ing difference from before I started using the product a month ago to now. In it&#x27;s defense I&#x27;m also not a smoker or a coffee drinker so I don&#x27;t have any deep set in stains.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I have with it is that it does not really hold up in the freshness department. If you are trying to alleviate bad breath, this is definitely not the product for you. Though, I like the taste more than most pastes, this one will leave you needing a mint before lunch.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is billed as providing \\&quot;instant whitening after just one use.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t really buy into it - but I did have whiter teeth after one brushing! I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day since the first time I got it and while the initial \\&quot;OMG!\\&quot; of it has worn off, they are getting progressively whiter. This would be a great toothpaste to wear on special occasions like engagement photos, a wedding, or even a special date. (I was provided this sample to review from Influenster.)</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does give some great results.  However, I do wonder how long the whitening lasts.  I would like to try the mouthwash.  One of the only other complaints is that the mint taste is not very strong.  When I brush my teeth, I want to have that tingling mint taste in my mouth and I didn&#x27;t have it with this.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Must try! Bright white &amp; super shiney! Will buy this product regularly. Whole family loves this amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> Luster is ok. I got it from Influenster.com for free I have used it for two weeks now and it does whiten but the taste is not that good. I have tried better toothpaste flavors.</li>
    <li> This product really does work well -- I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now &amp; I definitely notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free for testing purposes. I have to say i really like this toothpaste.  Love the taste and that it is blue. The only thing that i don&#x27;t like is that it is not permanent results. It only whitens your teeth for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how impressed I am with the Luster NOW! Instant whitening toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER be without it again.&lt;br /&gt;I literally watched in amazement after after only ONE use the coffee stains were literally GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF BEATS OUT EVERY WHITENING TOOTHPASTE ON THE MARKET! I have seriously tried them all...none work as fast as this, or have as long lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about this product sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received Luster NOW! complimentary to try from Influenster, thank you Influenster!</li>
    <li> I loved that this was whitening my teeth without causing sensitivity or discomfort. Not only does it taste good but keeps getting better after each use.</li>
    <li> I love the luster toothpaste! I received mine from Influenster and it is amazing. It made my teeth so white and I continue to use it everyday. Using it the first time makes a huge difference! I definitely recommend it for anyone that wants improvement for their teeth.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from Influenster for testing purposes. It was okay. It doesn&#x27;t actually whiten your teeth, it just puts a blue tint on them, making them look white</li>
    <li> I received this from influenester and I saw that this made a dramatic difference granted its only temporary but it works wonders</li>
    <li> I received Luster from Influenster for testing and review purposes. I have been using this product ever since. Love Luster! You really can tell the difference after a week or two. Love the way my teeth shine and feel after using this!</li>
    <li> The Luster Now toothpaste is great option for those of use who don&#x27;t have the money for a dental whitening.I love the unusual mid-blue color, I have never seen it before in toothpaste.The flavor is great and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in just a week even though I drink 5-6 cups of coffee daily! A big THANK YOU to Influenster for giving me the sample to use and review the product!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster for testing &amp; reviewing purposes. I really like it. The taste is not overpowering. It does a good job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I wish that I would&#x27;ve known about this before, my husband noticed an immediate difference. I think I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I so lovee Luster premium white after only a few days I could not believe how much whiter my teeth looked!! My family noticed and even my hubby noticed!I was always fooled by them whitening toothpastes but this one stays true to it&#x27;s word!</li>
    <li> I received LUSTER Premium Whitening in my Influenster something blue voxbox to test and I absolutely love it. I have to have my morning coffee in order to function throughout the day and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about icky coffee stains. I have tried several whitening toothpastes and they all take so long to show results, but with LUSTER Premium Whitening toothpaste there was a difference immediately. Seriously I&#x27;m no where even done with this tube of toothpaste and I already went out and bought some more.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOOT for white teeth.!! ♥</li>
    <li> Loved my @Luster Instant Whitening Toothpaste! It came just in time for holiday cookouts and summer pool parties with friends, I will definitely be purchasing this in the future! Received complementary from @Influenster in my #voxbox</li>
    <li> Does what it says, plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is great, foams wonderfully and I have noticed pretty dramatic results using this. I am about halfway through the tube. I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this item in my \\&quot;Something Blue\\&quot; VoxBox complimentary for review and testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now. I have to say it really works. First use and I could instantly see a difference. My teeth looked super white and brighter than they were before I used the product. The taste of the product is pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t have an over powering minty taste like some other products. I love this stuff so much, I plan on giving it as gifts to my brides maids.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was pretty good! It was a bright blue color and it was very minty and nice. Not bad!</li>
    <li> I have tried many whitening tooth pastes and recently tried this product for a month. I noticed a SLIGHT change in brightening however not enough to warrant spending over $7 on this toothpaste. Not worth the extra money in my opinion. Tastes great though :)</li>
    <li> This toothpaste really works, not just for whitening but for fresh breath, also ok on my sensitive teeth. I am a new fan!</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try the Luster premium whiting toothpaste thanks to influnsters something blue vox box and i have to say i love it. It leaves my mouth with this great minty taste and super cleaning smelling breath. It also has helped whiten my teeth so now i smile alot more. I would deffinitly recommend this to anyone looking to whiten there teeth.</li>
    <li> When I brush with this, I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference in the shade of my teeth, as well as my 12 year old son&#x27;s teeth.  He just got braces and struggles to brush long enough and often enough, so a whitening toothpaste that he could use is great  It tastes minty and fresh; but not as my 10-year-old would refer to as \\&quot;too spicy,\\&quot; and it feels on par with the \\&quot;average\\&quot; toothpaste as far as bubbling up while brushing and overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth. Our of a 5-star rating system, I think I&#x27;d have to give it a 4 star rating is because I didn&#x27;t necessarily see the results \\&quot;NOW\\&quot; as it claims to do, rather instantly.  I&#x27;d expect a noticeable difference the first day or two, but this was a little more cumulative over time, especially to see my son&#x27;s, which would have been easier to judge.  When you try it,  just don&#x27;t expect this stuff to lift too many shades in the first day or two and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optical Illusion of Whiter Teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stain Removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes Great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps Teeth White For Hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe For Daily Use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surface Stain Removal with daily use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on Teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe for Dental Restorations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not permanent whitening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive ($7.99 for a 4 oz. tube)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t leave a long-lasting \\&quot;Fresh Breath/Minty\\&quot; feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Residue Behind on Gums that requires lots of rinsing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend giving it a try to gradually whiten your smile, especially for a photo shoot or a special event, like a wedding or graduation.  Give it a good 2 weeks to work it&#x27;s magic and you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results, just remember they&#x27;re short-term.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Luster Premium White Toothpaste! It was complimentary product I got to try sent to me by Influenster. It has a pleasant taste, and as a smoker my teeth are noticeably whiter after brushing. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products made by Luster. You can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this!</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this from Influenster and am very surprised at how well it works! Normally, whitening toothpastes can make your teeth sensitive and since I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 weeks 2x a day I can&#x27;t say that I have a problem. Bonus is that it actually works and my teeth are at least 2 shades whiter! It foams more than other toothpastes in the mouth and the minty taste isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this in the future!</li>
    <li> I got this product from influenstr and i love the results! It lives up to its claim. I notice an increase in my teeth&#x27;s whiteness after the first brush.</li>
    <li> I got this product free,for testing purposes,from Influenster.  I love this product.  It makes my teeth look whiter and it has a pleasant taste which isn&#x27;t too overpoweringly minty. I would recommend this for people who need a quick pick me up in their tooth color.</li>
    <li> I received this complements of influenster. I love it! It works wonderfully and I will be making it part of my hygiene purchases from now on.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complementary in my I Do Voxbox from Influenster.  My only negative remarks are, I dont feel like my mouth is clean after using it so i use a regular tooth paste before i use it, and it foams a lot so dont use it while wearing the clothes you are planning to wear out.  Other than that, it works very well.  I am a smoker so white teeth is important to me, and this def works and is totally worth purchaseing.</li>
    <li> I received Luster Premium Whitening Paste free for review from Influenster &amp; and absolutely love this product. I saw actual results after one brushing and I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll continue to use Luster from this day forward!!</li>
    <li> *** i received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i recieved this in my something blue voxbox from influenster and saw that it was a \\&quot;instant whitening toothpaste\\&quot; i was very skeptical. but after i tried it i was actually amazed at the difference! its not a HUGE difference but definatly noticeable. i like to wear cherry red lipstick and its hard for my teeth to look really white while wearing it, but with this toothpaste it really makes my teeth look whiter!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of MOST whitening toothpaste but I can say that Luster Instant Whitening Toothpaste has to be my favorite of the ones I&#x27;ve tried thus far. Some whitening toothpaste just feels like you have a gunky layer over your teeth but with this my teeth actually feel clean and fresh. There really is an instant change in color that is noticeable with each use. After testing this out, I would most definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster to try for free. I liked it but I did not love it. I does make your teeth somewhat whiter but it leaves a weird taste and feeling in my mouth. It is also a bit pricy. I would recommend it to friends, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy any for myself, but I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste. So it could just be me.</li>
    <li> I was a excited to use this product the minute I opened the \\&quot;Something Blue\\&quot; VoxBox but became a bit skeptical upon it&#x27;s ability to instantly whiten teeth after one full application as I previously tried the Dial-A-Smile whitening kit and the claims were the same and I had to use that product on 3 different occasions to notice a change because my teeth are fairly bright white so I didn&#x27;t bother using the product any longer and I was discouraged. I used this product and instantly seen a major brightening as well as my friends and family even when I teeth were like I mentioned the brightest teeth can possibly be. This product has a light minty flavor and has a gentle whitening system perfect for sensitive teeth. While using this toothpaste my teeth felt super clean even after meals and it maintained my fresh breath . I have already purchased my second tube as my husband liked it&#x27;s results and wished to have his own. I truly recommend this product to anyone looking to brightening their smile instantly without the risk of damaging tooth enamel and experiencing sensitivity. Thank you Influenster and LUSTER Premium Whitening for sending me this excellent product for testing purchases it has exceed my expectations.</li>
    <li> Left my teeth white, had a nice minty taste. Loved this brand and will buy it again. Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when first trying this product but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference after one brushing (as stated) BUT after two weeks there was a significant improvement.. It had a nice mint taste that wasn&#x27;t too strong. It works great</li>
    <li> Never going back to my old toothpaste, this one works so well! It clearly whitens after the first use and continues to work.</li>
    <li> I happened to get this product as a tester from a company named Influenster. I got to say I absolutley love this item. I see results right after the first couple of uses. Also it does not have the extreme burning feeling just a mild nice tingle, but it still makes you feel just as fresh and clean. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I got this product to review through Influenster, I was skeptical at first because whitening is suppose to be bad for your teeth. I was blown away, I could tell my teeth were whiter after 4 days. :) super impressive!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m starting to see a difference. I would recommend this product to a friend. The only thing is if you know you have an event coming up try to use the product at least 3-4 weeks in advance.</li>
    <li> I received a free tube of Luster Now toothpaste from Influenster. I tried it and am happy with it so far.It whitens slightly starting with the first use and has a mild mint taste. I was hoping for more whitening. I didn&#x27;t have much staining to begin with but you can still see a difference quickly.</li>
    <li> I like this product it taste better then other whitening toothpaste. And actually whitens teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY works. I have used many whitening toothpaste products in the past and nothing has given immediate results like this product. It tastes good and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to your gums or tongue. You can see results within minutes and over time the results are even more apparent.</li>
    <li> I RECEIEVED A SAMPLE OF THIS TO TRY AND I LOVE IT! IT DOESNT HAVE A FUNKY TASTE TO IT WHICH I LOVE. I HAVE SEEN A DIFF IN COLOR OF MY TEETH SINCE I STARTED USING IT:)</li>
    <li> The product was just ok. I have used other toothpastes that I feel actually whiten my teeth. This one on the other had, wasn&#x27;t that great. I didn&#x27;t feel like it actually whitened at all. I tested this product through Influenster.com</li>
    <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth super white! I love it!! It is also really goid for sensitive teeth and I dont have to buy whitening strips!</li>
    <li> I am still using toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;I can see some difference n my teeth&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to see results even after this tub</li>
    <li> No better than any other toothpaste on the market. Almost through the entire tube with no appreciable change in my teeth color. I will not reorder the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a smoker so I&#x27;m always out looking for the next new whitener for my teeth and when i received this in my \\&quot;something blue vox box\\&quot; i was ecstatic, legit whitens with the first use. i went on to buy the mouth wash as well works great i would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in my influenster ido voxbox. I tried it feeling skeptical as it promised to show whiter and brighter teeth after the first use. I gave it a try anyway and I could instantly see that my teeth were a little whiter. This product definately lives up to its promises! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received Lustter NOW! Instant Whitening Toothpaste complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. I was very impressed with the full sized bottle I received and have been using it since the day I got my Voxbox. I&#x27;ve seen slight change in the coloring of my teeth, and can&#x27;t wait to continue using this product &amp; see a further outcome. I&#x27;ve always wanted to have a bright smile, and hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to have that now. Thanks again Luster NOW! &amp; Influenster.</li>
    <li> While I have no idea whether or not this is the best product out there, it is certainly reasonably priced and effective in whitening teeth! I can happily recommend this product for whiter teeth :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received free for review from Influenster.</li>
    <li> My hubby tried this product which gives you whiter teeth after just one brushing he now has teeth that Shine Bright like a Diamond http://www.lusterpremiumwhite.com/</li>
    <li> I just started using Luster NOW! and I am already seeing great results. It tastes great too. I received this as a sample from Influenster and loved it along with my other great products.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It made my teeth feel really clean and I believe they are getting whiter by the day as I use it! I&#x27;m definitely an addict!</li>
    <li> This product really works.. just make sure you use it twice a day like it says. I saw a difference around day 3/4. You should def try their other products as well!!!</li>
    <li> Luster Now! Is great and perfect for before pictures! It gives you a lighter smile and it has a good minty taste unlike other brands.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great. Has a great taste and is a quick way to make your teeth whiter quickly. I personally love the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product complimentary from Influenster. I&#x27;m not one to buy spend $10+ on a tube of toothpaste, especially if I have no idea whether it works, so this was a perfect opportunity to try it. I drink coffee, so staining is an issue when it comes to my teeth. I wasn&#x27;t sure whether this would tackle those stains, but after just two uses, my teeth were so white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste itself is BRIGHT blue (I&#x27;ll admit, I was worried about having a smurf mouth right away) and it has a slight minty flavor at first, but it&#x27;s quickly replaced with a bland flavor with a hint of baking soda. I did notice a bit of sensitivity if I used it every day, so I moved it back to every other day and it seems to have helped.</li>
    <li> Really like this product!  Minty fresh taste and definitely whitens your teeth! Would recommend to any new bride wanting to whiten their teeth in a pinch!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I received it complementary from Influenster, and it has officially taken the place of my regular tooth paste! My teeth are soooo white now even after one use!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Luster Premium Whitening Toothpaste courtesy of Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;I am not new to whitening systems. In fact I prefer my toothpastes to have some type of whitening formula included.&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of Luster prior to receiving my sample, and was slightly hesitant on using it after seeing the color of the paste. Don&#x27;t let looks deceive you! I was very impressed with the quality of the toothpaste. Just because its a whitening toothpaste, didn&#x27;t mean I had to compromise the fresh feeling and minty fresh flavor. A bonus? It doesn&#x27;t take long to see the results!</li>
    <li> I received LusterNOW in the Something Blue VoxBox. I liked the mild taste of the toothpaste. Some whitening toothpastes just taste so terrible!! I did notice that my teeth were slightly whiter after aa few days of usag</li>
    <li> I got this to test for free from Influenster, but I will definitely be a loyal customer from now on.  I always try to whiten my teeth, but can&#x27;t afford doing it at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Other toothpastes, help a little, but this I have noticed, is even better, and it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like the whitening strips I&#x27;ve tried do, which is a plus!  I am a big tea drinker and even drinking tea and soda every day, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my smile in the past two weeks!  I highly recommend to others if you are looking to brighten your smile for a special event, or are even just like me and want to feel more confident when you&#x27;re flashing your pearly whites! :)</li>
    <li> I recently received LUSTER premium Whitening tootpaste from Influenster. I started using it immediately and brush with it atleast twice a day. It has a very fresh and minty taste. However at this time I have yet to see too much evidence of my teeth becoming whiter...but then again I haven&#x27;t used the product for very long. So far I am enjoying this product and hope to see more of a result as I continue to use the toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I know, I shouldn&#x27;t expect \\&quot;INSTANT\\&quot; results but why use the word INSTANT? (LoL). Anyway, I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I can now really see a difference in how much whiter my teeth look! I&#x27;m so glad I have been using this product. Unlike other whitening toothpaste, they don&#x27;t work like this one! :-)</li>
    <li> Thanks to LUSTER Premium Whitening and Influenster I received a complimentary product for testing and review purposes and oh MY did I absolutely LOVE it! I personally think that it&#x27;s a little thicker then the toothpaste I was previously using but it makes my entire mouth feel fresh and clean and after just a few days I started to notice a difference in my teeth becoming whiter. How awesome is that?! It also had a great minty taste (because I can NOT stand weird flavored toothpaste... it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my teeth have been cleaned) but that wasn&#x27;t the case with the luster toothpaste. I loved my sample and will definitely be purchasing more! I would recommend to EVERYONE to try it out because not only is it inexpensive, it works wonders also!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! I have tried others that claimed they whitened but to no avail! I am so glad I decided to try this. I got it complementary from Influenster :) I would recommend it to everyone :)</li>
    <li> I got this product @influenster and I was amazed at how white my teeth were just after the first use this product works great and I recommend it to all</li>
    <li> I have been using the toothpaste for just over a week now, and I can say I do see a difference. I have yellow teeth, not by choice, but because I have never had them! I have always dreamed of having them, but I can&#x27;t afford the $1,000 to go get them professionally bleached, so this seemed liked a good option.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a free trial from Influenster.com in The Something Blue VoxBox and I am thrilled with it. I have been using sensitive toothpaste for years so I have always been hesitant to try new toothpastes (especially whitening toothpastes) that aren&#x27;t labelled as sensitive....but I thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl. I am extremely happy with it. I have been drinking coffee for about a year now and my teeth have yellowed quite a bit in that time...and this is whitening them right up. I have been using it for a few weeks and I have a noticeable difference and all without the pain! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received the Luster Now! Instant Whitening Toothpaste as part of the VoxBox for Influentser. I received a full sized sample of the Happy Mint flavor and was immediately skeptical about it. I have tried other toothpaste that claim to do the same thing and have never seen results. I can say this does 100% work. I noticed a difference right away and others have notice my whiter smile. I will definitely buy this again and have recommended it to numerous friends.</li>
    <li> Recieved this product as a trial... I thought It was good for the most part for whitening however though, I felt it didn&#x27;t freshen the mouth as well as other toothpastes. I would use this product again however for a special occasion.</li>
