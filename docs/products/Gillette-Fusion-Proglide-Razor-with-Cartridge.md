<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product, quick ship (amazon prime), good price w/discount and/or instant coupon.</li>
    <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
    <li> I really like the handle on this razor. It feels well balance in my hand and even when it gets wet it doesn&#x27;t slip or slide in my grip. Four stars because the cartridge seems to wear out quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Gillette Fusion line since the beginning and I will continue to do so. Simply because they deliver every single time and the Proglide is no exception. Hands down the best manual razor on the market. I actually received this one as part of a promotion that Gillette was running, but I always buy these. You can never have too many. I even keep one in the car for emergencies. If you&#x27;re looking for a great, smooth shave, look no further than the Gillette Fusion line.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor via a Gillette program. To me I found the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor great to handle in the shower versus other manual razors I have used in the past. It&#x27;s rubber grip and razor shape have made my shaving experience not only easier to handle but has made my shaving less time consuming. If your seeking for a good grip razor this has thus been the best I have tried yet!</li>
    <li> Normally, I buy razors made for women, but was always disappointed by their results. I was looking for a new razor on Amazon and reading reviews from other women was recommended to use a men&#x27;s razor. I was a little skeptical because I thought a razor that a man uses to shave his face is different from shaving private areas. I was very wrong!!! I used this razor everywhere including my underarms, legs, and other private areas. I always wondered why my husband sometimes would go for days without having to shave even his private parts and even he looked smoother than me. And now he and I use this same razor! I was really amazed the very first time I used it!!</li>
    <li> I recently recieved a free razor provided by a program by gillette. This Razor is Very great and easy to use. The Razor blades feels like clean spoon going around my face cutting the hair. The Blade is self flys around you cutting the hairs. The only thing is refills are a bit Coasty But the life and use age of the Blades make up for it Giving you a Clean and sexy Cut.</li>
    <li> These razors are usually highly overprice, but with the coupon it was worth the amount ($2.95).  Good deal, decent razor</li>
    <li> very good. No problem it all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman with extremely sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve had an extremely difficult time finding a razor I&#x27;m happy with. Before this, I was using the Venus razor. It has 5-blades and shaves pretty close without a ton of irritation, but the design is terrible! The head is far too bulky to shave knees, ankles, and bikini area.     The Proglide, on the other hand, is a dream! It gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, with the least amount of irritation I&#x27;ve experienced. It really does glide! Plus, the smaller head makes it perfect for hard to shave areas.</li>
    <li> There two attributes that impress me the most:   1. The blades shave really close. When they move over my face, I can feel that they \\&quot;catch\\&quot; the hair near the root.   2. Very easy to clean after shave. With a little warm water rinse, the blades are ready to use. In comparison, my old blades always got some \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; between blades. I needed to use Waterpik to flush it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the last generation Fusion for a few years now. I got a great deal on the Fusion Proglide so I decided to try it out. It is very similar to the Fusion, but with slightly less tug and pull. I also discovered that Proglide razor heads fit on the older Fusion handle, and vice versa. So if you want to switch, there&#x27;s not much reason to buy the handle too. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s still a great razor, but more of a .5 jump in evolution.</li>
    <li> Until I found the proglide, I was an electric razor only type. I hated how manual razors pulled. Of course, I also hated the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 11AM, that came with electrics. It was a trade off. My girlfriend convinced me to try ProGlide and I love it. Smooth, fast, close, and barely pulls, The only downside is replacements are expensive. I thought I would go to  less expensive razor, but I cam right back to ProGlide. It is worth the extra cost. When Gillette says the best shave or your money back, I now know why they can make that guarantee. It really is the best I have had. What is more, the closer shave means less oil from facial hair which means less acne. Hallelujah! I love ProGlide. I would give this thing 6 out of 5 stars if I could. This is like the Lamborghini of razors..fast, smooth, and a bit expensive. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I highly recommended this razor, easily the closest, cleanest shaved for me. This is my third one and I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> The Proglide Manual is hands down the best overall blade I have used over the years. Tried the Proglide Power and it still doesn&#x27;t compare to the Manual. If you want a close, smooth shave without irritation this is your match!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a loss leader. It works fairly well. Better than most multi-blade razors, in fact. Oddly enough, my shaving rituals are contrarian. While King Gillette invented the safety razor, I prefer Schick products (until now). In electrics, I prefer Braun, which is a Gillette subsidiary. Weird, huh?  My new razor, and my all-time favorite so far is the Emjoli. Hard to find at a reasonable price, but if you find a deal, THAT is the best multi-blade razor.   Gillette, you almost had me for a while.</li>
    <li> My husband loved his razor. I bought for him and when I received it I thought it would make a great Valentines&#x27; gift to him from our daughters. He loves using it and has thrown out all other razors. It really leaves his face smooth and soft. A great razor all around!! Would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Another outstanding product from the Gillette Company; a vast improvement over the first generation Fusion as the five blades are placed closer together making for a closer shave, especially around curves and corners.  I bought the extra blades with the facial scrub and the scrub really does make for a closer and smoother shave; however it&#x27;s very messy.  My only complaint about the Proglide is the cost - it does not come as a free trial, and the replacement blades are very expensive; $3-$4 for disposable cartridges - ouch!  But the performance is undeniable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the smoothest shave with fewest nicks I&#x27;ve ever had, but after 4-5 weeks it&#x27;s on par with the older blades as you start to feel the tug again. It should last another 2 or 3 weeks probably, but I was hoping for more after reading other reviews. I&#x27;m not going to invest in too many blades as I&#x27;ll wait for the next iteration which will likely rise the bar yet again.</li>
    <li> Im just keept it short and simple. Using the same cream and shaving style, i like this new thinner blade over the old product. I used to hate shaving my neck and chin because of the tug and pull but with this new blade I don&#x27;t experience that problem anymore. Buy this product it really does have less tug and pull when shaving.</li>
    <li> The feel of the razor is very smooth at first, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the life of the razor is relatively short compared to other brands out there. Either way, I bought this on sale for 73 cents! So I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> Was on sale so I thought I would try it. Gave a nice close shave (actually many), and the blades didn&#x27;t plug up with hair.</li>
    <li> By far the finest blade that Gillette has ever produced. It really does glide across your skin, as long as it is still sharp. It Reduces irritation and is definitely smooth than the older one. It&#x27;s so gentle, you have to wonder it;s actually working.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now and have been impressed with it. It provides a smooth clean shave at a great price. I don&#x27;t even buy the replacement blades because I have found a better value in buying a new razor every time.</li>
    <li> Very smooth cutting.  I personally like this over the Schick Hydro 5.  I feel it glides easier, plus it has the precision trimming blade.  The grip/razor holder itself is very well made and has a nice heavy metal feel to it.  The only downfall to it is that the razor doesn&#x27;t provide a cover for the blade area.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for the price.  $4.20 with free shipping.  I have used these shavers for several years and I like them.  I&#x27;ll use this one when I travel.</li>
    <li> The razor works well and gives me a nice clean shave, and is an improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion is great as always.  Five blade shave is so smooth and awesome!  I strongly recommend Gillette Fusion.  You gotta get this.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love Gillette&#x27;s razors but this one hits the moon! Sharp and exact, very light and incredible work! Only one cartridge it&#x27;s not so funny...</li>
    <li> I stopped using blades regularly several years ago because they were more time consuming (for my face) than electric razors and always left me with little nicks and cuts that I didn&#x27;t feel like having to deal with. But I do use my Fusion ProGlide Power Razor every now and then when I need a close shave for a special occassion. I like it, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if the vibrating function actually did anything for my shave. I bought this Fusion Proglide Manual because it was so cheap and I tried it out yesterday, and I can honestly say that it was the smoothest shave I have EVER had. Maybe it was just a fluke shave or something, but I was checking my face all day long and it felt silky smooth until the next morning. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t think this is some miracle razor or anything, as I was a little more deliberate in my shave than I normally am, but I have to give this thing some credit!</li>
    <li> always ask for these for xmas, don&#x27;t cut my face like shick. customer for life</li>
    <li> Is quite satisfactory products.   The product looked a lot like using a razor that could satisfy me.   Strongly recommended.   New to shaving?   Please purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female and decided to try this razor since it&#x27;s gotten such good reviews. If it can leave super smooth skin on a mans face, I thought it would do just as a great of a job on my legs. I was wrong.    I had to go over the same spot multiple times and still didn&#x27;t get the smoothness I get from my Quattro for Women (which is awesome!) It gave me tons of razor burn, and for the first time in YEARS, my legs got cut up and were bleeding. I was so disappointed :(    I&#x27;ll go back to using my Quattro for Women.     I gave it three stars to be fair because I can&#x27;t review how it works on a man&#x27;s face, but if your a female, this is not good for your legs!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor, that I ever used.  It allows a very smooth shave.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Razors are getting too expensive and it seems like these do not last as long as some of the older gilette products</li>
    <li> After years of shaving, buying several different safety razors over the years. I finally fell into the advertising B.S. and bought a Fusion Proglide (manual). It came in a kit with bodywash, deodorant and face lotion.     Well, the razor is a MAJOR pain in the face. I find it shaves like the old BIC disposables. I have not had razor burn this bad in years. In fact, I can not remember having this bad of razor burn, ever. Even the disposable Mach-3 shaves better than this SO-CALLED \\&quot;best most comfortable shave\\&quot;...    I will not be enjoying this misery again. Thank goodness it came with the other stuff or I would feel extremely cheated. As of now, I am just feeling mildly cheated. Do not waste your money on this bit of advertising hype. There is absolutely no improvement over the three bladed razors and in fact is much more UN-comfortable than any razor I have ever used.    I gave it two (2) stars because well, it did shave. But that is about all I can say. Save your money buy a 3 blade razor and forget this FUSION bit of OUCH.</li>
    <li> When I shave, I want two simple but key needs met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Yes, the Proglide is an excellent razor.  I recently had to purchase a disposable razor that 20 years ago would have been considered a premium product.  I was shocked at how differently and more easily the modern razors did their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Yes, again, on the razor feeling solid and easily held.  The tactile sensation of shaving is an important part of the process and experience.  I shave in the shower, and I did not have to fumble about to get the razor just right.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide (which I purchased for under $1 with Amazon coupons) has been the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moving head is something some men may not like, but I like that the head is flexible and swivels back when I press it against my skin. The thin blades on this razor make it feel so smooth when shaving, especially when I use shaving cream. I have moderate facial hair I&#x27;d say, so sometimes I can get away with just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no cons because I haven&#x27;t used a razor that has performed and felt better. It has lasted over a month so far and still works great. It is very durable as well because I&#x27;ve dropped it several times in the shower with no damage done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to others and I will be purchasing another one in the near future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying these. Originally I was only using Schick Quattro and only bought these because they were a good price at the time and I had free prime. Anyway I really like them, they give a really close shave and don&#x27;t cut my face and it&#x27;s easy to get all the hair out by putting it under the faucet. I just use it to shave my neck and cheeks since I have a goatee but it does a really good job of it, super smooth.</li>
    <li> This razor is good for beards 1 to 3 days old.It cannot handle anything longer than that as the blades are very close to each other and requires short strokes,otherwise gets clogged very easily.It does not come no where near a Mach 3 when it comes to condition i mentioned above,in cases where you shave daily or alternate day it is way superior to a Mach3 and as advertised it has less tug and pull.I would recommend investing some more dollars for a different package which comes with a razor stand,as this one here does not come with one.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor to finally try out something newer than my Mach3. It works great...just gotta find deals on the cartridges now.</li>
    <li> I started like most others with the single edged shaver.  Progressed to the dual blade ... then the triple blade ... the Quattro ... and now Fusion.  It just keeps getting closer and smoother.  Why doesn&#x27;t someone just jump to the 10-blade razor and save some marketing dollars along the way?  Oh yeah ... planned obsolence.  Good razor nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Some years ago, Gillette had sent me one of these. I&#x27;ve used it to the point where the rubber on the handle was falling off. Got this one to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is about what you expect; sturdy with rubbery parts for better grip. The head it comes with wasn&#x27;t very good though; I needed to go over a spot several times before it was smooth. Fortunately the handle can use other types of heads (I find that the Mach 3 heads work better).</li>
    <li> The razor felt really nice at first but, it began giving out rather quickly after the second use. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I use it once or twice a week or what. Either ways it was nice to try.</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves almost no razor bumps, haven&#x27;t gotten any minor cuts or anything and leaves a clean shave.  Buying a better product for a few more bucks seriously makes a difference.  With a generic razor, I can usually see the hair growing back in 1-2 days - with this one, it takes a few more days then usual and actually enjoying shaving it as it is almost pain free.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good razor in its own right, but after using the powered, vibrating Proglide, it&#x27;s hard to switch back. Maybe I became lazy from use or some other cause, but I actually had a few nicks when trying this one out the first time, but uses after that went well and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I got this with a special offer, barely over three dollars, I&#x27;ve been using cheap razors my entire life, and sometimes I&#x27;m simply reluctant to shave because it hurts to shave.  When I saw this product on the tv commercial, where they just randomly break into a men&#x27;s locker to let people try their razors, I thought their claim about how it just glides is probably just as ridiculous as the ad itself, but when I first used this razor, I honestly just wanted to tell everyone: \\&quot;it glides!\\&quot;, the shave was incredibly smooth, even though I didn&#x27;t apply shaving cream, and it gives a very close shave, no leftover stubs whatsoever.  I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you can catch it on a deal, it is usually about 10+ dollars in target/walmart, amazon has it much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Although the head of the razor is a little large, it is very agile and conforms to the chin and neck very easily. I recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Slides like butter. A lot better than the previous Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;This is my third time buying it, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d try any other razor until Gillette comes out with a new one.</li>
    <li> Razor is nice and gives a smooth shave. I find that if I wait a few days before shaving I have a little bit of a trouble with a smoother shave. The blade lasts quite a few times. I have had better quality from Gillette before, I just feel for the price I should expect more.</li>
    <li> The cost of blades is higher that the fusion blades.Just felt that the fusion blades lasted longer that these proglide blades.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using the fusion proglide, switching from the mach 3.  I ended up switching back and forth between the proglide and the mach 3; the proglide definitely gives me a more comfortable, closer shave than the mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the difference between the two are minor.  If money is an issue for you, you likely should stay with the mach 3 as the cost difference may not be worth it to you.</li>
    <li> A solid product, been using this for years, nicely designed, sharp blades, does the job every time! No Complain here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it before and I liked it a lot. So When I needed another for travel, I had to go straight for it.</li>
    <li> Great razor it lasted for weeks. Worth buying. It has a really smooth shave. For the price it is really good.</li>
    <li> This one is just awesome! Give great shave with just one &#x27;swish&#x27;. Just like Harry Potter&#x27;s wand would do the trick in just one swish!</li>
    <li> These were my go to blades until I realized they are pretty much the same as the ones dollar shave club uses.  Save your money.  Razor blades have become a racket.</li>
    <li> Received, I feel very satisfied, it is just what I need, will be coming!Thanks to amazon&#x27;s service, delivery speed and the quality of the personnel of the service, as well as the quality of the goods and after-sale and so on are worth relying on, I hope you do better!</li>
    <li> Some guys just don&#x27;t want to use an electric razor but have a tough beard and tender skin that&#x27;s easily nicked and bleeds forever! This razor saved face.</li>
    <li> I am a woman with very dark hair everywhere. For years, I would buy cheap packs of disposable razors because whenever I bought a reusable razor, I felt that the razor dulled just as fast and wasn&#x27;t any better.    So, I was stuck with shaving my unsightly hair every other day. It was a pain! I picked up this razor one day on a whim after seeing their advertisements, and I am so happy that I did.      - The razor has a convenient rubber grip so it is very easy to hold on to. It is the perfect size (for my hand atleast).     - The razor glides extremely smoothly against the skin. No tug and pull, no stopping -- I was able to do one complete, quick movement up my leg with ease.     - Now, here&#x27;s the best part : I have never EVER had a razor cut my hair so closely or make my skin feel so smooth. My skin felt like I just rubbed lotion all over it -- so silky. And even better...I no longer have to shave every other day!</li>
    <li> This has proven to be an excellent purchase, it shaves incredibly close without irritation. Exactly what I was looking for when I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I love this Gillette product, manual one is always good because I don&#x27;t see more use of power when you save, it will not automatically save after all, you have to drag from top to bottom manually. So always love to shave with manual Fusion blade.</li>
    <li> I had been using this particular brand of razors for a little while and it was pretty good, I switched over to using the schick hydro 5 and like using that a little bit more.  Overall, a razor is pretty much a razor, I have no preference between a hydro 5 or a fusion proglide, which ever is cheaper will do for me.</li>
    <li> The pro glide is a very good product at a great price and is of lasting quality. If you shave in the shower like me and  do not have a lot of stubborn stubble,  shave every other day, this can last about 25-30 shaves without losing its edge. Warm water, while showering softens the facial hair a bit and you don&#x27;t need to repeat the shaving strokes. Just remember that you need to shake off all the excess water on the razor to maintain this edge for that long.&lt;br /&gt;A few gentle strokes of this razor will do the job for most people and the handle is also easy to hold. The cartridges are good and gently conform to the edges of your skin so that you do not need to press hard.&lt;br /&gt;I think this razor can probably last more than 25 shaves.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp, what else we can say about a razor? It;s good. Well, it&#x27;s hard to think of more words.</li>
    <li> I love this razor and with a $3.00 off coupon, I love it even more! It doesn&#x27;t get plugged up like Schick razors do and the trimmer blade on the back of the razor is great for sideburns! No complaints!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years and they are my preferred brand.  They are decent quality and provide a nice shave.  It is disappointing how expensive these have gotten...but I guess we can say that about everything these days.</li>
    <li> Good price - good razor.  Works the way it&#x27;s supposed to without tearing up my face. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than the regular Fusion series though but I bought it to replace my Fusion handle which broke and wouldn&#x27;t keep the razor head locked in place any longer.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor is great. However, how we went from a single blade per the barber to 5 blades I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> Yea that what I am. got this for deal (3.99?). Now I am ordering more expensive fusion proglide blades and enjoying the smooth shave. But the original price got me sucked right in to give up on older Gillette models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the best feature is the back trimmer. takes care of &#x27;stache.</li>
    <li> Got it under a special deal from slickdeals. Worth the money. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to new temp ones this is good.</li>
    <li> Very solid and durable a very nice razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;◘ It shaves my beard in just the right places&lt;br /&gt;◘ nice manly size and weight to it&lt;br /&gt;◘ While shaving I almost felt like I was in an a beer commercial (I dont always shave my manly neckbeard.... but when I do I use a fusion proglide)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;◘ It does not automatically mow your yard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(seriously, it is a good razor)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift.  This razon is very nice as I have one myself.  I recommend it to those who want to have a clear shave.  I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I have been using in the past (among those where Gillette Mach3 and Fusions without the Proglide) as it gives a clean shave with little to no skin irritations. The differences to the &#x27;ordinary&#x27; Gillette Fusion appear to be just minor and the cartridges are interchangable (I tried that). The blades last for quite a while and the only thing preventing me from rating it 5 stars is the expense of replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  This is a stocking stuffer for my grown sons.  I bought items for stockings for my 4 grown children and my 3 grandchild. : )</li>
    <li> I have received several of these razors for free or close to free, thanks to couponing. Since I could never find a better deal on lady&#x27;s razors, I started using this razor to shave my legs, arm pits, and ahem, facial hair (I can&#x27;t be the only lady out there with a few sprouts, right?). Honestly, after using this razor, I have no idea why anyone would want to use a lady razor. Women&#x27;s razors get duller quicker and do not get as close of a shave. I have tried several women&#x27;s razors, even Gilette&#x27;s Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide lasts quite a while. I would say 2-3 months with shaving about 4-6 times a week. I think this is a better razor for women to use because it has more razors and is sharper. I have never nicked myself with this razor either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use as many coupons now, but if I can get this razor for less than $3, than I will, since it lasts a long time. My only complaint is that the razor refills are pricey. I might as well just buy another razor at a discounted price than buy the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVE LOVE IT LOTS A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A AAAAA+</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had been using cheap disposables for months when I finally let him use this puppy. From the bathroom I heard him say, &amp;#34;now THAT&#x27;S how a razor should work!&amp;#34; I meant to do side by side comparisons or try to see how many shaves it lasts through, but I got lazy. Maybe on for the next cartridge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if any of the &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; that Gillette is constantly making to it&#x27;s razors makes any difference at all but I do know that their razors work. I have to be clean-shaven for my job and have always used Gillette razors, regardless of the current gimmicky upgrade.</li>
    <li> Got this on a promo i can complain about it works well. I just wish that the blades were cheaper to buy</li>
    <li> Good razor, works well.</li>
    <li> He is using this item on his day to day use, he always loves all gillette items, specially he liked fusion proglide both manual and automatic. So I got this one in deal on amazon and order one for him. Thanks</li>
    <li> After buying couple of Gillette fusion proglide razors and realized big quality difference between blades come with razor and blades seperately bought.&lt;br /&gt;Blades comes with razor are in good quality and last longer than blades which boughts seperately. I am surprised with results and quality difference..</li>
    <li> I recently started using Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual 1 Up Razor and honestly I loved it. I don&#x27;t have rough skin anymore and gives wonderful smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Been using Gillete fusion blades for years now. They last the longest even when they become dull. They are worth the money!</li>
    <li> This shaving razor by Gillette gives me a pretty good shave and I nick myself noticeably less when I use it--that&#x27;s all very good. It also allows me to shave hard to reach and tricky areas much better than standard, run of the mill shavers that I can get at any local supermarket. However, it&#x27;s still no way out if you&#x27;re looking for something that will let you shave somewhat less frequently; and when I use it I do still occasionally nick myself. Overall, I do recommend this shaving razor but keep in mind that it&#x27;s not completely perfect for the reasons I mentioned. Nevertheless, one of the better shaving razors available out there.</li>
    <li> I used to hate shaving. Not anymore! This razor is prefect. I&#x27;m serious people, you will not be disappointed with this razor.    You can say goodbye to cuts and razor bumps with the Proglide Fusion. If you have a problem with razor bumps like I did, here are some tips:    1. For the best results, don&#x27;t shave for a week before the first time you use the Proglide Fusion. This will allow for many of your razor bumps to heal.  2. Shave in a hot shower. This will open up your pores and make shaving easier.  3. Don&#x27;t press the razor hard to your face/neck. Use gentle short swipes as the super thin blades do not require you to gash your face in order to get a close shave.    You should also note that this razor has a single blade trimmer on the back side for areas that require precision such as side burns and under the nose.    The refills may be expensive, but they are worth it. You can use them several times before they need to be replaced.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no doubt the proglide version of the Gillette fusion is outstanding. But is it sigificantly better than the original fusion? This is what I&#x27;ve found. I shave in the shower, warm water, using a unscented Gillette shaving gel. The handle of the proglide has a slightly different shape, more of a knob at the end. I suppose the knobv makes it easier to grasp the end of the razor when making gentle swipes alog the skin, sort of an artist at work. But the handle of the original fusion is also okay, and I don&#x27;t think the new handle is much of an improvement, if any. The blades in  the cartridge are great, more than marginally better than the original. A few easy swipes do the job for most of the face. I&#x27;ve found the razor shaves closer than the original about the neck and above the upper lip. Result is the shave time is quicker with a good result. I also believe a proglide cartridge will last longer than the fusion. I&#x27;ve used one cartridge for about twenty shaves, and so far it is doing the job. thus, since the cartridge seems to give more shaves, that fact ought to offset the extra cost. Bottom line is, the new proglide fusion is great, better than the original, but since the original fusion cartridges also do a great jobb, I plan to use them up before switching over to the proglide.    Update april 2011 - I think the proglide works best for men who shave every day, and against the grain for a close shave. The blades are thin and close and work best with short hairs. When shaving with two or more days of growth, hthen it&#x27;s best to first shave downward, with the grain, and then up against the grain to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> this item is good for me  i love it so much  the price is suit for me  i lke it</li>
    <li> Great price on a great product!  And I didn&#x27;t even have to go to Walmart!  What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything more I can say about a razor. It does it&#x27;s job and does it well. never leaves my skin rough, always smooth</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t need it but bought it as a spare. Got it on time and it&#x27;s a good product. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I haven&#x27;t even shaved with this thing, but was disappointed with what it included. Basically, I was just looking for a replacement handle for my regular fusion cartridges, because I left mine in the locker room. I read that it should fit the older cartridges, and for $3 bucks, I figured it was a good deal. My disappointment came when I opened the package from Amazon today and realized that it did not have a tray/holder for the razor/handle to sit on. I don&#x27;t want this thing loose in my bag, and was expecting it to have something for it to sit in. I&#x27;m sure it will shave great tomorrow!</li>
    <li> It is noticeably lighter than the Mach 3.  Maybe this is obvious and I am the only idiot that didn&#x27;t know but I think it should be made more clear that the Mach 3 and Fusion cartridges are NOT compatible.</li>
    <li> I always used the Hydro 5 before this and never had a problem. I decided to go with this since Amazon had a coupon to get this for like $2 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, this does shave well to make you smooth but I find it cuts me way too easily. It kind of &#x27;grabs&#x27; your skin in certain areas and cuts it. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle on this razor is nice, however. So that&#x27;s a plus, I guess.</li>
    <li> В моем городе это стоит порядка 600- 700 рублей, здесь же на сайте в разы дешевле. я купил себе и отцу и мы довольны.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have sensitive skin that is a pain to shave, but this is so smooth that I can shave with it every day with no problems. It doesn&#x27;t provide as close a shave as the previous blades I have used, but it is so smooth that I can quickly and comfortably shave everyday which is better that a ruff shave very other day of so.</li>
    <li> This is the favorite razor of our family, everyone loves it. Works great, easy to clean and stylish. And also a good gift.</li>
    <li> I normally use an electric shaver and I bought this one only to shave after I skip the whole week or a few days in a row and just like it advertises, you barely feel that it&#x27;s shaving. Really nice.</li>
    <li> Description says that the product comes with 2 cartridges, but it had just 1 that comes by default with the razor.</li>
    <li> I had a 3 day shave and it hurt my skin. However, for a daily shave it is good and its easy to rinse in the water.</li>
    <li> I use sensor excel and after using this love my sensor excel better. This one pulls the skin. Even though it may give smoother shave but I can&#x27;t stand the pull of the skin.</li>
    <li> Only razor I can use. The rest cut up my face like crazy.</li>
    <li> The shave is smooth when compared to other razors and blades.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves these!  Prices are good too</li>
    <li> I use an electric razor.  But when I use a blade, it&#x27;s this one.  It&#x27;s amazing how well and painless it cuts compared to everything else I&#x27;ve used (prior Gillette and Schick razors).  If it weren&#x27;t for the high cost of blades, I would even consider switching from electric.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Mach 3 for a few years now...&lt;br /&gt;This one is definitely an excellent upgrade. Gives a very close shave and handles shaving against the grain well.</li>
    <li> I have gifted this to my husband recently. he was a fan of fusion manual but after using proglide he seems to be enjoying his morning routine in a better way.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is no doubt a worldwide leader in  the shaving blade technology. 5Star would be less for Gillette.</li>
    <li> Overall its a good razor. I personally find that the Proglide can pull a bit more than other razors that I have used. Other than that though it works well and lasts for a long time. However if I had to choose a razor it would be a Schick.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor and Cartridge is awesome! This is a great buy and I am very satisfied. It shaves well, the razor cartridge is replaceable, and it stays sharp for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit, which includes the stick, two razor cartridge heads, and a stand with holder for 2 heads, 2 months ago. I use these razors to trim and line up my beard, and to shave my head, and each razor lasted for a month. I think that&#x27;s astonishing, considering that I use this razor to shave my WHOLE head every, or every other day, and basically shave my neck and line up my beard every other day with it too. That&#x27;s a pretty amazing deal if you think about it. All you&#x27;ve got to do, is use a good shaving cream, with a rich lather, and it&#x27;ll work great, for a close shave that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Proglide is the most comfortable and smoothest safety razor I&#x27;ve ever used in over five decades of on and off wet shaving. I am finally to put away my electic shaver--it cannot compare with the closeness or comfort of the Proglide. Yes, cartridges are expensive compared to double-edge blades. But I&#x27;ve yet to find a DE razor that is as comfortable as the Proglide, and this includes a Feather DE razor. You can reduce the cost of cartridges by signing up for Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save plan. At the time of this review I am saving 50 cents per cartridge by going on Amazon&#x27;s plan. The Proglide is much different from the former model, Gillette&#x27;s Fusion, which was no where near as effective or as comfortable a razor. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin, the Proglide handles both with ease, it&#x27;s a pleasure to shave in the morning. I occasionally use my Feather DE razor, it&#x27;s the purist in me, but none of my DE razors can match the performance of the Proglide. For the record, I use a Jagger small super badger brush [[ASIN:B003UV8LPW Edwin Jagger 9ej257sds Handmade Imitation Ivory Shaving Brush with Drip Stand, Ivory, Small]] and mug filled with Williams Shave Soap, occasionally I&#x27;ll use Proraso shave cream [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream 5.2 oz (147 g)]]. I am getting two extra Proglides to keep on hand in the event Gillette changes the design. This is simply the best safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Oct. 11, 2011--Compared to Schick Hydro 5, Proglide Rates #1&lt;br /&gt;This morning I did a shaving comparison between the Schick Hydro 5 and the Gillette Proglide Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package (manual razors). First off I shaved with my Feather razor with a Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Double Edge Blades (green package). I love the construction of the Feather razor; but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close and as comfortably as the Proglide of the Hydro 5. So, after shaving with the double-edge razor, I rinsed, relathered, and had at it with the Hydro 5; I did feel a bit of pulling, even on the remaining stubble. It cleaned only some stubble left by the double edge shave. But, I still felt a lot of stubble, the shave was not skin close. Then I rinsed, relathered and had at it with the Proglide. The Gillette cleaned everything to the skin with exceptional comfort. I had to try the Schick after reading these reviews, but for me, and shaving is a matter of personal preference, I know. But with sensitive skin and a tough beard, for me the Gillette Proglide out-shaved the Hydro 5. For the record, I use a badger brush, mug with Williams shave soap, and a preshave cream. I only wish the expensive Feather razor worked as well as the Proglide--so it goes. I&#x27;m submitting this as one guy&#x27;s experience and opinion--perhaps it will help.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor. Smooth and clean. It&#x27;s perfect except for the delayed delivery. I like manual razor rather than electric ones. Anyway, the product itself is very good.</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t know when razors got so expensive, and this is no exception. I also wasn&#x27;t happy with the sharpness and durability. I bought the power version and was much happier. [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]]  I didn&#x27;t think that a vibrating razor would result in a better shave, but it definitely has. Spend the extra 60 cents and go for the power model instead of this. If you don&#x27;t like the power, use it and you&#x27;ll have the same razor, only a bit heavier.</li>
    <li> I only pick these up when I find a good deal on them. They provide a closer shave then my Philips-Norelco electric shaver, which I feel is necessary on special occasions, so I have to have at least one cartridge ready to go</li>
    <li> Great shave. I wish the regular price was a little lower and I didn&#x27;t have to look for coupons to &#x27;clip&#x27; on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Better than I expected. High quality.</li>
    <li> Great blade. It does what it meant to do without any problems. one of the best shavers ever!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he seems to always leave his razors behind when he stays at a hotel for business.  I purchased this because it was a better deal on Amazon than buying it from my local store.  I would definitely recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> Good product !!!,&lt;br /&gt;Good product !!!&lt;br /&gt;Good product !!!&lt;br /&gt;Good product !&lt;br /&gt;Good product !!!&lt;br /&gt;Good product !&lt;br /&gt;Good product I love it</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with a Mach 3 razor and was satisfied with the razor and Mach 3 turbo blades. I thought I would try the Proglide after reading reviews to see if it would give me a closer shave. I have been using it for about a month and not as yet changed the blades that came with the razor. I am very satisfied and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Not only are the shaves close and smooth....but the blades seems to last&lt;br /&gt;forever ! Just keep get the water off the Blade set-up after the shave and&lt;br /&gt;these blades last a month or more !!</li>
    <li> I happen to have received this through a program run by Gillette and let me tell you this is the most enjoyable blade i have ever used since my first time shaving when i was 18.The handle is very groovy and comfortable for my hand.The blade was so smooth while using i did not even know that i was finished shaving the first side of my face.In the past i have felt other blades pull on my facial hair when i used them,but this blade i did not experience that at all.</li>
    <li> At first I was questioning how much better the new Gillette Fusion Proglide could be when compared to their other products. I received the handle for free in exchange for my review of the product and am happy I did so because this handle rocks! The quality of the razor handle seems to be substantially better than other products I have tried and seems as though it could last a lifetime. The increased grip capability really helps hold onto the razor even when its wet and covered with shaving cream. I can&#x27;t see myself using any other razors in the near future as the Gillette Fusion Proglide is made to last. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> I am the most cutting-prone person I know when it comes to shaving. Generally look like the victim of a knife attack, not a shave! After dozens of shaves, I&#x27;ve yet to have a single knick! Best razor I have ever used!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is one fine razor.  Beats the heck out of my first razor, a so-called safety razor with the flat, double-sided blade.  Each time Gillette introduces a new razor I keep thinking that this is it, no more innovation left.  Then they introduce the next one and again I stand in awe of the latest improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like this razor, not for the four blades but for the single blade on the top reverse side of the shaving head.  This small blade is perfect for the upper lip and in close to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the lack of a case or stand or something to hold the razor when not in use or for travel.  Not much good to toss the razor into the Dopp kit only to have the blade messed up.  All of my previous Gillette razors provided some sort of stand, case or something to hold the razor when not in use.  How much could it have cost for some simple plastic base that would lock the handle into the case?</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He really likes these razors. they are his favorite razors to use daily</li>
    <li> When on sale, it&#x27;s a win!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, very easy to clean</li>
    <li> When I first heard the ProGlide was coming out, I was a bit skeptical on how it could be that much better than the regular Fusion. As is turned out, the ProGlide is better and noticeably so. There is definitely much less resistance when sliding this across my face. It also seems like I&#x27;m been getting a closer shave. The best part of the ProGlide is that your can use your old Fusion handles to attach the blades onto. No need to buy special ProGlide handles. The only bad part that I have noticed so far is that the ProGlide seems to wear down much faster than the old Fusion. I have to replace the ProGlide blades about a week earlier than I used to with the old Fusion. The Razor &amp; cartidge were provided via a program run by Gillette and was free of charge to me, over all the product does as it says &amp; provides a close shave free of irritation.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide via a program run by Gillette.  The handle has a lot of curves and rubberized grips but, in the long run, it&#x27;s just a handle.  It holds the blades and is easy to remove and replace.  When I turn the handle to get to different areas of my face it doesn&#x27;t always feel natural in my hand.  But I guess it&#x27;s probably difficult if not impossible to create a shape that feels great in every hand position.  Also, if you have an old Gillette Fusion handle already, there&#x27;s no need to purchase a new one to use the ProGlide blades.  They&#x27;ll fit your old handle and really, the blades are the star of the ProGlide razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide give a comfortable, close shave.  In comparison to the Schick Quatro, which is my current razor, it&#x27;s about the same or slightly better.  However, the handle of the Gillette is smaller and harder to hold.  The Schick comes with a plastic tray that holds the razor and a sleeve of cartridges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback is the cost of replacement cartridges.  The price on Amazon for 8 Gillette cartridges is $30.97 or $3.87 each.  The price for 8 Schick cartridges is $12.99 or $1.62 each.  I don&#x27;t know how long a Gillete cartridge will last since I&#x27;ve just started using it but I get about three month&#x27;s use from each Schick Cartridge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of the electrified fusion razors and I decided to try this. It seems to be slightly better, though I think I prefer the electric version, or would, if I had it for this model. Still, I&#x27;m happy with the shave it gives me.</li>
    <li> I like this gillette Fusion product. It&#x27;s cheap and works well. This is my second purchase and suggest to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was using MACH3 for long time and wife suggested to change to different one. This is huge upgrade from MACH3 and really worth it, smooth and clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mach 3 for about 6 years and it was good; then moved to a Philips aqua shaver which was good too... I had heard a lot about this, so bought it... and i am impressed.. the closest shave ever. Even against the grain, you wont feel a thing...</li>
    <li> This razor is one of the best on the market.  Gives you a very clean and smooth shave, not much more to say about it.  Its a simple razor.</li>
    <li> I got this as a complement for another gift and it worked out well. Although not the fancy vibrating one, still a nice razor at a great price.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THESE FOR A COUPLE YEARS.  TRIED OTHERS WHEN I GOT A DECENT COUPON. NO COMPARISON. WATCH FOR THESE IN THE $7 RANGE AND BUY A COUPLE. CANT SEEM TO BRING MYSELF TO BUY THE CARTRIDGES.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to a hot towel and a professional shave. Use this with a quality shaving cream and a brush for maximum effectiveness. Is there a straight razor and strop in your future? If not, get this.</li>
    <li> Never a problem,Always Dependable and last for quite a few shaves.even better than the power versions.would recommend  to all my friends.</li>
    <li> love it… perfect for girl too… It last me for almost a year way better than women razor. cleaner and more precise hair removal without cutting myself.</li>
    <li> Connects my hands to lazer sharpened pieces of metal meant for face scraping exceedingly well.</li>
    <li> The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because of the OUTREAGEOUS prices of new cartridges. But the razor itself is top flight...smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I use it along with a reasonably priced store brand razor so as to preserve length of time each cartridge lasts. i still shave every day; but on those days I don&#x27;t need to &amp;#34;look my best&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll use the store brand disposable. But whenever I need to look/feel my very best, this razor is THE choice, hands down.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was on sale and needed a spare for travel. Gillette fusion Proglide Manual Razor !@</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide manual razor  that was from a program from the company itself. The package said it&#x27;s #1 for sensitive skin which was great for me to see since I have sensitive skin and I get razor bumps from using razors. I decided to try it out anyway, along with some shaving gel for sensitive skin. After lathering the cream I went to work. I only shaved under my chin to test if I would have a reaction. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t. The last manual razor I used was a Mach3 and it was good but the Fusion ProGlide was much better. The handle is easy on the hand. Very comfortable in fact. The four blades makes shaving easier in one take, by the extra blades catching missed, small strands. The precision trimmer blade was great for the end of my chin/ beginning of under chin to make it even. I didn&#x27;t experience any tugging with this razor. One stroke from this razor and it was smooth and very close. Before trying this razor I shaved with trimmers because they are convenient but I never cared too much for the results. I&#x27;m not sure if the lubricating strip helped with no bumps or the thinner blades  but I guess it did in combination with the gel I used. It&#x27;s been 3 days and not bumps or growth yet. I&#x27;m pleased. I think I found my new best (grooming) friend.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette guy through out my adult life - razors, shave cream et all. I have used the old school (&#x27;safety razor&#x27;--[[ASIN:B0050HO9MI Silver Double Shaver Nonslip Handle]] and I have used several electric razors too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is by far the best razor I have ever used and best shave I ever got!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wanted to test it&#x27;s limits, I went on and on. First cartridge lasted 2 1/2 months until I got a rash. Now, each one lasts 1 month easily.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using 2-blade disposable razors for years. Lots of spots get easily missed and skin gets cut. It makes him want to shave less. Got him this razor. He hadn&#x27;t shaved in almost a week. Direct quote, &amp;#34;That new razor is great. That was the best shave of my life.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> At first this razor glided over my skin and caused less irritation than the Mach 3 Turbo I&#x27;ve been using for years. But the slippery green strip on the razor which seems to provide most of the lubrication lasts for all of about 2 shaves before it&#x27;s shot. Once it&#x27;s shot, the shave is very uncomfortable. So if I stick with this razor it&#x27;s going to cost me about two bucks a day just to shave. I&#x27;m probably better off with the Mach 3 (also overpriced but not as high) and living with the red bumps all over my neck.</li>
    <li> i love this razor! best shave ever!&lt;br /&gt;no cuts, no burn, smooth, very comfortable to use. better than girls&#x27; one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shavers, many brands, but this - Gillette is the best. Cuts very smooth, easy to rinse and with extra blade on the back even more functional.</li>
    <li> If you shave daily get this. Its not cheap. One tip, keep the blade dry after shaving. Shake it vigorously after washing it in hot water.</li>
    <li> This one really works - I was surprised and very impressed. The replacement blades are expensive but I use a Razor Saver so that&#x27;s not a problem!</li>
    <li> Love the smooth face post shaving.</li>
    <li> GIllette got me as a Freshman in college with their new Mach 3 (I was using the disposable 2 blade razors) in a free sample to all incoming freshman. I could never go back to the 2 bladed razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a recent coupon from Amazon and thier &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item, I had to try this one out for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now say, I will never be able to go back to the 3 bladed razors now.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is smooth, no drag (unless you let your beard build up and since my hair is so thick and coarse, it tends to drag if I go more than 2 days without shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used every day, this thing is effortless and I get no razor burn from it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I prefer heavy razor handles, some momentum helps when plowing through 2 day&#x27;s of stubble. Hate the cartridge price, but do love the Fusion system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the chrome, blue, and black color scheme. Whatever genius executive at Gillette who thought orange would be a classy color for a men&#x27;s razor must have been hired away from Hasbro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there were more rubber patches on the handle part. My bathroom has a nice ceramic pedestal sink, unfortunately the soap bar flats are angled for drainage. When I put the razor on one of the flats while I make coffee, most of the time the razor very slowly slides itself off the flat into the bowl. Clank!</li>
    <li> For a disposable, this is a great razor and I concur with other posters. Takes few strokes to get a good shave, and it&#x27;s very smooth even when I use a face wash instead of shaving cream.  The only downside here is the cost of blade refills.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as the second one of this make and model.  This was done because of the performance of the original... Unfortunately, it could have been bought locally for less money... good history with Amazon led me to believe their price would be best... NOT... I am now a wiser consumer...</li>
    <li> I have used different versions of gillette for a long time and this is very good. It remains sharp even after 10 shaves</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over how much closer of a shave I&#x27;m getting with this new ProGlide over the older original \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; I had been using.  It&#x27;s night and day.  I recommend this x1000.</li>
    <li> Gillette razors I have been using , after the morning run , I feel very comfortable day .Will use it later Good product</li>
    <li> Best among existing... I don&#x27;t like any other after having this... but they made as addictive...</li>
    <li> I took the advise of others and purchased on size smaller in the waist fits great. Color as ordered. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> This razor is comfortable on the skin, glides well, and provides a close shave. Additionally it has a nice amount of weight so it helps the natural motion of the razor.</li>
    <li> Great Design, Nice shave..&lt;br /&gt;- -- -- -- ---- - - -- - - - --  -- - - - -</li>
    <li> As much as I like them though, they are very expensive to own. That being said, usually the best shave I get.</li>
    <li> The problem with this kind of razors is the price of the blades. However, this is a great product bought on sale</li>
    <li> This is probably the best razor on the market today for every day shaving. It keeps its edge longer and with proper care, WIPING CLEAN WITH TISSUE AFTER EACH USE,,,, Baby oil on blade...lasts a VERY VERY LONG TIME......</li>
    <li> I shave 2 to 3 times a week. Feel that it is a little bit better than Mach 3. But I would say they are similar, with good quality.</li>
    <li> This razor works well, I still prefer the Mach 3 for What seems to be a closer shave. That being said I would buy it again if the price was good because overall it was a good razor.</li>
    <li> Gillette probably makes the best shavers for past 45 Years. Tried different brands and come back to the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the Best since recently had a chance to try Track II. How did we all use it and thought then it was good enough!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve own several of these razors and they are always great.  Package includes single razor and blade, not the two blades on most packages at the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this manual razor for years and it&#x27;s about as well-designed as it could be.  Never had the slightest problem with it and I like how I can just push a button to eject an old cartridge and slide/snap right into a new blade.  I also like the blade storage under the razor cradle.  I bought an extra one to leave in my travel kit,  just wrapped in a washcloth.  I already reviewed the actual blade cartridge itself, so this is about the handle (5-stars for both), but if U R wondering about the blades, THEY&#x27;RE GREAT !!!</li>
    <li> This is the only razor I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all) that allows me to shave my neck without getting razor burn and bumps.  The FlexBall version of this razor is terrible, in my opinion.  The head moves too much and it causes nicks and irritation.  The manual, original version of the ProGlide is the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  I use Nivea sensitive shave gel and post-shave balm.</li>
    <li> This is the product used by family.  Plus I needed a ad on  for my purschase. Every male needs a razor.</li>
    <li> I had been using BIC disposable razors, but my last BICs were terrible.  This razor is very good.  It provides a smooth shave and the design allows for trimming the sideburns and under the nose.</li>
    <li> I have had a great experience so far with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle. It follows the face very easily and shaves very smoothly. Also it&#x27;s easy to hold and came with a nice holder that fits extra shaving heads. I received the product from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I am spoiled now, best razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to use.I still like the product.I bought back perhaps to spare no power this thing comes in Dayong.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these razors and this seems to be a very good deal. Even at Walmart with a coupon, these are $7.99 in my area. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Very good shave.  Works better than the Mach3 which I previously used.  Don&#x27;t yet know how many shaves I&#x27;ll get from 1 cartridge.</li>
    <li> I bought these off one of those daily deal sites and have never been so disappointed in a razor.  The blades clog with one pass over a two-day growth and scrape/tear stubble off on anything more than a 2-day growth.  There is no greater degree of closeness of the shave with these redundant-blade razors over a typical double-blade disposable of your choice.  In fact, I find these razors really only last for about 3-4 shaves versus the typical 6-7 that I can get from a twin-blade disposable.  The weight of the razor and the solid feel is nice, but not worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is the absolute top of the line in disposable blade shavers, Hands DOWN! The Gillette not only shaves better but looks better too! If you want to be impressed and impress your friends,spouses listen to me! Get this and try it once. That is all it takes to know what you have been missing.\\&quot;For once I was blind,now I see\\&quot;! You wont even beleive how fast this is to shave either. Dare I say \\&quot;you will look forward to shaving again\\&quot;. Go to the store tell them you want the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> five blades, good razor, smooth shave, nice flow and feels nice in my hand - smaller hands so that was nice.</li>
    <li> Gillette gave me this razor to try. By far this is the best razor I have ever used. It give me a nice smooth shave with no effort. I will never use a mach 3 again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman but no other razor has worked this well for me. It&#x27;d either be a close shave OR gentle, never both.. until this one! I never get nicks or cuts anymore, and the razor leaves me smooth for a lot longer than any other. It&#x27;s a def buy</li>
    <li> I was given a free razor from a program that Gillette was running.  This razor is amazing.  The handle alone gives me much more control over my shave.  Because of the grip I can get every last spot that I need to shave.  The handle is a bit larger than most razors I have used in the past but it has given me much better control of my shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best &#x27;standard&#x27; razor - hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives a very close shave with no nicks or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single blade trimmer on the back of the blades is great for precise work around facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as well as my Merkur but much easier and safer.  8)</li>
    <li> I like it! As always...</li>
    <li> This is my hubby favorite toy... He use it for his head... yeap for shaving his head and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Okay, not any better than my Mach 3.  I thought I would see what all of the commercials are about. Works fine, but with the high cost of replacement razors, you are better off spending your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby for a stocking stuffer. He had been using the same razor for years, I thought this would be new and improved and it is. The spot on his neck that he always seemed to miss is now smooth as the rest of his face. He loves it.</li>
    <li> These truly are the best of the Gillette razors.  They glide pretty well over your face.  And they last quite a while.  The older blade styles wore out much faster than these do. Very close shave and very comfortable.  Overall highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and the blades can be used at least 3 or more times before disposing in my own personal experience. My only complaint is the price but with the quality of shave, I&#x27;m willing to part with the $.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to either rave or rant about such a mundane product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good. it&#x27;s fine. but i am not tweeting how awesome it is.  because i find myself hard pressed to classify this as... awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here goes the mandatory pros/cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;- weighty feel.  the thing is heavy in a good way&lt;br /&gt;- hangs well on my razor hanger thingy i have in my bathroom&lt;br /&gt;- press the button, and the razor cartridge pops out: how exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- my pet peeves of all commercial razor systems:  they have all this lubra-strip/wonder-glide/gel-strip stuff above the razor blades that wastes space.  it eats up about a 1/8 of an inch of the cartridge.  what that does is that it prevents you from getting a blade right under your nose.  aargh.&lt;br /&gt;- they claim these are ultra ultra ultra thin blades.  not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing.  sounds like the blades will go dull quick.  but i am not expert</li>
    <li> The problem with most multiple blade razor designs is that the first blade cuts and the next 4 proceed to rip the hair out of your face. If I were of thinner facial hair I would be pleased and able to contend with this issue, but due to my thick facial hair I am in pain everytime I use a blade over one. This means that the cheapest blades in the aisle are the safest to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like it with the chrome handle and the ergonomic handle, but alas I would sooner ask for a cheap square handle than a facial hair ripper.</li>
    <li> This razor is very good. Has a good handling very close shave to face that hair grows in every direction. I got this razor for free to test and I am very happy with it. It takes little bit longer to share the electric shaver but much better closer shave. I am very happy with it would definitely recommend it to any one.</li>
