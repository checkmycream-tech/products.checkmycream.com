<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these lashes, I enjoy wearing them and there comfortable! Great for everyday or a girls night out I am ordering more!</li>
    <li> These are much thicker than what the picture shows. They&#x27;re like comically thick. They look awful on and don&#x27;t bend well to sit on your lashes. The picture is misleading of how thick they are.</li>
    <li> they are ways too long for me very un-natural</li>
    <li> I used almost all of them!</li>
    <li> Cheap. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Lashes were not natural looking as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> I just received them just now even tho they said it was going to come around in a month, anyways they look exactly like they show in the picture and they don&#x27;t look that dramatic. I actually love how it looks on me :D honestly i would&#x27;ve gave it a 5 if the box didn&#x27;t look all torn and beat up but at least the 10 lashes looks good in order ;)</li>
    <li> very stiff and hard to put on!  not worth it at all.  I ended up throwing them all out. great concept ..bad product</li>
    <li> way to heavy to place on eyelashes. Eyes feel weighed down! They look un-natural and not believable that they are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking!</li>
    <li> They are sort of large, and a little like halloween lashes. I assume they would be perfect for some people with larger eyes and lashes. Mine, however, are small and light and these look a bit ridiculous on me. I will probably wear them for halloween, or cut them into pieces to use at the very corners of my eyes.</li>
    <li> These lashes are so stiff and hard to put on. They do not shape well to your eye. Don&#x27;t spent your money, they took forever to come in. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> There Is Not Much To Say About Them But,They Are Beautiful And Last Long I Really Like Them I Had The For A While And Im Still On The First Pair...Long Lasting</li>
    <li> I ordered these for a vacation and they took over three weeks to come in. When I received then the boxes was crushed and some of the lashes were bent and frayed. Out of all the ones in the box I could salvage three pairs of lashes. They shipped from somewhere in China and I&#x27;m assuming they were in ok condition when they left and got damaged in the mail but they were shipped in a thin box that was placed in an envelop.What did I pay the extra money for shipping for if they were shipped cheaply and poorly? I would recommend paying a little more for a different set. DON&#x27;T BUY THESE.</li>
    <li> These are very uncomfortable, stiff and they almost itch your eyeslids.They are also much thicker and fuller than they look on line .The band that the lashes are attached too seems too thick and made it difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> These lashes were great also - easy to apply and GREAT quality I really cannot say enough about what a bargain they were - packaged very nice - go on clean - a GREAT deal  Love them</li>
    <li> Worst eyelashes everrrrr!!! Do not waste ur money even if they are cheap!! Ive gotten better eyelashes at walmart. Never again</li>
    <li> It was fast shipping but some of the eyelashes were bent and I had to throw some away cause they were to damaged. A lil disappointed&#x3D;\</li>
    <li> I love these alshes as they are easy to apply and last a long time. Unlike alot of other brands these do not ball up if you sleep in them. I have worn my 1st pair for over a week, only relacing the glue twice (a good adhesive makes a difference also). But overall these are awesome, They are a nice length and fullness so they don&#x27;t look like a caterpillar sitting over your eyes, just a nice full semi-natural look. I&#x27;m constantly complimented.</li>
    <li> love them they look so real!</li>
    <li> The packages were alittle squished when they arrived &amp; about 2 pairs were damaged but I had ordered 50 pairs so that didn&#x27;t bother me. I had read the reviews and knew what to expect. If your looking for a perfect lash these are NOT them if you don&#x27;t mind thicker lashes that need trimmed at a very cheap price these are great I think they look very nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item over a month and dtill havent gotten it, im really concerned, usually when i order this it doesnt take this long to get it... I dont even lnowwhere its at... Didnt like it.</li>
    <li> good for nail art or crafts not for wearing</li>
    <li> I purchased this package to practice using false lashes. I was extremely surprised by how easy they were to apply. I have purchased other lashes over the internet and found them not such a value. I just wish they had larger packages. The band wasn&#x27;t too thick or hard to maneuver. They were a good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews on these types of lashes and concern of them being on a \\&quot;string\\&quot; ... I thought they might be \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; when I got them but they do in fact have structure to them and are pliable/moldable if you like to curve them before you put them on.  They do have strings that hang over at both ends, just clip those off.  Actually, I cut almost all my lashes in half anyway so trim work is no big deal.  They are not the greatest quality I&#x27;ve used but considering the number of lashes I go through - they&#x27;re way way worth the price per set.  They seem a little fuller to me in person now that I am looking at the photo but they&#x27;re not far off from the picture.</li>
    <li> Love thee eyelashes fit my eye perfect!! I have a oval eye&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like is having to clip the ends off that stick into the package that they come in. Make sure to clip close to the lashes and make sure they are not sharp when after cutting..&lt;br /&gt;But will be buying again when needed&lt;br /&gt;Have used one pair five or six times after cleaning and re applying :)</li>
    <li> I really liked them. If your the type of person who loves long and full lashes these are a good fit for you!! They aren&#x27;t as heavy as some are. They feel real light. I really recommend this product. I loved mines!</li>
    <li> these lashes are great! they&#x27;re long, pretty &amp; easy to apply. they shipped super fast &amp; overall, i&#x27;m pretty satisfied. you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I received them faster than I thought I would. But I ordered 2 boxes and one box was of some that looked different. A few days later I received another box and it was the right kind. As for the lashes, they were ok. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again though.</li>
    <li> I guess the price does speak for the quality, I thought I was getting two different types of lashes but I didn&#x27;t and the lashes were bent in all different directions.</li>
    <li> I have never been so disappointed with this product it was my first time ordering from them and I wish I never did. There is nothing natural about the</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper option when it came to false lashes, especially when buying a single pair can run anywhere from $7-$12. They were very cheap so I figured I&#x27;d give them a try. Like my title says, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;. The quality is very poor and the length is extremely long. If you want natural looking falsies, these aren&#x27;t it. For someone who doesn&#x27;t mind a huge/cartoonish lash, this will be perfect.</li>
    <li> The lashes didn&#x27;t stick to any glue.. I tried a lot of different glues and they are very hard not soft</li>
    <li> I think they were a little bit too full, for $1 what can you expect, they started falling apart the minute I separated it from the cardboard.</li>
    <li> The lashes are beautiful and really full. I liked the feel of them, Great Job with the shipment. I would order these again</li>
    <li> amazing eyelashes would def buy these again good deal for the price and they look amazing on they make my eyes pop</li>
    <li> They were fine for what I needed them for.  They were a dollar so I was not expecting much but, they were better then I expected.  The shipping was pretty fast.  The box was crushed but, it is to be expected, not an issue, the lashes were fine !</li>
    <li> I like these lashes a lot.  They look just like the picture. Lashes go on very well! I will definitely order these lashes again in the future. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Material is cheap and it&#x27;s packaging is not in English,  it also doesn&#x27;t come with instructions.  The glue wont adhere to the lashes.</li>
    <li> This would make you look natural not too hard to appy..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them at all, looked super fake and they came to my house all flat :( super bummed about it but whatever what can u do. That&#x27;s what u get for ordering online I guess</li>
    <li> I am a sorority woman that orders quite a bit of false lashes &amp; the second I got these I threw them away. I did so b/c there literally is a THICK strip and it is so obvious and so uncomfortable. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use but I had to wait just about a month to get a package that looks like the hulk sat on. Part of it was already open. Most of the eyelashes weren&#x27;t even useable. No glue included and they are not soft, or in any way real like in the feel. They are horribly stiff. I would never buy from these people again. And I would not recommend them to anyone  at all. But I guess you get what you pay for. Next time, I will be buying better ones that are actually made/ship from the USA.</li>
    <li> i love them! i dont have to go to the beauty supply every week to get more! these last for at least 2months! they are reuseable!</li>
    <li> Cute, Cute, Cute! I love them. They arrived very quickly and were just as described. I wouldn&#x27;t hessitate to buy these! Thanks again</li>
    <li> they are more for costume wear they look like plastic but thank  you&#x27; hope they get some better ones next time</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive but definley worth the wait !!! I totally love them I plan on buying some more in the meat future! Great for those special events</li>
    <li> I love love love them!! They&#x27;re easy to put on and look so natural and pretty :) definitely recommended to all!</li>
    <li> These lashes are perfect for day or evening wear. I love them. They are so well&lt;br /&gt;made &amp; have just the right about of hairs in them to look like THE REAL THING!&lt;br /&gt;Very comfy to wear &amp; I would highly recommend these to anyone in BLACK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset, this is the worst product I ever order on amazon and I hate it. I&#x27;m gonna  trash it and please don&#x27;t waste your time to buy this... I know it&#x27;s very cheap but I don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> they r rlly big and dramatic. theyre pretty! they are tho in no way natural looking, as it its too thick and long,, not that its s***ty quality. i rlly like them, but i only use it for cosplay,,</li>
    <li> When I get them I went woah they are very pretty they look great on I love them and the price really cannot be beat .</li>
    <li> These are okay lashes they look kind of plastic and they should be labeled dramatic. They are really thick at the base and would be perfect for dramatic looks they don&#x27;t look natural not for everyday looks</li>
    <li> yes they are all identical but I have problems when it comes to getting them to stick. I add glue and it just wont work. I bought these for practice and ive tryied 3 different glues I wait for it to get tacky and then apply them but it never seems to stay on completely. :/ and yes my package was crushed but the lashes were unharmed</li>
    <li> Great lashes for the price.</li>
    <li> i thought these were going to look very fake but not at all they look just like i use to have mine which i lost due to cancer</li>
    <li> Once you cut them and shape them to your eyes they work quite well! Cheap quality product! They dont itch like most false lashes and with the right glue they stay on all night!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s all smashed!! the box, product...&lt;br /&gt;the lashes are bent and smashed i don&#x27;t think i can use them without cutting the both end of them off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice shape and decent length but very disappointed with shipping and boxing.</li>
    <li> they are extremely frail and fake looking. like doll lashes, actual doll lashes that you glue onto a doll. save your money and buy a nice set of lashes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive my lashes I&#x27;ve waited for 1 month &amp; 1/2&lt;br /&gt;I would of liked it if I got a hold of it.</li>
    <li> First it took a while to get here and when they did I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I could have done cut out lashes on contract paper better than these. They feel like nylon wings or something. I was attracted by the black band and price. At least I&#x27;m not put back for this fail.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use, not natural at all.  Made of hard plastic, was not worse the money spent, I could not use with glue at all.</li>
    <li> Is too hard for my taste but they look good in someone else eyes, thanks&lt;br /&gt;is ok is ok ok</li>
    <li> These lashes are insane. They are huge and long and super thick. Obviously, if you like this in a pair of lashes, then they&#x27;re perfect, but when I bought them, I was not expecting them to be as full and as long. I can&#x27;t wear these anywhere, except maybe for a costume party! I thought they were a lot finer and shorter than they are, so beware! Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great value- but it does not come with glue, so you&#x27;ll have to buy separately.</li>
    <li> These are great for hitting the town or just going out with your man! They are not over the top.</li>
    <li> Came a little early and the lashes are beautiful. Look full but feel thin so they should not be heavy on your eyes.</li>
    <li> They more plastic then natural looking and can be staple to eyelid, because there is NO way they staying on otherwise. I&#x27;m not sure what they are can be used for unless on Barbi doll</li>
    <li> Not a good product and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> personally i did not like these lashes. i dont know if they send me the wrong ones but they were so stiff and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Amazing me and my sister inlaw order these all the time</li>
    <li> the eyelashes were nice and full! and very soft. it is a great buy for the price! I highly recommend purchasing</li>
    <li> These are garbage. They are cheap and do not stay on even with the best glue. Very disappointing. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> These were amazing for the price, but not exactly quality. I wore them for my wedding day and they looked nice.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t turn out how it looked online. They look better online than in person. They are a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love how they look! I&#x27;ve been wearing fake eyelashes for 5 years now so I&#x27;m no amateur &amp; I know my lashes! They are a little stiff, but I just grap both ends &amp; kind of move them up &amp; down (makes them a little softer) I don&#x27;t wear them that often, but they do last very long if you take care of them. FYI if you clean them be careful,  the threads at the base will ripp off very easily!</li>
    <li> these lashes are not the perfect to use if you are a make-up lover.. bad quality and looks fake anyway</li>
    <li> I ordered them September 24 and go it next day! They&#x27;re kinda long but i love them! Only wish it came with glue but i can always buy some. :]</li>
    <li> These eye lashes looked great in the box but were hard to put on they didn&#x27;t stay on very well but they were a great price quick service so it could of been me I wear lashes almost everyday and like for my lashes to look more natural but if you like that look then these would be great specially with the price and quick service.</li>
    <li> Definitely not what the description says  They are thick and hard and no where near natural soft looking.  They look more like a Halloween looking lashes and feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Lashes are not the best. And they are quite heavy be aware when you buy these.</li>
    <li> lashes looked unnatural and need to be cut because the strip is longer than eye</li>
    <li> So i got this in the mail yesterday, earlier than i expected. The box was a little beat up but the eyelashes still usable. I tried them on today and they sucked. They were too stiff and wouldn&#x27;t stick. But if you cut the tip of the band horizontally to make them thiner (where you put the glue) they are actually pretty manageable! Also adding glue to the band and placing them in a real curved eyelash case for a good while they are great to use and will stick! :) they look beautiful and a bit dramatic. will definatly buy again.</li>
    <li> These lashes are absolutely awesome. For being so inexpensive they are definitely not cheap. They are much prettier and a much better quality than the ones I&#x27;ve been wearing that cost 4 times as much for one pair. These are my lashes from now on.  I wear them day and night. In my opinion they are not too long. If you have pretty eyes and can pull off long eyelashes, these are the lashes for you,</li>
    <li> Horrible. They are nothing like the picture. You get thick flat falsies that are a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical upon purchasing these lashes because of how cheap the price is. I&#x27;m so glad I bought these they look absolutely adorable on me. They are just right.</li>
    <li> They came all smashed, the eyelashes and the box. They&#x27;re not even worth wasting your time buying them so just save your buck and move on! Horrible lashes</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!!!&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like picture!&lt;br /&gt;Yes a little stiff, but definitely stays on!&lt;br /&gt;Loved the way they look!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep buying more!!&lt;br /&gt;Better than store bought lashes!!</li>
    <li> THEY ARE NOT THE MOST REALISTIC LASHES... BUT THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL! VERY LONG AND THICK.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DAYTIME LASHES.. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THESE BUT THEY ARE PERFECT FOR EVENING.&lt;br /&gt; FYI: YOU HAVE TO CUT TO ADJUST LENGTH.. IT COMES WITH A LITTLE EXTRA TO HOLD IT IN THE BOX</li>
    <li> These looked amazing in the picture, but when you receive them, you see that they&#x27;re made out of rubber!! You can&#x27;t even wear them... total waste</li>
    <li> THEY LOOK A LIL FAKEY BUT GREAT FOR A NIGHT OUT</li>
    <li> I cant stand when people give false eyelashes bad reviews because they \\&quot;look fake\\&quot; well yea.. they ARE fake. Do not say \\&quot;these are awful cuz theyre too thick,\\&quot; say \\&quot;these dont compliment my eyes but they might work for other people.\\&quot; Im a makeup artist in training and some people (like myself) NEED obnoxious eyelashes to even tell we&#x27;re wearing any. No these lashes dont look right on everyone but that doesnt make them halloween lashes, i happen to look amazing with them. And for the price, oh yea i will definitely order again. You have to cut them a little but thats no big deal at all. Be sure long and thick lashes compliment you before ordering them though and ladies please make sure you know what eyelashes you can abd cant wear before giving bad reviews :)</li>
    <li> Did not look at all like in the picture.they look more fake.not natural at all.I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Whatever they are made out of is very stiff and unnatural looking. The eyelashes are secured to a band that extends far beyond where the lashes are in order to secure them to the box so the ends have to be clipped. The band is rigid and doesn&#x27;t have enough curve to be glued on. They were super cheap so worth a shot, so I thought...don&#x27;t even waste your time.</li>
    <li> they suck and are entirely to long and too thick.  they look like ghetto girl eye lashes.  do not  buy</li>
    <li> bad quality , doesnt sit well on your eyes, the ends are too long and feels more like plastic then actually hair</li>
    <li> The lashes look natural. I Recomend this product but there is no glue. It is what I was looking for</li>
    <li> They are ok, my daughter uses them for dance and they are not very soft more plastic like. Will probably have to get different ones as I feel these dont stay on very long.</li>
    <li> i really do like it, it feels natural !&lt;br /&gt;in general it&#x27;s better than half of the eye lashes out there</li>
    <li> i chose this rating cause they weren&#x27;t what expected. beauitiful lash but its hard to put on , there so straight and stiff. its very hard to shape around your eye.</li>
    <li> They look real and feel real. Fun to wear out and easy on your eyes. I would give this product a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> They are cute once you cut them and what not just they dont last for very long, not too reusable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear fake eyelashes often but always wanted to try wearing them and these really do the job ! The instant I put them on my eyes looked bigger in a way, I love the way they accented my face and gave me the look I was after. I won&#x27;t be running out anytime soon but im very much happy with this purchase. I recommend these if you want a fancy and sophisticated look, but don&#x27;t get frustrated if you think they look too fake...they are fake. Its just how you wear them that makes it appear decent.</li>
    <li> great items thank you</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter, age 17, who loves to have more lashes than her natural ones.  They look very pretty on her.  She said they are great.  The price was amazing.</li>
    <li> I hate these lashes, they are straight up plasic. no fake hair for the lashes, no nothing. straight up plastic! They are still in the box on the way to they trash!</li>
    <li> cheap but very bad quality, very difficult to use. When I tried to put them on Corners will Stick straight out They will not bend.</li>
    <li> just got these for a friend, they come all the way from china so it took them a month to get here. they are VERY good quality, they&#x27;re thick and soft just like natural lashes. she looooves her new lashes. gave it four stars cauz the strings that attach the lashes are very thick</li>
    <li> Perfect! Theses were just what I expected  from when I ordered to when I received them! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> not for me, I am used to other ones! they are too thin, just not my style!</li>
    <li> I bought these, and they were horrible. They hardly bend and was like trying to glue wood to my lashes. I go thru many pairs of lahes each week so I thought I would try them. They did not work for me, so after trying on one lash, they were very uncomfortable so I threw them all away. Will not buy these again, sticking to my $4.00 a pair kind from Walgreens</li>
    <li> I bought these lashes thinking they would look natural or feel natural, and was really excited since another review said they were big and full! but to my disappointment they were more plastic than any I&#x27;ve had! First and last time I buy some from the internet! I would keep on looking!</li>
    <li> I purchased these because the hair looks like real eyelashes. They are easy to apply. They are glamorous and sexy!!!</li>
    <li> the lashes are natural and soft, but the liner you attach them with is hard and not easily reshaped to fit each person&#x27;s eyelids. I have worn one set, and will not use the rest.</li>
    <li> Cheaply priced and made, but they will be fun for halloween and dressing up for stuff. I do not recommend them for anything important.</li>
    <li> Although I have not used it yet, I think I have plenty of lashes for the next 2 years! hahaha...</li>
    <li> Cheap hard plastic. Not the same lashes as in the picture. Could not ever use as band is not flexible and cannot curve to fit.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes aren&#x27;t too long as other buyers have stated. You do however have to cut the ends off but it&#x27;s just extra of the strip that holds the lashes together. No Biggie. These are nice and full, but not over the top. Happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I live in falsies, and these are not bad, but the band holding the lashes to your eye is in fact pretty thick. I suggest that if you haven&#x27;t worn lashes a lot then not to get these since they take a bit of customizing and adjusting to make them actually look real. Fun if you don&#x27;t plan to use them all the time or if you just need some to have &amp; not worry about keeping looking nice</li>
    <li> They look just like they are in the picture. I also got them much sooner than I thought I would. I am very pleased with the quality for the price. they look  pretty and natural :)</li>
    <li> They arrived early, however the package was so banged up that several of the lashes were ruined. They don&#x27;t look anything like the picture, and the base is so stiff it&#x27;s nearly impossible to apply them. I suppose they were still a good deal for the price, but only if you have the patience to apply them.</li>
    <li> These are as nice as expensive ones from the drug store.  They are soft and pliable. They are neither too long nor too thick.  They are easy to work with.  They are a real bargain.  I highly recommend their purchase.</li>
    <li> This lashes were not the worst but not the best either. They don&#x27;t have much shape to fit your eye while the 20 piece from the same brand are completely different. I would not buy this set again but I&#x27;m not dissapointed this is how you learn.</li>
    <li> They Are super awesome!! Really love how thin they are..very very nice!!! I recommend this product. Thanks so much. (:</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes, they were exactly what I was looking for. They aren&#x27;t too big or too small and they do look exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> I was quite impressed with the professional quality of these false lashes.  They also washed well enough for me to use them more that three times.</li>
    <li> these are cheap and don&#x27;t look or feel good on my eyes. I don&#x27;t recommend them for anyone. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> these lashes looked super fake and like they were made of plastick. my mom and a few friends told me that they did not like them on me. they made me look like a Drag Queen! lol. i like the more natural look.</li>
    <li> the edges are too hard so when i put the lashes it pokes my skin which hurts</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. Variety in styles and longevity. Not a human lash fan, kinda like the stiff look when I wear them (costume). Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> The lashes I received are not like the ones in the pic. They are HORRIBLY thin smh even after putting mascara on them you still could only tell they were on from the side. The ones pictured look very dark and somewhat full....that is NOT what I got</li>
    <li> I bought the thinner, more natural looking lashes and they came in within about 2 weeks of ordering. I personally like them. No box damage or anything. The lashes are definitely different for me to work with because I am so used to using thicker lashes (but I DID order thin ones, so I did get what was to be expected). I will definitely be ordering from Fashionwu again!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t exactly what I call &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. They have that sheen to them that screams &amp;#34;PLASTIC&amp;#34; when you see them at a certain angle. I believe the thickness is natural but the length is too far beyond realistic.</li>
    <li> not all lashes are for every one...these for some reason dont suit my eyes but i gave the rest to a friend of mine and they look amazing on her eyes. im not sure why...but i ordered two other types from the same vendor and love them...not to mention the price is absolutely unbeatable. these lashes are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> NATURAL LONG, UGLY FALSE LASHES!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, EVEN IF IT&#x27;S JUST A FEW DOLLARS! IT&#x27;S TRUE WHEN THEY SAY &amp;#34;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!&amp;#34; BAAARRRRFFF**** THIS IS MY HONEST OPTIONS!</li>
    <li> Great for the price! We&#x27;re a bit much for me though! I wore them to cheer for games so they were great for that!</li>
    <li> i ordered these about a month and a half ago and they finally got here. so don&#x27;t order them if you don&#x27;t want to wait at least a month for them. they did not arrive on time though because i guess they got lost during long shipment so i contacted the seller and they sent me new ones which came really fast. i have never put on fake lashes before but i bought them because they were only $1.13 :) for 10 which is a good deal. they do look nice like in the picture. i find it weird how people give bad reviews because &amp;#34;the lashes look too fake&amp;#34; well, they&#x27;re fake to begin with so you get what you order. anyways they look really nice and i cant wait to try them. :D</li>
    <li> Nice lashes, but not as natural looking than the name claims. I had many that were more natural looking. Nice for those glam days.</li>
    <li> Package came sooner than I expected which was a wonderful suprise. THe eyelash quality is great and they are very pretty. Love that they are firm but still soft. My clients love them as well. 100% would recomend them to any one looking for eyelashes. I will definetly be purchasing some more for my clients.</li>
    <li> Other than needing to adjust for my left eye they are great. Almost seems like they are all made for the right eye.</li>
    <li> These false lashes are great, in price wise, but in quality wise they kinda suck. These lashes will begin to loose their little hairs after the first or second application, but when there on they look great. The band is also pretty thick which i did not like but i worked with it.</li>
    <li> These lashes are worth every penny of the $1.16 I paid for them. Given they are more of a party lash then an everyday lash but they are beautiful. Some of them are longer than the others but it makes them perfect to layer up.</li>
    <li> These look as real as real... very satisfied - easy to apply and they blend in with my regular lashes for a fuller natural look</li>
    <li> For the price and quantity, I love them. I purchased these so that I can learn how to put on eyelashes. I love these. Just note that they are coming from China so it takes 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent eyelashes!!!</li>
    <li> these eyelashes are amazing, their lightweight their easy to deal with throughout the day and they even look good enough for a natural makeup look and for 10 in a pack the price is great too.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, material is cheap, cheap price, good for fun. Quantity is definite here.</li>
    <li> The band is very thin so they take a bit more time to put on. They are long and spaced. Nice.</li>
    <li> When I first took out a pair of lashes I was slightly disappointed because it looks super fake (I prefer natural-looking lashes).  They are too long and will need to be trimmed on either end. To make them not look so plastic-like, here&#x27;s a tip: wet them first and pat dry, leaving damp, then apply.  I found this to make them look more natural and I was able to put mascara over them to clump some lashes together so it would not look so full and thick---you still get a dramatic look because of the length of the lashes yet its not too much.  The end result looked fabulous, but once again, if you&#x27;re a makeup artist, like myself, then you will know how to make it work; if not, I do not recommend buying this product UNLESS you want your lashes to look VERY bold and dramatic.  In that case, this product would be perfect .</li>
    <li> the lashes are way too long, very unatural looking&lt;br /&gt;also, they lay flat when you take them off the board, they dont stay curved for easy application</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter to wear on stage for ballet. They are a bit stiff, but for the price they are perfect for what we need.</li>
    <li> Lashes don&#x27;t feel natural at all...&lt;br /&gt;Can not bend lashes they are very very straight...&lt;br /&gt;You also have to trim the ends</li>
    <li> Cheap price &#x3D; cheap material&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re only using them for fun once in awhile. the strip of the lashes are pretty tough so it&#x27;s tough on your eyelids. Shipping-wise, it was delivered as estimated.</li>
    <li> Um thee took like 2 1/2 week to come&amp; their really not worth it and they kinda suck. Lool&lt;br /&gt; So</li>
    <li> Freakin&#x27; brilliant! I use these at all my events! They amazing and last all through the night without issues. Huge thumbs up without issues.</li>
    <li> Literally a month gone by and STILL not here WTH? needs to hurry up! I&#x27;ve ordered so many things from hong kong and farrr away places and they got here a week after i ordered them! So whats taking them a month to get here???</li>
    <li> These are great lashes for the price! They are a little long for my eyes, but trimming is easy enough. I would say these are going out lashes as opposed to daily wear (very bold look). Love them!</li>
    <li> I am just learning to used them so i didnt want to spend to much in case I had to dispose of them this was a great product to learn with.</li>
    <li> just as it was said to be , fast friendly, and on time, no probs at all</li>
    <li> I bought these for costume lashes, and they work for that. But I wouldn&#x27;t suggest them for every day application.</li>
    <li> cheap? yeah! very! good? NO! It doesn&#x27;t only look fake (yes of course you may say - they are fake...but those look really really fake) - they do not stay on even with a really good glue. so...I hate them!</li>
    <li> they are not natural looking at all! if you want long Drag Queen eyelashes this is for you, but if not don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It actually doesnt really look like it in the picture. The material looks kinda natural but the shape is really big and dramatic...... I cut it and created the shape I want, but I&#x27;m still kinda disappointed because it is not easy to cut it into a natural look.</li>
    <li> These lashes are good for special ocassions. I was looking for something more natural. Eitherway i loved them cause they were easy to apply and they looked really cute. I cant imagine going out to buy one pair of lashes for five bucks when i can buy ten for less than five bucks</li>
    <li> Looked beautiful on. Put took all day to get used to due to the fact that it was hard to apply. Not bendable.</li>
    <li> to long and to thick for me because I wear glassed, but if you don&#x27;t they look great for a night  on the town. they are a little on the heavy side and the strip is thick, but for the price i guess they do in a pinch​</li>
    <li> worst things ever., do not fit well,  bad making, even the box was cheap. took forever to get to my house. disapointed</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok, just kind of firm and tough to bend to the shape of the eye.  They have these long strings on the ends that you will have to cut off before you can wear them.  They are just ok.</li>
    <li> How you see these lashes are exactly how they look but better when arrived they look kind of natural to me &amp; curly @ the ends of the false lashes. I would reorder one.</li>
    <li> They look really pretty once there on but they are kinda harrrd when yur trying to move them to fit yur eye.</li>
    <li> I PREFER THEM TO BE A LITTLE THICKER.  THEY&#x27;RE NOT AS THICK AS THE PICTURE INDICATES, BUT JUST OK FOR ME</li>
    <li> You get so much for your money. Other than the fact it took about a month to ship, everything about the purchase was satisfying. The eyelashes were long and full, but still looked very natural. They are easy to mold and you can use them for many different styles. I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were not up to standard. Very hard in texture, they broke apart in places. The ends unravel when trying to cut off the extra. I was not satisfied but it is a risk you take. Good luck to all who purchase these eyelashes! My advise to you would be to &amp;#34;Proceed with caution!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little awkward on me, I didn&#x27;t think they were going to be as full and fake looking as they are... The shipping came in quicker than I expected also. It is a great buy, specially for the amount of lashes you get.. but only go for them if you really like that fuller look of lashes!</li>
    <li> For only being a dollar you can&#x27;t complain!!! They are kind of long but you can trim them if you like. They make my eye lashes look more natural too! I definitely will buy again!!  They take a couple weeks to get them but well worth the wait. They look just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Most people say it feels like plastic but it doesnt!! Its really soft almost feathery and i like that a lot overall its worth the money and ill surely be bing a lot more from here!</li>
    <li> love the lashes I don&#x27;t care with others say if you know how to put on lashes then you won&#x27;t have any problem there not for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; girls I bought bundles of lashes why because they&#x27;re cheap good for everyday and durable for cleaning ...they come from a long ways so have a little patience with the shipment but some came  earlier than expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> They looked nice but when I picked them up they felt like plastic. These do not look natural at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look very intense.</li>
    <li> They only last for one use.  So I suggest buying more than one set of these if you can if you can&#x27;t don&#x27;t buy them</li>
    <li> Now I see why they are so cheap. The actual lashes are beautiful but the strip on them makes them hard to stick &amp; they go straight out instead of curling up. I bought these because I do a lot of makeup &amp; use lashes like crazy. Yea don&#x27;t buy them. They look trashy. Also I ordered a few boxes of one type &amp; got all different ones.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with the product and how fast I received the lashes.  They are very beautiful and sexy! Made me feel glamorous and like a celebrity.</li>
    <li> Awesome and convenient for last minute accessories to your makeup look. Easy application just remember to cut the extra off the corners</li>
    <li> Help a friend buy. In fact, the picture does not look so natural, the quality is very good, but my friend did not seem too fond</li>
    <li> I should have read the fine print not real human hair&lt;br /&gt;they were plastic&lt;br /&gt;didnt even wear them&lt;br /&gt;just gross</li>
    <li> These lashes look nothing like the picture. They are way too thick to look good and they make you look very fake to put it nicely. The other reviews saying they should look fake and stop complaining are wrong. They are not worth the money at all. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THESE!</li>
    <li> When i read the reviews that said \\&quot;not natural looking\\&quot; i didn&#x27;t think much of it because, they are fake eyelashes, of course they wont look natural. But I think people were trying to say they aren&#x27;t made of human hair, it is synthetic. I usually buy human hair lashes, and these made my eyes itch and uncomfortable. They weren&#x27;t as long as I thought they would be, but they were cheap. It took about a month to ship because it is from Hong Cong. I guess if you need a lot of cheap lashes in abundance then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered a wig for my son almost 2 months ago. NEVER got it! It&#x27;s 3 weeks PAST delivery date. They don&#x27;t care.. I guess it is not their problem! Learned my lesson... never again. They basically stole my money!</li>
    <li> I know some people call these fake eyelashes but OMG it doesn&#x27;t even feel like HUMAN HAIR!!! nothing &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; about these lashes I would love to get my money back but I still tried them anyways and it was a nightmare! the have no flow to them they a super stiff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY LADIES</li>
    <li> I really like them they are easy to put on and handle... worth you&#x27;re money and met expectations. All fully and new lashes</li>
    <li> These are very cheaply poorly made. I never could get a pair to stay on at all. The band is too thick and looks obviously fake on.</li>
    <li> Lashes are very un-natural looking! Also they are  Very cheaply made. They are not worth wasting your money or time on!</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they seem to be fairly decent quality for someone who is just experimenting with them.</li>
    <li> They look really fake, and I can&#x27;t wear them. Good for costumes and stage wear. I would have really want more diverse set. If you want a cheap costume type of eye lashes these are for you go big or go home type of look</li>
    <li> First off, packaging was extremely terrible. When I received my package I opened up the large envelope only to reveal the box the lashes came in was smashed and bent. My immediate thought was that the lashes are not useful anymore and I wasted my money. But when I opened the box the lashes were \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but, still I cannot tolerate terrible packaging and I should&#x27;ve known because I read other reviews. Other than the packaging, it came in pretty fast so I have to give props on that, it came in about 5 business days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes themselves are of low quality. I don&#x27;t wear lashes every day like I used to but when I did, I had a stock of MAC falsies and LOVED their lashes like no other. So comparing these the MAC I have to say they aren&#x27;t as good but they still do the job and look great. I recommend a really good lash glue because if not, they&#x27;ll easily come off. Also when you open the package and pull off a lash, two things are on each end so just take some scissors and cut them off. Other than that, you&#x27;re really paying for what you buy so don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
    <li> Did not look natural at all. I waited 4 weeks and they turned out pittyful. They looked like pure plastic...with a bunch of fur. If it were poossible it should get 0 stars!</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply due to them being thicker than most store bought lashes. Does not come with glue but for the price, no problem.</li>
    <li> Have to trim the sides down because of &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; sides. Very difficult to glue due to very thin plastic base. Not very flexiable!!!! Tried with three and unable to use them. Have inface thrown them away. You get  what you pay for.....</li>
    <li> I love this eyelashes the are awesome I recommend you get a pair. A pair last me 2 weeks you must try&lt;br /&gt;them</li>
    <li> Anyone complaining about dollar lashes are hilarious. Ur really disappointed your dollar lashes didn&#x27;t meet your dollar qualifications LMAO. I love these lashes. They are pretty and do not look trashy they look cute and glamorous  but not to over the top. I also like the box they come in, and how easy it is to get them out of the slots without worrying if I might rip them.:-)and the price is amazing. It cost 3 bucks or more for one stupid pair of false lashes.</li>
    <li> the eyelashes where more of a natural lash! Do not expect a thicker dramatic look. ♥&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;*Applied on easily ( not stiff, very flexible flimsy )&lt;br /&gt;* Didn&#x27;t tangle or morph when water got on them.&lt;br /&gt;* Re-usable. ( You do not go through them all one by one. You can re-use one set multiple times )  &#x3D; last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;* Fast shipping is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;* Great for framing the eyes~&lt;br /&gt;* And comes in  a great little case that you can store your lashes in safely and put away~</li>
    <li> Came in super late and all the lashes look super fake and plastic like. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real hair I actually haven&#x27;t used them</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are super heavy and the adhesive strip is so thick that you can totally tell you are wearing fake eyelashes. I like to go for a more hidden/natural eyelash look. The eyelashes are plastic , I preffer paying the 5$ for a pair because they are so much easier to put on and stay on longer. When I wore these I felt like a doll, the ones where the eyes roll back lol !</li>
    <li> They look exactly like they do in the picture but they&#x27;re very hard to apply on to your eyes. The part where you usually put the glue s very hard and the eyelash falls off easily</li>
    <li> These lashes are bawm!&lt;br /&gt;I use to buy Katy Perry brands for 6 bux at Kmart nd it lasted up to 4-5 days bcz I would wash them nd it would lose its volume curves n stick together nd there goes my money waisted! but these lashes got me nd my cosmo girlfriends hooked!  I hardly need to wash them, they keep formity, full and professional looking lashes, and when i do makeup,  they kinda boost my charges only bcz they dont look cheap and just make my clients look fab along with their makeup application. bcz of the fact I share/use for clients,  I&#x27;m waiting for my second order and so is my sister lol.</li>
    <li> These lashes are a little thick and dramatic for everyday use, but I still like them. I put them on wrong the first time so my eyelashes seemed closed and heavy. My only complaint is that these lashes are so hard. You can feel them on your eye. Other than that, they are just fine.</li>
    <li> Awful.fake, cheap, don&#x27;t buy it. Its just waste of money. Its made of plastic and looks like a plastic. Bad bad bad.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x60;t like the way my package was sent. The case it came in was beat up and it looked cheap, but my friend liked the eye lashes</li>
    <li> I found these eyelashes a bit stiff and hard to apply, but they look good. Very good price for the amount of lashes.</li>
    <li> The lashes are so full and flirty. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. They are wonderful for a night on the town!</li>
    <li> Very nice on but not easy with bein flexible to fitting your lid kinda stiff I also like the fullness</li>
    <li> I knew this deal was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;The lash line / strip that holds the eyelashes is way too thick, and stiff. Hard to adjust to shape of your eye when you go to apply them on. They do not look natural nor is there anyway to disguise them to look possibly real. Close similarity with the cheap Halloween costume false lashes. Disappointed. But I guess u get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;The only plus was the seller was quick with shipping.</li>
    <li> For some reason these lashes fall off very easily. I&#x27;ve tried several different glues but its always the same result. Worth it for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Cheap...stiff... And they all don&#x27;t look right don&#x27;t buy! Waste of money don&#x27;t fall for it. You will be disappointed</li>
    <li> He stays on a long time and doesn&#x27;t fall apart after peeling the glue off. You should definitely try it</li>
    <li> These do not look like they do in the picture. How is someone suppose to wear doll like lashes and try to pull them off as real. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I loved the eye lashes, compared to others I have bought on amazon these are the most show stopping of them all, they are easy to apply just measure to the eye length comfortable and glue on for gorgeous natural long looking eye lashes.</li>
    <li> Honestly, they&#x27;re as cheap as I expected them to be. They feel like plastic and aren&#x27;t malleable enough to form around my eyelids. Threw them away immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on models at photo shoots. They were a great price and they are easy to cut to size. I think they are perfect for a dramatic look. I would not wear them out for personal use though, they are just a bit too much for every day wear.</li>
    <li> these are awesome I love them :-)  they do the job and they can be reusable if took care of..lot of them..I&#x27;d def recommend :-)</li>
    <li> Great lashes for the price. Easy to use. Would definitely order again. I was disappointed at first because I prefer natural human hair lash but once I tried them on they looked wonderful.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this DVD 3 stars was because I still have not had a chance to use these but they look super THICK. I&#x27;m hoping they look cute when I apply them</li>
    <li> First off, these lashes are too stiff. I put the glue on them, let it get tacky, then applied the lashes. The lashes would not mold to the shape of my eyelid as other high quality lashes do. They have no curve to them, they are straight as an arrow, so that makes it harder to apply them. The novelty Halloween lashes sold at stores in October work 100X better than these. I would not recommend them to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that is why they are so cheap. They are no good and shouldn&#x27;t be used by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;These things just set in my bottom makeup drawer taking space.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. And if you&#x27;re someone who goes thru a lot of eyelashes like me, these are well worth it, I&#x27;m an exotic dancer and these will last me for a month because you can reuse them, AND to the ppl who said they look fake, uumm they ARE fake eyelashes</li>
    <li> I wear falsies everyday. I&#x27;m in love with these ones. they&#x27;re cheaply priced but very well made. these stay on better and longer than my $20 pairs. I like how thick they are but not freakishly long. I will be ordering these forever!</li>
    <li> The thickness of the lashes is much more than shown in the picture. Not as natural looking but i guess will go good while wearing a costume, to get the fake look.</li>
    <li> Love how affordable these are, they are good quality and great if you costume a lot. They are thick and far from natural</li>
    <li> They were not the same lashes posted here. They were very thin. Please changed the picture of the lashes that you have to match the ones you send out. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Actually when I realized these came from China I didn&#x27;t want to put them on my eyes.  They were so cheap that if you have any craft stuff to do with them by all means but I wouldn&#x27;t wear them.</li>
    <li> It took a while for these to come in the mail. I really enjoy dressing up so buying lashes all the time can be expensive especially for the little time I use them. I figured it was worth the try for such little money. They do seem cheap when you get them in the box and have an extra tip on the sides but I have been able to work with them and they look good enough to wear out.</li>
    <li> Really Great eyelashes they Look So Natural love them :) I recommend them if you wanna look like you have natural eyelashes</li>
    <li> they were not what expected they looked too fake. was not happy with my purchase because of the low quality.</li>
    <li> These lashes came quickly but you get what you pay for. They aren&#x27;t the best quality type of lashes but they will do the job.</li>
    <li> These are really long and thick, but they are pretty. I wanted something very dramatic, so these were perfect for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Very good quality easy to clean and I like how thick the lashes are. They come from across the seas so it will take awhile and you can reuse them also:)</li>
    <li> I love these eye lashes. Me being a MUA Student I can give these away when I practice and it does not hurt the wallet</li>
    <li> I ordered these lashes and when they finally arrived I was disappointed in the quality.  They looked very cheap and not natural as they are advertised.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t cheaply made. I was surprised with the quality of the eyelashes. I would recommend to my family and friends. My order was delivered within the time frame given.</li>
    <li> I WEAR THESE ALL THE TIME WHEN IM GOIN OUT OR JUST TO A GATHERING. THE PRICE WAS DEF RIGHT FOR THESE EYELASHES. PEOPLE SPEND 20 DOLLARS TO GET THESE PUT ON OR THEY SPEND 5 TO 6 BUCKS FOR ON PAIR AND I GOT 10 FOR LESS THEN 3 BUCKS. CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT BOO BOO!!!</li>
    <li> I love the eyelashes I purchase and will certainly buy them again and recommend my friends to buy, cant beat the price</li>
    <li> AGAIN THIS IS PRODUCT FROM VERY FAR AWAY.  STILL WAITING, GLAD I GOT BACK UP PLAN BECAUSE I AM STILL DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I rated this product of five on it because it&#x27;s cheaper love the product it was meant for my daughter saved us a lot of money I love the prices couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this product I also purchased two more have not received them yet this was a gift for my daughter</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are horrible! I can&#x27;t even apply them on my eyes they don&#x27;t bend! And I hate the texture of them. Waste of money even tho their cheap plus it took forever for the shipment.</li>
    <li> First time actually using fake lashes and these r good to start off with and cheap... I got these along with another two styles</li>
    <li> does not meet the expectations I had, image of marketing look great but seem wings of the bird that you find in parks, streams are horrible and not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love them they are pretty I have wore them they feel great dnt make ya face itch or nothing</li>
    <li> I am not familiar with that, just bought it for my girlfriend, she said not bad, well,it seemed very good in quality</li>
    <li> I highly feel there amazing loved them they worked and feel natural and didn&#x27;t bother me at all an yes I just made 3 new orders and planing on ordering more recommended to make an order more then one pair cuz you&#x27;ll regret not doing it like I did</li>
    <li> Good for practicing how to apply lashes. They are way less expensive than natural hair but are harder to apply which makes them perfect for practice</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t look like what i expected. it&#x27;s like a piece of tape with lashes on it basically cheap like hell. i bought this n i regret it</li>
    <li> I guess these were supposed to be cute but no they were not they were to big and felt way to fake like not the texture from the ones you buy  beauty supply houses. They also wouldn&#x27;t stay on my eyelashes for more than a couple hours.</li>
    <li> This product is so bad, not  what i expected the eyelashes alomst feel like paper dont recommend at all. I bet there are better products around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product to practice with..seeing am a beginner it&#x27;s very affordable so of I mess up one ..it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> They look like plastic, even if you put mascara on them because the mascara doesn&#x27;t really stick to them. They&#x27;re pretty long so I had to cut them, but the band that attaches to your eyelid is really thick so it looks really awkward at your inner eyelid. Not a great product.</li>
    <li> I wear eyelashes quite a bit because its a lot quicker and the set I got are jagged tipped and very thick, great stiff band. These are the kind beginners use. I LOVE THEM. Know I have a box of 10 keeps my mind at ease!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am no expert applying fake lashes. These are easy to apply, can be use more than once and the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> These are really hard to glue on, they look a little more real than some of the other ones, more natural. But in the end, it&#x27;s better to spend a little extra get something that will last, and won&#x27;t bend out of shape, that you can wear more than once.</li>
    <li> love them for the quick girl on the go look more bang for your buck for a city fashionista on a budget</li>
    <li> Easy to wear... Easy to clean... Reusable .. Look and feel natural... Great purchase👍 I highly recommend them you will love them also</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t horrible but they aren&#x27;t the best lashes to work with. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for beginners because it takes a little more effort to make them blend.</li>
    <li> Shipping time was nice. These look so synthetic. I&#x27;d much rather prefer human hair. These are also too thin and short. I&#x27;m used to dark &amp; thick, full lashes. I might just use these for my bottom lashes. The lash strip on this is HORRIBLE. It&#x27;s just straight &amp; flat when you take it out of the box - like a piece of paper. It doesn&#x27;t curve like it shows in the pictures. I&#x27;ve also seen that people have said the strip is too long. It&#x27;s not a big deal. All you need to do is trim it! I would say do not buy. Especially to beginners.</li>
    <li> So yes they are very pretty eyelashes but when they arrived they were smashed and flat which made them hard to apply. Thats all i have to conplain about. They came 11 days before the expected time for me along with other lashes i ordered.</li>
    <li> Good quality lashes but the shipping took forever. By Time I actually got them I really didn&#x27;t need them anymore. Never the less the lashes itself is great for what you pay. Love how the base of the strip is thick so it won&#x27;t easily shred.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m getting kind of into this lashes! I like these so much!</li>
    <li> all was ok thanks, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
    <li> These lashes were too artificial. The lash band was entirely to thick. It wouldn&#x27;t stick to my lash line. I will not buy from this company ever again.</li>
    <li> My very first set of Lashes and I love them so much! They were exactly what I was expecting them to be :) thank you!</li>
    <li> I will never purchase these again, these lashes are for drag queens. (1.) There in nothing natural looking about these lashes, they&#x27;re extremely synthetic, they might as well be plastic, they&#x27;re a weird shinny and the length is ridiculous. (2.) There is no natural curve of the lashes to simply place them onto your lid and apply pressure to make them stay...no, instead you have to fight with them and get glue everywhere. (3.) The one time I was actually able to set the lashes (takes tons of patience) I ended up ripping them off, they looked cheesy-fake. I expect fake lashes to look fake....to an extent. These do not meet my standards, I ordered 2 boxes (20 lashes) and there are 4 pairs I attempted to use......the rest are going in the trash!</li>
    <li> I was looking for some inexpensive eye lashes to use for my engagement photos and wedding day. While these were a little too over the top for either of those, they worked great for Halloween. Worth the $.01 I paid.</li>
    <li> NOT THE BEST LASHES BUT OK FOR PRACTICE. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN. will not recommend for anyone wanting to have for a while.</li>
    <li> i did not love these lashes. they are so hard to put on and they are so stiff.  i would not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Nice long eyelashes but had to trim them but they are very beautiful! Nice for a dramatic look! But they are Hard to glue and take off Lol but good overall</li>
    <li> Arrival and shipping costs were fair.&lt;br /&gt;Because the lashes aren&#x27;t human hai, application can be slightly challenging and they feel kinda plastic and heavy if not applied right but once they&#x27;re on they look lovely</li>
    <li> Really like them, really natural looking!!!! They are the perfect length to me! Makes my male up routine much, much easier!</li>
    <li> IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK&lt;br /&gt;it was an old one maybe, because even the glue was old and unusefull&lt;br /&gt;........ . . .</li>
    <li> Im new at applying eyelashes but ive tried diff ones a did ok, these are to stiff and cant get them on.</li>
    <li> was not what I thought but will use them to practice application of eyelashes.  I really like the look of these but wish they were real.</li>
    <li> They look really fake. I had to cut them quite a bit to get them to fit my eye. Which is ok, but they are really really long and give you like a cat eye look</li>
    <li> Thicker than I thought but works it&#x27;s just kinda more plastic-y. Kinda hard to bend to fit to eye but over all it still did it&#x27;s job which is to flaunt my lashes.</li>
    <li> these eyelashes are no good they do not bend to your eye which makes them unusableI tried to get a refund and return them but the company told me it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it because they were so cheap so I got stuck with them</li>
    <li> Well... When I first got the lashes I was quite disappointed. They say natural and to me they weren&#x27;t. It was hard to put on... At some point I wasn&#x27;t able to put them on. I had bought 10 boxes adn couldn&#x27;t do anything with them..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one night I decided to try something different. I cut the ends as usual and the worked the band. You know how when you were younger you took a pair of scissors and a piece of paper and rubbed them together to get that curly piece of paper? Well thats what I did except I used my fingernails. I work the bands so I was manageable and but the pieces that were out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when you buy these lashes be prepared to play with the band to get it as soft as you want. Now.. They are quite beautiful once one.</li>
    <li> They look extremely fake!!!!</li>
    <li> If you want beautiful MAC $10-$15 per pair for fake eyelashes, don&#x27;t buy these. BUT, if you&#x27;re going out where the lights are likely to be dim and everyone&#x27;s vision is hazy, DEFINITELY buy these! They&#x27;re great for the cost. I love them. The only thing I would say is that the picture doesn&#x27;t show the exact eyelash you will receive. It goes from short to long from the inside. They are definitely not even but nonetheless they do the job!</li>
    <li> they took awhile for them to get to me but overall they are great. They are good quality and they last a day or and when you buy them more then once you sometimes get a different pair everytime. which is still ok with me.</li>
    <li> awful quality! most of the lashes werent even usable!</li>
    <li> They looked really fake.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes...to my surprise...we&#x27;re fabulous! I decided to take a gamble and buy them considering all the bad reviews this product has gotten and they&#x27;re perfect. When they arrived they all were well fastened in the box ...maybe I just got lucky...</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t get any better. I even went ahead and ordered some more for myself and friends. They claim to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, but for my taste they&#x27;re a little too full. I&#x27;m used something more like the demi wispies by Ardell. These I use for more of a dramatic yet appropriate daytime look. Don&#x27;t be fooled if your lash band has glue residue or gunk after you use them, these ARE reusable. Look up a video on youtube, how to clean false eyelashes, and you&#x27;ll be able to use a pair for a week! That&#x27;s 10 weeks for only $1.12. Such a great deal!</li>
    <li> The band is hard. Lashes not natural feeling as said in the description. Had to cut them in half abs use them only at the ends of my lashes</li>
    <li> I like them because they came fast and undamaged but the only thing is that they are more stiff than most. So if you are new to  lashes I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, I beg you do not buy anything like these or these, they gross and not at all what i expected just go to your local beauty supply store and buy red cherry falsies please, do yourself the favor</li>
    <li> the size are really nice I love it the are easy to put and looks beautiful I recommend it !!</li>
    <li> Not for everyone,,, I have little to NO eyelashes so I love because they compliment my eyes without them being too dramatic.</li>
    <li> The bands are not flexible at all and are way too thick. It sticks out straight on your eyes and gives you the unnatural fake lashes eyes. Also, it&#x27;s almost impossible reuse them because they&#x27;re not flexible enough for restoring.</li>
    <li> HARD TO PUT ON ESPECIALLY FOR BEGINNERS. THEN THE LONG WAIT FOR THEM TO BE DELIVERED WAS LIKE A MONTH! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE EYELASHES AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Waited more than a month , and look nothing like the picture . they look super fake and my package came all crushed like wtf</li>
    <li> These are almost rubbery. They look very MADE UP on and would not be good for a every day look. An extreme GLAM &amp;#34;very fake look&amp;#34; yes! Like Halloween maybe. They are dark and go on ok. But not my style at all.</li>
    <li> They look nice without being to over the top :) They still look thick and long without being difficult. Very flexable and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> great item.  exactly as described</li>
    <li> I thought &amp;#34;oh cool fake drag eyelashes&amp;#34; or maybe I could cut them in half and it would look cute!&lt;br /&gt;But no they where to big you could not glue them to your eyes to heavy and when I did after 20 minutes of trying I could not see at all.&lt;br /&gt;If I would have kept them on they would have fallen off within 2 minutes it sucked&lt;br /&gt;So I would not get these even if you wanna read the good reviews and not the bad ones I&#x27;m saying don&#x27;t get them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waist your money it is just bad I&#x27;m sorry!</li>
    <li> Extremely excited Just got them in the mail cant wait to try them after I take my store bought out. Got them before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> great it looks good on  and the money i payed it great&lt;br /&gt;  i would buy theses again i will tell my frends about  this</li>
    <li> got these today they came before due date&lt;br /&gt;the  packaging is great! and im so surprised for such a low price I can get good eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;there extremely soft and long there so doll like&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied defiantly will be buying my eyelashes from this seller c:</li>
    <li> These lashes were very thin and hard to use plus it took long to get them delivered very disappointed. They get 1 star cuz I couldn&#x27;t leave them empty</li>
    <li> I tried these and as my first try of fake eyelashes I guess I made a bad choice. I have okayish eyelashes to begin with, but I still wanted to try fake ones. I know these are fake but don&#x27;t get me wrong its like putting on makeup for the first time, everything seems to much. I mostly bought these bc/ they were cheap and I was running out of money, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much anyways. They are a lot thicker than the pic I didn&#x27;t like them but you like big lashes go for it. If its your first time... go for smaller ones. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have about... let me see.. five boxes of these that I havent touch yet. Affordable and good quality if you treat them good. One pair and last about three weeks for me and I use them five days a week! AMAZING</li>
    <li> The lashes were all different, there were no pairs! They will work for Halloween definitely  but not every day use.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes too plastic looking.. they not natural looking at all.. not human hair.. need more natural looking lashes not plastic</li>
    <li> Great, cheap lashes that you will have to cut to fit you. Shipping was fast and it was during the holiday period which was great.</li>
    <li> Throw caution to the wind and wear big eyelashes. The hugest advantage, although the strips are a little thick, is that there&#x27;s enough lash to hold onto while you try to place it properly on the eyelidl</li>
    <li> Common so many lashes 4 such little price,&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more, made in great quality craftsmanship&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for sure</li>
    <li> I have used false eyelashes for years and I&#x27;m used to trimming them and working them into position.  However, these lashes are quite stiff and long.  I had to trim off about 1/3 of it and then these things &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; back to straight instead of warming up and staying curved.  These just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Do not buy these. Even though there Cheap. Its just a waste. They look so fake. There made out of plastic. They won&#x27;t Even stay glue for to long.</li>
    <li> They are cheap, but a lot of fun!! I&#x27;ve really enjoyed playing with them!! They will re use relatively easily, I recommend using some make up remover to gently remove them from your eye and then to remove the glue before using them for a second time!</li>
    <li> I DID NOT LIKE THE LASHES AT ALL!!!  THEY WERE TOO LONG !!!!!  HAD A VERY HARD TIME MAKING THEM FIT TO MY EYELIDS. DIDN&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE STRING ON THE END OF THE LASHES.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s superr plastic and not natural. It just screams fake and notice able.&lt;br /&gt;I regretted buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;#VERY BAD! ×((</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s no way I can used it. I really don&#x27;t like it. now I think I regret that I purchase this</li>
    <li> I was afraid these would be stiff and super hard to glue on, but even though they aren&#x27;t real hair, it sure does feel high quality!&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;flexible&lt;br /&gt;non distracting&lt;br /&gt;can be worn in everyday situations because the length and thickness isn&#x27;t overwhelming, but there is tons of lash to add beautiful definition to your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;The underside where you put the glue is nice and flat to it&#x27;s easy to stick on accurately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;very long (but can be cut easily)</li>
    <li> I use them in my crafts and work very well.</li>
    <li> I really like how they look and are very easy to apply. I would order from this guy again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes, they are not too thick but long and lasts long also, i can get at least 1week of wear of them and they will still look good as new. The only thing i dont like is that shipping takes a little longer and makes me impatient to getting these gorgeous lashes</li>
    <li> the box was damaged and the eye lashes  are no good for professional makeup artists they&#x27;re too thick and fake</li>
    <li> For the price you get what you pay for.. but you better buy something to help make them stay on because they don&#x27;t stick on.</li>
    <li> Great false lashes. I love long big flirtatious lashes and I absoulty loved these. If your like me and love long thick lashes than these are for you other than that there great and fabulous. You cant beat the price neither. Ive paid almost 7 dollars for just 1 pair of eyelashes like these in the stores so what a bargain this is. Very dramatic and long once again. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I will purchase more. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not bad at all. They come straight, so they have to be slightly bent and they get out of their shape easily. Besides that, they&#x27;re excellent and don&#x27;t break. None of the individual eyelashes come off, which is great!!</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT! THE LASHES ARE PLASTIC AND LOOK SO UGLY! DEFINITELY WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Hard to put on. Hard to keep on. These would be awesome if they weren&#x27;t so heavy and averse to being placed. They do ship from China, so I cleaned them first. I&#x27;ll try it again with another glue, but the &amp;#34;lashline&amp;#34; is thick and heavy.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes they were very long and fluffy and for the price worth the money I would order from them again and again I recommend anyone who wants long lashes for just I a day or two these are good quality</li>
    <li> These lashes do not stay adhered! Unless you use maybe super glue?  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I do not like thick lashes. I do not like thick lashes. I do not like thick lashes. I do not like thick lashes. I do not like thick lashes. I do not like thick lashes. I do not like thick lashes. They were extremely to heavy on my eyes.</li>
    <li> The item was very badly packaged. Haven&#x27;t used the item yet but it seems as if it will suffice. For the cost of the product, I would say it is what I paid for.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes do not look &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all. they look like something you would wear to a beauty pageant, consider buying something else before you buy these.</li>
    <li> They are thicker in person, but I’m still going to use them as soon as I get my contact lens</li>
    <li> They look amazing when you get them on but they are a challenge to get on due to the thick and not very pliable band.</li>
    <li> Ended up throwing it all away.  It is hard to use.</li>
    <li> Longer lashes than what I expected but so far so good. This is something good for going out in the club</li>
    <li> Great price, but there is no length difference between the two ends. Ex: the inner corner is normally shorter than the outer corner. These are the same length from outer to inner corner, which makes them look a little funky and super unnatural.</li>
    <li> They are ugly and look nothing like the review photo and I want my money back so baaaaad...!!!! Frfr they can get this crap back</li>
    <li> I loved them but they need to place them a better way because the way they are places makes them be straight</li>
    <li> These are so nice. They look like my own lashes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper product was exactly as advertised ...to thin and &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; like for me ...I like for my lashes to feel like soft hair with these types of lashes it&#x27;s hit or miss...can&#x27;t beat 10 for a dollar tho...I add them to other lashes to get a thicker look so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste</li>
    <li> They are horrible their really thick and shiny I like more of a natural look.</li>
    <li> Great lashes have ordered twice now</li>
    <li> They look okay just not on. They would be cool for halloween. The outter lash is nice but it&#x27;s the inner lash that brings to much attention to them.</li>
    <li> These did NOT fit my eyes.. tried cutting them but just did not fit... not for someone Caucasian let&#x27;s just say that.</li>
    <li> these lashes look fake ! they arent even natural hairs don&#x27;t waste your money on this youll come out looking uber tacky .......................</li>
    <li> I gave a rating of one star because a minus rating wasn&#x27;t available.  Disgusting item! They look like they were made from rat hair! Straight to the garbage they went!!!!</li>
    <li> I have not used these but they do not look much like the photo. They are very thick and straight, the picture is miss leading on how they look.</li>
    <li> Eh..its okay but definitely not for small eyes! Way to huge for small eyes, it touches my eyebrows. Its a big too long, they should definitely make shorter ones</li>
    <li> it took forever for shipping but they wear well and give you that very big fake lash look. but that&#x27;s what i go for when i wear fake lashes.</li>
    <li> These lashes are very harsh and dramatic.  They reminded me of bug legs when I first took a look at them if that is any indication.  If you are looking for high drama, these are for you but,  if you want a natural look- these are not the lashes.</li>
    <li> I really havent put them on so i dont know i like them when i go too with friends ,.</li>
    <li> love all the lashes looks amazing day/night i will buy more soon they are a wonderful fit for all types of faces</li>
    <li> Didnt really dont  like what they look like. Was not satisfied with how the look on. Look like catepillars 😕</li>
    <li> These were just what I needed for my cosplay as Ran Mao (Black Butler) and probably many other cosplays to come as well as some regular days in between. They took a while to get here but that was not unexpected (delivery estimate was 10-14 days or smth like that). When they arrived they came in a nice paper package that had gotten a little bent in transit but the lashes were fine. I had never worn false eyelashes before and had only meant to use them for cosplay but I loved them so much after wearing them for a whole day (12+ hours) that I may just wear them on a regular day. After my crazy anime makeup was taken off, the lashes looked really natural and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the price on these too! I will definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> they took a while to arrive. once i did receive the lashes i was disappointed. they were more like plastic. not what i wanted at all.</li>
    <li> For the amount and the price you get these at. I was just hoping for something a little more.&lt;br /&gt;If they were slightly thicker and if the outer-halves of each lash was more winged, is have been happy.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty decent if you just want to add a little extra length to your lashes during the day</li>
    <li> Mmmmm not so good. The base is to hard so difficult to apply on eyes and company from china packed really bad I got all lashes bend it and bad condition I won&#x27;t by this ever horrible product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want to look like a drag doll</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are SUPER thick, they don&#x27;t look like the picture. They don&#x27;t bend at all and they are obviously fake. It was like gluing a piece of black cardboard to my eyelid. Plus they took over a month to get here. Not worth the money or the wait.</li>
    <li> The only complaint that i have is that the lash band is too thick which makes it hard to apply. Definitely not for beginners. Other than that, good product for the price.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes came all smashed and only 1 eyelash seems to be fine&lt;br /&gt;obviously with only 1 workable eyelash i cannot use them at all&lt;br /&gt;They did come almost 2 weeks sooner than expected but under the conditions it arrived i cannot use them</li>
    <li> They are more &amp;#34;night life&amp;#34; then I would like but for the price it&#x27;s worth the risk ! I order them December 23rd and got them January 17th</li>
    <li> I got them a month and a half after I placed the order. It was okay since I knew it would take that long. The lashes itself look just like they do in the picture. They were actually cute on but they dont look very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but still cute. Makes my eyes look very big and attractive!</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering eye lashes offline...I was a little hesitant at first because I like to touch and see up close what im spending my money on. So i took a chance and bought a pair. And i have to say it is a great product and very affordable...I wouldn&#x27;t mind ordering another pair.</li>
    <li> The quality sucks and putting it on was a pain. You definitely get what you paid for. I ordered some like these before and they worked fine for me but these were not the same.</li>
    <li> Feels very cheap and stiff. Love the dramatic look, but just feel super uncomfortable. But you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> The bands of these are very stiff. I don&#x27;t recommend them for daily wear.</li>
    <li> The worse ever....how come they look soo nice and when you get them they are useless!!!never again!!hated them!!hate them hate</li>
    <li> It took 1 month and 3 weeks to arrive. Once I opened the package the paper case was all beat up. I was glad to see that there was 10 eyelashes but they looked nothing like the picture that I saw on amazon. The image I saw looked like the eyelashes were a natural shape but the ones I received looked all choppy. As If the company added more hair to the eyelashes then got scissors and started snipping away. They don&#x27;t have the natural look at all. I recommend the 99 cents store. :) they are a dollar and last a long time if you take care of them. They look more natural.</li>
    <li> A bit long, but still fun to wear. More for parties than for every day, but definitely worth the money :)</li>
    <li> I actually liked these eyelashes my only problem is that they are really stiff. They don&#x27;t feel natural or look natural at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing these lashes during the day. You really do get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t think i will be purchasing these lashes again.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re very flimsy and cheap looking they look like barbie eyelashes, I never applied them because they look really weird off so I know they might look crazy on my face. -__-</li>
    <li> I tried to straighten these but they MELTED! I thought these minion wigs would work easily being applied to a bald head! I ended up just taping it to my boyfriends... i just noticed these were eyelashes! Haha! So silly. Maybe i really shouldnt have taped these to his anus.... Is that like a health condition???./?!!!!</li>
    <li> I really love these lashes!! They are easy to apply and I plan on buying many more. Great find for me and love the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this type of lash for a couple of years now.  I love that they come in all sorts of different styles, and I can order a different pair if my mood changes.  Plus, they are cheap, which is nice when you don&#x27;t want to spend $10 a pair elsewhere.  That being said, they&#x27;re not like ones you&#x27;ll find in the stores.  These are a little thicker, and give you the very dramatic, obviously false eyelash look.  I&#x27;ve found they look best (on me) if you put a coat of liner on after their applied, to blend them in with your natural lash line.  I can usually wear one pair for about a week before throwing them away.  I just clean them with an eye makeup remover pad. As far as glue is concerned, I have had the best luck with either Revlon or Duo glue with the applicator brush.  I will for sure be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Last a long time meaning you can wear them over and over again.  So inexpensive very sexy porn star look</li>
    <li> These were cheap and you get what you pay for.  The look entirely fake and are thick and very hard to apply.  I have not been successful in applying yet.</li>
    <li> i was expecting natural looking lashes and let me tell u thats not what i got they where sooooo large and bulky and totally fake looking</li>
    <li> Okay here&#x27;s the thing. You get what you pay for. These eyelashes are not \\&quot;high-quality\\&quot; at all, as a matter of fact, they feel almost \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;. I also couldn&#x27;t tell which two where a pair .</li>
    <li> It takes a while but these look amazing on every single face and look I create. I am an MUA and I have packs and packs because they are so great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! Very cheap! I don&#x27;t like plastic on my eyes.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These are super cheap. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> They where just not a good fit for my eyes but good quality and over all very happy with how quickly they came. Good for smaller eyes</li>
    <li> These false eyelashes are extremely thin and much too short ..they are too stiff on the eyelid. They fall apart easily .</li>
    <li> I bought these for someone else. I was told that theyre just perfect, they go exactly as they&#x27;re meant to, they go on pretty easy and they&#x27;re a good size.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t get them to attach. tried many different glues. but you get what you buy, they are cheap , enough said</li>
    <li> The package came in the mail and the box was SO distorted and definitely not handled with care. The eyelashes are bent out of shape to the point where I cannot use them. I am very displeased. A complete waste of money, even being as cheap as it was.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying false lashes for many years and was very excited to receive this product. The pictures look very lovely, however what I got in the mail did not look anything like the product promised. It was thicker and longer and sharper looking, almost like shark teeth. It looks verrrry unnatural so do not buy this if that is what youre going for. Second of all, the lashes came in a cheap box that was bruised when i received it. However, i manage to make use of it by stacking two lashes together, it made my asian eyes look larger, but that was the only pro. PLEASE do not get these lashes.</li>
    <li> These are really cute and would recommend them. The only problem that I had with them was that they didn&#x27;t shape my eye very well.</li>
    <li> there really nice but really hard to put on once they were on they look amazing but it was hard to get them to stick.</li>
    <li> The price is unbeatable. If the lashes are too big, you should cut to fit your eyes (cut a little from each edge). Then apply glue to the lashes, allow about 15 seconds to set next put on your eyelid. It&#x27;s easier to hold the lashes from the middle to ensure its center.</li>
    <li> My lashes didn&#x27;t even come! I waited for it for 4 weeks and i keep on checking my mail. The sender said it might have out miss out of the way! LIKE SRSLY. I WAS WAITING!</li>
    <li> I always order 10 eyelashes at a time. They last a long time! &amp; can be reapplied if needed! Great purchase</li>
    <li> I really liked these very durable and you can customize them to fit. Their a little more on the thick and long side but not too exaggerated, i personally love them and i bought them to practice with because their cheep, i do recommend these!</li>
    <li> I love them thanks my my lashes very pretty and shinny i woulld love too order allot more in the near furture i plan to recommend dem</li>
    <li> Less than half of the product was usable. Some were too twisted and wouldn&#x27;t lay right.</li>
    <li> It was okay, but they could have mentioned that it did not come with glue.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. I looked like a drag queen with them. I guess I didn&#x27;t think they would look the way that they did. Good for people who wear tons of makeup, but for people who only do eyeliner and mascara....don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I was really amazed at how nice these look. They are not over done and look really natural. they are soft to the touch and look like real lashes.</li>
    <li> THESE LASHES DO NOT SHAPE WELL TO THE EYE BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY STIFF! GO FOR A HUMAN HAIR OR REMY HAIR LASH INSTEAD BECAUSE THESE ARE TERRIBLE. I WOULD PREFER GOING TO MY LOCAL BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE AND GET THE LASHES IN THE WHITE AND BLUE PACKAGING THAN WASTE MY TIME AND GO THROUGH THE PAIN OF WEARING THESE! UGH WHAT TO DO WITH THE OTHER 9 PAIR :?</li>
    <li> Not the best product ever, but can save you lots of money if you wear flash lashes often. Otherwise very cheap</li>
    <li> I ordered the natural long black eyelashes and instead received ones that are very thick, solid, one length (look like baby doll eyelashes). Definitely not the soft, tapered, thinner ones pictured. I am disappointed that they aren&#x27;t the ones I ordered, but I&#x27;m a performer and I burn through lashes and for 73 cents for 10 pair, I really can&#x27;t bitch too much. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, as in stores they would have been at the very least a dollar per pair. They are quality enough to be able to reuse also. So, if you aren&#x27;t choosy with what kind you receive, go for it. If you have your heart set on the ones pictured, I would advise against ordering.</li>
    <li> They can do better when it comes to shipping my item were banged up so not in good shape. They didn&#x27;t replace my damaged eye lashes nor did I get a refund they wanted to give me 20% off in I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s far. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎</li>
    <li> Item was as described and received on time!!  The lashes are very thick, look very nice for night time wear.  Gorgeous and easy to apply!  I will definitely order again soon, thanks!</li>
    <li> ew. these are horrible and thats all i need to say</li>
    <li> Item was in good condition</li>
    <li> I wish i knew exactly ehat it meant by thick because yhe eyelashes were thickike super dramatic overly done thick</li>
    <li> They should at least look real.  Looks like felt paper</li>
    <li> THESE ARE A GREAT 10 PACK OF QUALITY LASHES.I&#x27;M A LASH CONISURE&#x27; ,AND COMPARABLY FOR THE PRICE THEY ARE GREAT!THEY ARE DARK THAT MEANS THEY ARE NOTICABLE BUT THATS HOW I LIKE THEM!EACH PAIR LASTS SEVERAL TIMES AND FOR THE MONEY YOU JUST CAN&#x27;T BEAT THIS DEAL.THEY AREN&#x27;T TO LONG EITHER,YOU CAN CUT DOWN WIDTH ,BUT YOU CAN&#x27;T CUT DOWN LENGHT ,AND WITH THESE YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM BEING TOO! DRAMATIC.FAST SHIPPING AS WELL.</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes, very natural looking. Not plastic, I will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my lashes! I will def be making all my future purchases for lashes here.. It&#x27;s def worth the price.. Didn&#x27;t take long to get my order either</li>
    <li> These lashes are perfect for an over made up look but by any means aren&#x27;t natural looking at all.  I did have to curl them in order to get 75% vision from my eye, otherwise they block vision.  Wide so I had to cut edges but I usually have to with false lashes. Work one pair 10 times before I lost one and threw the other away and used new pair, very durable and can wash them and they don&#x27;t look used.</li>
    <li> just as pictured natural look</li>
    <li> did not come with glue but thats perfectly fine because they are inexpensive and look absolutely fantastic :) the instructions are not in English but if you are ordering fake eyelashes you should probably know how to use them ahead of time.aye try a YouTube video</li>
    <li> This lashes tooo longgg to arriveee!&lt;br /&gt;But wen they did i freknddd loveeed ittt at first they looked alil cheap but after i triedd them omgg there light on ur eyes!!( :</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly! I was so excited to get them for my mom who&#x27;s going through chemo for breast cancer. The are very nice and real looking. Mom loves them and they look very natural. The price is great and shipping was fast. Will buy these again when she runs out.</li>
    <li> I loved the price. If ur looking for a natural look then these arent the right choice for you. But the price/quantity are awesome. They are very sturdy and easy to wash and reuse.</li>
    <li> They look great on me I do plan on buying again so I will have them on the way since it takes a while to ship but sorry for the ones who didn&#x27;t care for them  glad they worked for me!</li>
    <li> This was dumb there way to think don&#x27;t look real at all makes u loo weird I wouldn&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> Very happy with how fast it came to my house and it works very well i was expecting something cheap but very happy with results and so is my customers that get makeup done... and it aso gives u options of how thick u want them n how long u want it too</li>
    <li> Blatantly fake look. In the sense that, I&#x27;m not wanting to look like a drag queen.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention they&#x27;re extremely heavy. I threw them away but luckily they were cheap.</li>
    <li> my niece was skeptical with it but she still like it a little longer shipping since its from another country but still the way how they describe the product we were all thinking its a natural eyelashes I guess not anyways thank u</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very full and they&#x27;re only appropriate, at least I&#x27;d say, for a night out or special event. Day to day and it&#x27;s too much. I think they&#x27;re pretty. But I want lashes that are very natural and simple. If you&#x27;re a glammed up kinda person, this is for you. If you&#x27;re a casual chick, consider buying something else.</li>
    <li> These are extremely poor quality and was not as described in the advert.  Also, they claim to be human hair but they are synthetic.</li>
    <li> Great lashes!&lt;br /&gt;Especially for the Price&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was efficient.&lt;br /&gt;A little long but so what? Just cut them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> Very hesitant at first because the eyelashes were a very low price. When I received them in the mail I was pleasantly surprised the lashes didn&#x27;t look cheap at all they&#x27;re stylish. When I put them on they looked way better. Very nice loved the way they looked on me. They were easy to apply on. Good thing they come in a 10 pair set it should last me awhile.</li>
    <li> Love how they&#x27;re long and thin and look natural since they&#x27;re not thick:)i love using them all the time! :)</li>
    <li> I had fun with the false lashes, experimented with a few looks raging from the extremes of anime to May West.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get but good deal but they&#x27;re very stiff ... Not soft at all</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE! They were so stiff, like copy paper. Threw them out! Went to store paid more but so what.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes, ppl think they are real all the time. Easy to apply and easy to clean and reuse.</li>
    <li> I always buy these lashes and the thicker kind. Let me tell you I LOVE LOVE these lashes. For there price your probably thinking they aren&#x27;t going to last?? But trust me they do. All though they don&#x27;t come with glue. These lashes last me months. I wear them for special accosions and there so natural looking . I get asked if there my real ones lol .. I do recommend them</li>
    <li> just like other reviews, its fairly dramatic, but that is what I expected, so no complaints because it was not expensive and for 10 good quality lashes, which is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> Well, I love everything eyelashes, these were okay! I like the really bulky kind of lashes, but decided to give these a try for work, work great! Even though they came in a smashed envelope and the box was completely smashed, still fit pretty nice. I had to trim them a bit to fit my eye because the base is too long for me, but they stay on great when using some professional glue and tools.</li>
    <li> you will need something to cut the extra lash used to keep them in place by packaging. Goog lashes, worth the money</li>
    <li> Love these for my everyday use just work with them trim them to your eye and they&#x27;re amazing can use each pair for up to 20 times or more</li>
    <li> THESE EYELASHES ARE THE BOMB&lt;br /&gt;WILL BE ORDERING MORE&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONE SHOULD PURCHASE THESE THEY MAKE YOUR EYES LOOK SO&lt;br /&gt;BEAUTIFUL</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a costume look go for it. not my kind of style i was looking for the full look guess i got too much. looks like a doll.</li>
    <li> I loved this eyelashes they are super soft and they look super cute. Definitely will buy again when i need more.</li>
    <li> received them before time, and they were gorgeous. The box was a bit bent but they were not affected. I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone seeking high quality strips for an excellent price. They last long with easy application as well!</li>
    <li> they are very stiff and flat i couldnt get them to stick to my eyelid because they were to straight!</li>
    <li> It took a while to get to my house but they finally made it. I have to say that the only bad thing about it is that they don&#x27;t stay too long. I use a strong false eyelash glue and even with that they come right off after an hour. Not what I had expected and they don&#x27;t even come the same as the picture.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the amount you pay! Only downfall is they are a little stiff which makes it hard to put on, but you just need to play with them a little, not too much an inconvenience to lower from a 5 star buy!</li>
    <li> so very unnatural and fake</li>
    <li> I guess you can you use these eye lashes for more of a natural look, they are however very shiny so you can tell they are fake. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I like the lashes. however, the line is too thick. lashes are long, you will have to trim the lashes a bit.</li>
    <li> I ordered these and was surprised at how fast they came! They are really dark, almost feather-like, but they are really good quality. They seem a bit thick though. The only thing I didnt like was that they only are long at the outer corners of your eyes, so you cant really tell your wearing lashes in the middle. They are great for that cat-eye look for sure, but im all about big open eyed looking lashes. I wont be getting these again, but I will definitely get different lashes from this seller. Actually ive already ordered 2 other sets. :)</li>
    <li> It took forever to receive them and when I did they were to thick they look like drag queen lashes. Way to heavy and two long I&#x27;m just glad they were cheep</li>
    <li> They are just what the name say &amp;#34;cheeky&amp;#34;! They look cheap and they appear to be two left eyes! I could have donated that buck</li>
    <li> These are the worst lashes i&#x27;ve ever bought! So ugly, bulky, cheapy and sooo fake. (I know all are fake but some look natural and glamourous, but these not at all.</li>
    <li> Oh Yeah! Now these are some nice lashes. Love Love Love Them. So pretty! I have purchased a few different kinds of lashes and I like these a lot. CUTE!</li>
    <li> There are no two alike so I cannot wear them and they&#x27;re way to big. Like costume makeup!!!  And there were some that were torn. Never will I purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t natural looking at all. I have no idea why they were labeled as natural when they look like drag queen lashes.</li>
    <li> I wasnt very satisfied with my purchase.  The false eyelashes were too straight.  Too stiff. They did not sit on my eyes very well. Very uncomfortable. .</li>
    <li> Nice product but to small for my eyes great shipping but would have liked to wear them.. Hopefully bigger ones come out</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are gorgeous! They are long and pretty. The only thing about them is that you&#x27;ll have to trim them a bit to fit your eyelid.</li>
    <li> Amazon needs to stop forcing us to write things in the comment box, or they will continue to get messages like this when no comments are necessary.  The product was fine, no problems, no issues.</li>
    <li> These are a waste of money and do not stick and thats with many diff. Kinds of adhesive eyelash glue</li>
    <li> These were great but the packaging came a bit broken and bent. I wasnt disappointed though because they were comfortable and looked great</li>
    <li> At first I was beginning to think they were never gonna come, I contacted the sellers about the issue and they were very kind about it.  The lashes were really big and different from the picture, i didn&#x27;t want these ones but little did i know i was sent these bc of a misleading picture but all in all I am satisfied with my product ONLY because of the price. These are good for practice.</li>
    <li> These are terrible.  Über thick and heavy. They look terribly unnatural. It is very plastic looking which I hate.  What a waste to make such a crappy proct.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes. They are made of really good material (not all plasticy like some other ones I&#x27;ve tried). All I had to do was trim them to fit my eyelids and BAM, they were perfect. Just the right amount of drama for my big makeup nights.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a two because I waited so long for it to ship I got two more strands of gray hair and like 5 more wrinkles on my forehead.  Not really but I still waited FOREVER!  Then the box was so ghetto and crushed when it got here.  I opened the box and it looked like toylekalon lashes...(I know I wear it for my hair weave all the time).  You do have to adjust the length unless your eyes are big enough to use the full strip.  It wasn&#x27;t heavy.  It was easy to glue and stayed on pretty well.  It wasn&#x27;t to long....but I say the bigger the better.  I think if you can master the art of false lashes these are great.  And they didn&#x27;t look like spider legs to me.  Just big and dramatic.  Overall for the price I&#x27;m satisfied but you get what you pay for.....apparently I paid for plastic...</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars for several reasons.  These look very natural ( they aren&#x27;t ridiculously long or thick).  They also have a very strong feel to them (as if you can tell by just feeling them they could be reused).  I was very surprised that for such a great price I received such a nice quality product and in a very timely manner!  Thank you Taobaopit!</li>
    <li> I love fake lashes. But these r extremely long!!! So long that they touch my eyebrows. They r not very flexible guess it was a good thing they were so cheap.</li>
    <li> took quite a while to arrive because im in the US but i didnt need them right away and the wait was worth the price especiallly since one pair is seven bucks at wall-mart and i received 20 pairs for 2 bucks.</li>
    <li> I thought I would have to wait a while to get them but they were hear before I knew it, and I love them!</li>
    <li> The eyelashes are very synthetic looking. They do the job, but I don&#x27;t like reusing a pair like I might with another brand of falsies. The connecting bit is very flimsy and kind of pokes me in the wrong way.</li>
    <li> These lashes look like a joke with how LONG and full they are. NOTHING natural about them. They&#x27;re so cheeply made that the base doesn&#x27;t hold the glue which makes them impossible to put on. Perfect for haloween otherwise save your money.</li>
    <li> I wear faux eyelashes every single day, and I have to say I&#x27;m a pro at applying them. But I usually pay 6 bucks a pair at the local pharmacy makeup counter so i wanted to try to buy bulk for cheaper.Even after cutting the lash band to fit my eye and using professional glue, these DO NOT bend at all to sit above your lash line. The lash band is so thick they look super fake from miles away, and even with professional glue do not stay glue down because the lash band stay super straight no matter what you do. They also took almost a month to arrive. You get what you pay for....DO NOT BUY THESE</li>
    <li> These lashes are really thick and great for evenings out. They are easy to apply and they came very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these over 5 times. they are extremely sexy and cute for everyday wear and affordable!  If you have a full face/oval get them!</li>
    <li> i think it is okay that the lashes .because i haven&#x27;t try that since i bought it .cuz i am not used to use the fake lashed and i think it is okay for me</li>
    <li> HELLO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for dramatic natural false eyelashes then this is the place for you, my friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purchase came in 2 weeks so depending where you are in the U.S. it may vary. Mine came wrapped in bubble wrap in a  orange envelope. The lashes weren&#x27;t damaged at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes allow you to cut them to fit to your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use DUO eye lash glue and they stick with out any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable but they can get in the way, sometimes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to remove and wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I use mine specifically for masks. I also put them on myself to experiment with makeup looks. If I would wear them I would wear them for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good price too . It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wish they were human hair tho,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please forgive my horrible writing skills.. haha ! :D</li>
    <li> Eyelashes look too fake when you put them on, they&#x27;re too dramatic and too long. I can&#x27;t wear any on a regular day</li>
    <li> Too big, didn&#x27;t like them at all they look like clown lashes I see why they were so cheap. Not good</li>
    <li> I was trying to be cheap and I regret it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, horrible quality! Buy at your own risk</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  They are very stiff and shapeless.  They don&#x27;t form well and they feel like paper.  But for the price, you can&#x27;t expect much better.  They&#x27;d be good for practicing learning to put on lashes.</li>
    <li> looks great on and they are very sturdy compared to others I&#x27;ve used. very pleased with these lashes! happy happy!</li>
    <li> Eyelashes are a little thicker than they look, but with a little trimming they look pretty good. I think next time I will pay a couple more bucks for some better ones.</li>
    <li> I liked this lashes but maybe not for everyday use in my opinion maybe  for a night out at a party or club or something like that. They are really big and somewhat shiny because they aren&#x27;t natural but they are pretty good quality for what you pay for them.</li>
    <li> Not sure why everyone has their panties in a bunch, but I&#x27;m in love with these lashes. For the amount you get and the price, this product is a total score. They may look a tad fake if you don&#x27;t trim them, but that is why they are called FALSE eyelashes, ladies!!! I trim mine and they look absolutely perfect. I ordered two more of this product so I don&#x27;t have to wait on shipping... takes a bit to get to the U.S., but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> you get aot for the amount and pak, Try are easy to workwith and put on. them don&#x27;t feel like they will rip on you. while trying to put them on. NICES!</li>
    <li> These lashes were the worst I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The photo does these lashes no justice. They look silky from the image but are hard to shape and plastic. Needless to say I waited about one month to  receive them. Never again!</li>
    <li> Says NATURAL and there is nothing NATURAL about this product. I mean if I wanted a stand out product for Halloween maybe but not for an everyday product for sure</li>
    <li> The lashes are very pretty and soft.  They are long so you can cut them to the size that you want.  The strip is stiff so I bend it so that it will easily bmold to the contour of my eyes.</li>
    <li> They are very dramatic and you should not just casually wear these.</li>
    <li> Love!!! It is exactly like the picture. Not to thick but you do have to trim the edges. The price is worth the trim lol</li>
    <li> They look pretty good for one or two times use. As long as you get good glue it will stay on. for the price it is amazing!</li>
    <li> for the price...i guess you can&#x27;t go wrong. but they&#x27;re pretty much like pictured, but on will look more costume like and fake. Also, doesn&#x27;t hold well w the glues i own.</li>
    <li> These are well worth the money ... They are softer than i expected... And not too long at all .. For those who gave a bad review . I think they just dont know how to apply false lashes. I would recommend them to a friend or anyone in the market to collect lashes at a very good price.. I will purchase this product again...Ohhhhhh and i got them sooner than i expected......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Props to vender</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the box was already damaged when it came in, or when I was trying to figure out how to get the packaging off because everything was sealed airtight. I think I was aggressive with the removal of the secure packaging so this shipment should get 5 stars. The shipment came in 3 weeks earlier than expected, so that&#x27;s a plus! The lashes are very thick, but I don&#x27;t mind. I needed a set of eyelashes that wouldn&#x27;t cost too much and these sealed the deal. 10/10 would recommend</li>
    <li> I was very excited about these lashes coming. could not of been more dissapointed when they arrived.  They are bizzare and nothing like the photo. MAYBE QUIT PROMOTING CRAP FROM CHINA!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the lashes. But when I got them/ The way they shipped and packed them. Three of the sets on the lashes got crunched. Lashed were twisted the opposite direction.</li>
    <li> it looks alright, but i can&#x27;t use it in the morning it&#x27;s too thick it doesnt look like natural in the morning, but at night it does. thanks i like it so much... i use diff brand before and its kinda a expensive so i&#x27;ll just keep ordering this one. i use this everyday.</li>
    <li> They are okay for starting out, but the bands are very thick and don&#x27;t stick well. Definitely going back to buying individual pairs. This was a good price but a bad product. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this for all girls. The lashes are very durable too which is a plus because they can be reused multiple times.</li>
    <li> The package was alittle damaged and was hard to take off the lashes without damaging them</li>
    <li> wore my first pair to work (im a dancer) and they held up very well, kept them on while i slept and everything for three days straight and they still were beautiful and still reusable. buy it</li>
    <li> Of course they took awhile to arrive but their from china so duhh but I LOVE THEM they are reusable . Not too long not too dramatic I just love it . Purchasing more for my clients .</li>
    <li> The lashes are pretty good, but they&#x27;re not natural it&#x27;s more on the thick side. I personally was looking for lashes far more lighter. I have small eyes so they look kind of weird on me, I think if you have bigger eyes these will look great on you.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, but not what i expected. They are too thick and simply gives it out that they look fake. The price was cheap, which i loved but the product was bad. Ive bought some on here before for $1 and those were even better.. wouldnt recomend. Save your money instead!</li>
    <li> I love these false lashes my daughter and I we wear them every day and they look great. I ordered 3 more packs and I can&#x27;t wait till they arrive.</li>
    <li> They served their purpose....little too thick</li>
    <li> These lashes are the most pathetic fake lashes I have ever seen. I honestly don&#x27;t think they could get any worse. They are very plastic looking, excessively thick and long, have no bend to them, and just plain hideous. I wouldn&#x27;t take these if they were given to me for free. Worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon. I was expecting long and even somewhat dramatic...but these basically look like ugly sheets of black plastic. I couldn&#x27;t even get the \\&quot;thing\\&quot; to stay on because it has no flexibility. Like I said, it&#x27;s an ugly piece of plastic that doesn&#x27;t even resemble an eyelash. Don&#x27;t buy them!! These are embarrassingly bad.</li>
    <li> THESE LASHES DO NOT LOOK NATURAL, THEY ARE WAY WAY TOOK LONG. DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE. I CAN&#x27;T SEE ANYONE ACTUALLY WEARING THESE LASHES.</li>
    <li> i choose this raking because of that the lashes are beautiful and i like it due to that it looks nice. i would also recommanded this my fellow friends too.</li>
    <li> Well I love wearing eyelashes throughout the day but these are more for going out. I have not tried them yet, waiting for the right time!</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the ardell waterproof glue and I have never received so many compliments. I&#x27;m a novice lash wearer, and was able to put the glue on the band part without a fuss (the band is a little thicker than norm). I trimmed a few down for the day and kept some longer, flirty ones for night. The only downside is after 2 uses they break apart:( (And I gently wash them with soap so they do last longer without the gunk, but I guess the material doesn&#x27;t put up well with wear and tear). Glad you get 10 pairs!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved them very nice and not too exagerated. I left some for me and gave some to my friend and they will buying some</li>
    <li> Love em. They don&#x27;t come with glue but ordered separately.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice. Seems sturdy and easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Blends well with my lashes and fits my almond eyes. Most lashes are too short (across my lid). These were great.</li>
    <li> To long and look fake. If it was for a costume or late night activity works good, but not good for the day light.</li>
    <li> It says natural in the title. No such thing. I wear false lashes all of the time. I thought by ordering the 10 pairs would be a good deal. It&#x27;s only a good deal if you want to look like a drag queen or you&#x27;re using them for Halloween or dress up purposes. No one will take you seriously with these spider legs hanging off of your face</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Gorgeous.</li>
    <li> These lashes are super dramatic and will look good on people who know how to rock thick and long lashes on a casual day! More likely for big eyes. Make sure dramatic lashes suit you before giving a bad review . Fast shipping and very impressed !</li>
    <li> I completely love the look, the band is stiff  but it&#x27;s still flexible. It is a great value for the money</li>
    <li> These false eye lashes look amazing online, but when you apply them they are better left in the box. I&#x27;m used to human hair lashes and synthetic just do not cut it.</li>
    <li> If you wear false lashes then you already know your way around and I would definitely suggest these. New comers, I would still recommend them to you. You can mess up a few times putting them on and still have some to spare without being out of pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they are a little heavy. Other than that...why are you still reading reviews?? BUY THEM NOW! I am going to purchase 2 more boxes before the middle of the month. My lashes fell out due to illness and these rock! I wear them daily...everyday! I even sleep in them. (Crazy I know, but hey.. sometimes you do what you gotta do. I have 4 kids!) These are a bargain and EVERYONE loves them. I even had someone at McDonald&#x27;s ask if I was famous because my eyes looked so beautiful. (Note, I don&#x27;t visit any restaurant, so I may just have looked unfamiliar familiar, but I&#x27;ll take it.)Yep.. winner!</li>
    <li> Poorly made. They don&#x27;t hold to the shape of the eye so gluing was impossible. I threw them away! Never again.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t not look like the ones in the picture. Very plastic.  But my daughter can play with them. No thanks</li>
    <li> I really bought these with the lowest expectations, and that is exactly what I got. Don&#x27;t waste your money, they aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> It may just be that I am new to fake eyelashes but I find these very hard to put on.</li>
    <li> I actually in love with these eyelashes im from the south where eyelashes are very common and even though these took damn near 3 to 4 weeks to get here they are very much worth the Dollar and some change. I&#x27;m guess it took a long time because I live in virginia and the are coming from where ever they are coming from. I&#x27;m actually bout to blog about this item!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please support an check out my blog!!!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Delivered ahead of schedule and in great condition! Very happy and worth the wait, would recommend that you try them out!</li>
    <li> They look like animal fur, terrible. Good thing they were so cheap, then again, u get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2-15-2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well i have to eat my words on this one and change it to a four star rating. i will admit i didnt like them at all looking at them in the package and threw them down and never even tried them, but last week i ran out of my usual ones and had to resort to these and once i put them on, they were fantastic!!! they looked so good even though i thought they looked really awful in the package. i was very surprised how good they were once they were on. i would say give them a try if you dont mind the long wait to get them. i am going to order some now, so they get here before the ones i have are finished</li>
    <li> I cannot use it they looks like doll lashes, I cannot put it on  I don&#x27;t know how so is cheap but rear</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this they break easily</li>
    <li> fells like cheap plastic</li>
    <li> They are such a good deal, but they are pretty flimsy. They are a bit more difficult to work with and fall apart easily. I know it&#x27;s not recommended, but I usually reuse my false lashes. These are definitely single use. But at the price, maybe worth it?</li>
    <li> I ordered these on a whim and should have known better based on how cheap they were.  First they did not look like the picture, and there is nothing natural about the way they look.  Second they are barely curved which makes them almost impossible to apply.  Last, they took forever to arrive.  I&#x27;ll definitely be staying away from these in the future.</li>
    <li> I am Very ,very Disappointed .they look relly Nice and natural online , i relly  thought they would be tiner But there not, there really thick and FAKE looking . I would relly appreciate if u could send me a more Natureal looking ones !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You .</li>
    <li> nice products my niece loved them it was a gift from me to her I sent them all the way to mexico and she loved them.</li>
    <li> If you like the waoo look then this is the way to go.. They are very dark n long.. Thanks for good wrapping</li>
    <li> Very full lashes , I would consider wearing for Halloween or possibly some special function but otherwise too full for regular day wear! Great deal and lashes look silky.</li>
    <li> These are good for wanting to add something extra to your look for the night, when you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of False Lashes.</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking.  Didn&#x27;t even use them but I should have save them for HOLLOWEEN</li>
    <li> Maybe someone else will like/appreciate the style but they are far yo bushy for me 1-10 there a 10 on the WTF scale</li>
    <li> Never could get on right.  Gave them to my granddaughter..  She loves wearing them and Her friends enjoy them too.</li>
    <li> these are actually a different style from my last lashes, I believe it was a different company( sometimes you can order and don&#x27;t keep track of who you ordered from ) but I love this style better and will stick with this company!</li>
    <li> The product came as described but no instructions on how to apply them as is going to be the first time I&#x27;m going to use them. The rest is perfect.</li>
    <li> Too dark and very unnatural looking, after I put them on, I took them off and decided not to wear them to work like I usually do; I may use them at a later time, maybe to an evening event, where the lights are dim...</li>
    <li> There ok eyelashes, ive had better. But u get what u payed for i guess. Some lashes dont match to well tho :/</li>
    <li> I did not like them, they where very long and hard. To much of a dramatic look for my taste. I had to cut them to fit the length of my eyes</li>
    <li> The product is great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone considering to buy. Very inexpensive and could not figure out how they would be any different from an expensive pair of lashes.</li>
    <li> The were way too long for my eyes, so I had to cut them, but then they were fine, and they r totally worth the super cheap price.</li>
    <li> NO DISAPPOINTMENTS HERE...THEY ARE GREAT.  GOT MANY COMPLIMENTS WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.  I WEAR THEM EVERYDAY TO ENHANCE MY OWN LASHES</li>
    <li> They are really thick but cute to wear when going out at night time. Also recommend cutting them for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> These lashes were so hard to work with and I couldn&#x27;t get them on, they were huge as well, disappointed.</li>
    <li> Way too thick.  They were heavy and weighed down my eyelid. So that I could not open my eyes all the way. It was just annoying but didn&#x27;t obstruct my vision too much.  Plastic could not be easily trimmed.</li>
    <li> not exactly what i expected, they are much fuller than what i wanted from the picture, and they took a long time to get here, but theyre from over seas so i understand but i guess i will figure out when to use them...</li>
    <li> I chose to rate these a 4. Although these eyelashes come freakishly long, you can always cut them to the length you prefer. They are very durable, they can be worn more than once. I have had no major issues with these eyelashes so far. They are definitely good quality for the little amount of money they cost. I would recommend these eyelashes for a formal outing, such as dinner. But not to work, they just do a little too much.</li>
    <li> These are good eyelashes just not for my eye shape.They took about a month and a half to come but there good eyelashes ad would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Good quality, I like the product. Cant wait to wear it. A little long but overall great product. Will order again</li>
    <li> These lashes are terrible unless your ready to slide down a pole and take your clothes off I don&#x27;t see where else these could be worn . They are ridiculous . I know fake lashes can&#x27;t look 100% real and natural but these don&#x27;t even come close the description on these are very misleading . As soon as I opened the box it went in the garbage . At least they weren&#x27;t a huge waste of money . Negative 10</li>
    <li> they are thick, dramatic lashes. if that&#x27;s what you want then they&#x27;re great, I still wear them but keep in mind that they are really dramatic</li>
    <li> The band is a little on the thick side and required extra bending and flexing before applying and still had to use extra glue to keep them in place. But otherwise they are beautiful.</li>
    <li> These came in pretty quickly considering they shipped from overseas.  The strips themselves are a bit too long, but not all that uncommon with false lashes.  When I got these in, I was surprised by how densely packed together the lashes are on the strips...it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.  That being said, I would purchase these lashes again.</li>
    <li> the rib of these eyelashes is very stiFF and hard to contour to the shape of your eyelid. TOO DIFFICULT</li>
    <li> Lashes are hard and shaped funny</li>
    <li> It is exactly what you get and what you pay for, it is a little thick and dramatic but nothing I cant fix trimming them myself ! The band looks and feels very durable and lets not forget to mention the price ! you cannot beat that! Shipping arrived when it said it would.Thank you for my lashes and I will be ordering from you soon!</li>
    <li> 1st Offf I Never Got Them It&#x27;s Been Over A Month &amp; Still Nothing! So Untill Then They Get A ONE-Star ! But One Things Forsure I&#x27;m Never Buying From Them Again! Smh</li>
    <li> I expected the lashes to look how they dd in the picture, but they dont. The lashes look incrediby fake and synthetic and I could have bought a more natural looking pair at the dollar store. Pro, it was only $.21 and they look really nice in pictures, just not for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I love this item although some might complain because of the way it was or is sent I don&#x27;t. I mean come on your paying for a box in which you know is and will pretty much break  or get crushed. Regardless I love my product it was on time and I use them all the time mine were soft and easy to use. Will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Just received my package it came all bend up I had to fixes some of the eyelashes they are very long and thick</li>
    <li> It is completely useless as it is coming without glue. Just lashes. I never used them since arrival. They are still in my drawer, however, eventually I will trash them.  I will not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> i have to put to pair together to get the look i want but its okay,i havent taken the time to wear them anymore but i do like them</li>
    <li> There is a thick lash line that is super obvious. Which isn&#x27;t bad if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for...but I&#x27;m not so personally they didn&#x27;t look great for me.</li>
    <li> These are nice, if applied correctly and with eyeliner they are very natural looking. They did take forever to get here though. I had just about given up hope.</li>
    <li> Bad lashes! Cheaply made but what do you expect for the price.</li>
    <li> I love them worth buying</li>
    <li> I tried these on and I looked a hot mess. They were so over-the-top that when I stepped out of the bathroom my friends laughed. I mean, I&#x27;ve worn falsies before but this was just too much. Only use for Halloween or as a joke.</li>
    <li> I like the dramatic look of these lashes. I love the price and I think I will become a regular client.</li>
    <li> They were so ugly and chip!  I though were better quality but I won&#x27;t buy nothing like this ones again! Sorry</li>
    <li> Looks terrible. Cheap eyelashes, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I got them yesterday. They were supposed to arrive on Valentine weekend, but i was surprise I got them so early. They are very natural looking, and are very light to  wear.</li>
    <li> I disliked the eyelashes because they ripped easily. I also didn&#x27;t like how the looked when applying them so I took them right off but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap.</li>
    <li> I did not recive these there for this review is for everone DOO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> They look great! I only had to trim them a little on the ends but that&#x27;s not uncommon. But other than that there PERFECT!! I love them! Got them sooner than expected so it was even better!</li>
    <li> I found the lashes to stiff... not flexible enough. Was not able to wear them.  Too bad as I liked the thickness.</li>
    <li> Me and my mom loved it, the one pair I had my mom took the rest..really hard to get from the box so be careful</li>
    <li> Lashes look really cheap, and the lashes them self are too short in length. Wouldn&#x27;t ever buy again. Threw box away..</li>
    <li> I have very large, bug eyes. These make my eyes look somewhat normal. I wear them every day. They are not as thick or fake in person, which is a good thing. I think they are very natural looking. The only thing is they kind of itch if I don&#x27;t apply them right.. That being said, I&#x27;ve never been good at applying false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;These look beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend these to any of my friends. The packaging threw me off guard, because it was very bent but I guess that may have happened during shipping. All of the lashes are in tact though. :)</li>
    <li> I usually spend $4 on one pair of human eyelashes when I&#x27;m going out but these here are good but not better then human. I can wear these everyday without over doing it. I will definitely be purchasing these again</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a costume where I needed super animated eyes, and they turned out great. I actually ended up layering three pairs. So far, I&#x27;ve reused the same pair a couple of times, which has been fine. If you only use one pair, they have a less dramatic look, but certainly, they look like fake lashes - which, incidentally, is the look I&#x27;m going for when I wear fake eyelashes. I have yet to wear any pair of eyelashes that doesn&#x27;t look fake. Particularly for the price, these are really high quality. There is a bit of excess on each end for packaging which needs to be trimmed, but it kept them looking great during shipping. I would definitely recommend these - they were great! Allow some time for shipping - it took about three weeks to get here in the US.</li>
    <li> They were farrr from natural they were very dramatic but they were great quality . So I was dissaponted I couldnt wear them all the time but they are nice for dramatic events</li>
    <li> Looks like straight up plastic on your eyes. It&#x27;s not worth the buy. These lashes were short as well, v</li>
    <li> They  are very cheap looking and there very uneven big and small....they are the worst...wouldn&#x27;t order again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> Omg these are so fake and so stiff don&#x27;t buy they are very thick and won&#x27;t bend so when you try to glue them on they won&#x27;t stay they lifted</li>
    <li> False lashes for sure!  They took forever to deliver which was expected but they are super think and reallly too much.  Something you&#x27;d use for a halloween costume to be super dramatic or drag like.</li>
    <li> I recently purchase this eyelashes and i LOVE them! they look really good when i put them on. they are easy to put on and the price is geat very cheap!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wear false lashes at least 3 days a week and these are the worst lashes I have ever bought they don&#x27;t conform to your eyelids they are stuck straight I have tried several times and different ways to make them bend its like the plastic is to hard to bend.they did come quickly in the mail considering they came from overseas.</li>
    <li> Soooo generic please do not buy . Lol . Lbvs . They probally only cost 2¢ each to make . I didnt even use them . Yess that badd . Their stiff . I  gave them to a friend to practice applying eyelashes .</li>
    <li> I love the length but they do not last long I am used to wearing my lashes for at least 8 hours and these didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Does not look one bit natural. The thick band doesn&#x27;t even stay glued down.overall just crap quality..you get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> Lots for the money. They look real. Very flashy but cute. Well worth the money. They do not fall out easy</li>
    <li> These lashes are awful, the curl out too much towards the inner corner of the eye, the strip is so thick, its hard to get them to lay naturally on the lid. I keep trying this 10 pack sets of lashes from different brands on here, and none of them are any good. I&#x27;m better just sticking with my dollar store lashes.</li>
    <li> These are the worst fake strip lashes you could ever purchase. These are only good for practicing strip lash application.</li>
    <li> These lashes were hard plastic, they hurt when you put them on. I guess you can cut them and use them on the outer corner of your lashes. No glue either.</li>
    <li> These look nothing like the picture. They are not angled (larger on one side). They are the same length throughout. They are extremely cheep and plastic. I understand that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; but they are NOTHING like the picture.</li>
    <li> First off they arrived 10 days after I ordered them. Amazon estimated the delivery at 3 weeks so I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived early. For $1.18, I was not expecting much but again I was surprised.  They are soft and the strip is very thin. Some people stated in their reviews that the lashes are too long...well the product advertises \\&quot;LONG Black False Eyelashes\\&quot;. There are shorter ones available on Amazon, so if you don&#x27;t want long ones look else where. I have paid $10.00 for a set of three from Sephora and these are a tenth of the price, a set of ten, and comparable quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; More importantly I have worn them out twice and had so many compliments it was ridicules. I cannot tell you how many women ask me were I got them.</li>
    <li> these are affordable, and work alright.  but you get what you pay for. these are cheap plastic lashes that have a sort of sheen to them which looks unnatural. (Just because we are talking about fake lashes, does not mean they have to LOOK fake.) you do have to trim the tails off the sides but that&#x27;s not hard to do.  I don&#x27;t feel they are thicker than the picture. As far as fake lashes go, I prefer the ones made with real hair over these plastic ones.  of course those are more expensive, but worth it.  I find these a little harder to work with because seem less flexible and a little less comfortable to wear as well because they are a thin plastic material.  So all in all,  I like how affordable they are, for the price its really hard to complain.. and they are better than nothing.  But not the greatest lashes out there, that&#x27;s for sure.  If they are all you can afford,  go for it.  (I&#x27;d also recommend buying dark or black lash glue to put them on with,  not white because sometimes the white glue is visible!)</li>
    <li> I like false eyelashes but these are ridiculous.. They are really big and look nothing like the picture. I was thinking they were going to look natural and flawless. But these are really big and fake looking. And they are uneven. You can&#x27;t cut them right. And  they both look like they are for the left eye. I don&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the price. I have more than enough lashes to last me and anyone of my girlfriends who want to dress up or wear them for costumes any time of the year. These lashes cost less than one pair at the local drug store. Again, the packaging is not great, but the quality of the lashes are. I would rather that, then the other way around. It helps keep costs down too, i&#x27;m sure. Thank you for these lashes. I would very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t bad but not what i was expecting them to be, but they are really thick and great for more daring makeup looks.</li>
    <li> Worst eyelashes ive bought to thing they cont event bend to ur eyeshape when u put them since their to thick uggly !!! Very mad</li>
    <li> After shuffling through many eyelash options I settled on these .For $1 I thought it was amazing and the picture makes them  look very natural... they are not as the picture appears but on the flip side I still love this look it gives! Might try anither brand but these were NOT a waste of money I still love them...</li>
    <li> These lashes are by no means \\&quot;natural looking,\\&quot; however, not many false lashes are anyways! These are very dramatic but they are very workable. Usually, I&#x27;ll cut them in half, thin them out a bit, then apply them to the outer edge of my lashes. They blend better and can be super cute. For the price, who cares? One pair of false lashes at any store in America will be $3+ so if you regularly use falsies or want to try some out, these aren&#x27;t too bad of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product ships from Hong Kong, its takes a couple weeks and it does not have any tracking information. I got mine earlier than expected, though!</li>
    <li> Love them!!!!!! Everyone asks me where I get my lashes</li>
    <li> I think these lashes were great for the price! I literally re-used the same pair of lashes up to 4-5 times and were still in good condition! And plus you get 10 pair of lashes even better! Although I do wish they had different styles and sizes of lashes, but other than that they are amazing!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes do not stay on. I have tried 2 different types of glue. They were imported from china so maybe they are made with different fibers? not sure. but they are pretty  just do not stay on or adhere.</li>
    <li> Now I only speak for myself. I prefer light and natural falsies. I found these heavy as holy H and they look TOTALLY un natural. For anyone going for the big lashes gyaru make or sultry night look here you go. Oh and these took almost two months to get.</li>
    <li> Great. Durable. And look natural. If you are unsure, I highly recommend buying this product! I received my order fast and was very pleased with the product for the price!</li>
    <li> The lashes are great, yet they arrived smashed and flat. Wish they would package them in a better box.</li>
    <li> They do not glue on well and they break/tear reall easily. Got to only use 2 sets out of all 10. Very poor quality lashes.</li>
    <li> these lashes are a great choice! they are perfect for a night out ! I love them so much and the price was a great deal</li>
    <li> A little too thick and able to be seen too much around the eyes not sure if used again thank you anyway</li>
    <li> The lashes overall are cute but they are so hard to manipulate into my eye shape.  I doubt I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  Wrong type.  Put in costume trunk.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love. Natural looking and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> these arrived a month from order, as expected. box they were in was squished from shipping and one eyelash was loose but none were damaged. these eyelashes look like the picture-- they are THICK. they look like fake lashes, and if you&#x27;re going for a very dramatic look then this is it.&lt;br /&gt;i am using these for cosplay and they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected.  They were unreal and they were not easy to apply.  I tried bending them with no success</li>
    <li> they are very fake look and exaggerate Eyelashes. i will never wear them only if i go to the night bar.</li>
    <li> I had to trim them, as they were too long for my eyes (length across)... They stay on longer and more comfortably than any other false lashes I&#x27;ve ordered, though.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how quickly my order was shipped.  all smiles when opening my package and it was exactly how it was described.</li>
    <li> The shipping was good and the price was good as well, the product is not my favorite. It did not look exactly like the picture. I contacted customer service and told them about the issue and they said they would do a refund but I haven&#x27;t gotten the money yet. So I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were the most cartoonish thick eyelashes and most definitely doesn&#x27;t match the description. I would not recommend these to anyone. Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re looking for natural thin lashes</li>
    <li> They look gorge on the product picture but wtf?! These look plasticy and super fake. I was in the market for some sexy lashes, but these look cheap. No offense but they look like something a tacky hooker would wear! Eeeeep :X never again.</li>
    <li> they said natural long black, but they were not natural looking. they were long, but they were not big enough for my eyes and just didnt look goos</li>
    <li> I Honestly thought that with the product being so in-expensive, the product would be crap. But I was able to keep these lashes on for up to 12 hours (A first)! There not extremly flexible like the ones you buy at walgreens ECT... but just enough firmness to keep  them on! Good/inexpensive product...</li>
    <li> These are cute. It was thicker then I had expected. But u do get your bang for your buck. Nice packing too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear lashes often but these serve the purpose. Took a minute to get to me but worth it</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re soft &amp; long so you can make them fit any eye size but for me, they&#x27;re a bit of a hassle to put on. especially since its not my forte to put on falsies. they are tied down &amp; came in a smashed box, but they came unharmed.</li>
    <li> They r to long looks very fake n plastic. No body like it that long. I&#x27;ll never again gonna get lashes online.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes look as pictured. They aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for me. Very bold,long and thick lashes! They look great on but they were a bit much for me I ended up wearing a pair and gave them to my sister. Great quality and guantity for the price!</li>
    <li> these look way too fake and the glue doesnt stick on them. the band is too thick and the hair is too stiff</li>
    <li> These are not natural looking at all. Very thick. Reminds me of Elvira or something like that. Couldn&#x27;t use these. Maybe for Halloween. Not for every day use unless you&#x27;re Nikki minaj or want people to ask about them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, the &#x27;natural&#x27; false eyelashes, and what I got was heavy tiangle-patterned lashes.  Not natural looking at all.</li>
    <li> Fiquei com medo depois de ler tantos coment&amp;aacute;rios e acabei querendo arriscar em comprar esses c&amp;iacute;lios.&lt;br /&gt;Procurando uma coisa um pouquinho mais ousada, saindo da rotina de c&amp;iacute;lios tão naturais, apesar agora a &amp;#34;moda &amp;eacute; c&amp;iacute;lios postiços&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Esse c&amp;iacute;lios s&amp;oacute; ficam bem com uma maquiagem escura nos olhos, se não ficam muito artificiais.</li>
    <li> Worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon! I wear false lashes often, but the quality and thickness of these were just horrible. Don&#x27;t think I would even wear them if they were free.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $3 or whatever it is cost. It took a month before I got it and they are hard plastic that is not flexible whatsoever. I was so embarassed when I tried putting it on a client.</li>
    <li> They look great on my gf but dont look as great in the box.&lt;br /&gt;i have seen others she had bought and they look better then these in the box.</li>
    <li> They did not look anything like the picture. They were way too stiff and did not glued. I wish I could send them back but they were cheap enough that Its not worth it.</li>
    <li> really long. and you have to cut them to get them to be the way you want. But they are cheap and fun. Especially for something fun like halloween or girls night</li>
    <li> Just received this item today, it came super fast. If you dont love big lashes these arent for you ! But i loved them ((: they are soft, long &amp; full, great buy for a great price. Definitely happy with this product &lt;33</li>
    <li> The lash band is sorta thick.. And you have to shape em and size em a lot. .. Not for beginners. More for play.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t high quality but if you are familiar with wearing false eyelashes and are comfortable with different styles then these are perfect and worth the buy, I bought about 40 from here and you don&#x27;t really know what style you are going to get I have a few different styles but I like them all. They ship from hong kong so be patient and they will come. Hope this helps (:</li>
    <li> I know I ordered these from abroad and paid next to nothing for them but they definitely missed a step on the assembly line.  They are very lightweight which I like but I have yet to trust them to stay in place for long periods of time without an excessive amount of DUO.</li>
    <li> definitley recommend! good price and theyre dramatic looking but they dont look fake like your typical 99 cent lash, no shine on them</li>
    <li> I wear fake eyelashes as everyday makeup and these are too much.  They are very long and thick,  maybe for a night out but not for a natural everyday look.</li>
    <li> These worked great for our dance competitions.  I plan to order more for our Cinderella professional performances, now.  I plan to be a steady customer.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These lashes are OK if you run out of good ones that you normally would wear, but overall they are not the kind of lashes that I would proudly wear out on a girl&#x27;s night out. No way.</li>
    <li> Loveeee these!!! GREATTTT GREAT GREAT bargain! 10 eyelashes for $1-$2!!! Love them! I need to order More! I got some for my sisters and they loved as well!</li>
    <li> these eyelashes are so stiff they don&#x27;t even bend. At least they are cheap and I don&#x27;t feel so bad wasting the money,</li>
    <li> Great product for unbearable price!! Im beyond impressed!!! Very natural look worth every penny!! Im gonna buy more ! Awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought these lases on the 11/7 and they just got here today 11/21, shipping is long if you buy from the hong kong seller fyi...they are soft pretty and thick but a little on the short side for me. You cant beat the price and the free shipping :)</li>
    <li> Very good. Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
    <li> What are these? Lmao it&#x27;s bigger then my whole eye! Like wth! I tried applying it in but it was just ridiculous so yeah waste of like 4$</li>
    <li> I hated these so much. A waste of money! They have a a thick plastic strip and the hairs look plastic and shiny. I workforce these no stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Shipping was a little slow, but the package arrived unharmed. The lashes are somewhat shiny, but just as full as the pictures show, so proceed with caution; they&#x27;re not everyday, natural-looking lashes. They did require some trimming, but the ones I received were voluminous and added length. The band was flexible and I had no particular trouble putting them on. They are reusable if you take care of them properly, and considering how many pairs you&#x27;re given for that price, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These lashes reminded me of very very hard doll hair...they are way too fake looking...not worth the money at all</li>
    <li> Not anything like the picture.  Think they sent me the wrong ones.</li>
    <li> These lashes are unnaturally thick and bristly. If you&#x27;re going for the natural look DO NOT buy these! They are very obviously synthetic, and plastic looking.</li>
    <li> cheap don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are nothing like advertised. Super thick.. Un mold able.. Save your money...</li>
    <li> A little longer and thicker than expected. The picture makes them appear thinner than they are.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given this seller 4 stars except I found not one, but two major no-nos. First, the original box looked like it is not the original because a couple of lashes were coming out and the box was not sealed. It looked like the lashes that were coming out were already cut on one side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And second, the packaging did not protect the merchandise. Unfortunately, I have a mail lady who likes to cram as much mail in my box until she absolutely has to give us a key. So the box of lashes were mashed in. Had the seller used an envelope that had bubble wrap, they might have been in better condition.</li>
    <li> They Take Way To Long To Get Here. Their Nice If You Like Long Full Lashes. They Dont Look Like The PIcture But They Are Nice.</li>
    <li> Goodnight Product arrived quickly and well, very seriously recommended the purchase 100%, no detail, and size is the corect perfer</li>
    <li> I got these like a week before they said I would get them in the mail  which is Awasome , I&#x27;m new the the false lashs I got the thick ones and I really like them</li>
    <li> The lashes in the picture look more full than the actual ones I recieved in the mail. I dont usually get ones with spaces between the lashes but for less than $3 for 10 pair, how can I complain?</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!!! After spending ridiculous amounts of money on lashes, I finally found the perfect ones! They&#x27;re so nice 3 of my friends are waiting for me to order them some!</li>
    <li> Well you get what you pay for lol but they ok for the price I can deal...they long but not to long I like my lashes thick but not to thick so I use two together and its just right. Ummm these lashes feel kinda wixie they don&#x27;t feel real that&#x27;s where you get what you pay for come in at.</li>
    <li> This is a good fake eyelashes</li>
    <li> I realize this is a great price for falsies but it took a very long time as they came from overseas (I did not know this before ordering). The box was not sealed and some of the lashes were glued to the bottom of the box. Things that aren&#x27;t sealed makes me think that they may have been used. Gross.</li>
    <li> These lashes are okay, easy to cut to the size you want, and with the right lash glue they&#x27;re fine. Normally i get regular lashes, and cut them in half and only place them on the outer edges of my eyelashes, for more definition and nothing too dramatic. But these are just so thick, with so many lashes that they look so ridiclous only on half of my eye, and even more ridiculous if I apply the entire thing to my eye. They&#x27;re fine, just not my thing. May use one pair for halloween or some crazy event, but definitely not for regular use. Glad they&#x27;re so cheap though!!</li>
    <li> They where to shiny and need to look more natural but alright for a cheap prince. I will be buying more !</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not at all what I wanted. They were thick and just ugly and fake looking I was looking for natural looking lashes and these aren&#x27;t it. Don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
    <li> PERFECT...YOU WILL LOVE....WILL RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND....BEAUTIFUL LASHES...THE PICTURE DOES IT NO JUSTICE....MUCH BETTER IN PERSON....LOVE LOVE LOVE...YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET</li>
    <li> They are huge and really for stage or club use. They&#x27;re gorgeous for the price!</li>
    <li> I like the false eyelashes  they are very natural looking they&#x27;re not too long  very natural looking I love them</li>
    <li> The lashes arrived smashed and you have to pick and choose which set will look okay when they are all the same. Would really recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliment on my lashes and they are way more durable then the one pair for three bucks in the store!!! Well worth it!! My second time buying and its all i can use!</li>
    <li> Well I forgot that I ordered, fun cause it was a surprise, However this was a surprise I didn&#x27;t want, I got yesterday and returning ASAP.</li>
    <li> I expected low quality, based on the price I paid for them. However,I war pleasantly surprised. They are actually good. You can trim off any excess that&#x27;s unneeded. Definitely a must buy</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t revived them. I wish I could say something nice but I haven&#x27;t recived them. I wish I could get them as fast as they can send them to me</li>
    <li> these are very thick and dense lashes. great for a photo shoot or pulling off a certain look. They weren&#x27;t exactly what I thought they&#x27;d be but I used my scissors to thin them out a bit. great price for lots of lashes</li>
    <li> Yes they are fake. They are not rubbery, and are easy to shape. Play them right, and you can get the cute little Katy Perry look.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these eyelashes! They are very dramatic, and if you like to stand out these lashes are perfect! I got so many compliments ! They are definitely worth getting. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> wonderful if you are wanting a dramatic look or if you want to practice putting on lashes I would recommend</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the night life, they look fake but in a good way&lt;br /&gt;one would just have beautiful full lashes that can match their makeup for&lt;br /&gt;going out. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Lots for cheap. Can&#x27;t beat that. Will need scissors as the ends have weird strings</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and i was able to use each pair 2 maybe 3 times i would get these again. They were very cute and blended well with my natural lashes</li>
    <li> These take up to 3 months to get, you have to trim them tremendously... Just stick to the $ store</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
    <li> If you want to look like you glued a caterpillar to your eyeball- go on ahead and add it your cart. Order took 4 weeks to arrive- after it got thru customs from China...came in an envelope from the 1930&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Love them!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s say that if you love HUGE fake lashes this is for you, It maybe bc i didn&#x27;t read the specifications well or whatever, but I was expecting something big but at the same time that it will look somehow natural. This eyelashes are really thick and really really long. If you are looking for something huge this maybe your product, if you are looking for something natural this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Unlike any other false eyelashes, this false eyelashes is extremely uncomfortable. It&#x27;s too long, hard &amp; thick &amp; It&#x27;s not soft &amp; seems like it made out of fake feathers. Overall, I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
    <li> these lashes were pretty however a little to thick for me, but for a evening look these are perfect length</li>
    <li> when i got them they were not thin at all</li>
    <li> I think their description needs to be updated&lt;br /&gt;they were MUCH thicker and bolder then described. Thought theyd be more natural but no you can definitely tell they are on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;So they arent to bad if thats what you want but since its not what i wanted, i wont be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> so these are my favorite lashes by far of ever buying or having falsies. they are a little thick and a bit dramatic but that&#x27;s my style so i love it and i love these lashes.i can use them over and over and it comes with ten so for the quantity and the price ill def. be buying more when i run out</li>
    <li> I think these eyelashes are perfect. They are not too full and not bare at all so they look good with or without mascara. I wear them on a daily basis just for a little emphasis on my eyes and they are very comfortable, soft, and flexible. If  you are not usedto wearing fake eyelashes I would suggest you make them a little shorter or use eyelash curler to curl up out of your eye sight until you are used to them being there. All in all I am very pleased with my purchase and will purchasing again in the near future.</li>
    <li> very big, may tell there fake right away. but still useful if your able to pull it off good. long too</li>
    <li> These lashes are made very well.  I have never worn false lashes in the past, but I made the mistake of going to a salon and letting them glue in some fake lashes.  When they fell out a month later, some of my lashes fell out with them.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.  These lashes served their purpose until my lashes grew back out.</li>
    <li> i gave 4 because i thought they were thin</li>
    <li> Are very cheap. I&#x27;m using and i go well. I prefer more short, but i do and ready! With duo glue is genial. I recommend.</li>
    <li> they dont look like this in person, not as whispy and theyre just not my favorite lashes that ive used</li>
    <li> The eyelashes were too thick and long for me. They look unnatural. I thought they would be different based on the picture.</li>
    <li> we order it for gift but didn&#x27;t pay attention this item doesn&#x27;t include special glue.....&lt;br /&gt;i have no idea what kind of glue  must be.........</li>
    <li> Im glad I bought these lashes. I have fairly long lashes but I want them to look fuller and these did the trick!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. If you&#x27;re looking for something overly dramatic that could never be worn for everyday use, then the look of these are pretty good. They practically blinded me, though. I felt like I was wearing 10 lb lashes! I feel them when I&#x27;m blinking and when I&#x27;m not. Could barely keep my eyes open with them. I wore them once to take a picture and took them right off.</li>
    <li> Very bad material look like u out plastic lashes in ur eyes and not steady with adhesive</li>
    <li> These are very thick &amp; the band is somewhat stiff. Just bend it a lot &amp; trim them before use :) Not for a natural eyelash look.. great for the price if you like big lashes.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I will never but paper plastic lashes again.</li>
    <li> Received these absolutely crushed. They were un usable.</li>
    <li> Loved these lashes they where everything</li>
    <li> so i got my eyelashes at a good expected time and very satisfied that i paid for a really cheap price for good quality for lashes...would recommend them</li>
    <li> These lashes were rubbery and would not stick on, even with the most professional and expensive glue! They reminded me of something made for a DOLL- extremely unnatural looking and feeling! The hair itself is plastic! I wanted to save money since fake eye lashes are so expensive in the drugstore, but this product was a total flop!</li>
    <li> Not the quality I expected it. This lashes are great if you are trying to learn how to apply lashes but if you are going to put them on clients, not the right kind to get--they look extremely fake when on. I was going to use them on my private clients but when I received them I changed my mind. I&#x27;m not going yo compromise the quality of my service. I only use them when I&#x27;m teaching my students how to apply lashes.</li>
    <li> I love lashes ladies im always skeptical about buying products off line but for such a low price why not.It took a little while for me to receive them but they feel soft and they look so good on my eyes when i went out i got allot of compliments.You may have to cut the edges off a little but if you like full lashes these are perfect. I will definitely order some more :)</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get a better deal or better eye lashed any where. Even better than Ardell. Love them and tell your friends.&lt;br /&gt;Julie</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but they&#x27;ll work for costume parties. Not natural looking at all. But I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I really like using these lashes. I was not really used to wearing them, so I had a hard time at first, but now, it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to cut them. They are held on to the board with a little... almost like a string. I have smaller eyes, so I have to cut them down anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reused them several times before tossing them. And it&#x27;s almost like the more you use them, the better they bend and form to your eye (probably from all the glue, haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying these again. Shipping time was surprisingly fast as well, being that they are coming the whole way from Hong Kong!!</li>
    <li> I knew that these will be dramatic and they are, but being shorter at one end they actually look nice for more glamorous looks, They arrived in good condition, the seller (LuckyStore) had packaged them with special protection, so nothing was crushed. they have longer threads at either ends which I trimmed and they are rather shiny (as in unnaturally shiny). But again, they look interesting for a dramatic evening look.&lt;br /&gt;My problem with them is that they aren&#x27;t curved enough and that the band is so stiff that I can&#x27;t get them to properly stick to my lids. I used the Revlon Precision Lash adhesive which is supposed to be really good, but they are so stiff that one end would constantly come loose (it refused to mold to my eye). I&#x27;d really like to use them and I&#x27;ll try to fiddle with them some more, but the first attempt was discouraging. Still, I&#x27;m not very upset about it because they were very cheap.</li>
    <li> When I received these lashes, it looked like little strips of black feathers were placed into a box.There are too many lashes per strip, and wearing them looks pretty gaudy.</li>
    <li> Crap. Maybe ok for Halloween. Would not use on a bride</li>
    <li> i recieved the product on time and they were just as expected!! unbeatable price too!! i will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> The lashes I received look nothing like the picture. They look very fake, like very fake. So if natural is what you want, these are not for you. But for about 2.50 for ten pairs as too $1 per pair isn&#x27;t that Bad really. I&#x27;m sure I could make them work somehow</li>
    <li> Loved my lashes so pretty</li>
    <li> They not the right size of fit, too fake and too long and thick, but would get a different pair</li>
    <li> Absolutely one hundred percent recommend these. They were expedited extremely quickly great quality and a good length for my personal eyes and they aren&#x27;t too gawdy to wear during the daytime so I&#x27;m not just limited to wearing them in the night time.</li>
    <li> These lashes were a waste of money. They are huge and look fake. I thought they would be more natural looking.</li>
    <li> shipped in only 10 days! and these look exactly like the picture shows to a T! people saying they dont look like the picture are lying! their obviously super full and dramatic like the picture shows! if you dont like dramatic full lashes then dont get these, but if you do then get these bad boys! mine came in bubble wrap and a manilla envelope. PERFECTION!</li>
    <li> A great mix btwn glamourous and a little less fake. Looks great on and can use at least 3 times depending on the glue u use.</li>
    <li> I received the eyelashes about 1 week ago. They were not what I thought I would receive but they will work. The look of them are more like spiderish(if that makes sense) , instead of what the picture looks like. They are very thick looking. Would be great for a night look, but if u bend the lash band u will see the lashes spread out and have a thinner look instead of a thick look. Which would be good for a day look in my opinion. But overall it was worth what I paid. I think I would probably purchase them again.</li>
    <li> My issue is that they do not look like the picture at all and are very poor quality. They are very heavy to wear on the eyes and make my eyes itch like crazy!!! My issue is natural long right no they look so fake I understand most eye lashes will not look real but these are scary looking. I have huge eyes and had to cut them to even get them to fit. I have been a make up artist for years and I am always complimented on my eye make up I like my eyes to stand out but this is just to much not to mention the large white line of paper underneath the eye lash what is that???? You get what you pay for and I got what I paid for cheap horrible itchy spider/ drag eyes. Be prepared not like photo at all!!!</li>
    <li> I love the lashes you just have to cut to fit your eyes ... &amp; it took a little while (2 -3 weeks) to get to me (MO) . They are very long, great for the dramatic glamorous look! DO NOT buy if you are looking for a natural look. But overall they&#x27;re great.. I LOVE :)</li>
    <li> The hair in these is synthetic plastic and not natural as advertised. I have not tried them on to see how they look yet, but I can tell they wont look natural.</li>
    <li> These lashes are super super thick, they are like Snooki. I wore them for special occasions, but its not my style to wear these every single day!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive the lashes however, when I got the box it was smashed and the lashes were a bit messed up. I understand that it was shipped overseas but I just wish I could&#x27;ve gotten them in a better condition.</li>
    <li> These do not look at all like the picture. They are large, chunky, and very plastic/fake looking. Waste of money, never ended up using.</li>
    <li> it was taking to get it longer and its first time but finally I got it.  so excited it and good price.  For fun and parties.  I like it. :)</li>
