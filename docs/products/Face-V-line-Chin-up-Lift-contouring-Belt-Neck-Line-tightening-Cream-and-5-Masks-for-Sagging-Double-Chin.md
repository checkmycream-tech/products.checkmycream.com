    <li> It is good. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I looooooooooooove these products! .... Never heard of this brand decided to try something new for my jawline and i&#x27;m happy that i did... It&#x27;s been 3 days and i see improvement... I&#x27;m 33 and i don&#x27;t have a bad neck just a fatpad under my mouth/neck area  that all of the women in my family seem to inherit and i am seeing changes already.... I like the neck cream (i wish it was a bigger size in here tho) and the strap that u wear is comfortable and durable but the best part is the neck patches... U can feel them working! It doesn&#x27;t hurt and i had no irritation but u get a warm sensation which i enjoy.... I just wish thst i knew how to purchase more without purchasing the whole set with the strap again.... Please if anyone knows contact me... Otherwise it would be a five star review for sure...</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had a great experience so far with customer service as well as the product.It shipped very fast and packaging was secure and well preserved.
