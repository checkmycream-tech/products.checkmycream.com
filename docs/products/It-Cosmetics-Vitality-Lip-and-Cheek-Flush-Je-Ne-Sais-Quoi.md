    <li> you missing out if you dont try this I love it</li>
    <li> Love it cosmetics and this is perfect on the go or not!  It is moisterizing and smells good and it stays on!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product, for travel as it is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;One step and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more pink than I like, but OK.</li>
    <li> I really love this lip stick/ balm. I love the way it works, it goes on colourless and quickly turns into a blush.</li>
    <li> My favorite tint. It changes with the lips temperature. So it is not always the same shade.  I use it also as a natural blush. It lasts a good time between applications.</li>
    <li> love this for my lips and Cheeks! it is a always have on hand and great price!</li>
    <li> I have to keep applying it, but it feels good. I don&#x27;t get how it is anti-aging, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like cherries and it makes a lovely lip stain/butter. The color is temperature activated. I applied it to my arm and it turned a brown pink. I applied it to my cheeks and it turned a bright pink. It is a little tough to spread and it feels sticky on the face so I recommend getting a nice stippling brush to blend it into your cheeks</li>
    <li> Nice size lip stain, very natural colour which I like, but for the cheek - not at all - it is so battery , no no no , just if you don&#x27;t mind to get sticky to your partner. I still think it is a good product and I&#x27;m going to try other product  from it cosmetic. This product is more promising then what it is. I&#x27;m using it but still looking for perfect lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s larger than my original tube. But that means I won&#x27;t need to order it again for a while. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Long lasting moist color that looks natural. I use this not only on my lips, but since it&#x27;s so large I use it on my cheeks as well. I&#x27;ve purchases several of these- don&#x27;t want to ever run out of a beauty staple.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get how this is a stain . 24 dollars?&lt;br /&gt;It is awfully short lasting. Last for about 30 min to an hour. Forget about drinking it will stain the whole cup and nothing stays on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Baby lips from maybeline are $4 and do the same trick.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I use it on my cheeks &amp; lips. It stays on all day!!!! Makes your skin look dewy and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love the feel and color, wish it stayed on longer.</li>
    <li> Love this lip stain.  Beautiful color, long lasting.  Keeps lips moist.  My daughter uses it too.  Highly recommend it. Really</li>
    <li> I love the natural look and it does go on smooth !!!! this product means a lot to me I finally found what I have been looking for and you only need a little, then just freshen it up when you normally freshen up all your makeup !!!!! don&#x27;t change anything about this product please it is perfect .</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite product. I use it everyday on my lip,it is clear but it makes my lips feel so good all day. I will be a repeat user of this product.</li>
    <li> Love how this &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; is clear but tints lips in a natural shade.</li>
    <li> Love this creamy, long-lasting lipstick.  I have permanent lip color (color tattoo-ed in), and the shade of this lipstick is an almost perfect match.  The creaminess keeps my otherwise dry lips from looking dry -- gives a more polished look.</li>
    <li> Great staying ability</li>
