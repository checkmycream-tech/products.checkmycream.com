      <li>I like this product, and it works great as a top coat and stays shiney even as it dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>I feel this top coat protected the color polish and helped keep my pedicure fresh looking with no chipping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do check the other reviews re: colors - not everyone is happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a nice sheen to it (not super shiny) and it&#x27;s healthy for my nails.</li>
      <li>So far, it seems fine.</li>
      <li>I used this product all last summer and at first my toe was OK.  </li>
      <li>I threw out all my old polish and started fresh with these medicated polishes.  </li>
      <li>My beautician is very interested since she has many older clients that like to have pedicures and have at least some fungus issues.  </li>
      <li>It chips right off the next day.</li>
      <li>Polish is nice deterrent and this is my fav brand but nail fungus is some serious stuff.</li>
      <li>For the limited colors this polish&#x27;s abilities is worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started using the clear polish and referring to it as medication so he would not freak out.  </li>
      <li>I like this clear polish.</li>
      <li>WOW ---  </li>
      <li>My 70 year old husband has had a fungal problem with his toe nails for years.  </li>
      <li>The main advantage is the product only has to be applied every seven days.  </li>
      <li>She discovered this and told me about it;  her toe nails are thinning back to normal again.  </li>
      <li>use clear and the last of my nail fungus over 3 months is disappearing.  </li>
      <li>So, my toes are bare and I use plenty of gold mouthwash on all of them and the fungus is almost gone again.  </li>
      <li>I do regret my purchase(s) - I bought several colors, plus base, plus top coating - and strongly don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>

<li> good base  coat.</li>
<li> I think this is a common problem as we get older.  </li>
<li> have spent since 2001</li>

<li> The white marks on my toenails have vanished in a few months of using the top and base coats.  </li>
<li> addition, the nail polish chips and peels off easily, the selection of colors is not great, some of them are very thick and hard to apply evenly (depending on the color) and is waaay overpriced to use it just instead of regular nail polish.</li>
<li> its just not worth it.</li>
<li> a dear friend of mine has had a lifelong thick toe nail fungus --</li>
<li> /&gt;Suggest putting-on in thin layers; one big layer will peel-off faster.</li>
<li> combating a terrible toe nail fungus a boyfriend gave me (grrrrrr) - hospital medicine that is suppose to knock-it-out internally coupled with external medicated prescription creams never killed the blame stuff. . .  </li>
<li> Not only didn&#x27;t I see any, but worse, the nail fungus got worse and spread to other nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This polish chipped off of my fingernails and I am not able to move my hands.</li>
<li> Not sure if the anti fungal works yet.  </li>
<li> I even use it on my skin; it does not have the dangerous ingredients that regular nail polish has . .  </li>
<li> I tried 3 times to use it with the base coat and regular coat.</li>
<li> it was difficult to trim his toe nails.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this product all last summer and at first my toe was OK.  By the end of the summer the fungus was back and had started in a second toe.  Miss having my toes painted but can&#x27;t stand the fungus.  So, my toes are bare and I use plenty of gold mouthwash on all of them and the fungus is almost gone again.  Gave the Dani Pro to my cousin and maybe it will work for her.</li>
    <li> I can only say that it has stayed on for five days - I can&#x27;t attest to its anti-fungal properties (yet) but it seems to be good nail polish. I had a pedicure and had my nail tech use it.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended by a podiatrist. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks, so too soon to give an evaluation for the product. So far, it seems fine.</li>
    <li> See a doctor. Polish is nice deterrent and this is my fav brand but nail fungus is some serious stuff. This polish is not a cure.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and doesn&#x27;t last!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this at my podiatrist&#x27;s recommendation to treat an incipient nail fungus. I used it as prescribed - applying first the base, then the color, then the top coat - for almost 3 months and it did nothing for the fungus. Now, I know fungus treatment requires patience, and I didn&#x27;t expect the nail polish to cure it overnight. However, I expected at least some improvement after the first 2 months of use. Not only didn&#x27;t I see any, but worse, the nail fungus got worse and spread to other nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the nail polish chips and peels off easily, the selection of colors is not great, some of them are very thick and hard to apply evenly (depending on the color) and is waaay overpriced to use it just instead of regular nail polish. I do regret my purchase(s) - I bought several colors, plus base, plus top coating - and strongly don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> good base  coat. Not sure if the anti fungal works yet.  Hope so!</li>
    <li> In my trial of this product I observed that it had no effect on toenail fungus. I am using Deep Cover Nail System and it appears to be working.</li>
    <li> WOW ---  THIS DOES CURE Nail Fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do check the other reviews re: colors - not everyone is happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use clear and the last of my nail fungus over 3 months is disappearing.  I even use it on my skin; it does not have the dangerous ingredients that regular nail polish has . .  The strange discolorations from nail fungus on my big toes are gone.  One lady in the reviews says she paints her husband&#x27;s toes -- and now I see why!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent since 2001 combating a terrible toe nail fungus a boyfriend gave me (grrrrrr) - hospital medicine that is suppose to knock-it-out internally coupled with external medicated prescription creams never killed the blame stuff. . .  Tried those smelly serums from the stores - nothing got rid of it.  But this has. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a dear friend of mine has had a lifelong thick toe nail fungus -- She discovered this and told me about it;  her toe nails are thinning back to normal again.  For the limited colors this polish&#x27;s abilities is worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;Suggest putting-on in thin layers; one big layer will peel-off faster.</li>
    <li> I feel this top coat protected the color polish and helped keep my pedicure fresh looking with no chipping. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> My 70 year old husband has had a fungal problem with his toe nails for years.  They had thickened to the point it was difficult to trim his toe nails.  I started using the clear polish and referring to it as medication so he would not freak out.  After a while, I forgot and called it polish.  At that point he didn&#x27;t mind because it was doing an amazing job.  The main advantage is the product only has to be applied every seven days.  Now, I am ordering it for my friends to use on their husbands.  I think this is a common problem as we get older.  My beautician is very interested since she has many older clients that like to have pedicures and have at least some fungus issues.  I think an effort needs to be made to market this to the senior citizens.</li>
    <li> I like this product, and it works great as a top coat and stays shiney even as it dries quickly.  I have used this before and will continue to buy it.  It is effective when used consistantly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to prevent further toe nail fungus. I use it as a base and top coat, but does not leave much shine.</li>
    <li> I like it, I got is on time, but it is a long term process using it.</li>
    <li> I am paralyzed. Therefore, I do not use my hands. This polish chipped off of my fingernails and I am not able to move my hands. I was very disappointed! For the price I would not have expected it to chip.  I would not recommend this for anyone to purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this clear polish. The podiatrist recommended it.  It has a nice sheen to it (not super shiny) and it&#x27;s healthy for my nails.</li>
    <li> The white marks on my toenails have vanished in a few months of using the top and base coats.  I had what looked like smudges of white-off on my big toenails and found out through research it was probably a superficial toenail fungus.  Great reviews of these products convinced me to give them a try.  I threw out all my old polish and started fresh with these medicated polishes.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Works as stated, this is the only one I now use, it even impresses the professionals that do my nails.</li>
    <li> It chips right off the next day. I tried 3 times to use it with the base coat and regular coat. Finally went to a salon and paid $18 to have them do it so I could sit underthe heat lamp but why should I have to do it?? for the price its just not worth it.</li>
