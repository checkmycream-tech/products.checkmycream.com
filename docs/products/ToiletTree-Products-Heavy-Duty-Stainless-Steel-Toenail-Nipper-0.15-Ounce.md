<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If these won&#x27;t trim your toenails, go to a farrier and get a hoof trimmer.</li>
    <li> although good at first, it dulled pretty quickly.  I would not call it heavy duty.</li>
    <li> Useless for my heavy big toenails.  A large clipper type does work so the nails are not invincible.</li>
    <li> Most importantly, it cuts, cleanly and easily, even on the toughest nails, hand and foot.  The last TWO clippers I have bought were almost sharp enough for about 2 months, then kaput.  Now take a look at this ToiletTree Nipper.  First of all, it is stainless steel, and will not rust.  One of the others did.  Second of all, the Nipper has a steel spring, which is of highest quality, and should last as long as the edge, which being steel will last almost forever.  The lifetime replacement guarantee tells you a lot about the product, as well.  When this company, ToiletTree can so blithely back it&#x27;s product for a lifetime the product just has to be good or the company will all too soon be out of business.  Google it, and see what a long time it has already been around!  Love my Nipper.  Thanks Amazon for stocking a good product.</li>
    <li> A very satisfactory product in every way . They are professional quality .</li>
    <li> I believe I&#x27;ve said enuf to make my point. It would cut fingernails but not toe nails, for which it was sold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tough to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; (5 stars) a toenail nipper.  I&#x27;ve used it once and it did the job very well.</li>
    <li> The clipper is sharp enough and appears durable enough to last for a while. The clipper is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is just what I have been looking for.  Nice quality.  Able to clip my very hard toenails.  I would definitely reccomend this Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> My daughter cuts my nails and said it was much easier.  I have no idea how long it will stay sharp enough.</li>
    <li> These are really worth what you pay. Some of us have to have chain saws for our toenails and I am one of those. You will not regret this purchase . They can be passed down through the generations......lol</li>
    <li> This small device does a great job.</li>
    <li> Well, I found one that works...  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product and value. I have thick, difficult to cut  nails and this Nipper is very effective in cutting them.  Long handles provide very good leverage.  I have used a competitor&#x27;s product for many years and this one is superior. A definite buy.</li>
    <li> keeps my nails neat and cut away areas that can be ingrown.</li>
    <li> This product is unparralled in quality and workmanship. The stainless steel blade are of the finest quality. I have diabates so keeping my toenails properly trimmed is importment to not only myself but also to my overall foot health as well. With diabates you must be diligient in keeping them trimmed and well grommed at all times. The traditional toenail clippers are not adequate enough for feet with diabates.  the Toenail Nipper not only meets but exceeds what is needed to maintain toe and body health as well. My Doctor recommended a product with all of the features of the Toenail Nipper. They are easy to use and easy to keep clean and free of germs and other things that can cause problems. Weather you have diabates or not you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Does the job it&#x27;s suppose to.  Item is sharp, cuts through the thick toe nails with ease.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Sturdy well made clippers. They cut cleanly right through the thickest part of the toenail.</li>
    <li> my husband loves these and he has the l/2 thick nails...needs a chain saw...but he says these are great!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i needed to cut my toenails.</li>
    <li> Great for my  very thick ingrown toe nails .</li>
    <li> Great Product and Warranty, fast shipping, works well, will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the best, but other reviewers were right, in that it doesn&#x27;t cut well - splinters my toenails, and that the spring  rides off center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have opened the package and examined/tried it before the return time expiry, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with a $25 loss and an unneeded/unwanted paperweight.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, have been searching for this quality and effective toenail nipper  for a long time.  My elderly mother has the thickest toe nail and before I purchased this toilettree product, it was an uncomfortable process, and sometimes painful for the both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what these are made of, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be stainless steel.  The handle snapped right off while trimming a toenail.  Supposedly they have a lifetime warranty, but I think I will look elsewhere for a nail clipper.</li>
    <li> These toenail snippers are well constructed, sharp, and work well with large and small toenails. The handles are long enough to get a good grip, and the blade shape works quite well for getting into the nail corner. The only minor negative is that the steel spring that holds handles apart (blades together) fell off one time, but was easily reattached. I am glad that I bought this item.</li>
    <li> Keeps my toe-nails nice and happy.  which makes all the honeys flock to my feet.</li>
    <li> it worked satisfactorily</li>
    <li> Not as long as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Good quality, Smooth Operation</li>
    <li> High quality instrument that works well even on very thick toenails</li>
    <li> Decreasing mobility and increasing age has made caring for my thickening toenails a headache. And then I lost my toenail clippers! I let it go for far too long hoping that they would turn up, but no such luck. But good luck was what it turned out to be because I was forced to replace them and had the good luck to choose these. What a difference a really good pair of clippers can be! The blades have just the right curve and are very sharp. They glide through without crushing and with far less effort than I am used to. Of course the old ones have now turned up ---and are residing with my garden tools waiting to cut wire and twine. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t go by price alone.</li>
    <li> These are a quality product -- sharp and sturdy with very good fit and finish.  They definitely get the job done.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Dull, cuts like a pair of pliers.</li>
    <li> I use these nippers in my toenail cutting business. They are sharp and cut very cleanly. They have a satiny finish that is good for griping. The only thing I wish was that they were a little larger.</li>
    <li> The only ding on these hard cutting nippers is the misaligned stainless return spring, shown in the attached photo folded up on the left side handle, which just can&#x27;t be fixed. Either yours comes properly aligned or you can forget using that function. They do cut beautifully.</li>
    <li> Too small and doesn&#x27;t cut as well ad advertised on tough big toenails. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> It will not cut the big toenail.</li>
    <li> best toenail clippers ever</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Heavy Duty Toenail Clipper&amp;#34; broke the very first time I attempted to clip a toenail with it. Fortunately, the blade that broke free did not fly far enough to injure me, as well. It appears to be made of poorly cast metal. Totally useless!</li>
    <li> My husband did have to show me how to use the clippers because I&#x27;ve never used this style before.  Once I got going, this went very smoothly.  Unfortunately, my hands shake at times.  My husband finished the job for me and had no problems.</li>
    <li> Work well for tougher toe nails.</li>
    <li> Not fit for human, let alone toenail, consumption.  Just doesn&#x27;t measure up - will probably use it for......what a disappointment, can&#x27;t think of anything that it will do.</li>
    <li> This thing works well for my thick toenails.  I opens far enough for the thickest of nails, and cuts nicely.  It&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> My mom had one like this when I was growing up, and this one appears to be just as sturdy and durable (I think she still has it, and I turn 61 this year lol).  My husband has &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; nails and this does the job handily!  Thanks for offering this through Amazon!</li>
    <li> i was very impressed with the ease with which it cuts through tough toe nails - was using an old pair and wasn&#x27;t aware how bad they were - i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Strong and sharp for thick toe nails, Great Buy !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> As described.  Sharp and wash to use.  Fast shipping.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> finally could cut my toe nails with a little effort</li>
    <li> better than I expected. Works on the thickest nails</li>
    <li> These clippers get the job done. I was a bit skeptical of their shape at first but they are very sharp and well contoured for cutting through the toughest nails. I highly recommend them. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> You have to have a bit of hand strength to cut through thick nails, but if you&#x27;ve got that, it does an excellent job.  -1 star only because it arrived with a bit of rust on one of the flat sides up by the hinge.  I think there was a spot that didn&#x27;t get properly chromed, so that bit rusted.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding good quality toe nail clippers. ToiletTree sure got it right with these. Very sharp and strong.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a man with very tough toenails.  It works like a charm.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick toenails you can&#x27;t trim with regular toenail clippers. This works pretty good for that. I just have to be careful I don&#x27;t get skin, ouch..</li>
    <li> Does the job of clipping better than anything I have used before. Highly recommended. Handles the toughest jobs.I have tried many other clippers and these are the best. Quality is first class.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy item. It works very well to trim toe nails and the flip over spring helps make the product convenient for travel cases.</li>
    <li> These clippers are what I have been looking for for a long time.  They are top quality and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the best.  To start with I have real flexibility problems, so that it&#x27;s a real strain to even reach to my toes. With other clippers I have always had to use two hands to bring enough pressure to trim my big toe nails.  These clippers cut so well that it&#x27;s all a one hand operation.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as it could be. But otherwise is a great product that has helped me cut away those stubborn claws.</li>
    <li> Very. Well made product and quite sharp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;compound lever&amp;#34; type of clipper forever. Going to this plier type and this particular product is a revelation! It&#x27;s so much easier to cut your toe nails and to get those annoying ingrown toe nails taken care of. If you have some toe nails that are no longer just straight across but are curling into your skin, get these babies and you&#x27;ll be a happy camper. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic with toenails that are extremely difficult to cut. I also have to be very careful to cut them evenly. This product solves both problems.</li>
    <li> These nippers work well on regular nails, but are not able to make a long cut through the thicker nails.  I had to take small sections of the nails at a time.  I thought they would be sharper.  Handles could be longer for more leverage.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as I thought they would be. Handle needs to be a little bigger. Hard to grip.</li>
    <li> Good quality nail clipper.  Fold away spring is a good feature.  This was a good buy compared to the price my doctor wanted for the same type of thing.</li>
    <li> I misplaced a pair of clippers that looked like this awhile back.  But looks were deceiving.  These clippers are considerably sharper than my old ones - work great on thickest nails i can produce.  I got them because they offered a lifetime guarantee - but after a few months&#x27; use, i&#x27;m not sure that i&#x27;ll live long enough to claim it.  [&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are just what they&#x27;re advertised to be.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Garbage.  Made out of pot metal. Broke on the FIRST try.  You are better off with standard clippers than these things.</li>
    <li> I bought these on the recommendation of my doctor and am happy that I did. I can now take of the nails that I used to go to the podiatrist to get cut. They are heavy duty and easy to use</li>
    <li> We really haven&#x27;t had much time to use this product but what little&lt;br /&gt;we have they are very easy to handle and very sharp.Also a product that&lt;br /&gt;is a little longer to be able to cut toe nails.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It trims even the thickest, toughest nails.  The price is high, but the product is worth it.  Others have mentioned trouble with the spring, but I haven&#x27;t had any.  I recommend this product to all, especially those who have thick or fungus infected nails.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. It was so nice to have something cut through my extremely thick toenails. If you have had trouble finding a toenail clipper that works then look no further. Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it. I guarantee it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find a really good toenail clipper but this seems to be the case--at least until now.  I have--like most--used a variety of clippers over the years with varying degrees of success.  I was always looking for a better clipper.  Anyway I think I have found it in this product.  It is easy to use and does the job quite well.  ToiletTree has produced a great product at an affordable price which satisfies my need for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Now this is a nail clipper, goes thru even the thickest nails like butter. It&#x27;s the real deal of toe nail clippers</li>
    <li> Broke in half on first cut</li>
    <li> This nipper is VERY sharp and works well in cutting my most difficult toe nails.  It is shorter than I expected, but it does the job.  So I can recommend it for others.</li>
    <li> Did I need these. My toenails are just too big and thick for a regular pair of clippers. These babies slice cleanly with minimal force. Tough for a big guy to reach his toes. These allow me access with out fear of lopping off skin and other parts of this appendage.</li>
    <li> I care for someone with both diabetes and very thick toe nails.  It has been a real struggle to cut those nails properly and safely.  I read the reviews for the Toilet Tree nippers very carefully and decided to give them a chance because of the warranty.  I knew if they didn&#x27;t work, as so many other such products hadn&#x27;t, I could send them back.  They do exactly what the company says they will.  They open wide to accommodate even the thickest nails, and they snip them right off without my having to work my hand to exhaustion or squeeze and squeeze with no results at all.  Instead of a chore dreaded by all involved, nail trimming is now simple and quick.  I know several reviews mentioned problems with the tension bar&#x27;s popping loose, but I&#x27;ve not had anything like that happen, and the trimmers feel more balanced in my hand than any others of this type I&#x27;ve tried previously.  This product is a winner!</li>
    <li> This toe nail clipper is not what I thought I was buying--cheap made, don&#x27;t know which side to use--neither side works--really a disappointment</li>
    <li> They are very sharp and cut the most stubborn nails with little effort. They work great, and I have thick nails.</li>
    <li> I use this nipper for several toe nails that are too thick for standard clippers. One is a double nail due to damaged nail that grew a second nail on top of the one I thought I would lose. Also use on both my big toe nails which have become thick at my age of 70 years. This nipper has a nice swing away spring. I have no trouble cutting thru my thick nails. I would recomend this tool and it is at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have very though to trim thick toenails.  These really do a good job. They are sturdy and very well made</li>
    <li> very well built and fits the hand well.  I like using them without the spring in the handle, but the spring works great if you need it. They are VERY sharp ( so be careful ) and cut the thickest nails with ease.  The lifetime warrenty is good and makes them easy to recommend</li>
    <li> I bought these  based on the reviews . They had great problems cutting my nails, nor did I get a clean cut</li>
    <li> This toenail nipper is of fantastic quality.  It is no wonder it has a lifetime warranty.  I definitely recommend this as a product every family should have in their bathroom medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I used to live in fear of my thick toe nails. No longer! These are high quality clippers that really do the job and have made life easier. The price is right as well. If you have a tough time with tough toe nails these will do the job in no time at all. Wish I&#x27;d bought these years ago.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to remove hangnails, don&#x27;t buy this. The blades are very sharp, but they don&#x27;t mesh... hold them up to the light and you can see the gap.</li>
    <li> Finally able to clip my very thick nails.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Seems strong and durable.  No complaints I would recommend to anyone needing clippers for thick toenails. Give them a try.</li>
    <li> I was ready to go to a podiatrist, I was having that much trouble cutting my toenails. Problems over. This &amp;#34;nipper&amp;#34; can deal with anything.</li>
    <li> When it came, I was upset by the small size for a heavy-duty nipper.  When I tried it, it did cut my thick toenails but it cut in small pieces of the nails.  Also because it&#x27;s so small, the grip is hard to handle.  While it does what it is supposed to do, it&#x27;s difficult to use it.</li>
    <li> product performs as advertised, but the points are too sharp and needed to be ground down a little to prevent stabbing. also, the handle is too smooth and slippery when wet. otherwise, a great tool.</li>
    <li> Amazing clippers, finally an end to my looking for the perfect clipper. They are sharp and sturdy, just what I needed for those thick nails. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product, does the job as advertised. It is strong and sharp and cut through my very hard and thick toe nails with no problems.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the hang of using this tool, but I managed to cut my big toe nail down to the quick with a cut in the corner.  I doubt I will try to use the &amp;#34;nipper&amp;#34; again...once is enough!</li>
    <li> Finally I can cut toenails correctly! This design is great after so many years of searching for something ergonomic to clip toenails. I am not even afraid to cut my husband&#x27;s toenails! I am glad we decided to spend that money on a real clipper. It is worth the investment. Sturdy and easy to control.</li>
    <li> got these for my mom, has the toughest toenails around, she loves them, I would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Cuts even the thickest nails the old folks get, be very careful, these are sharp. Does what I bought them for.</li>
    <li> Works well, could be a little larger.  Blades are sharp and seem strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;Overall pleased with quality and price</li>
    <li> The handles on this clipper are very small (the whole thing is very small) and the handles have a curved, polished slippery surface where you must grip them in order to apply pressure, that makes them difficult to use as you must use extreme force, which hurts your hand,  to get them to cut. If they had made the handles longer to give more leverage, and etched or rubberized he smooth surface of the handles, they would work much better. Now at least I know what to look for in finding something better.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the quality of these nippers but wish either the images or discription had answered my main question of whether or not the blades were straight or curved.  Unfortionately I thought I found in one of the questions which was asked or reiviews that they were straight, THEY&#x27;RE NOT!  But I can live with them this way I guess and as I said they are solid and of good quality for what I need.</li>
    <li> Nice item for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and I bought this second set for my RV.  Cutting my toe nails is like snipping steel and these do the job easily.  I highly recomment them.</li>
    <li> have bad circulation in legs and toenails are bad . The toenail nipper helps in strength and size. Easier to reach toes.</li>
    <li> For what appears to be a well made set of clippers, the spring falls far short. It would have little additional craftsmanship to have made this a great set of clippers. I cannot recommend this product for this reason.</li>
    <li> Terrific Nipper.  Strong and sharp.  Delivered in 48 hrs via Prime.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> the product is a heavy duty stainless steel tonail nipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wonderful quality.......will last for years........cuts toe nails amazingly...stainless steel and razor sharp</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Nelson Steele, my youngest son, but Richard Steele, my oldest son that I sent the clippers and nippers to. Richard told me thay worked beautifully and he was able to do a wonderful job on his nails which would be a tremendous challenge. Thank you for your speedy delivery as well as providing an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I expected that this clipper would be able to cut my toenails.  I was disappointed and returned it to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product,it was just as stated in the ad,I&#x27;m very happy I ordered it,and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t not cut nails with easy and has limited applications.  I bought a toenail clipper from Walmart for half the price that does a better job.</li>
    <li> I have hard to cut toenails and wanted a sharp, high-quality cutter for them.  This clipper is beautifully made and looks like it will last me forever.  Razor sharp.</li>
    <li> A well made product of excellent quality materials. You will not be disappointed! I will be recommended this product to friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is truly an outstanding one.  It handles my tough toenails very easily.  I heartily recommend it.  The supplier, ToiletTree Products is equally outstanding and strives for total customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers are a very nice tool and will work well for my husband&#x27;s thick nails!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item I was looking for clippers that would cut my toe nails that have thicken over the years. I&#x27;m 74 and don&#x27;t have any particular ailment that causes abnormal thickening of my toenails. The regular cheappo type nail clipper I have just over the years doesn&#x27;t do the job anymore. They weren&#x27;t sharp enough, didn&#x27;t have long enough handles to provide the necessary pressure to the cutting heads, and the the shape of the heads weren&#x27;t proper for cutting the nail of my big toes. After reading the reviews of the Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail Nipper by ToiletTree Products I thought this product had to do the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product I immediately tested it on my big toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;I found the product not to be sharp enough to cut the nail of my big toes. I even doubt it would have helped if the handles were longer providing more leverage. As for my other toenails, the blade was sharp enough, but the cutting head didn&#x27;t allow a good cutting angle. Keep in mind a person looses flexibility as they grow older.</li>
    <li> Apparently rust-proof hardened stainless steel.  Has maintained its sharpness thus far.  Conforms to seller&#x27;s claims.  A bit on the &amp;#34;too of short handles&amp;#34; size but it nevertheless does the job OK on my thick toenails.</li>
    <li> these are the best toenail clippers i have ever used my toenails are very thick and hard to cut but with these it was very easy good quality and fast shipper</li>
    <li> I expected them to be go better quality for the price.  They do cut through thick nails, but leave a rough edge.  You can see daylight through the blades when closed.  Despite this, they are serving my needs for now.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about ordering these clippers as I have been disappointed before but I can highly recommend these. I have very thick toenails and these cut them like they were paper thin. Love them!</li>
    <li> This was much sharper than the one sold to cut fungus infected toenails, and I think all of the manufacturers should adopt the spring mechanism design because it allows you to take all tension off the spring when not using the nippers by just flipping back to the handle the spring you notice on the left inside of the handle in the picture.  For use it flips up and pushes the nippers back open when you are done cutting.</li>
    <li> Top quality product that works perfectly as described.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> loved the clipper when it first came july 2015 - note that screen says it has lifetime guarantee - clipper worked okay until 10/13/2015, when one prong of clipper blades broke off - since there is a lifetime guarantee, expect that another set of clippers will be sent - thanks..</li>
    <li> What can I say,  I like these clippers.  They are foreign made for sure, but what isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
    <li> I wanted a STRAIGHT toenail nipper.  This one has a slight curve so we don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> My husband had tried everything except maybe a chain saw lol  These worked the best!  He can happily wear all his shoes now!</li>
    <li> This product does what&#x27;s advertised.  Blades are sharp and the handles give good leverage. I would highly recommend these cutters. They are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Strong, well built and very sharp. Well worth the price. I was guided by reviews on Amazon, which were helpful.</li>
    <li> Great heavy duty nail nippers.  Nothing exciting, but they do the job, are easy to clean and store. Be careful with these, they ARE heavy and sharp, its easy to nip skin along with the nail</li>
    <li> My husband has toenails like gnarly rhinoceros horns and has peripheral neuropathy in his feet. His feet look the best they&#x27;ve looked in 30 years. This product really does what it claims.</li>
    <li> Advertised to cut any toe nail, it really does. I&#x27;ve had thick difficult nails for a long time, these do the job quite easily!&lt;br /&gt;a great purchase!</li>
    <li> A YouTube video on Cutting thick toenails recommended using nippers. They work!&lt;br /&gt;My only con is the arm that swings up when in use doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This toenail nipper (also great for fingernails) is durable and also has enough control that it can cut strong nails but not cut the surrounding skin...I have found cheaper clippers to be harder to use because they tear the nail rather than Clio it....I would say that if you have very thick toenails, you might want to buy a slightly heavier version of this nipper</li>
    <li> These did the job, decent quality, they were what I was looking for. Heavy duty and sharp. They will last.</li>
    <li> My elderly Father, recently took off his shoes and socks, and well his toenails looked kinda scary.  So instead of getting out the shop grinder,  an apron, and goggles, I thought I give these a try.  These clippers worked great on his thick toenails, I used them on myself last week, and was really pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellant Product, Just as pictured. Great seller to deal with.</li>
    <li> This does the job on my thickened toenail as well as the regular one.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will stay sharp, but after 6 months it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> This clipper is a quality tool. Seldom does one find anything made this well today. If quality is what you are seeking then this is for you.</li>
    <li> after having purchased and returned an expensive clipper of another brand from another seller, I was leery of buying another clipper online..  took a chance on this clipper from ToiletTree Products and it is great..  my husband who is age 80+ has thick toenails and he is extremely happy with these..  he says they are easy to grip and clip with no tearing of the nail..  thank you ToiletTree Products for having a good product..</li>
    <li> I had to use a podiatrist due to a partial amputation I caused.&lt;br /&gt;I said forget that. I&#x27;m going back to cutting myself, this time with the right tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched foot care on YouTube.</li>
    <li> My husband has had other scissors and clippers but this product does the job and is easy to use successfully.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  They feel like the 8 dollar ones from Walgreen&#x27;s.  Too small, safer just to use clippers.</li>
    <li> These Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail Nipper by ToiletTree are the best! Reasonably priced, great quality and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what my husband needed to get his nails cut that normal clippers could not do.  Very happy he purchased them, would recommend to anyone who had problems clipping nails.</li>
    <li> this is quality, so much better than the local stores</li>
    <li> These are very sharp, and do a great job with thick toenails.</li>
    <li> My husband just love them. Thanks for the good quality.</li>
    <li> These nippers are not as sharp or as strong as I had hoped. I have one of those hard toenails that is difficult to trim. I was hoping these nippers would make that job easier. I did get it trimmed, but had to nip a little at a time.</li>
    <li> As advertised . . . does the job. Better than any of the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> …and finally disappeared for good. Other than that, it cuts tough toenails well and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> very good product, just 1 issue with spring clip that does not affect it&#x27;s cutting</li>
    <li> This nail clipper is by far the best clipper I have ever owned.  It is heavy and cut effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Works well! Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a straight edged nail clipper, and thought the picture looked like this was one. But it is not. This is the same kind of product you can easily find in any store- and I returned one of those also. Had to go to Footsmart to find a straight edged clipper, as recommended by my podiatrist to avoid ingrown toenails.</li>
    <li> The kind folks at ToiletTree&lt;br /&gt;Asked to get a review from me&lt;br /&gt;About their Heavy Duty Nipper&lt;br /&gt;For which I use as a nail clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it at my home&lt;br /&gt;I clip my nails, they do not roam&lt;br /&gt;But if I clip my nails at work&lt;br /&gt;My co-workers all call me a jerk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it must be pure Envy.&lt;br /&gt;But they won&#x27;t get my nipper from me.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to cut so many things&lt;br /&gt;Like my nose hair when spread out like wings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes them with a snip, no longer there&lt;br /&gt;Skin tags unsightly are now left bare&lt;br /&gt;I can not wait to clip some more&lt;br /&gt;Please buy these clippers, from their online store.</li>
    <li> We are delighted with these.  They helped me remove a dead thick toenail from the new nail underneath, and cut my husband&#x27;s thick nail that was infected with fungus.  By the way, they also do a great job on cat claws!</li>
    <li> Does not cut. It rips. Sending it back.</li>
    <li> These are simply the best clippers I have EVER used.  If you purchase these you will NOT be sorry.</li>
    <li> this was an excellent pu I would buy it again anytime.it is sturdy and easy to handle.  It was a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated managing a peculiar (to me) thick toe nail for so long now it seems like forever.  clip, clip, clip, file, file, file.  yikes.  I even brought this to the attention of a doctor some time ago, and he suggested he could pull the nail and see how it grew back.  I wasn&#x27;t sure he was serious, but I quickly dropped the issue.  I had some good karma when I stumbled onto this \\&quot;heavy duty nipper\\&quot; (that sums it up) on Amazon.  It did the trick with one easy squeeze.  I wish I new this baby existed years ago.</li>
    <li> It is everything said in the other reviews; sturdy, well made and works well.  Good weight, as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty stainless steel nail clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent tool- I would recommend it to my friends and relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.S.</li>
    <li> Except for the fact that the guy who uses it has a hangnail</li>
    <li> Really works well even on nails thickened by a fungus infection, and there is little to no discomfort experienced with other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I hate these clippers. I have thick natural fingernails/toenails and they&#x27;re not sharp enough to cut them without splitting the nail. I couldn&#x27;t believe how dull they were and I thought maybe I was doing something wrong when using them. Plus, the very end is slightly curved and it makes cutting nails difficult. You can&#x27;t get a straight edge on your toenails at all and that can lead to hangnails. Of all of the nail things I&#x27;ve ever purchased this has to be the biggest waste of money. I&#x27;m still in the market for a decent pair so I can give myself manicures.</li>
    <li> I returned these clippers which broke 8/15/2015 -- they do have a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee. I have the USPS tracking number and they were received by Toilet Tree Products Monday August 24, 2015. I am thankful / happy that I received a new pair of nippers.  I had no qualms with the product other than the spring / pin popping out rendering the nippers ineffective.  They are easy on the hand and quite sharp, enabling them to be very effective.  I will now give the product 5 stars and I am grateful for your returning a new set of nippers to me! Return policy very good!</li>
    <li> The clippers are very sharp which makes up for the fact that they are somewhat light weight, less than 5&amp;#34; long.  A longer and heavier handle would have made them perfect.</li>
    <li> so far so good clipper</li>
    <li> Blades are very sharp and easily cut thick nails.</li>
    <li> Not enough to trim the tough nails.  They are high quality but just not enough for me.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because my toenails are hard and the regular clippers did not do a good job.  This nipper did the trick!  It is easy to use, easy to keep under control, and you have less chance to cut into your skin.  I would definitely recommend it not just to people have issues, but to everybody.</li>
    <li> I wrote a negative review earlier because I never received the item.  Didn&#x27;t have time to do anything about it. About a month later, I received a routine follow-up e-mail from Toilettree.  When they learned the situation, they sent another one immediately.  It performs as advertised.  However, it arrived minus the spring clip on the handle, which I can live without. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It was very hard to cut the toe nails on my big toes.  I don&#x27;t like them. It did OK on the rest of my nails</li>
    <li> These are the best I have ever had!!!  My toenails are thick and regular clippers are difficult to use.  These make it quick and easy to clip the nail.</li>
    <li> Wish I had known about these SS toenail nippers many years ago, nice painless quick work, I would buy again!</li>
    <li> For the reasonable price these are sharp, made well and work well. The guarantee even makes them better. Just 3 stars because they should not be called &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;. My wife has a pair from a different company and they ARE heavy duty- there is a big difference in size, thickness and quality.  Yes, hers are 2-3 times the price.</li>
    <li> It will not cut thick big toe nails as it said it would.</li>
    <li> I have not had these very; I purchased them to replace a similar pair that I had for many years. The new clippers work and that is what is important.</li>
    <li> Lifetime guaranty, manufacturer will replace for$3.00 if it breaks or gets dull. I usually buy German, this was made in China, but I think it is good quality.</li>
    <li> I have only used the nippers once but they are a great improvement over the ones that only cut a horizontal line.  Delivery was very prompt.  Nippers are substantial, should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> These clippers are excellent in quality and cut perfectly without pulling the skin or tearing it. Nails are easily clipped and the cuts are precise and even. No creasing the nail and having it halfway cut or jagged. They were to replace clippers that I&#x27;ve had over 20 yrs and I can say that they are even better in quality and craftsmanship than the ones I used to have. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Seller sent promptly and they also sent emails tracking this item as it shipped and afterward when they arrived, also a follow up email to make sure I was pleased. Great customer service if you ask me!!</li>
    <li> Had to send back - the spring is not well constructed and off center.</li>
    <li> These are good toenail clippers. I sure wish that the handled had a little better grip to them (not so smooth) and they were a little bit bigger</li>
    <li> Shipped fast,seem high quality and sharp, can set so they spring back open , or stay closed after cutting</li>
    <li> worked as expected.... great!</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected.  But effective enough to manage the thickest nails.</li>
    <li> could not use them at all</li>
    <li> The lever slips off the edge of the handle every time I cut a nail. Not very helpful. I do like the shape and sice for my hand and the blades are smooth and sharp.</li>
    <li> This really works on the thickest of toe nails! We tried other clippers, but nothing worked but this fine product!</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmers work very well on my very thick toenails...Trims Like a breeze, Well designed and made sturdy will last years</li>
    <li> The&#x27;re ok.  They are not really that sharp and do not feel professional</li>
    <li> Much better than the usual cliipers.  Stronger, more precise, sharper, faster.  I play an instrument that requires fine control of fingernail length.  This fills the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned rust, but I don&#x27;t think these can rust.  There is a reddish decoration near the pivot.  Maybe that is what the other reviewer saw.</li>
    <li> It works &amp; was received promptly...</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, sharp and high quality product. Grace used it a few times now and am very impressed. You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice but I wish it was a little sharper.</li>
    <li> The clippers were just as advertised and I love them. Whenever I need a product I go right to Amazon, it seems they have very good products from very reputable companies. Toilet tree is a company I will go back to again.</li>
    <li> It was almost as good as the last clippers I got from Mall of America.  The item was a German brand Dovo  Solinger. which we had for maybe ten years. We lost it on a cruise. This was a better price so I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! High quality, reasonable price &amp; fast service!</li>
    <li> This is a very fine tool, but it was not a large size, and I found it difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;Good for small nails.</li>
    <li> Stubborn, hard nails beware! This nipper worked easily, resulting in clean cut nails, no pulling or tearing. I have purchased several &#x27;typical&#x27; nail clippers for my husband, and they were too flimsy, broke or bent, or didn&#x27;t provide a large enough space to get to the base of his toenails for a clean trim.  These do it all - much safer!</li>
    <li> My toes turn under causing my toenails to be curved. Regular nail clippers will not work to trim them. These toenail nippers work great for cutting my toenails. I highly recommend them!!!</li>
    <li> This works great on my old man toenails.  Good price and fast shipping, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This works very well on tough toenails.</li>
    <li> it is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> Bought for my snarly toenails. These will cut them effortlessly and with precision. Even thick areas can be thinned with a little practice. For the first time in long time, I have toenails that look like toenails instead of science project that went bad.</li>
    <li> very sharp and a nice feel while using. Got the job done on my thick toe nails, very pleased with these and was delivered right when they said they would be.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t fault the product,  Unfortunately it requires more strengh then I have to clip the toe nails.</li>
    <li> This thing is no joke!  Sharp and plenty of leverage</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product. My father is a diabetic and this makes it so much easier to trim his nails without injury. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am updating and confirming a favorable review that I posted about a year ago upon first receiving this nail clipper. It continues to work perfectly. It is well made, effective, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Certainly this is a heavy duty appliance necessary for those thick, heavy duty toenails..works great..easy to use. I give my significant other pedicures and this is a great tool to use on his thick toenails.</li>
    <li> Two-day delivery got my order here this morning. Now, several hours later, having completed my appointments, I went to the patio and to see what I got. I got my money&#x27;s worth. I was able to clip problematic toe nails and other nails. Tomorrow, after a visit to a steam bath to soften my nails, I can continue the cleanup that otherwise would have taken a visit to a professional.&lt;br /&gt;  Am I happy? You bet.</li>
    <li> I bought these trimmers for my diabetic roommate and she needed the curved tip style clippers because of every time she would go to the doctor, he would cut to close and she would be in pain for up three weeks. So, we decided to buy the trimmers and do it our self. They are very well made, very sharp, and for the price, an excellent value. Oh and to mention, No more pain from them being cut to short. Would highly recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this item because my old toenail clippers were always getting dull and not cutting very good. I am impressed at how easy these are to use, how well they cut and trim the nails leaving such a smooth edge. They are so well made that I believe the lifetime warranty probably will never be needed. If I need an additional pair I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and tough toenails.  I have struggled for years trying to cut them myself.  These work well.</li>
    <li> Lives up to the review. Good solid scissors work even on tough nails.</li>
    <li> Did a great job on my (unfortunately) thick toenails!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I bought this so I could give my 86-year-old dad a pedicure.  He has very thick, scarey-looking nails. I couldn&#x27;t even get ordinary clippers around those nails.  These things cut easily and are very precise.  No sweat.  They made the whole process very fast.</li>
    <li> I bought these nippers based on the reviews posted here.  I am so disappointed.  The clipper is sharp enough and easy to use, however the little spring on the side is not permanently attached.  It is held in place by two little holes.  The first time I used these clippers the paper-clip type wire went flying into the air.  The little spring is so small that it was hard to find.  I wish the spring was more like the spring-lever on other nippers. If you zoom in on the image you will see what I mean. Major design flaw.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this device.  I can now trim my toenails with very little effort.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these clippers. They are the perfect size and shape for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle for a great cut.</li>
    <li> This toenail nipper works great! Seems to be good quality and is easy to operate. It keeps my toenails under control between pedicures!</li>
    <li> This is the nail clipper I have been looking for. It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s tough enough for my thick big toenail.</li>
    <li> The delivery time was excellent, it was well packaged and precisely as described. A good company to deal with. The clipper is easy to hold in a woman&#x27;s smaller hand in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am sure this is a good tool for people who are used to them I am not so I passed it on to my husband!</li>
    <li> Would not clasify these clippers as &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;. Requires a lot of effort to cut through normal nails. Returned these and purchased the Revlon Heavy Duty nail clippers at a fraction of the price. Much better device and truly &amp;#34; heavy duty&amp;#34; . Happy with the Revlon product. Disappointed in the ToiletTree clipper. Would not recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love these clippers they are very sharp and cutting is effortless!  Yes, I&#x27;d recommend them very highly.I&#x27;ve had clippers that you have to have a lot of strength to cut with them, but these are a breeze... so sharp.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I chose the nippers because I was looking for a heavy duty, sharp clipper. Yes, it did the job well.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> This item was made in China, and it showed the typical worksmanship of most items made in China.  It was not a precision instrument, but it worked fine.  A more precision instrument would have cost a lot more, and I was unwilling to spend a lot more.  The spring, which makes the nippers open after clipping a toenail worked fine.  It appeared to have been fastened securely.  The blades were fairly sharp.  It felt comfortable to hold.  I am satisfied with my purchase.  I cannot tell how long this item will last; I can only hope it lasts several years.</li>
    <li> Sturdy.  Works well. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> My original review stated that the nippers I received \\&quot;crushed\\&quot; my nails rather than trimmed them. Toilet Tree contacted me and sent me a replacement pair of nippers, and I am happy to say that they work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a swimmer, so my nails are not little delicate rosepetals that receive pampering all the time. They are pretty much soaked with chlorine and whatever else in the pool water, so I know that there&#x27;s going to be a little bit of a challenge with my nails as opposed to someone who has their nails manicured/pedicured/attended to on a regular basis. I&#x27;m not a manicure/pedicure expert, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the beauty of the cut but they do a great job, even on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement pair of nippers I received made very clean, easy cuts through my nails. No crushing, no splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality stainless steel construction. I don&#x27;t see how anyone can fault this toenail nipper. However, as I use it over time, I will report back if there are any \\&quot;gotchas\\&quot; that are not apparent at the onset. I highly recommend this tool as a quality pedicure instrument!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important point to clarify based on negative reviewers&#x27; comments: When you close the blades without squeezing hard, and hold the blades up the the light, you absolutely cannot see any light coming through the blades. They are flush together. This is even better than the other ingrown toenail nipper that I purchased where you could see a little bit of light (even though it works fine cutting thick toenails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important note: Make sure the spring is fully up before you use this tool. If you don&#x27;t put it fully up, and it gets stuck, you might break it as one person claims they did (and gave a negative review). You want it up until it slides freely as you clamp the device together in a springing action. When not in use, you can retract it (as pictured on the item page). If you don&#x27;t put it all the way up, and squeeze too hard, you might break it. It seemed stuck until I realized this. If used right this spring works smoothly and is designed extremely well.</li>
    <li> Great and very sharp, I can&#x27;t use then , my wife must cut my toe nails and they fit her hand  just right</li>
    <li> Really excellent for tough toenails!</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s new favorite tool.  They do a great job on his tough, old toenails!</li>
    <li> to cut and the clippers don&#x27;t work well. I thought that the decription of the product would mean that it would work but it reall y does not. &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; does not mean that they would cut my old man&#x27;s toe nails well.  Joh Schiefer Bandon, Or</li>
    <li> A very well made grooming tool that won&#x27;t let you down. Only been using for a week, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;A little more expensive then a national drug store but worth it. Hope this helps. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Phil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on extremely tough and dystrophic nails --the clippers are very strong, effective and long lasting.  One of the springs on a pair of clippers came off and the company quickly replaced the clippers for me. These clippers are a great buy!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for some good toe nail clippers for some time, then thought about looking at Amazon, where there is a wide choice.  I also got the finger nail clippers for the manufacturer.  Both work really well, and I have recommended them to others.</li>
    <li> I want to return these as they were not made in the US as claimed, which is why we bought them, so my husband refused to use them</li>
    <li> I HAVE A DRAWER FULL OF TOENAIL CLIPPERS THAT JUST DO NOT WORK WELL FOR ME....I WILL TOSS THEM ALL OUT NOW THAT I HAVE THESE NEW ONES...THEY ARE GRRRREEEEAAATTT!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to cut my 93 y.o. father&#x27;s toenails. High quality. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT , WOULD RECOMEND</li>
    <li> Shipping meet my expectations</li>
    <li> My toenails are classified somewhere between &amp;#34;Giant 3-toed Sloth&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Water Buffalo&amp;#34;.  I have always struggled to hack and saw my way through these stubby little chunks, but No More-- these Heavy Duty Nail NIppers are the Real Deal. They Work! They really do! Thanks, Nail Nippers!</li>
    <li> I got some nasty ass thick nails and this did a awesome job. The spring back isn&#x27;t that smooth on mine, but still works. I would also buying some safety glasses at the same time...</li>
    <li> I got a lemon and neglectfully did not pursue return and replacement in a timely manner. IN SPITE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME (8 months), the owner graciously is SENDING ME A NEW ONE, without my having to go to the expense of mailing back the one that did not work in the first place (thus the lemon moniker) (not sharp and tips did not meet). The fact that there are so many 5 star reviews also tells me this was just a lemon and I should have acted promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, tickle me happy. It is a sturdy clipper and can handle old people toe nails (mine).I am looking forward to receiving the  new one, which I know will be just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this style of nail clipper since I was a kid. After using it, I was so impressed, I wanted to send a review right away. It takes very little effort to cut the toughest nails. Feels very comfortable in the hands and cuts clean. Be sure not to get anything between the blades you don&#x27;t want to cut off. Seriously great nail clipper.It is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The person I bought them for soaked their feet for about twenty minuted before using these (to soften up the nails), and they were able to get rid of two problem nails pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Great toe nail clipper easy to use</li>
    <li> These toenail nippers or toenail clippers as we use to call them are very sharp and our a Excellent Product.&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately  I do have some thick toenails and they do what they are made for with ease .&lt;br /&gt;Just hope the &amp;#34;Lifetime Warranty&amp;#34; is as good down the road (If Needed)&lt;br /&gt;Would tell friends to buy them.</li>
    <li> Somewhat apprehensive to make this purchase because of failures in other similar products. I have one particularly long , thick and tough toenail.  When I received the nipper I soaked my foot for approx 20 minutes and proceeded with the attack. I was amazed at the ease in which this device cut the nail exactly where I wanted the cut. I can hardley wait to cut the nails on my wife&#x27;s foot as all her nails are irregularly shaped , and thick.  I applaud you for making this fine instrument available and expect it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and well-made. They work smoothly and are great for problematic toenails.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Great.</li>
    <li> For me, this was an important purchase. I&#x27;m old enough that I don&#x27;t bend easily so a sharp device to clip toenails was essential. This is a sharp device and has made my life easier.</li>
    <li> READY FOR SOME WHOPPER NAILS</li>
    <li> These are the best toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. They are well built and cut easily with a little bit force. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is not the kind of tool you buy everyday--or even every year--so I was determined to find a good one. One can spend a lot of money for toenail nippers. I hoped to find an excellent pair at a reasonable price. The ToiletTree nipper looked to be sturdy--and designed with long enough handles to give good leverage, so I ordered one. I am very pleased with my purchase. The nipper is made of high-quality materials; it&#x27;s sharp; it cuts really well. Bravo, ToiletTree. Very good value for the money.</li>
    <li> About the only caution I would note w/these excellently-made clippers is that you should take care as they are sharp. :)</li>
    <li> These are great for hang nails and ingrown toe nails. I have had these since 2012 and they work amazingly! They sharp and precise! Unfortunately, recently I had an issue with the little metal part and I called the company and I thought they were going to send me a replacement metal thing, but they sent me brand new clippers, which made me very happy! I would totally buy this product again, if I needed to.Excellent product and customer service :)</li>
    <li> Works well.  Cuts through thick toenails.</li>
    <li> These nippers are so much better than the cheap $2 clippers I used before.  Heavy duty, very accurate and clean cuts. I use them on my fingernails mostly.</li>
    <li> For the first time in the past 5 years, I&#x27;m finally able to cut all my toenails easily and safely. I&#x27;ve used other nippers and clippers before and always have been disappointed. But with this nipper I can cut all the nails, even the two thick ones (which have been almost impossible to cut). This product has very sharp blades, so I&#x27;m really careful and make sure the lighting is good enough. In my opinion, this product is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> After looking for a good pair of toenail clippers, that I could use myself, and save on going to the foot Doctor for a trim every month. I decided to give Toilet Tree products a try, and I&#x27;m happy to say. I couldn&#x27;t be happier about my decision to purchase these clippers, even though they cut great, I wish the handle was a little longer. All in all I would rate this product a 4 1/2 stars, the only reason I don&#x27;t grade it a perfect five, is because of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Cacciotti</li>
    <li> These nippers are the right size for me to grip them easily and use them on my toenails. They cut clean, smooth, and close -- much, much better than toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> These toe nippers are what I was hoping they would be. Very sharp and strong. I have to learn to not cut too close with them.</li>
    <li> The spring in the center of the handles was misaligned and nevber worked right from day one.    That is unacceptable for this product at this price.</li>
    <li> They work very well, especially on tough toenails.</li>
    <li> It is dull.  Very disappointing..</li>
    <li> There are going back, for a number of reasons.    The return spring is misaligned, slipping out and poking you in the hand when you squeeze the handles.    The metal is poorly machined, and there is a gritty grinding between the moving surfaces of the two halves. Light machine oil helped alleviate the problem, but the clippers will not operate smoothly even after an oiling and cleaning.    The blades are poorly ground, with only the tips of the cutting edge making contact when these cutters are compressed. In other words, the clipper blades don&#x27;t fully contact each other, so you cannot cleanly cut through whatever you&#x27;re cutting.    Overall, these clippers have a nice feel, so it&#x27;s a shame that my example was so disappointing. I consider these to be quality control issues. On a positive, I was contacted promptly by customer service and offered a replacement, with an assurance that my problems are not typical.</li>
    <li> Great product as advertised.</li>
    <li> This toenail nipper is very sharp, well manufactured and comfortable to wok with.  I also like the fact that a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee is offered and if and when the time comes for replacement, I&#x27;ll use it and expect it to be honored.</li>
    <li> Husband has very thick toenails, has a hard time cutting them. He was shocked&lt;br /&gt;when he used for the first time, cut his toenails easily. Very Happy!!!! Worth&lt;br /&gt;the price.</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers and solved all my toenail situations.</li>
    <li> Cut very well and spring device works nicely.  They are big enough to provide good leverage making cutting thick toenails a breeze.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great! I am very happy with them</li>
    <li> Got this to do my elderly mother&#x27;s toe nails which are extremely thick.  Haven&#x27;t found anything to work as well as this yet.</li>
    <li> They are useless because of a design error.  When wire spring is flipped to the cutting position, it has nothing to hold it in place.  This product should be taken off the market.  Being sharp and other wise well made is irrelevant if they cannot be used as intended.</li>
    <li> very good for small areas and hangnails.</li>
    <li> Very well made nippers. Do an excellent job on my less than perfect toenails. Product was shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper appears to be lightweight, but it does the best job of clipping my super strong toenails of any clipper I&#x27;ve ever bought!  Not only is it strong, but it is also sharp enough to make accurate cuts, so I don&#x27;t clip too close to the skin and cause minor abrasions.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Seem to be very sturdy and well made.  Way to expensive for what you get.  It should hold up for a long time.</li>
    <li> Wow!  What a difference this makes. I used it for the first time, and was surprised at how well it worked.  My toenails are now clipped and neat, without hurting or puncturing my toes.  No more dreading this task!</li>
    <li> Seem to be well made and sturdy. I have only two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. I wish these had straight blades instead of curved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2. I wish the handles were an inch or two longer for better leverage (overall length is 4.75 inches, which is not shown anywhere in the product description).</li>
    <li> As a senior it requires more pressure than I am comfortable with. Otherwise it is a very good product and would recommend it to persons with an average grip.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for more than several years for a quality, lasting clipper, for some very problem toenails and finally I have found it...Having peripheral neuropathy in my lower torso, causes severe pain in my legs and feet, thus, causing the clipping of toenails to become very problematic &amp; potentially painful. This is the only clipper I have found to actually cut, cleanly and straight, without causing one bit of pain...my toenails, for the very first time in my adult life, look and appear neat and well-groomed, as if a podiatrist did it himself. You will not find a better product offered anywhere, especially at this price being offered...you will not be sorry for purchasing this product and from the organization offering the clipper. Very kind, very professional and very affordable.</li>
    <li> These work well, being able to release spring tension for storage is a nice touch.  They could be a little sharper.</li>
    <li> I just received these nippers (?) about a week ago. They cut my thick,tough toenails very well. However, I have reduced my rating by two stars for the following reasons: I took off one star because the first time I squeezed these nippers new out of the plastic packaging, the spring mechanism snapped off and ricocheted around my bathroom, and I was lucky to have found it. There are many better spring designs out there, and this company needs to research and improve this problem. The second star came off due to the fairly high price. At the same time I brought these clippers, I bought another pair of ingrown toenail clippers that were half the price but much better design. Since I am equally happy with the way these two clippers cut nails, I think these nippers are a little over priced. So, three stars for the good cutting and minus two stars for spring design and price. (At least fix one or the other. If the spring had been better, I doubt I would have complained about the price.) That&#x27;s my review for this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a high quality toenail nipper and this really fit the bill. There are cheaper nippers available but they are not of this quality. It cuts thick nails easily and has a lifetime replacement guarantee. The cost for this quality is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool.  Service speedy and excellent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  Strong enough for tough, thick nails.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s toe nails are so thick, the standard nail clippers can&#x27;t begin to do the job.  This pair is definitely &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; and also extremely well-made.  My husband is totally pleased.</li>
    <li> The clippers come with no protection for the sharp end and nothing to keep it closed. This makes it both unsafe and easily subject to blade damage. If it were not for these problems I would give it 4 or 5 stars</li>
    <li> These are excellent clippers and work very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toenail clipper a few times and found it to be both sharp and effective. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and super sharp for cutting toe nails that are thicker than the average person.</li>
    <li> Delivery was super fast and product received was exactly as promised. Very sharp and capable of cutting thick toe nails my only wish is that the handle was a bit longer for us old folks to reach the target. All in all a great product that have no trouble recommending!</li>
    <li> Was all that I hoped for</li>
    <li> Good weight, grip, hinge and sharpness. Still need to put a bit of pressure due to the design.</li>
    <li> The nipper tool is ok made however it&#x27;s quite dull. It seems to cut only by sheer will power of the owner. I&#x27;m not happy with that at all!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toenail clipper. They are well made and worth the price. You get a precise, clean cut and they are so easy to grip.</li>
    <li> They wouldn&#x27;t cut through paper let alone a toe nail. Terrible.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very effective.  Also durable!</li>
    <li> I developed old lady thick toe nails. What a bummer. So hard to cut my toe nails with regular clippers. Soaking my feet all the time to make the nails soft enough to cut. Ugh. Found these clippers on Amazon and what a nice surprise. They cut exactly as others have noted in their recommendations. No more soaking- just cut and go!! Easy to grip, squeeze, cut. Just great in every way.</li>
    <li> I have very, very, very thick toe nails and have had a difficult time keeping them neatly trimmed.  Regular and heavy duty nail clippers that I have tried in the past were not either wide enough to get the nail or not strong enough.  I bought these on whim after reading the mostly favorably reviews, and I cannot be happier with the product.  For the first time in what seems like a decade, I am able to get a clean cut on my toenails so that they appear somewhat normal.  I definitely recommend these toenail clippers for anyone with really thick nails.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as advertised. It works great on thick nails and is easy to clean. The clipper is high quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I need a weed whacker for my toenails, they&#x27;re thick and tough.  There is nothing dainty about these nippers.  They flat get the job done - pronto.  They appear to be very well made.</li>
    <li> How can I be delicate in this review? These clippers could cut steel. Perfect for the older gentleman. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The clippers worked well on thick hard to cut toe nails.  Good quality and they don&#x27;t hurt your hand cutting.</li>
    <li> I have and still play a lot of tennis.  My big toe and second toe hit the end of my tennis shoes constantly.  Usually I have my podiatrist trim my toe nails.  Until I found this nail clipper. This is the BEST.  Unequivocally the best!</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Toenail nipper&amp;#34; works, but I had trouble with it. The handles are small and I found it difficult to control. I&#x27;m going to look for one that has plastic or rubber grips on the handles.</li>
    <li> My husband has such tough, thick toenails but, after soaking, I can clip them with this clipper.  Others do not work for me: I am not strong enough to get a clip!</li>
    <li> I find it hard to believe that I could get excited about nail clippers, but this tool is so good in so many ways that my excitement is justified.  The fit and finish is superb and the attention to detail is amazing.  I can&#x27;t believe they went to the trouble of putting a tiny roller at the end of the spring.  Not necessary, but proof that the people who designed this clipper really sought perfection.  The jaws can be opened very wide but not before encountering a strong detent that keeps the jaws close together unless you choose otherwise.  Another nice touch.</li>
    <li> Very well constructed.arrived quickly. Worked very well on thick, thick toenails. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Heavy Duty SS Toenail Clippers the other day and was very impressed by the workmanship and quality. The clippers cut cleanly and easily. They are comfortable to use and fit in my hand nicely.&lt;br /&gt;They are well worth the asking price I paid on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I have very thick toenails. Regular clippers wouldn&#x27;t cut them. At one point, I was cutting them with a pair of wire cutter pliers. The heavy duty stainless steel&lt;br /&gt;toenail cutters are fantastic. They fit very confortably in my hand and they are super sharp. A clean cut every time. They are expensive but well worth the money</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006X1H2P6 Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail Nipper by ToiletTree Products. Lifetime Replacement Guarantee]] i actually found these in pet supplies.  i was trying to find a clipper for my cats ingrown toe nails.  i couldnt use the type used on cats and dogs toe nails because the cats nails were growing into the pads. anyways i decided on these heavy duty clippers which MDs use on diabetics toe nails.  they were perfect. they are strong and clipped the cats thick ingrown nails easily. my cat is fine .  the clipping went so smooth,because of this most excellent tool.  i will now use these clippers on my toe nails and my husband will use them also.  he is diabetic and its a must for him to keep his feet clean and nails trimmed. i am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> These are the best clipper, that I have ever seen. This is the last one I will ever buy. This will last a life time. Also this Company ships quick. I got them before the time. Great Great clipper!!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t for me. This isn&#x27;t to say that someone else would find these a good fit. I bought them because I have one incredibly thick toenail. They&#x27;re hard to position. Never used them on my fingernails because I think they&#x27;re overly strong for such a job.</li>
    <li> Am very pleased with these nippers.  Regular toenail scissoes don&#x27;t work on my thick nails, and my arthritic fingers don&#x27;t help matters.  These nippers make it almost easy to cut toenails correctly.  Recommend highly for purchase.</li>
    <li> The handle is somewhat short for me not allowing me to have as firm a grip as I would prefer. Also They cutting surfaces are not as heavy duty as I need for my thick nails. They work, but it takes a lot of effort to squeeze these handles. Sure wish someone made something that would more easily cut hard, thick toenails. One year later and the spring keeps popping off making them a headache. It says lifetime warrantee but where is the company.</li>
    <li> Just received these today and was dying to try them.  The old type of drug store clippers were useless on my thickening nails, but these little guys did the job fast and painlessly.  They are sharp and the few negative comments relative to the spring falling out might be valid but all you have to do if that occurs is spread them out a little and reinsert into the holes of the handle.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. I have difficulty reaching my feet and this helps. It is easy to use one handed</li>
    <li> The cutting edge is not sharp enough to cut thick toe nails I was disappointed.  I expected to have something similar to the one my Dr. Uses when I used them they just bent my nails  truly disappointed,</li>
    <li> VERY SHARP does the job, nice price</li>
    <li> After chemo I found I had curly, thick, tough toenails that were just about to dig into the skin of my toes.  I couldn&#x27;t find any standard clippers that could cut these toenails but this nipper was a wonderful surprise.  I ordered them with little expectation that anything could help me.  Using this nipper, I easily cut my toenails.  My feet feel so much better in shoes now because my nails are cut.  Also, my nails look much better now that they&#x27;re that they&#x27;re evenly cut.  I would definitely recommend you get these if you&#x27;ve got &amp;#34;challenging&amp;#34; toenails like mine!</li>
    <li> A quality product that is very useful for particularly difficult nail clipping.  Well designed, fits the hand well and the fit and finish is excellent.</li>
    <li> this item is exactly what you could buy at wal-mart for much less. cannot endorse this product. the advertising was very misleading.</li>
    <li> If they were a little bit sharper, the nail might have stayed in one piece as it was being cut. As it was, I didn&#x27;t need safety glasses but I never did find the cuttings as they shot across the room. I supposed I could  have contained them had I tried using them with my foot in a box.</li>
    <li> My first review was a 1 star because the nippers I received I suspected were out of alignment.  They would not cut without great effort and then they left a ragged nail that required filing.  The first time I used them was way past the return period, so I just threw them away and wrote a lousy review.  And as you can see I was in the smallest of minorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toilet Tree Products President, Steve Parisi,saw my review and wrote asking for my info.  I sent my order information and within 8 minutes he wrote me back saying the product was defective and a new pair was on the way that very day.  I received them a few days later and they are perfect and just as advertised, only a lot better.  That is simply because Toilet Tree Products&#x27; President is personally concerned with his products, and they have many.  Who could ask for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have deleted all of my previous review since it serves no useful purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mr Parisi, you are a rare individual and this product is immensely better than any clippers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> They seem well built and sharp (my others had lost their edge) and easy to use. I also use it on my two cats and it even cuts their nails quite easily. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has pretty much one job and does it well. I don&#x27;t know what else I can say. :) :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product - sturdy and substantial.  Arrived promptly from ToiletTree Products.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Although the lever that anchors the blades falls off easily it is easy to put back on.  Does a good job cutting my toe nails. It is nice and sharp.</li>
    <li> I expected straight blades. The curved blades make it much less useful.</li>
    <li> I have truly enjoyed this product.  It cuts tough toe nails cleanly and with ease.  It is easy to handle, especially when you have arthritis and/or carpal tunnel problems with your hand or wrists.  I have both.  The handle is not too big or wide to handle with ease.  I really like the idea of a lifetime guarantee.  The reviews I read and the product description made my decision to choose this one an easy decision.  I am truly happy with it.  Thanks ToiletTree Products.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks to Amazon for making it available through your site, and delivering it in a timely fashion.

    <li> I received these nippers as a gift. Someone asked where they were made,China. Clearly marked on package</li>
    <li> This purchase was my attempt to replace a toenail nipper that had successfully met my needs for 35 years until the spring feature failed.  It works, and I&#x27;m getting used to the slight change in handling of this new one.</li>
    <li> They work good but are quite hard to squeeze...  For the elderly the handle could be bigger.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m having a hard time getting used to them.  they do cut well if you place them properly.  i&#x27;ve been using one of the things that you use straight across.  quite a few times, i place them improperly and have no nail in them.  i think once i get used to them, they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I really like these clippers.  I have been searching for something that will cut my horrible nails and these do.  My only problem is that I am left-handed and the clippers are geared towards someone who is right-handed so it is awkward to clip my nails but I eventually get it done.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp and the cutting quality is great but the handle and ergonomics could be much better. Could use larger handle grips.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking for the Tweezerman toe nail clippers but couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for. So, after reading all the good reviews for this product I decided to purchase it. To be honest, I expected more. I don&#x27;t think the nippers are sharp enough, it&#x27;s also hard to get into places with these (the corners of the toe nails). They do cut the skin around the nail very well, but for the price, I thought these would be sharper and easier in cutting the nails. It&#x27;s an ok product, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again, nor, unfortunately i would recommend it unless it&#x27;s to trim the skin around the toe nails. I&#x27;ll continue to use them to justify the money spent but next time I&#x27;ll purchase the ones by Tweezerman because those are really worth it.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. Nice and sharp even after a couple of months of use.</li>
    <li> Great quality and works well.</li>
    <li> Business end could be a little larger.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and usually pay $15 to have my toenails trimmed. These clippers are so easy to use. I use the clippers on both my finger and toe nails. I was worried about using my left hand since I am right handed but had no problem. With no instructions I did have a problem finding out what the spring on one handle was for. I was embarrassed after I figured out it is the spring for opening the clippers.I am happy with this purchase and would do it again.</li>
    <li> The best toenail clipper I have ever used!  It is an easy to handle but very effective cutting tool.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS STRAIGHT BET WERE NOT.&lt;br /&gt;THAT DOESN&#x27;T MEAN THEY WERE NOT GOOD. I&#x27;M SURE THEY WERE VERY GOOD. JUST NOT 4 ME.</li>
    <li> Fine nail clipper.  It&#x27;s attractive looking and it&#x27;s as sharp as it looks.</li>
    <li> I bought these nippers to replace nippers I lost while traveling.  I use them on my fingernails, rather than my toenails, and they are sharp and effective in trimming my nails as I like.</li>
    <li> Watching the manicurist using these for pedicures inspired me to buy my own.  They are GREAT.  Nail clippers simply do not do the job.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the quality.  Cutter blades do not align under pressure so cutters don&#x27;t work well on heavy toenails</li>
    <li> middle spring piece keeps coming off</li>
    <li> I have very thick toe nails and had hoped these would be more effective than they are for cutting through them.</li>
    <li> takes care of my thick toe nails. I saw my podiatrist uses the same pair.</li>
    <li> it is worse don&#x27;t waste money</li>
    <li> I had a lighter toenail cutter but it just couldn&#x27;t do what was needed, so as usual, I go to Amazon.com to look for one.  This heavy duty toenail cutter was just what I needed.  I was very happy with the price as well when compared to prices at local stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper, strongly made, sharp easy cuts and very well priced.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve tried using large toe nail clippers for a long time and always had difficulty with them not cleanly cutting well. Now I&#x27;ve tried the Toenail Nipper from ToiletTree Products, and what a huge difference! These toenail nippers were able to get under the curved sides of my toenails and not only was it effortless, but they cut smoothly leaving no ragged edges. That makes me happy! Finally I can cut my toenails in a lot less time with ease! Thank you ToiletTree Products for a great quality too!</li>
    <li> I gave it this rateing because Swhat I wanted and did the job. I would recomament these to any one.</li>
    <li> Pricey but worth it for the quality</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing these, I had a pair of rubber-gripped toenail nippers I used for many (too many) years. I am in my early 50s, and over the years my toenails have thickened. Without paying mind to that fact, I was needing more force to tend my nails. Between the old nippers dulling from use and the extra force I exerted to use them, the grips became loose and it was a painful chore to tend to my toenails. Finally I was granted the brilliant idea it was time to replace them. I did a bit of research, mainly comparing products and reviews here on Amazon. I settled on these, mindful of the price, expecting a high quality product. After a bit of use, I can report I am highly satisfied with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nippers are made in the traditional design: spread the handles and flip up the spring arm to use, flip the spring arm back down to store. The lighter tension on the spring arm makes these nippers easier to, well, nip. Before the first use I was concerned this lower spring tension would cause need for more hand squeeze power (an issue for me ever since multiple Carpal Tunnel surgeries); however, that is not the case. These nip easier because the sharp, well-honed blades do not need the heavy torque. They nip my nails easily and the first time. The blades come to a perfect fit at the tip, creating a point sharp enough to easily maneuver into the corners of the nail beds, but not so sharp as to easily punctures those tender areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;- The compact design makes it easy to manipulate these nippers, getting them into place. The satin finished handles allow a good, positive grip, helping keep them right where you want them.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades are sharp and nip with ease - using much less wrist and grip strength than the previous (admittedly OLD pair) I had.&lt;br /&gt;- Lifetime replacement guarantee, although I don&#x27;t expect to need it any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None.</li>
    <li> I must have very tough nails, but these were not sharp or easy to use. I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not suffient for my use.  Big toenail too tough for this product.  Now using a pair of wire cutters.  For most people it may be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;It is well made, strong, but for me &amp;#34;no good&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the positive reviews and was not disappointed. I&#x27;ve suffered from painful thick ingrown toenails all my life and have never had a good way to deal with them. These cut them much better and easier than any method I used before.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, my mom likes it - says it works just like her podiatrist&#x27;s. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect,just what I have been waiting for!</li>
    <li> This safely cuts through the world&#x27;s thickest toenails, without making your hands and wrists ache. The &#x27;balance&#x27; of these clippers is exceptional, which means I didn&#x27;t have to work very hard to make cuts. I didn&#x27;t have time to soak my nails first, yet the nippers still did an excellent job. I&#x27;m sure it would have required even less pressure, had I been able to soften my nails before nipping. I&#x27;ve tried *several* brands, but these are by far the FINEST!</li>
    <li> The Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Toenail Nipper was sharp and worked as advertised.  The nipper is well built and strong enough to handle any thickness of nail.</li>
    <li> The toenail nipper is very sharp, easy to use and has a handle that does not slip in your hand. It is the best I have owned.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very sharp, use wisely.  Easy to open packaging, received on time in excellent condition. I would recommend to everyone. Great Product for a great price!</li>
    <li> it will not cut my nails and I do not have nails that are hard to cut. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> These nippers are just what I have been looking for. I like that there is a lifetime replacement guarantee on them. They were shipped promptly and arrived promtly as well.</li>
    <li> I had never owned toenail clippers that were easy to use and that did a good job.  After reading all the positive reviews, decided to try this Toilet Tree product.  Am delighted how well it works and am very pleased with my purchase.Also believe it is well priced.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as it looks.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I have problems cutting my toenails, especially the large ones.  I was recommended this by a medical personnel.&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong and sturdy.  It really clips the nails and helps a lot.  Both my husband and I purchased one.</li>
    <li> They work fine but a little small for arthretic hands.</li>
    <li> Good product,prompt delivery. Pleasant during business with you.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, strong nippers for hard thickened toe nails. These fit the bill. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that I had finally found a straight blade nipper.  No luck.  Curved blades are harder to use on small toenails.  Otherwise, the nippers seem sturdy and sharp.</li>
    <li> Finally, have located something to cut thru those thickened fungus toenails.  Nippers worked well on first trial, and looking forward to being able to keep toenails trimmed.  Recommend these heavy duty toenail clippers!</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised</li>
    <li> They work much better than standard toenail clippers.  I&#x27;ve own these for six months and have no complaints.  They have held up very well and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I disliked trimming my toenails because my old clippers were so hard to use. The new one is so easy I am waiting for my nails to grow again so I can cut them again! I can&#x27;t believe I put up with the old trimmers for so many years.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to use. Cuts thick nail with ease.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and sharp; used it immediately to cut my Mother&#x27;s toe nails. Even the big crusty ones fell to the blade! Time will tell the rest.</li>
    <li> I just received this Nipper and it really works!  It cut my nails easily and straight.  It is substantial and sturdy.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is not because of the product itself, but because I need to be very careful as to how much I want to cut off.  The blade is thicker than many nippers and therefore you need to adjust for it so you don&#x27;t take off more than you want to.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers to cut my uncle&#x27;s very thick toe nails.  These nippers were very heavy duty that they were able to cut through very, very thick toe nails.  I am ordering a second pair for my father.</li>
    <li> I have very thick toe and fingernails.  My toenails are so bad that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick toe and fingernails.  They are so bad that I had to have my toenails cut by a podiatrist.  My fingernails were nearly as bad but I kept trying to cut them myself because I was too embarrassed to have them done in a salon.  These clippers work great!  I can use them on both finger and toenails!  These are great!</li>
    <li> My toe was crushed 10 years ago ever since I&#x27;ve had a 1/4&amp;#34; thick nail. I purchased this because other clippers had bad reviews for sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is sharp but still does a lot of crushing on my nail. To me that is to be expected on a 1/4&amp;#34; thick nail with any clippers. I&#x27;m not sure how my nail compares to others with issues but this is fine for me. It may not be pretty but it works.</li>
    <li> I have toenail fungus and it is very difficult to cut my nails so that I let them grow out. I cannot believe how good these toenail clippers are. I just want to be careful not to cut away skin with them.  I&#x27;m not one who would over-rate a product, either.</li>
    <li> This toenail cutter is exactly as advertised; The blade is VERY sharp and cuts through the hardest of nails, it works beautifully and arrived promptly. An added benefit is that it&#x27;s not too heavy nor too big for the average size hand to use, and squeezing the handles is easier than one would imagine. Hope to have this for years and years.  P.S. Only 4 stars for the things I&#x27;ve mentioned here because I can&#x27;t imagine ever saying &amp;#34;I loved it&amp;#34; about any toenail clipper!</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and use. Sharp and accurate. Spring works fine with no problems.</li>
    <li> Razor sharp, be careful.  It&#x27;s perfect for thick nails.</li>
    <li> These are not easy for me to use, I have arthritis in my hands and I thought these would be longer, sharper, and a better angle for me to cut my toe nails.  So far they are awkward to use, I am going to have someone cut my nails and see if they will do the job........</li>
    <li> Good clippers. Got them to use on my mother&#x27;s toenails. They are extremely thick and they cut most of them easily. She&#x27;s 83 and had been going to the foot Dr to get them cut. So all in all a good purchase for the money.</li>
    <li> Above-average quality, good sharpness and alignment.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I had another set of clippers that were impossible to use, the handles were too short and the cutter blades too long. There was no way to get leverage to cut the large toenail. In this nipper the handles are long enough and they do cut the big toenail with a bit of effort. I think the cutter blades could be shorter to get even more cutting leverage.&lt;br /&gt;The handle lengths and the cutter lengths should be specified in these products. I had to compare pictures online to decide which product had the best cutting leverage. I determined it was this one.&lt;br /&gt;This nipper works and I&#x27;m happy I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was prompt as promised.</li>
    <li> very well made. Edges are thick and hard to see the nail, so when you are cutting for the first time with them be careful not to ct into the finger</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with these toenail nippers.  They cut easily and cleanly, and it&#x27;s always a pleasure to use an obviously well designed, precision tool. I was a bit taken aback, however, to find that the cutting edge is slightly curved, which I didn&#x27;t notice in the photo.  I&#x27;ve always understood that toenails should be trimmed straight across.  But I have to admit that in actual use it didn&#x27;t turn out to be a problem, and my toenails are now well groomed.</li>
    <li> The Toenail Nipper by ToiletTree is well designed and crafted.  I found it easy to use and strong enough for the job.</li>
    <li> Sharp and works well.  The wide opening &amp;#34;jaws&amp;#34; are a benefit.  I just wish I&#x27;d ordered a size larger.. but didn&#x27;t see one.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Cuts my toenails which are as heavy as a horses hoof.  Good price.</li>
    <li> At 82, I have great difficulty in cutting my toenails.  I saw how these nippers are made on TV and did a search for them.  My wife and I have both used them and they are great.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it is uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> These were easy to handle and cut those hard nails off.  Thanks to whomever suggested these.  Perfect.</li>
