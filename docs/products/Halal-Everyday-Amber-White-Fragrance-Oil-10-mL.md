<ol>
      <li>the bottle with the roll on is perfect to carry with you, in your purse</li>
      <li>ITS AWESOME......</li>
      <li>Every oil i&#x27;ve bought from Nail Polish Supplies is wonderful.</li>
      <li>BUT I MUST SAY GREAT OIL AND</li>
      <li>I bought this product after hearing how great it was from the podcast Rebel FM.</li>
      <li>Now the version of this product sold by Nail Polish Supplies is TOP NOTCH!!</li>
      <li>It was a good buy</li>
      <li>That is a shame because smelled good.</li>
      <li>I get SOOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS about this fragrance!</li>
      <li>So like it says under the Product Details, each vendor sells their own version of these perfume oils.</li>
      <li>It does smell better than a lot of the amber oils I have smelled, but not as good as the Nemat Amber oil</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell very strong and when it fell off my counter the lid shattered on the tile floor.  </li>
      <li>Overall best fragrance I have smelled as far as oils and it stays on your body and and can smell up a room no matter how light u apply!!!!</li>
      <li>and also it should be more oily</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS OIL</li>
      <li>I HAD PURCHASED ONE IN DECEMBER OF 2013 AND 3 MORE THIS MONTH</li>
      <li>I love love love this roll on perfume</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>Have been pleased with everything I have ordered.</li>
      <li>... could have been better if the oil didn&#x27;t seem dilluted....</li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>This Amber has been cut and then cut some more.</li>
      <li>got the recommendation through Rebel FM and love it.</li>
      <li>MOST</li>
      <li>Not as potent as others I&#x27;ve had...</li>
      <li>Not being able to tell what it is is its appeal.</li>
      <li>The ladies love it, no joke.</li>
      <li>Light, clean a very easy summer fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost sure you have smelled the original Amber.</li>
      <li>Cool!</li>
      <li>The scent is not as strong as it should be</li>
      <li>Great scent needs to last longer though</li>
      <li>find Halal&#x27;s version to be mild as it warms one&#x27;s body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;While not overly strong, the scent is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is not it halal, this is not the original amber.</li>
      <li>Smells like clean.</li>
      <li>My fianc&amp;eacute;e thought it smelled \\&quot;different\\&quot;, but seemed to have a much more positive reaction to it than before.</li>
      <li>The first time I purchased this item from this seller the scent was strong and the fragrance lasted all day.</li>
      <li>I love my amber white perfume and I am going to get some more and will refer this perfume to my friends.</li>
      <li>I strongly believe it is the Domestic version, while the imported smells much more distinct.</li>
      <li>It was a nice oil like those that I used to get at an African Market.</li>
      <li>It smells like dirt the first time you put it on.</li>
      <li>I usually forget that I put this fragrance on, people just tell me I smell good.</li>
      <li>I always get mine from a flea market, the real deal.</li>
      <li>I later let my friend smell it, and he said it smelled like clean linens.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Am a repeat customer and find Halal&#x27;s Everyday&#x27;s customer service to be outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I love this long lasting aroma.</li>
      <li>Did not smell as sweet as expected</li>
      <li>I have used alot of Amber oil and this is by far the extreme opposite of the nice clean fragrance that i usually use</li>
      <li>This is so wow</li>
      <li>It arrived early.</li>
      <li>i do not reccomend this product because its not the real amber white oil i had to return it not really even much scent to it</li>
      <li>It is a high quality, very long lasting perfume oil.</li>
      <li>My theory about Amber White is that you must be a little musty or have smoked recently for it to smell right.</li>

    <li> I bought this product after hearing how great it was from the podcast Rebel FM. Upon getting it home, I let my fianc&amp;eacute;e smell it. She coughed a little a made a face of disgust. I later let my friend smell it, and he said it smelled like clean linens. I tried to give it to another friend but he didn&#x27;t want it after smelling it out of the bottle. After a long time of it sitting in my house, I decided to put some on. My fianc&amp;eacute;e thought it smelled \\&quot;different\\&quot;, but seemed to have a much more positive reaction to it than before. My theory about Amber White is that you must be a little musty or have smoked recently for it to smell right. Also, don&#x27;t over do it. It supposed to be subtle.</li>
    <li> It smells like dirt the first time you put it on. The scent is not as strong as it should be</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this rub on oil.  It didn&#x27;t smell very strong and when it fell off my counter the lid shattered on the tile floor.  I ended up not using it and throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I have used alot of Amber oil and this is by far the extreme opposite of the nice clean fragrance that i usually use</li>
    <li> This is not it halal, this is not the original amber. This Amber has been cut and then cut some more. I&#x27;m almost sure you have smelled the original Amber. I have been warned about a mixed oil like Amber out there. Anyways yes the service was prompt but the oil fragrance is not correct. Thank You anyways.</li>
    <li> I can tell this amber oil probably smelled like the one I was searching for (Nemat amber) until it was mixed with its carrier oil. Whatever it was mixed with gives it a faint bitter accent. It does smell better than a lot of the amber oils I have smelled, but not as good as the Nemat Amber oil I was searching for, with no avail.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I wanted it to last, the scent I mean. Thank you though, I do like it, just not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I love this long lasting aroma. I will definitely use this product again. I love love love this roll on perfume</li>
    <li> Aroma seemed weak....Did not smell as sweet as expected... could have been better if the oil didn&#x27;t seem dilluted....I&#x27;d rather buy an uncut version of this</li>
    <li> Unless I got the wrong item, Amber White is not in a soap dispenser like bottle. I got a small vial similar to a ball point pen, have to roll over the spot I want to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the recommendation through Rebel FM and love it. I however get a lot of mixed reviews of it. Wear it for an hour or two and then ask people what they think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very subtle and should stay that way. When I smelled it it was as if I had trouble smelling it. Like Schrodinger&#x27;s cat you do not know whether or not you can smell it. Not being able to tell what it is is its appeal.</li>
    <li> Being a fan of the various Amber White fragrance oils I have ordered from Amazon, I have grown quite fond of the version offered by Halal Everyday.&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact each version offered by the various vendors is unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Halal&#x27;s version to be mild as it warms one&#x27;s body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;While not overly strong, the scent is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am a repeat customer and find Halal&#x27;s Everyday&#x27;s customer service to be outstanding.  Have been pleased with everything I have ordered.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT RECCOMEND PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT. I HAD PURCHASED ONE IN DECEMBER OF 2013 AND 3 MORE THIS MONTH AND THE SCENT IS TOTALLY  DIFFERENT.</li>
    <li> This is what am talking abt !!!! Smells morelike vanilla coconut OMG!!! This is so wow</li>
    <li> Not as potent as others I&#x27;ve had...The smell does not last long either....Amber white that im use to wearing the smell last all day</li>
    <li> Love the scent. It arrived early. the bottle with the roll on is perfect to carry with you, in your purse</li>
    <li> The ladies love it, no joke.Tyler barber approved from Rebel FM. Smells like clean. Don&#x27;t let them know what it is called until you got it in the bag.</li>
    <li> I did not get this on time and the smell is horrible I am not filling This oil anymore #sad face</li>
    <li> I love my amber white perfume and I am going to get some more and will refer this perfume to my friends.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this particular oil smells from this vendor...but I will say there are two different types...Domestic and Imported. I can never remember which is which but I do know one has that musky smell in which I HATE that smell. I strongly believe it is the Domestic version, while the imported smells much more distinct. I get SOOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS about this fragrance! I always get mine from a flea market, the real deal. Overall best fragrance I have smelled as far as oils and it stays on your body and and can smell up a room no matter how light u apply!!!!</li>
    <li> i do not reccomend this product because its not the real amber white oil i had to return it not really even much scent to it</li>
    <li> When I got the amber white there was nothing in the bottle. It does not have a roller and it does not look like the photo. That is a shame because smelled good.</li>
    <li> I purchased the roll-on version from Amazon.  It has absolutely no fragrance at all.  A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this item from this seller the scent was strong and the fragrance lasted all day. The second time it smelled \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; as if they tried to stretch their supply of oil. It&#x27;s ok but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it....always get compliments when I wear it and it last. I plan to purchase this product again. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great scent needs to last longer though and also it should be more oily it last the average time though</li>
    <li> It was a nice oil like those that I used to get at an African Market. It was a good buy</li>
    <li> This review is for the version of Amber White that i bought from the seller Halaleveryday. I give it 1 star but would rate it lower if it was possible!! It smells ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!! Its the weirdest smelling perfume oil i&#x27;ve every purchased. Now the version of this product sold by Nail Polish Supplies is TOP NOTCH!! I rate that version 5 stars. It is a high quality, very long lasting perfume oil. Every oil i&#x27;ve bought from Nail Polish Supplies is wonderful. So like it says under the Product Details, each vendor sells their own version of these perfume oils.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL MOST THE TIME WHEN I PURCHASEOILS THEY BE TO THIN AND WATERED DOWN,BUT I MUST SAY GREAT OIL AND LONG LASTING AS WELL....GOT SHIPMENT BEFORE TIME,WITH THAT BEING SAID..ITS AWESOME......</li>
    <li> I usually forget that I put this fragrance on, people just tell me I smell good. Light, clean a very easy summer fragrance. Oh yes, it was 3.99. Cool!</li>
