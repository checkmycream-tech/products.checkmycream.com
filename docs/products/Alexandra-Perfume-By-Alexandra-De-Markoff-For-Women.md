      <li>Ive been in love with this fragrance ever since my mother used to wear it.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne very fresh smell and lots of complements I receive,natural spray</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve learned to buy the light colored perfume in the bottle with the crystal ball on top.still</li>
      <li>The real thing not an imposture!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original shipping box.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always received in it&#x27;s original box.  </li>
      <li>I always get lots of compliments when wearing the original.</li>
      <li>it does not smell like it originally did.</li>
      <li>I have used this fragrance for over 20 years and love the real thing.</li>
      <li>I have lived this fragrance for over 25 years, but this smells cheap, not the real thing!</li>
      <li>Very grateful to find this!!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>

      <li>I do not like a strong cologne/perfume, but I did expect a scent to last a few minutes.</li>
      <li>expected the real alexandra by alexander de markoff...</li>
      <li>It has a scent when you first spray it, but the scent disappears completely after a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>This is the real stuff, not the watered down eau de toilette sprays some stores sell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product and the body lotion for over30 years ,and always receive a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> My mother has used this perfume for years.  It is hard to find now since Striplings is no longer around.  I have found it on amazon for less than I ever paid in the store and will buy it on there from now on.</li>
    <li> It was a big hit for my step mom.... So glad I could get this perfume for her for Xmas.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong Alexandra de Markoff cologne for my mother&#x27;s birthday.  I should have ordered Enigma instead. Unfortunately, I found out too late that cologne cannot be returned/exchanged because it is considered a hazardous material. I don&#x27;t understand why it wasn&#x27;t considered hazardous when it was shipped to me. Needless to say, the box sits unopened in it&#x27;s original shipping box.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Smells Rancid and made me have a sick headache!  I would not recommend this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I used Alexandra for over 30 years, but not anymore!  :(</li>
    <li> I love this heavenly scent. I have worn it for years but it is now no longer being produced!  What will I do?  Very grateful to find this!!  The only reason I rated this 4 stars rather than 5 is because it did not arrive in it&#x27;s box.  I&#x27;ve always received in it&#x27;s original box.  It makes one wonder.  Still same great scent!</li>
    <li> this product was ordered for my elderly mother.  i received within correct amount of days and the product was correct.    pleasant experience from start to finish</li>
    <li> God I love this stuff!  Bought the perfume instead of the essence by mistake and have filled entire buildings with my scent. Restraint!</li>
    <li> The only place I used to get it was nordstroms, but no more then I got on-line and there it was, I love it</li>
    <li> I have looked at every mall and cologne shop and never could find what I was looking for. The only place I found Alexandra by Alexandra De Markoff For Women was a very high end store at the mall in Laguna Beach. The price the store at the mall was asking for was almost $100.00. When I found my perfume I have been looking for I was not only shocked I found it, but I couldn&#x27;t believe the price. My perfume was sent to me in a timely manner and the price was excellent. I will be buying all my perfumes and colognes from this company from now on.</li>
    <li> The best fragrance and the best price.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this cologne exclusively. So it it a Christmas tradition that Alexandra is under the tree every year.</li>
    <li> expected the real alexandra by alexander de markoff...i fell for the phony play on the similar name...and of course cannot be returned...</li>
    <li> I wear Alexandra everyday whether staying at home or going out. Alexandra is the younger version on Enigma. Enigma is my&lt;br /&gt;signature cologne. But  my husband ordered Alexandra by mistake and I am enjoying it for a change.&lt;br /&gt;Both are wonderful, but Enigma is my all time favorite.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a woman at my dentist&#x27;s office. A very beautiful and rare fragrance. I like that. It&#x27;s nice having a beautiful unique fragrance that everyone in towns not wearing. Compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product over 40 years.</li>
    <li> Glad to know I can still purchase this fragrance..great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome service, cologne was perfect. Tons of compliments when I wear it which is always.</li>
    <li> Excellent bargain it is my mothers favorite and she was ecstatic about finding it for this price.  Just wished they sold the matching lotion.</li>
    <li> My deceased Aunt wore this cologne and it reminds me of her.  She always smelled good.  I miss her so much.</li>
    <li> I started wearing this perfume in 1985.  I like to layer it with the Alexandra De Markoff body lotion and body powder. I haven&#x27;t been able to find the body lotion in stock anywhere lately.</li>
    <li> It is so great to be able to buy this.  It has been my favorite perfume for many years.  It comes really fast and is the real thing.</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my mother and she is always thrilled with it.  It came in after a couple of days after I ordered. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an Enigma knock-off, not the real McCoy. I have lived this fragrance for over 25 years, but this smells cheap, not the real thing! In terribly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lovely another favorite for my Mother along with Enigma by Alexandra De Markoff. The real thing not an imposture!!! My mother has been using this fragrance for over 25 yrs. We purchased 3 bottles of each every 6 months!! The price is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you pay attention to the bottle and the color of the perfume, they differ sometimes and I&#x27;ve learned to buy the light colored perfume in the bottle with the crystal ball on top.still love this fragrance and hope I never have to find another.</li>
    <li> Ive been in love with this fragrance ever since my mother used to wear it. I remembered the name as well as the scent and since it was difficult for me to find at first, my daughter &amp;#34;found&amp;#34; it for me, from Amazon. This is the real stuff, not the watered down eau de toilette sprays some stores sell. You know when you have real perfume, when all you need is one spray, and rubbed in the right places, it will  last all day! I highly recomend this perfume to future consumers who love a little bit of nostalgia as I do. Thank you, sincerely, Juanita Wilson. (P.S.) Another fine, lasting fragrant to buy;Catchet! Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne very fresh smell and lots of complements I receive,natural spray THE BEST. HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO KEEP THIS COLOGNE ON MARKET JW</li>
    <li> I rated this item low because it was not what I ordered and was not what was advertised.  I ordered Enigma by Alexandra De Markoff, not Alexandra.  It has a scent when you first spray it, but the scent disappears completely after a few minutes.  I do not like a strong cologne/perfume, but I did expect a scent to last a few minutes.</li>
    <li> it does not smell like it originally did.</li>
    <li> I wore Alexandra for years, but upon purchasing this bottle I found it does not have the lasting scent that it used to. In the past even my laundry smelled amazing because it lingered. This is still a great scent, but I find myself using more, and having to reapply whereas I didn&#x27;t have to before.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Please keep in stock.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and believe it is a \\&quot;phoney\\&quot; version. I should have sent it back but waited too long. I have used this fragrance for over 20 years and love the real thing. This has a similar odor but does not last as long as,the real thing or smell as nice. I always get lots of compliments when wearing the original. The glass container  has some subtle differences if you compare to a bottle you just finished. Buyer beware unless you aren&#x27;t as picky about this product as I am. Maybe Amazon has changed providers by now--Mine was purchased well over a year ago.</li>
