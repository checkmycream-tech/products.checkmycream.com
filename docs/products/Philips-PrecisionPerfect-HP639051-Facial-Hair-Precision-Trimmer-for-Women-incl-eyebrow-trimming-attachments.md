      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Does its job just fine.</li>
      <li>Then I&#x27;ll use the trimming head (smallest attachment) to get any fine hairs that I may have missed underneath of my eyebrows.</li>

      <li>Good for eyebrow and facial hairs.  </li>
      <li>Worked reasonably well but the Panasonic one seems a bit better.</li>
      <li>This trimmer is decent but the blades do not do the best job due to its shape.</li>
      <li>Gets hung up easily and broke the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and good price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this trimmer and would definitely recommend it to someone wanting to shape their eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a model with this exact model number for at least 5 years, and it was perfect.  </li>
      <li>This little trimmer works great</li>
      <li>Great little contraption to keep in your purse.</li>
      <li>worth the money.</li>
      <li>Powerful</li>
      <li>/&gt;•Doesn&#x27;t really work good for coarse hair like that of the armpit or bikini line</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this trimmer it works great for the little bits of facial hair I have.</li>
      <li>But for only $12.99 it&#x27;s great for other areas with fine hairs.</li>

      <li>I think it works very well, I like it!</li>
      <li>I love this facial trimmer.</li>
      <li>Should have just tried to replace that exact model.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>I should&#x27;ve sprung for the more expensive Panasonic Beauty one; the top of that one looks much more efficient for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the Wahl Personal Trimmer is much better</li>
      <li>Works great and is a lot less intimidating for us females than their ginormous masculine brothers.</li>
      <li>As woman I love color and the fushsia pink is right up my alley</li>
      <li>Normally, I would recommend this product but the blade on this one is not smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel very good when you use it to trim facial hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A total rip off and waste of money!  The razor was so dull!  It hurt to use it!  I threw it out!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one at CVS for $9.99 and it it great!</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use and to clean. I just wish it came with a case or bag to keep all the pieces together.</li>
    <li> Normally, I would recommend this product but the blade on this one is not smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel very good when you use it to trim facial hair.</li>
    <li> Not very strong, so it catches a little.</li>
    <li> Attractive, does not hurt tender sites, quiet motor which uses simple battery.</li>
    <li> did not even cut, I have one similar, from a different manufacturer, worked great, then stopped working, so I bought this one just thinking it was the same, NOT, terrible won&#x27;t cut a thing!</li>
    <li> My son always lets me know when I have a mustache . This is the best thing I have used to get rid of the unwanted hairs on my face so I can feel like a woman again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like any other one.</li>
    <li> My gf is happy with the product. That makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. It&#x27;s the best one I use. Bought a lot of trimmer. And it was a disappointment but this trimmer was amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I use this to help shape my eyebrows. After I&#x27;m done plucking I will use the trimmer without the guard to get in between the brows. Then I&#x27;ll use the trimming head (smallest attachment) to get any fine hairs that I may have missed underneath of my eyebrows. Lastly, I&#x27;ll use the trimming comb to thing out the thicker part of my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this trimmer and would definitely recommend it to someone wanting to shape their eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;•Works perfectly for shaping brows&lt;br /&gt;•Comes with all attachments shown (adjustable comb / precision trimming head / cleaning brush)&lt;br /&gt;•Long-lasting battery (I still haven&#x27;t changed mine after months of being used)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;•Doesn&#x27;t really work good for coarse hair like that of the armpit or bikini line</li>
    <li> Delighted with trimmer!</li>
    <li> Good for eyebrow and facial hairs.  Bikini line, maybe maintenance...</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great</li>
    <li> Works well.  Small enough to fit in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would. Useless!</li>
    <li> Fairly self-explanatory. We had one purchased 15 years ago that finally gave up the ghost. This replacement is terrible.</li>
    <li> Love this little guy.  Does exactly what they said and a good value.  Very pleased will purchase again when it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
    <li> Pulls on the hair some</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this trimmer it works great for the little bits of facial hair I have. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase. Although it took about two weeks for processing and shipping I am still happy because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of having to pluck my eyebrows. This precision trimmer is lightweight and easy to use. It works very well and shaves my eyebrow hair without leaving any red marks. The extra precision tools I have not used since I bought this. I also like how this has a cap that covers the blades to keep them from wearing down too quickly.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well for the price. Gets a close trim, cuts thicker hair. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> does not work well with adapters  the Wahl Personal Trimmer is much better</li>
    <li> Works great, does what it says and cheap enough.  Problem is that after a month or two it just doesn&#x27;t work any more.  Sometimes I can make older ones work by banging it and the battery reconnects, but at this price i will order a new one every few months</li>
    <li> Use on my eyebrows. LOVE IT. I can use everyday if I want. Cuts thin enough that you don&#x27;t worry about the little hairs showing</li>
    <li> Good Product. My wife sometimes use it.</li>
    <li> I used this three times and it died. It is not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Not as good as other products from Philips, its rough</li>
    <li> Lost my other one so replaced it w/ this one. Love all the little extra pieces that came w/ it. Even came w/ a battery so ready to go out of the box. ;-)</li>
    <li> Used this one time and all it did was comb over the hair that needed to be removed. what a POS</li>
    <li> I had a model with this exact model number for at least 5 years, and it was perfect.  This new one is inferior workmanship, and did not work as well at all.  I was very disappointed that it only worked once, and then quit.  I replaced that battery but that did not help.  I am too lazy to send it back, but it was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works really well for facial hair and eyebrows</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it for bikini line cleanup, not sure it would hold up. It is perfect though for face and sideburn touch ups</li>
    <li> I expect more from Philips... lasted 2 times. Even the imports last a few months!</li>
    <li> Very very good . Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and good price!</li>
    <li> it does a good job on face, not so much on bikini area.  definitely for use on minimal hair removal..</li>
    <li> This is a perfect little trimmer for fine hairs (face, arms, etc.). Bikini line? Not so much. The blades are just too delicate. I bought this crossing my fingers that it would work okay for my bikini area, but I was skeptical because it&#x27;s such a small trimmer - but I was just being hopeful (I wasn&#x27;t wanting to spend a lot of money). If the description didn&#x27;t include &amp;#34;Precise bikini shaping and gentle bikini trimming...&amp;#34;, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. But for only $12.99 it&#x27;s great for other areas with fine hairs. If you&#x27;re looking for something for the bikini area, I&#x27;d suggest choosing a &#x27;stronger&#x27; trimmer (which, unfortunately, means spending more money).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to trim as close as trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past, but it does a decent job.</li>
    <li> I think it works very well, I like it!</li>
    <li> Worked reasonably well but the Panasonic one seems a bit better.</li>
    <li> Nice little tool for shaping my eyebrows and other places that need precision shaving.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works great I love it. I keep it in my purse its very compact 5 star recommended</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Not sure what all attachments are for but it does what I need it to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit reluctant to do what is expected of it!  Instructions aren&#x27;t really as clear as they could be.  But better than nothing!</li>
    <li> Blade is very dull. I know it shouldn&#x27;t be too sharp but this is not a blade at all. Eyebrows looked the same....</li>
    <li> Works well,. worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this facial trimmer. It works great but I wish you could get extra blades for it</li>
    <li> Buyer beware: this trimmer OK the first time but fell apart the second time.</li>
    <li> It gets spots that a regular razor can not get to.  It Lives up to what they say.</li>
    <li> Not powerful at all. Gets hung up easily and broke the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Should have just got a epilator, do not really care for this on my face.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect for shaving everything a girl needs to shave. Sturdy, well made. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> pointless. Clearly marketed towards women, or men who like pink, but I think this only works for the hairless.</li>
    <li> actually, not recommend to buy it. It is not usefully</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for the price. I found the accessories useless and threw them away after a week or so.  I use for face touch ups (sideburns, eyebrows) and unwanted stray hairs.  Powerful and I haven&#x27;t had to change the battery and I&#x27;ve had over 6 months.</li>
    <li> did not work the way I expected it to.  I had used a friends (different brand) and it did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this works great and is very discreet it looks like lipstick so the mate will never know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so tired of plucking so I thought an electric trimmer would be the best bet. This trimmer is decent but the blades do not do the best job due to its shape. I should&#x27;ve sprung for the more expensive Panasonic Beauty one; the top of that one looks much more efficient for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is very cute and still way better than plucking. It just doesn&#x27;t trim as well as it could if it had the newer circular head.</li>
    <li> Works okay but I wish it had a light. Also the battery holder bottom falls out very easily.</li>
    <li> Great tool!  Definitely a good price, too.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product!  My makeup goes on more smoothly after using it.  I don&#x27;t have much hair on my face and only use this every few weeks but it makes a difference!</li>
    <li> Scratch is not clean,</li>
    <li> This is excellent I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This product has different heads to do eyebrows, bikini trims etc. It works great. As woman I love color and the fushsia pink is right up my alley</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really grab my stray eyebrows like my old Conair trimmer did before I dropped it and broke it. Should have just tried to replace that exact model.</li>
    <li> This is a neat little device to have for quick clean ups. It works better than that &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27; junk too.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time and was as described! Great little contraption to keep in your purse.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim closely. Pulls. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love how sleek and adapatable this is.</li>
    <li> I had another brand of trimmer that died, so I thought I&#x27;d try this Norelco.  Not a good find at all.  Compared to my former model, the blade on this one is uncomfortable on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  Would not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a lot less intimidating for us females than their ginormous masculine brothers.</li>
    <li> I was able to get into the small area of the eyelids when trimming my eyebrows!!  It&#x27;s great for husbands ears too! :)</li>
    <li> hair get stuck and pinches - even fine thin hair --?? I have a similar one form about 15 years ago that works much better</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  Made in China.  Blade is dull.  Very poor quality; does not work.  I would return it but I had to cut the packaging up to get it out.</li>
    <li> Great i like it, very helpful and quickly! You should buy one and share with friends. I got 2 and i really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> terrible. wouldn&#x27;t cut paper. returned it</li>
    <li> Love these mini trimmers! Great for shaving facial hair area. Even comes with adapters for grooming your eyebrows. So far the battery life is fine.</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer. Easy to use. Small enough to carry it with you. Great personal trimmer.</li>
    <li> The on /off switch is not working. You have to remove the battery each time you use it. It does cut good.</li>
    <li> consider, this product is only for eyebrows</li>
    <li> It was painful...have others similar that never hurt...I sent this back.</li>
    <li> Looks good and works well but would be much better if the cutting head was on an angle.</li>
    <li> I have to go over area several times.  I must not have the angle right.</li>
    <li> Perfect trimmer!!! Trust me!</li>
    <li> Love it....best mini trimmer I have had so far!</li>
    <li> Good product. Very user-friendly</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> nice and handy, great for travelling</li>
    <li> More pink thank I realized, but it&#x27;s still cute. Does its job just fine.</li>
    <li> Fell apart, have no idea how to put the blades back in :-(</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t always turn on.</li>
    <li> Very easy to trim my brow</li>
    <li> Great buy. High quality and effective facial hair trimmer</li>
    <li> Crappy quality period...returning it.</li>
    <li> I just used it for a minute.  It pulls the hairs on my face and is very painful.  Won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
