<li> I have skin issues and this is a GREAT cover which does not irritate or redden my angry, angry skin.</li>
<li> I have used this Glominerals pressed base for years, and I feel it is the most natural looking make-up that I have ever used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time and no longer buy it from an aesthetician because I get the same product here for less.  </li>
<li> i have been using this base for quite awhile and it has nice coverage.  </li>
<li> I remembered that Glomineral is tripled milled giving it that creamy feel that other mineral makeup cannot come close to.</li>
<li> Like any other makeup, needs to be touched up throughout the day.</li>
<li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Bare Minerals which lit a skin fire that took years to bring under control.</li>
<li> Love this base.</li>
<li> This is my favorite base makeup!</li>
<li> I was recently recommended a different brand that&#x27;s a little less expensive, but I hate it.</li>
<li> It comes with a thin round sponge applicator</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t look fake or caked on.</li>

    <li> I love it ! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Very clean &amp; healthy makeup</li>
    <li> i have been using this base for quite awhile and it has nice coverage.  A very natural look.  I seen amazon had it much cheaper than buying it at the Spa</li>
    <li> The best foundation ever for any king of skin.  Not oily not drying and won&#x27;t break you out.  It&#x27;s developed by dermatologists...love love love it!</li>
    <li> This powder goes on very evenly and doesn&#x27;t cake. It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or make my skin too oily.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup! Don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it, oh yeah because its $44 at the spa, but the price on Amazon is so affordable, will never go back!</li>
    <li> The makeup I ordered was sold at an excellent price and the seller provided very fast shipment. My daughter was delighted to find a free gift with her makeup when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect powder for over make-up or alone.  Doesn&#x27;t feel cakey.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have skin issues and this is a GREAT cover which does not irritate or redden my angry, angry skin. Coupled with the Yonka skin care, I look much younger and I&#x27;m not so emotionally devestated about my looks. Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Bare Minerals which lit a skin fire that took years to bring under control.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this and it lasted for over a month and looked great do I ordered the full sized compact.

    <li> Have been using this makeup for years now- the camouflage concealer is great too! It goes on light and covers well</li>
    <li> Came quickly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Using this product is like using nothing at all. The color matches with no glare, no weeping and is easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The base goes on easily and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my esthetician...good product. Like any other makeup, needs to be touched up throughout the day. Overall tho, I think I&#x27;ve switched to this from a product Ive used for years.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery on exceptional product!</li>
    <li> The powder feels very silky on my skin.  It was recommended by my esthetician.  They products have really helped my skin look better.</li>

    <li> Love this base. Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Gives you great coverage.  Best of all it doesn&#x27;t settle on to your wrinkles. It blends nicely with my skin tone. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I love this powder, is much lighter than the regular mineral make up. I totally recommend it for people with problem skin and does good coverage.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and quality. Authentic item. Glominerals is wonderful makeup!</li>
    <li> I like using GloMinerals -  My only concern is, is it really GloMinerals or a &amp;#34;wanna be&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> the best coverage without irritation even for the most sensitive skin type .</li>
    <li> This is the greatest make up. It&#x27;s easy to apply and is a really soft finish. I have bought at the local spas and this is a big money saver.</li>
    <li> There is no comparison when it comes to Glomineral and the other popular mineral makeup on QVC. Glomineral glides on beautifully and gives you just the right coverage. It doesn&#x27;t look fake or caked on. I remembered that Glomineral is tripled milled giving it that creamy feel that other mineral makeup cannot come close to.</li>
    <li> Have used this before and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite base makeup! I&#x27;ve ordered it multiple times before. I was recently recommended a different brand that&#x27;s a little less expensive, but I hate it. Definitely going bak to my Glo Minerals!!!</li>
