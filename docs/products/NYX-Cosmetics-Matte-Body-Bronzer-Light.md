      <li>IF YOU DONT SEE YOUR COLOR HERE ITS SURE TO BE AT ULTRA STORE WHERE I WILL TO CONTINUE TO BUY</li>
      <li>Love this matte bronzer.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite matte bronzer.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It looks very light, natural and is great at combatting grease.</li>
      <li>Highly pigmented and good color for many skin tones.</li>
      <li>i left an earlier review stating the condition my package arrived in but now that I have tried the product I am proud to say the bronzer is great!</li>
      <li>I ordered the shade &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; since I have light skin however this seems more for medium-dark skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light but does the job I love how natural it looks great price.</li>
      <li>recommend the Light shade.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t break out in either place, which is always nice when trying new products.</li>
      <li>It applies nicely and is okay on dry skinn however.</li>
      <li>Most bronzers look orange and harsh on my fair skin tone, but this color is warm and natural.  </li>
      <li>Perfect matte finish, however the bronzer is a tiny bit muddy, with red undertones.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>The color is pretty light tan, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone whose skin doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great year round.</li>
      <li>This is the most natural looking bronzer I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I was told it was a dupe for the NARS Lagoona bronzer than everyone loves, but I rarely use this one</li>
      <li>So this arrived exactly when it said it would, which is always greatly appreciated!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star because the color is a bit more redish than I was hoping for, but I use it regularly during the winter months.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Super fast shipping as well!</li>
      <li>I also used this to contour my hairline as I have a large forehead.</li>
      <li>and I find the color looks very pink-ish.</li>
      <li>They also wear off fast and leave stains on my lighter colored clothing, but not with this one.</li>
      <li>When I opened it, I was very hesitant because the color almost reminded me of a brown based blush (it was a somewhat muted rusty brown)</li>
      <li>Cane in Really fast</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Very natural color sun kissed look</li>
      <li>I usually use bareminerals faux tan, and I thought nothing could be better than that.</li>
      <li>I usually buy pretty expensive bronzer ($30-$40); let me say, this stuff is beautiful for the price.</li>
      <li>I love the matte finish, other bronzers in my experience have been extremely sparkly.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s dark enough to give you definition, but light enough to look like a natural glow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about bronzer…this goes on light and does not look cake or like a fake tan.</li>
      <li>This is super pigmented, you hardly need to use any at all.  </li>

    <li> I use this for my face, the consistency is perfect, not too chalky. It is a little pinker then I expected though.</li>
    <li> Works graet! Cane in Really fast</li>
    <li> Awful awful awful. Does not blend at all! The color is totally orange. Had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> I usually buy pretty expensive bronzer ($30-$40); let me say, this stuff is beautiful for the price. Ten dollars? I would buy this over the others any day. I am quite fair and it&#x27;s dark enough to give you definition, but light enough to look like a natural glow. Love it.</li>
    <li> I recently used this to go to a work event where I didn&#x27;t want my pasty skin to steal the show from my red dress. It went on great with a kabuki brush and wasn&#x27;t chalky. I also used this to contour my hairline as I have a large forehead. I didn&#x27;t break out in either place, which is always nice when trying new products. The color is pretty light tan, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone whose skin doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this review four stars as opposed to five is because it was hard to clean off of my brush (which I also use for loose powder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> my go-to brand. Perfect for contouring, easily blendable. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this matte bronzer. It&#x27;s perfect for contouring. Love a non shimmer bronzer! Will order it again! Great year round.</li>
    <li> I use it over a contouring cream and it works so well! It gives it that perfect matte finish. Sometimes in the mornings i&#x27;m lazy and I just wear this and some powder and it still looks great!&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> i think this is a bit to orange so i wont be buying it again.I wished it was a nicer shade it had a good price.</li>
    <li> The NYX light bronzed is a Wonderful matte bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;No sparkly cheeks for me, my search for a grownup bronzer is over.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Light shade. I am fair, can tan fairly easily, but&lt;br /&gt;No longer tan my face by the sun. This is great.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and I find the color looks very pink-ish. I was told it was a dupe for the NARS Lagoona bronzer than everyone loves, but I rarely use this one and I prefer my Too Faced Chocolate Sole bronzer for contouring and bronzing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light but does the job I love how natural it looks great price. Will purchase again next time around</li>
    <li> This bronzer is awesome.  I got the lightest color, and it looks great on my porcelain skin.  Most bronzers look orange and harsh on my fair skin tone, but this color is warm and natural.  The formula blends easily, and the lack of shimmer makes it great for contouring.  This will be my go-to bronzer from now on.</li>
    <li> Rivals Macs bronzer. Great for contouring.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite matte bronzer. It looks very light, natural and is great at combatting grease.</li>
    <li> ITS A GOOD PRODUCT IF YOU NEED THIS COLOR I DIDNT I ORDER WRONG NUT FIND THE RIGHT ONE AT ULTRA&lt;br /&gt;SO IF YOU DONT SEE YOUR COLOR HERE ITS SURE TO BE AT ULTRA STORE WHERE I WILL TO CONTINUE TO BUY</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m very picky about bronzer…this goes on light and does not look cake or like a fake tan. Very natural color sun kissed look</li>
    <li> So this arrived exactly when it said it would, which is always greatly appreciated! When I opened it, I was very hesitant because the color almost reminded me of a brown based blush (it was a somewhat muted rusty brown) HOWEVER, once I put it on, I was extremely happy. I usually use bareminerals faux tan, and I thought nothing could be better than that. Wrong! This is my go to. It takes very little product (where with the bareminerals I found myself having to reapply) and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I am of medium skin tone, and this gave me the perfect sun kissed look. I was also scared that the light would be too fair but it matches perfectly</li>
    <li> very good bronzer. Highly pigmented and good color for many skin tones. I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star because the color is a bit more redish than I was hoping for, but I use it regularly during the winter months.</li>
    <li> I know what bronzer is for but thgis is too dark. I ordered the shade &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; since I have light skin however this seems more for medium-dark skin. It applies nicely and is okay on dry skinn however. I would purchase a lighter version of this.</li>
    <li> fell of my counter the other day, the glass and the product shattered :( the container also broke.</li>
    <li> This is super pigmented, you hardly need to use any at all.  I use it for contouring, great product.</li>
    <li> I use this bronzer everyday. It is a little on the subtle side, but it definitely makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Alright! i left an earlier review stating the condition my package arrived in but now that I have tried the product I am proud to say the bronzer is great! not too dark and completely matte. Awesome sauce!</li>
    <li> Favorite bronzer works well  with fair to medium skin color</li>
    <li> Very nice for contouring my face providing a nice glow. I love the matte finish, other bronzers in my experience have been extremely sparkly. They also wear off fast and leave stains on my lighter colored clothing, but not with this one. Lasts all day. Great product.</li>
    <li> Perfect matte finish, however the bronzer is a tiny bit muddy, with red undertones.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a great bronzer to have in one&#x27;s makeup collection.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural looking bronzer I have ever used. No glitter or sparkle which can make you look shiny. This is my go too!</li>
