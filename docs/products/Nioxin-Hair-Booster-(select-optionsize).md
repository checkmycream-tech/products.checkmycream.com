      <li>The hair loss with pregnancy I experienced was unreal!</li>
      <li>this is the best price around.  </li>
      <li>and i have been beyond impressed with the outcome.</li>
      <li>heard that Nioxin products are very good for your hair</li>
      <li>Nioxin &amp;#34;folicall booster&amp;#34; is very good product.</li>
      <li>Great product timely delivery</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>I had experienced hair loss after having a child about 6 months after birth and it was quite noticeable at my hair line.</li>
      <li>great people to deal with</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy with the service from All In One.  </li>
      <li>I compared this product to one I purchased from Great Clips salon.</li>
      <li>and I DO see results including an area where I USED to have a fairly sizable bald spot.</li>
      <li>I noticed good result on my hair...</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>will tell me more !</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>My maternal uncles have amazing hair, as does my dad (63 y/o).</li>
      <li>It gave my scalp a nice refreshed tingly feeling, and I saw amazing results.</li>
      <li>and honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed any results.</li>
      <li>It is a good product as I still have hair on the top of my head,</li>
      <li>A bit of direction here would be nice.</li>
      <li>Nice scent....</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell, very strong and smells like treatment or medicine but doesn&#x27;t causes me nausea or something I can tolerate it</li>
      <li>I Could not get passed the very strong odor to use it more than twice.</li>
      <li>I use thermal treatment; however, now I use iron + hair blower more often and didn&#x27;t notice any hair damage</li>
      <li>And most moms go off of any hormonal birth control indefinitely because they are nursing.</li>
      <li>This product appears ok, but was manufactured in 2010.  </li>
      <li>I stopped the products many years ago and my hair fell out</li>
      <li>It was more of a burning feeling than a tingly one.</li>
      <li>This may work for some, and if so, that is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Every time I try to go without using this on my scalp, my hair comes out more.</li>
      <li>Be patient and do not freak out when you lose more hair when you start using Nioxin products.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, great product</li>
      <li>It may even work better with the step 3 hair foam stuff.</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t style it the way I used to be able to.</li>
      <li>So, I don&#x27;t really believe I had any great expectations of it. . .</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
      <li>For people who think this product will magically make your hair grow, here is a reality check.    </li>
      <li>The back and sides of my head make me a very good candidate for a hair transplant, the thickness of those hairs is outstanding</li>
      <li>great my hair feels moist, too early to tell,,I</li>
      <li>But once you use habitually your hair does not come out as easily.</li>
      <li>but maybe it is because if your hair doesnt come out as easily I would think it would be thicker.</li>
      <li>This was a pretty good price, and the shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product and</li>
      <li>(The lady at Bosely when I went for my free 30 minute consultation was even impressed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As a result I have been able to retain a good head of hair at my age when my family heritage predicted male pattern baldness.</li>
      <li>used a mixture of different nioxin products and I&#x27;ve seen a good result hope to get even better and thicker</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Thanks Nioxin!!!</li>
      <li>I will say that Amazon took care of the problem quickly and easily with one phone call.</li>
      <li>Needs to be more affordable to be rated higher.</li>
      <li>I have not seen any significant results</li>
      <li>Buy only the starter kit or the smallest bottle and assess whether or not you see any kind of improvement at all before shoveling more money into these products.</li>
      <li>I read so many positive reviews about it</li>
      <li>I had no bounce to my hair and my scalp was full of dandriff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My fiancée however, swears I am not losing my hair and it looks full and has body...</li>
      <li>Been loyal to it on and off for three years.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser commented that I had a lot of new hair growth on the top of my head &amp;</li>
      <li>but so far, it looks just fine !</li>
      <li>That makes it worth it.  </li>
      <li>I promise it nips your hair problems right away.</li>
      <li>Only light fine fuzz would grow that would break off after an inch or so.  </li>
      <li>That spot is almost completely filled in with new hair now that started growing after about 4 months of product usage.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great product and I will definitely use it again.</li>
      <li>so I bought just this hair booster and after only using it a few times I&#x27;m really impressed.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Nioxin products for many years and my hair has come back so my hair is now fuller.  </li>
      <li>and I actually feel as though my hair has thinned more then before I even started this regimen.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>I give this product 5 stars because in this short amount of time I&#x27;ve seen something better than everything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>You have to be patient though and use it consistently.</li>
      <li>and I was starting to lose more hair each time I washed it.  </li>
      <li>The product seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>i first priced this item at a \\&quot;</li>
      <li>But my doctor said that it is safe to go back on after 3 months.</li>
      <li>but i decided to check the prices on amazon and sure enough i found it here for $27.00...</li>
      <li>I am so pleased to see some hair growth on the areas where I applied it 2-3 months later!!</li>
      <li>The larger size gives you more for the money.  </li>
      <li>I use this daily and make sure I am never out of it.</li>
      <li>Must be consistent - every day as directed.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying using Intensive therapy Follicle Booster by Nioxin, I am new  at using the product so it is too early to see the benefits of it.</li>
      <li>I use this on that spot every day and it grows normally and is the thickness and length of the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started their line a long with the Hair Booster (LOVE this stuff) and scalp treatment.</li>
      <li>I really liked the old follicle booster, but the new intensive therapy hair booster isn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and was in a lot of stress the last 2 years.</li>
      <li>It absolutely does what it is made to do -- BOOST the follicles of the hair.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really know if it works.  </li>
      <li>My doctor said that I would have had a thinning hair problem irregardless of having a baby, but I really disagree with this.</li>
      <li>Lost all hair during cheomotherapy and was told hair grows in thicker afterwards but wanted to give that area a real boost as hair grows in.  </li>
      <li>and i farted much than my wife</li>
      <li>so I had to start using them very faithfully each day and it has helped me.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>just say put it on without direction on HOW MUCH to apply.  </li>
      <li>It might add some nutrients to your hair, but it really doesnt do anything except burn and irritate the scalp.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall satisfaction: very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would be very mindful when trying these products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i  have been diagnosed with &#x27;frontal fibrosing alopicia&#x27; i belive this product, along with medications prescribed by my doctor has really helped return hair growth. I use it twice a day without fail.</li>
    <li> I am rating the seller.  The product was delivered extremely fast, something like two working days.  I am extremely happy with the service from All In One.  5-Stars for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I have used it before and I am still debating about it&#x27;s long term value, although I am still testing it, at the moment.  It seems to make your hair look fuller although I am not sure it is really growing hair.  3.5 stars for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair cutter swears by the product though.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0013945CQ Nioxin Intensive Therapy Hair Booster, 3.4 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)]]    This product, if used regularly as recommended, has helped me to grow new hair.  It may take several months to work but it does work.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years. Seems to give body without adding weight, making my thinning naturally curly hair appear fuller. Very good price!</li>
    <li> It regrows hair and will re-establishes circulation any where.</li>
    <li> It might add some nutrients to your hair, but it really doesnt do anything except burn and irritate the scalp.  Directions on the bottle make no sense.    Avoid!  Waste of your money!</li>
    <li> I have been using nioxin products since 2003.  People have noticed the difference in the thickness of my hair, which has always been very thin and fine.  The booster has helped fill in the almost bald spots that were really starting to show.</li>
    <li> Use it with all the other Nioxin products and Rogaine.  Them seem to help me hair look fuller.  I have noticed some new hairs growing, not sure how long they will last.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have slowed down my hair loss with this stuff.  It did not grow any back but it did thicken up my hair and prevent the rapid hair loss I was experiencing.  That makes it worth it.  If you are already bald, buy a razor or clippers to keep your head trimmed... don&#x27;t buy this and expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nioxin products for many years and my hair has come back so my hair is now fuller.  I stopped the products many years ago and my hair fell out so I had to start using them very faithfully each day and it has helped me.&lt;br /&gt;For me this is the best product.</li>
    <li> Great value for this size product!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 1 oz. version of this product and found that it lives up to its reputation.  This Payless Beauty outfit gives prompt delivery also.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product as  well as other nioxin products for a while now, i have  been on coumadin therapy since february 2011 and noticed that my hair was getting thinner and i was losing hair at an alarming rate, this product does not regrow my hair but makes the existing hair stronger and less likely to fall out..falling and thinning hair is one of the side effects of coumadin.  i first priced this item at a \\&quot; Ricky&#x27;s beauty supplies store in New York and they wanted $52.00 for it and was tempted to buy it but i decided to check the prices on amazon and sure enough i found it here for $27.00...Rickys is a highly overpriced store and its just a rippoff to charge folks $52.00 for a $27.00 item..( thats a $25.00 difference )..i will never shop at Ricky again.</li>
    <li> I went through a period where I was having chunks of hair falling out-possibly due to stress. My hairdresser actually  recommended this product, but her price was marked up tremendously. I found a kit on Amazon and gave it a try. It gave my scalp a nice refreshed tingly feeling, and I saw amazing results. Would highly recommend to those that have thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product I was losing so much Hair daily and I was stressing out so much. Since I starting using this product the amount of hair I catch in my shower drain is back to normal and amount I can live with. I use this daily and make sure I am never out of it.</li>
    <li> I immediately starting using and my edges instantly began to thicken and fill in. I have hair around my edges now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hair thinning for years because of a hormonal problem.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to grow hair and never worked so I was skeptical to try Nioxin.  I have one area at the front of my head so I didn&#x27;t want to get the entire kit so I bought just this hair booster and after only using it a few times I&#x27;m really impressed.  I&#x27;ve noticed some hair growth and where it&#x27;s not growing yet the current follicles are thicker so it covers that thinning area.  I&#x27;m now really thinkng of buying the entire kit in the hopes it&#x27;ll thicken my hair because it&#x27;s naturally thin and fragile to begin with.  This little bottle is SO worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old female that is experiencing some noticeable thinning to my front hair line and gradual thinning on the top of my head. I have been using this follicle booster along with the Nioxin 3 part system AND vitamins religiously for 6 months now. The only thing that I can say that it&#x27;s done to my hair is dry it out. I have not seen any significant results and I actually feel as though my hair has thinned more then before I even started this regimen. I would be very mindful when trying these products. Buy only the starter kit or the smallest bottle and assess whether or not you see any kind of improvement at all before shoveling more money into these products. This may work for some, and if so, that is fantastic! However, I would be cautious of reviews you find online as they can be written by anyone (i.e. those associated with the brand). If by miracle, this product starts to actually do what it is advertised to do all of a sudden, I will gladly come back to revise this post, but for now I give it 1 star.   EDIT: DO NOT USE THIS STUFF!!! After discontinuing use of this product, approximately a month later, everywhere I had applied the product has thinned to a degree that is far worse then when I had ever started using this stuff. Perhaps, like Minoxidil, your hair develops a dependency on such a product. You can literally see a uniform line of thinned hair along my hairline where I had applied this product. Really, really regret using this stuff; the result of use is far worse then what I started with. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> this product might work, but my dermatologist told me to quit using it because i was having extremely non-fling dry scalp.  I definitely cause redness where applied. - as it says on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 weeks now, and while I know other reviewers have said it will not grow new hair, I can&#x27;t help but notice a WHOLE bunch of new sprouts of hair exactly where I put this gel.  I do use it twice a day, as directed, and when I first started using it, I noticed a slight burning and redness; however, I no longer get that anymore.  I am convinced it works, and I will continue to use it.  I also use the Nioxin SYSTEM 4 shampoo and conditioner (3 months now) and the Nioxin vitamins (2 months now).  It definitely helps and I am getting lots of compliments on my hair recently.  But be advised.....you MUST USE THE PRODUCTS EVERYDAY or your hair will go back to the way it was.  Hope this helps others in the same situation!</li>
    <li> Great product great people to deal with</li>
    <li> I find that follicle booster pretty much does the same thing as rogaine does, but at less of a price. For people who think this product will magically make your hair grow, here is a reality check.    Follicle booster does not regrow hair! It does, however, stop your hair from falling out. So if you are like me who still has hair growing, but loses hair faster than it grows, this may help you have a fuller set of hair. But, if your hair is not longer growing at all, then you would just use it as a preventive measure.    My scalp only turned red the first time I used it. It was more of a burning feeling than a tingly one. Ever since, I have not had a problem. The application is a bit messy, because it is in a gel format. If your are not careful, it will run into your face. I suggest keeping a damp cloth nearby to wash off any of the follicle booster that may drop into your face or forehead.    Overall, this is a great product and I will definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> Great product timely delivery</li>
    <li> I Could not get passed the very strong odor to use it more than twice. A real Waste of money. Sorry, I  Do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review before, so know that this is a big deal. It&#x27;s going to be long too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 24 year old male, thinning started at about 20 years old, receding started at 21. It felt like the change in my hairline happened over night, but it&#x27;s been progressively getting worse. It came as a shock because for a while I had kept my hair short. Next thing I know, I can&#x27;t style it the way I used to be able to. I stopped using gel completely thinking that was the problem, but it wasn&#x27;t because it got worse. I&#x27;ve also gotten several hormones tested through blood work. My maternal uncles have amazing hair, as does my dad (63 y/o). To this day, the only reason I can come up with is stress (med school).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2010, I started using Nioxin #2 shampoo and conditioner, I suppose that for the last 2 years I&#x27;ve slowed down the dramatic hairless I was experiencing. I was told Rogaine would bring back some hair, didn&#x27;t work for me as my problem was the hairline. I&#x27;m also using the X5 Hair Laser (don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s doing anything)&lt;br /&gt;As of right now, I don&#x27;t even have a definitive hairline, my widow&#x27;s peak does not come down and make a point, there&#x27;s a little bald spot so the \\&quot;peak\\&quot; is basically a dull round shape with a bald spot. The left and right indentations of my hairline differ, they are both extremely thin, but the right is emptier than the left. And the entire top of my head is see-through (thin). And grows at an unbelievably slower pace compared to the back and sides. The back and sides of my head make me a very good candidate for a hair transplant, the thickness of those hairs is outstanding (The lady at Bosely when I went for my free 30 minute consultation was even impressed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Nioxin Intensive Therapy Hair Booster a little over 3 weeks ago. The directions say to put it on in the morning after using the nioxin shampoo and conditioner and before you use the scalp activator. And then a second time at night. So I&#x27;ve been doing that, as well as using the X5 laser 3 times a week as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I noticed on the left side of my hairline, dozens of tiny follicles beginning to appear. I give this product 5 stars because in this short amount of time I&#x27;ve seen something better than everything I&#x27;ve ever used. I really wish I knew about this 2 years ago. And unlike any product it has created hope for me. I will try to be back every month with updates. My hope is soon that the emptier right side, as well as the center will start generating new follicles, and I see some real results.</li>
    <li> Ladies?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair long - and at &amp;#34;50&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a big risk. But my hairdresser says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Healthy&amp;#34;enough. YES, it falls out when I brush it, so I re-stimulate w/Nioxin Booster after showers &amp; also take the VITAMINS.. They&#x27;ve been working for years!</li>
    <li> I wish i could give an actual review of the product itself, but we received a totally different product then what was ordered! I will say that Amazon took care of the problem quickly and easily with one phone call. Hopefully they have resolved the issue in the warehouse.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible, makes hair sticky and had no positive effect</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using Intensive therapy Follicle Booster by Nioxin, I am new  at using the product so it is too early to see the benefits of it.</li>
    <li> After 1.5 years of use, seems to be stopping the hairloss. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had new growth...at least non noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since two weeks only and it&#x27;s a bit early to see results but so far, it looks just fine !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy, you can put it in your hair at anytime and when it dries it becomes invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell me more !</li>
    <li> heard that Nioxin products are very good for your hair</li>
    <li> The Nioxin shelf life is supposed to be 36 months.  This product appears ok, but was manufactured in 2010.  Good price.</li>
    <li> This doesnt do anything to help hairloss.  Just a hollywood effect product.  Look into rogaine or lipogaine if you&#x27;re looking for hairloss produts.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper at Amazon and you can buy the 3 pz bottle. Dont even bother with one ounce. You dont get enough in it at all.  I have thin hair. Every time I try to go without using this on my scalp, my hair comes out more. I cant say my hair is thicker but maybe it is because if your hair doesnt come out as easily I would think it would be thicker. I use the shampoo and this scalp hair booster. I&#x27;ve used for years. It&#x27;s not gonna work overnight.  But once you use habitually your hair does not come out as easily. I love this stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years. It seems to work, because I see little hairs grow in between the longer ones around my face, which is where I use the product. I don&#x27;t use it religiously and when I use it, only once a day. Its just too much work to do it twice a day. I do see a difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a couple of weeks because was travelling.  So, I&#x27;ll keeep on using it.</li>
    <li> I see some improvement,but I did not expect  overnight  results.  I have recommended  this product to both friends and family.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Use of this product seems to reduce any further hair thinning and gives volume to my hair without any sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I buy this because I am a middle aged man losing my hair...LOL, I&#x27;d try anything except snake oil!  I preface this review with the disclosure that I am not a scientist so I have no idea if this works as promised.  My fiancée however, swears I am not losing my hair and it looks full and has body...I think she may be telling me this because she loves me??  Regardless, I do think my hair loss has slowed, possibly stopped, so I will continue to use for now.</li>
    <li> and I wanted to use this premium product. I like the kit but I feel this product don&#x27;t really boots or speed the process ...</li>
    <li> No problems.  Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was recommended by my haircare specialist. So, I don&#x27;t really believe I had any great expectations of it. . . Perhaps that&#x27;s why I gave it an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; or a 3-star rating. I&#x27;ll give it another couple of months try before I definitely say if it&#x27;s worth the amount they charge for this product.</li>
    <li> I was getting one of those old woman &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; on the crown of my head.  Only light fine fuzz would grow that would break off after an inch or so.  I use this on that spot every day and it grows normally and is the thickness and length of the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> to work. It may even work better with the step 3 hair foam stuff. Needs to be more affordable to be rated higher.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  While it does not grow new hair, it does help the rate of loss.  Would definitely recommend if your hair is thinning or falling out early in life.</li>
    <li> I started using these products when I was 21 (I&#x27;m 32 now) and noticed a receding hairline. This stuff has basically slowed that hairline down and leaves my hair feeling thicker and healthier. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying anything else. There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really know if it works.  Nice scent....</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who is battling hair-thinning problems.  It has totally helped me and I wish I would&#x27;ve ordered this sooner!</li>
    <li> Nioxin Intensive Thearapy works well to stimulate hair growth when used with Nioxin Cleanser and Scalp Therapy on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Nioxin is always repackaging (containers continue to shrink), and changing formulas and product names.  I really liked the old follicle booster, but the new intensive therapy hair booster isn&#x27;t quite the same.  For starters, it&#x27;s watery compared to the old follicle booster.  In addition, I&#x27;m just not seeing the same results.  Way to expensive for disappointing results.</li>
    <li> I have been using for several years and I believe it works - I was thinning around my face and I know its growing back because there is new growth.</li>
    <li> Have only used it a few times and it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work pretty well. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and haven&#x27;t seen much loss. This was a pretty good price, and the shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin &amp;#34;off and on&amp;#34; for years.  Whenever, I have hair breakage Nioxin helps bring my hair back to life.  It actually helps my hair grow.  Rub in a couple of drops on the problems areas and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> I bought Nioxin&#x27;s Hair Booster at a hair salon last July. I read so many positive reviews about it and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am so pleased to see some hair growth on the areas where I applied it 2-3 months later!! I am also using Nioxin&#x27;s shampoo and Scalp Therapy conditioner. I have baby fine hair and was in a lot of stress the last 2 years. I started noticing my hair getting thinner. I&#x27;m now noticing a little less scalp showing on the areas where it was thinning. I tried Minoxidil and Laser therapy treatment (which cost me $3000!!!) for a year with no result. I am and will be a lifetime Nioxin customer!! Thanks Nioxin!!!</li>
    <li> Nioxin &amp;#34;folicall booster&amp;#34; is very good product. I am using it on regular basis. It is help me to stop hair loss and hairs became more robust and thick.</li>
    <li> just like the product said hot n red scalp was very dark and made my hair tingy and i farted much than my wife</li>
    <li> This product had no effect on me. Now I am convinced that there is such a thing in the world.</li>
    <li> I had experienced hair loss after having a child about 6 months after birth and it was quite noticeable at my hair line. My ponytail got so much smaller in diameter. 2 years later, I haven&#x27;t fully recovered all the hair loss, but little by little. I bought this to see if it would help but did not try it that frequently. Recently, however, I started to apply it at my widows peak and temples where there was hardly any hair left at all and about 2 weeks later, i have a lot of 2 in long baby hairs in both locations. I know they say that the hair loss is just because your body is catching up to all the hair you did not lose during your pregnancy, but I am skeptical about that. My doctor said that I would have had a thinning hair problem irregardless of having a baby, but I really disagree with this. I had very thick hair all my life and even did Accutane and survived that crazy hair loss without any noticeable thinning on my scalp (and that was a lot of hair loss). The hair loss with pregnancy I experienced was unreal! I intend to continue using this and hope that I can get my full head of hair back soon! On a side note, I did ask my doctor about how to try to avoid the hair loss if I have another baby and she said that if I go back onto hormonal BC after 3 months of nursing, that will definitely help. It&#x27;s the lack of the pregnancy hormones that signals your body to start shedding. And most moms go off of any hormonal birth control indefinitely because they are nursing. But my doctor said that it is safe to go back on after 3 months. I intend to try this the next time around and see if this can also prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all.  This also dried out my hair and made it hard.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> My Nioxin hair booster was just as expected.  I was unable to buy it locally so was happy to get it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser commented that I had a lot of new hair growth on the top of my head &amp; she didn&#x27;t know that I was using this product - started showing about a month into using it. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It is a good product as I still have hair on the top of my head,</li>
    <li> I have been using this Nioxin product for a number of years in combination with their shampoo/conditioner products and medically prescribed Propescia. As a result I have been able to retain a good head of hair at my age when my family heritage predicted male pattern baldness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for quite some time on a thinning area above forehead (female).  Lost all hair during cheomotherapy and was told hair grows in thicker afterwards but wanted to give that area a real boost as hair grows in.  Have a way to go but looks like that area is responding - still a little thinner than the rest but not near as barren as before.  Must be consistent - every day as directed.</li>
    <li> In less than 2 month, my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;tonsure&amp;#34; was covered with hair...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still in disbelief.... all our friends and family are asking if he got a hair transplant</li>
    <li> great my hair feels moist, too early to tell,,I will let you now the results after a month</li>
    <li> The product I purchased from Bargains by Ben is not authentic and caused dandruff. I compared this product to one I purchased from Great Clips salon. This product smells similar, however the consistency is different. I tried contacting the vendor and was basically given the brush off. I do not recommend purchases by this vendor.</li>
    <li> I am 23 years old and have always had a thick head of hair. It is naturally curly, but I wear it straight all the time. Heat damage, combined with 30lb weight loss, and finishing up my masters degree, all began to take a toll on my hair. Three months after I graduated and moved to a new state to start a new job, and basically a new life...my hair was shedding like crazy. I was afraid to shower. I had no bounce to my hair and my scalp was full of dandriff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister told me about Nioxin products since it worked for her when she had hair loss due to planning her wedding and after she had a baby. I used the shampoo and conditioner coupled with 10,000 mcg of Biotin and 4 months later my hair feels thicker, is shinier, has that bounce, and now I see new growth along my scap that stick straight up after I blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My crown-line still need a little help. You can see a little scalp, but it is not terribly noticiable. I am hopeful that this product will fill in these areas quicker than just using the other nioxin products. When I put it on it gives the area with low density some volume so that is a plus too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wheather you are struggling with the beginnings of hair thinning or extreme hair loss--stick with Nioxin products. I promise it nips your hair problems right away. Less shedding, less breakage, and new growth all with time. Be patient and do not freak out when you lose more hair when you start using Nioxin products. You lose the bad and grow in new thick and healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay patient!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner by the same company. I have been using the system since about February 2014 and I DO see results including an area where I USED to have a fairly sizable bald spot. That spot is almost completely filled in with new hair now that started growing after about 4 months of product usage. In June I started to see new hairs growing elsewhere on my scalp where it had been thinning. It&#x27;s not mid november and the hairs in the previously thinning areas are now about 2 inches long. The hairs where the bald spot used to be are now about 1&amp;#34; to 1.5&amp;#34; long and growing. I was skeptical but this product DOES work and was recommended by the person who cuts my hair. You have to be patient though and use it consistently. It&#x27;s not instant hair like in the Hollywood movies.</li>
    <li> I had tried smaller bottles of this before.  It absolutely does what it is made to do -- BOOST the follicles of the hair.  I had some thinning around the edges of my hairline and after about a month or so . . . POOF!!!  It worked!!  If skeptical, don&#x27;t be . . . it absolutely does what it is created to do.  I ordered the large size because there is not much product in the smaller bottles.  The larger size gives you more for the money.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the nioxin scalp treatment to grow my hair out for my wedding and i have been beyond impressed with the outcome. My edges are growing back in places I haven&#x27;t had hair growth for years!!! I just wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> Not sure it grows hair but, believe it delays the thinning.  Been loyal to it on and off for three years.  Will continue to purchase through Amazon going forward</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple weeks now and my wife and I are both starting to see a major difference.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and this is the best price around.  Arrived earlier than anticipated.  I have been using this product for a while now in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this product ((along with other nioxin hair products)) I started it for almost 2 moths...I noticed good result on my hair...&lt;br /&gt;please note that I used nexion system 6+ scalp treatment + other brands so the result on my hair is the result of all my combination not specifically from this product, the results on me were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- my hair fall less (much less) than before ... I got this product because I have rich history in losing hair 2-3 times per years especially following a stressful life events and the worse part that only 50-60% of my hair will re-grow back again, thus year by year my hair get thinner and thinner... this time I approached this product immediately after I noticed my hair falls and YES IT WORKED and hair falls less, almost stopped&lt;br /&gt;2- Hair feels stronger... I have very fragile hair I never treated it chemically and very minimally I use thermal treatment; however, now I use iron + hair blower more often and didn&#x27;t notice any hair damage&lt;br /&gt;3- Thicker hair... even my sisters and husband noted this effect.. finally something to help my hair to re-grow back still using and will continue it to see the overall result cause I still have some emptiness in my scalp&lt;br /&gt;The smell: very distinguishable ... I didn&#x27;t like the smell, very strong and smells like treatment or medicine but doesn&#x27;t causes me nausea or something I can tolerate it&lt;br /&gt;recommed using it with nexion system (shampoo and conditionor)&lt;br /&gt;The price: very affordable&lt;br /&gt;I used a mixture of different nioxin products and I&#x27;ve seen a good result hope to get even better and thicker&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfaction: very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, try it out it may work for you at least will stop the falling</li>
    <li> Have been using about a month now and really don&#x27;t see any results.  I use the Nioxin 6 shampoo and conditioner then the Booster and volumizing spray after. Not sure it if is doing anything ans is a bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Also the directions stink.  just say put it on without direction on HOW MUCH to apply.  One pump, two pump three...  A bit of direction here would be nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months now-- I&#x27;m not sure it is working as well as I&#x27;d like, but it seems to be slowing or stopping the loss of hair.  So, this is a plus</li>
    <li> Great  products! I was seriously losing my hair at a scary rapid rate and my hair is already fine &amp; thin. I had a grandmother, an aunt &amp; a sister suffer from baldness, they had some hair but very, very little. I&#x27;m not just fighting genetics but pre menopausal  as well, with a stressful job. I&#x27;ve started their line a long with the Hair Booster (LOVE this stuff) and scalp treatment. Not only has my hair loss stopped, but growing some back!</li>
    <li> I have been Using this product for months and honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed any results. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin Hair Booster doesn&#x27;t completely stop the hair from falling out; it just slows down the the process.  With this product I also use the system 2 product and avoid smoking or drinking, which really seems to help.  There is definitely less hair coming off in my hands as I was my hair.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product</li>
    <li> useless! not really seeing any difference after a year of usage.</li>
    <li> does seem to help my thinning hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 1/2 months twice/day.  My hair dresser recommended it because my hairline was receding and I was starting to lose more hair each time I washed it.  I have definitely noticed less hair loss, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth yet.  I will continue to use twice/daily for awhile longer and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 2 months and have not yet seen a difference in my hair....Will continue to use it until I use it up and if I do not see results will discontinue use.....</li>
    <li> My hair is so thin and falls out due to medicines I have to take. I tried Nioxin Intensive Therapy Hair Booster as well as the shampoo and conditioner upon the recommendation of a dear friend.  I had no positive results with the products and could not recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Even my hairdresser noticed a real difference just in this past few weeks of regular usage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Intensive Therapy Hair Booster for years.  I still have a head of hair.  Because of the product image, I thought the bottle did not come with a pump, but it does.  Thinking it did not come with a pump, I bought it at W**mart with a pump, and it was twice the cost as this site.</li>
    <li> No complaints it works</li>
    <li> This product puts shine in my dry hair, and adds some volume too. I would recommend this to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
</ol>
