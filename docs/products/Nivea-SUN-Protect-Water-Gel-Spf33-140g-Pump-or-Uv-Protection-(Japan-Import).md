      <li>The packaging is also quite nice with the pump.</li>
      <li>Up until now, I&#x27;ve been a hardcore mineral sunscreen girl just because I like that zinc oxide is effective on blocking wavelengths in the UVA spectrum</li>
      <li>I heard many nice things about this sunscreen, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this.</li>
      <li>I love the pump bottle.</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth feeling after application.  </li>
      <li>But I love having an alternative for my body that I don&#x27;t mind putting on every morning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>wish there was more product in this.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even any more tan than I was when I started the trip.</li>
      <li>I use it before I leave the house, but if I could find a way to close it or cap it, it would be much more helpful.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff and recommend It to friends all the time.</li>
      <li>This is a lightweight sunscreen and very suitable for hot weather in summer.</li>
      <li>This is why I love Japanese sunscreens -- the texture of this product is incredible.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen; not drying and goes on clear and refreshing.</li>
      <li>This sun screen is effective and super light weight.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is like a light weight lotion, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>Light and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>It soaks into my skin so quickly and easily that i dont have to rub it forever for it to soak in.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gel-like cream that goes on SO easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>The protection is good enough for the rating.</li>
      <li>I can easily put it on before I go out in the hot Houston weather.</li>
      <li>A watery gel, like the name, that dries quickly, leaving my skin moisturized and with NO feeling of stickiness.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, very watery.</li>
      <li>Worth the $$.</li>
      <li>but as I&#x27;d use it everywhere, I went through the bottle super fast.</li>
      <li>product is quite refreshing, actually.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen for daily use on my arms and neck.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this until I can find a bigger bottle :)</li>
      <li>Unlike other sunscreens, it has a nice lotion texture.</li>
      <li>It works very well, the only problem is that I have not been able to close the pump dispenser so I can put it in my bag for going to the beach.  </li>
      <li>The price is pretty reasonable too.</li>
      <li>I used this up really fast.</li>
      <li>Overall a great buy, will last quite a while even with daily use.</li>
      <li>Very watery.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of a lightweight gel instead of heavy cream.....</li>
      <li>I always wish Japanese sunscreens came in larger sizes, but it&#x27;s worth it to not deal with strong smelling, white-cast sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Can not say much about the actual sunscreen effect, because I just use it for mild outdoor activities.</li>
      <li>It also has decent moisturizing properties which is a plus.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light, has no perfume, and has no real smell to talk about.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get this in the local stores as the Japanese formulations are different and far superior to any of the American ones, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>but this one is gentle and won&#x27;t cause any redness after I re-apply it several times!</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Non-irrating, light, moisturizing and leaves no white cast on African American skin.</li>
      <li>This is a basic sunscreen, most japanese sunscreen is in this form, thin and liquidy, with a yellowish/greenish tint, have no scent, easy to spread, I only use this while I&#x27;m indoor or are not exposed to heavy sunlight or engaging in sport, because this is not waterproof</li>
      <li>The bottle was quite small and would be appropriate if it were for the face only....</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a clear gel, as my boyfriend has a beard and every time he would apply sunscreen I would laugh when I saw all the white-almost purple tinted SPF cream trapped in his beard-</li>
      <li>is a super lightweight, refreshing gel that sinks in instantly and leaves no trace of chemical odor, white cast, tackiness or other unpleasant side effects of most body sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I can barely feel it on my skin.</li>
      <li>(A nice change from traditional occlusive, suffocating</li>

<li> Not sure about if it works on keep me from being darker.</li>
<li> so my arms are usually quite darker than my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> it&#x27;s difficult to evenly spread a thick SPF into thick facial hair!</li>
<li> Takes to long to get it and very expensive.</li>
<li> Goes on thin, works well.</li>
<li> but I HATED the application and texture of mineral sunscreens and never trusted it not to be immediately wiped off or sweated off.</li>

    <li> I use this sunscreen on my arms and on my neck everyday since I wear tank tops / sleeveless almost year round so my arms are usually quite darker than my face.&lt;br /&gt;This is a super lightweight, refreshing gel that sinks in instantly and leaves no trace of chemical odor, white cast, tackiness or other unpleasant side effects of most body sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;This is everything that I wanted the Lubriderm lotion to be. I will continue to buy this until I can find a bigger bottle :)&lt;br /&gt;I use a stronger sunscreen on my face. But I love having an alternative for my body that I don&#x27;t mind putting on every morning.&lt;br /&gt;This product is quite refreshing, actually. (A nice change from traditional occlusive, suffocating sunscreens)&lt;br /&gt;If you hate the look and feel of sunscreen, if you live in a hot and humid climate and have to wear sunscreen daily, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a clear gel, as my boyfriend has a beard and every time he would apply sunscreen I would laugh when I saw all the white-almost purple tinted SPF cream trapped in his beard- it&#x27;s difficult to evenly spread a thick SPF into thick facial hair! So I was on the hunt for a thin, clear gel like SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thin, and did disappear into his beard much better than regular white SPF lotions and creams... but not exactly how I had hoped.</li>
    <li> So it is winter but it still got up to 90+ degrees this weekend on my camping trip. This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s a gel-like cream that goes on SO easily and absorbs quickly. It also has decent moisturizing properties which is a plus. I applied generous amounts every morning to face and body and reapplied every 3-4 hours on my arms and legs (there was a lot of shrubbery to trek through and boulders to climb. I was concerned some of the sunscreen may have wiped off). Was out in the sun with very little shade for two days from sunrise to sunset. No sunburns in sight and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even any more tan than I was when I started the trip. Up until now, I&#x27;ve been a hardcore mineral sunscreen girl just because I like that zinc oxide is effective on blocking wavelengths in the UVA spectrum but I HATED the application and texture of mineral sunscreens and never trusted it not to be immediately wiped off or sweated off. This will now be my go-to sunscreen for being in the sun for extended periods of time.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Very watery. Not heavy at all. I can&#x27;t even feel it on my skin. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I will definitely be repurchasing this sunscreen. It absorbs quickly, has no scent, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on the skin. The packaging is also quite nice with the pump. I absolutely love this stuff and recommend It to friends all the time. The price is pretty reasonable too.</li>
    <li> I heard many nice things about this sunscreen, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this. The price isn&#x27;t very attractive, but it feels so good on my skin.

    <li> It&#x27;s really light, has no perfume, and has no real smell to talk about. The protection is good enough for the rating.</li>
    <li> Non-irrating, light, moisturizing and leaves no white cast on African American skin. The bottle lasts me about a year. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth feeling after application.  Takes to long to get it and very expensive.</li>
    <li> All &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; NIVEA products are gooood! This sun screen is effective and super light weight. I also like the pump, its so mass-free and easier to use. I have really sensitive skin but this one is gentle and won&#x27;t cause any redness after I re-apply it several times!</li>
    <li> Not very useful as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is still good, I use it both on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to protect my skin. Not sure about if it works on keep me from being darker.</li>
    <li> While this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t hold up well with water, it&#x27;s price and lightness definitely make up for it. After waiting 10 minutes, i can&#x27;t even tell I have it on!</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever tried, I have been using Japan suncream for the last 2 years, this is the best, does not irritate my face at all.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for daily use on my arms and neck. I use SPF50 on my face or else this would be great too. It&#x27;s so lightweight and easy to apply. I love the pump bottle. I always wish Japanese sunscreens came in larger sizes, but it&#x27;s worth it to not deal with strong smelling, white-cast sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I used this up really fast. I liked the idea of a lightweight gel instead of heavy cream.....but I&#x27;m still unsure if this gives the same sun damage protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was more product in this. The bottle was quite small and would be appropriate if it were for the face only....but as I&#x27;d use it everywhere, I went through the bottle super fast.</li>
    <li> It works very well, the only problem is that I have not been able to close the pump dispenser so I can put it in my bag for going to the beach.  I use it before I leave the house, but if I could find a way to close it or cap it, it would be much more helpful.  (btw, I do know how to close and open the pump type dispensers but this one has baffled me).</li>
    <li> It is not greasy at all. It is like a light weight lotion, and absorbs very quickly. I can barely feel it on my skin. I can easily put it on before I go out in the hot Houston weather. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Goes on thin, works well. I use it in my toddler and we are repeat customers.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen; not drying and goes on clear and refreshing. Can&#x27;t get this in the local stores as the Japanese formulations are different and far superior to any of the American ones, in my opinion. Worth the $$.</li>
    <li> This is why I love Japanese sunscreens -- the texture of this product is incredible. A watery gel, like the name, that dries quickly, leaving my skin moisturized and with NO feeling of stickiness. I have dry and sensitive skin, but I do not find this sunscreen drying or irritating at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried!  no oily feel, no white cast, hardly detectable scent.  It soaks into my skin so quickly and easily that i dont have to rub it forever for it to soak in.  I only wish it came in larger bottles!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, very watery. Like it.</li>
    <li> Wish it was waterproof.  Light and non-greasy.  Biggest Japanese sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> Works well. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a basic sunscreen, most japanese sunscreen is in this form, thin and liquidy, with a yellowish/greenish tint, have no scent, easy to spread, I only use this while I&#x27;m indoor or are not exposed to heavy sunlight or engaging in sport, because this is not waterproof so if you sweat a lot you have to reapply. This does contain hyaluronic acid as the moisturizing ingredients, but doesn&#x27;t contain any antioxidant. The way to use this is I do one pump and pat onto my facial skin and neck, and do another pump and cover both of my forearm and back of hand. This is weightless, after drying you won&#x27;t feel a thing on your skin. The bottle came with a plastic cap so after using you can put the cap back on to prevent accidental spilling/personal hygiene or carry with you in your bag. Overall a great buy, will last quite a while even with daily use.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight sunscreen and very suitable for hot weather in summer. I would purchase again. Shipping took a bit too long.</li>
