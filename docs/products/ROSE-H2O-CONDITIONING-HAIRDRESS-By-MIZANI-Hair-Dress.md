      <li>This hairdress smells so good and is a very good moisturizer,  Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not your grandmother&#x27;s rose smell.  </li>
      <li>and I personally liked the smell of roses.  </li>
      <li>and my hair is nicely hydrated.  </li>
      <li>The smell is fresh and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I think the Mizani has more penetration than the mango butter</li>

      <li>Great product I live by!</li>
      <li>The h20 hairdressing is a good product, however, when I received this particular one, the product had seperate in the container!</li>
      <li>I did not like this at first because I love QP Elasta Mango Butter and comparing the two the mango butter seemed to hydrate my hair better when curly.  </li>
      <li>Really light.</li>
      <li>Never disappointed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>I over processed my hair with a bleaching agent and it was tremendously damaged.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long, but my hair is looking even more healthier.</li>
      <li>and I bought it from the salon for twice as much</li>
      <li>The smell of it is okay with me and like other reviewers have stated it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it was an old product!</li>
      <li>It is perfect for my thick, ethnic hair, but too heavy for one of my daughter&#x27;s mixed race hair.</li>
      <li>a little strong in the odor department.</li>
      <li>I received it quickly and the quality was as expected.</li>
      <li>It is very pricy and not something I can afford to use daily at that price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for over a year.  </li>
      <li>my hair my really soft and not sticky and no build up</li>
      <li>It completely tames and moisturizes my hair.</li>
      <li>I can really load it into my hair and let my hair dry</li>
      <li>In fact, I lost more than 1/2 of my long thick hair</li>
      <li>Gives a soft, relaxed look to my natural hair when I blow dry it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is back soft again and my edges are growing back.</li>
      <li>and my hair has the same shine towards the end if the week it would have had at the beginning and eliminates frequent use of the flat iron.</li>
      <li>I have very dry hair and have used varying products in the hope of keeping my hair moisturized and soft.  </li>
      <li>that if you use too much, it can leave your hair a little greasy.  </li>

    <li> Excellent product! Received on time,great price.</li>
    <li> The h20 hairdressing is a good product, however, when I received this particular one, the product had seperate in the container! I hv not used it infact, I can&#x27;t used it. Mixing it is not an option bc of how badly it seperate! I blame the shipper! Perhaps it was an old product!</li>
    <li> I did not like this at first because I love QP Elasta Mango Butter and comparing the two the mango butter seemed to hydrate my hair better when curly.  I make a mix on my hair when putting it into a bun of Eco Styler gel and the mango butter.  I flat ironed my hair and it felt really dry and the ends were crunchy so I put this around my edges and on my ends and let it sit for a little while before styling...my hair my really soft and not sticky and no build up and I haven&#x27;t had to apply any more of this for over a week and my hair is nicely hydrated.  I think the Mizani has more penetration than the mango butter and I personally liked the smell of roses.  It&#x27;s not your grandmother&#x27;s rose smell.  Really light.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product for very long, but my hair is looking even more healthier. The seller also delivered my product almost immediately! I have very pleased.</li>
    <li> Product is all that I expected it to be.  It is excellent for keeping hair and scalp moisturized.</li>
    <li> I received it quickly and the quality was as expected.</li>
    <li> Arrived when they said it would. Has a beautiful smell and doesn&#x27;t give that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Greatest hair  moisturizer ever!!!  you get no greasy after effect.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Been using it for years  Would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Great product - have used for years.  Never disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 10 years. I love it. I seem to be struggling to find it in local stores for some reason, which is why I turned to Amazon. It is perfect for my thick, ethnic hair, but too heavy for one of my daughter&#x27;s mixed race hair.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of grease.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a little applied to the scalp will do.</li>
    <li> I recently started back using Mizani products. My hair was badly damage from a previous product that I was using. My niece was using it and reminded me how my hair was when I was using Mizani then. As soon as I started using this I could tell an immediate difference in my hair. My hair is back soft again and my edges are growing back. The smell of it is okay with me and like other reviewers have stated it doesn&#x27;t take much. I use a little on my hair after I shampoo and before I wrap it. I also took a little and added it to a daily hair oil conditioner I am using to oil my scalp once or twice a week depending on my mood!</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product.  My hair is beautiful.</li>
    <li> great product! I&#x27;ve been useing it for years on my dredlocks</li>
    <li> Great product I live by!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product,  excellent moisturizer and give the hair a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> I love this product...... Will recommend to others!  My hairstylist suggested I use it and it has been a joy,</li>
    <li> A great buy and a wonderful product.  Great price and expedient service.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It completely tames and moisturizes my hair. Gives a soft, relaxed look to my natural hair when I blow dry it.  This is significant because although I do not have a perm in my hair, Rose H2O makes my hair look and feel like I do.</li>
    <li> Love it! Keeps hair moisterized!</li>
    <li> I used a lot of moisturizes before this one and once i started using it, i Never used another product. I haven&#x27;t had a perm in over 3 years. My hair stylist suggested that I use Mizani products and I absolutely LOVE them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over a year.  I have very dry hair and have used varying products in the hope of keeping my hair moisturized and soft.  This is the one product that has successfully done that.  It keeps my hair looking healthy, moisturized and shiny.  If your hair is very thick, like mine, I think you&#x27;ll truly appreciate this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the best time to use the product is after a co-wash/shampoo.  I can really load it into my hair and let my hair dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that if you use too much, it can leave your hair a little greasy.  Therefore, I use it in the mornings, which allows my hair time to fully absorb it through the course of the day. In the mornings, I like to add a leave-in conditioner, which has greatly reduced my split ends and frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to wear a satin cap at night, which keeps the moisture in your hair without getting the product on any linens.  I do this now and am not experiencing any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the aroma.  It smells of old-fashioned roses, which I like.  It is now part of my regular regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t tell, I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I using have dry ends because my hair is short and I gym daily forcing me to use the flat iron to get back the sheen from earlier in the week. With this product I use it once a week and my hair has the same shine towards the end if the week it would have had at the beginning and eliminates frequent use of the flat iron. Love this!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It keep my hair from looking so dry and I even use this product on my lil boys.</li>
    <li> Great purchase!! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> This is the only line that I use.  This hairdress smells so good and is a very good moisturizer,  Thanks</li>
    <li> Light, creamy and smells wonderful.Left my hair feeling hydrated and shiny, not gummy or tacky. It is very pricy and not something I can afford to use daily at that price. The fragrance is not over powering.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like. Iwould not order again. didn&#x27;t like the smell.. My daughter like it. she said she will order this. I gave it to her.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I over processed my hair with a bleaching agent and it was tremendously damaged. In fact, I lost more than 1/2 of my long thick hair&lt;br /&gt;:&#x27; (  My hairdresser recommended this and I bought it from the salon for twice as much so this is a good price. It keeps it moist and strenghtens it a lot. My hair is slowing coming back. The smell is fresh and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Delivered in timely manner.</li>
    <li> a little strong in the odor department.</li>
