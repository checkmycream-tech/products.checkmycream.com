      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Lisa in administration is a joy to deal with and offered me many tips to promote younger looking skin.</li>
      <li>Better than that even, because I never knew something could work so fast, and be so effective.</li>
      <li>Dr. Jacobs transforming serum is fantastic.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Jacobs is a smooth talker using $5.00 words.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
      <li>I have tried many different serums and face creams and this is by far the best!!</li>
      <li>The serum makes my skin smooth and reduces the wrinkles.</li>
      <li>My makeup goes on smoothly over it.  </li>
      <li>I cannot say this product in and of itself makes any significant improvements for me.  </li>
      <li>My crows feet have diminished and the skin under my eyes is significantly tightened.  </li>

      <li>I am 100% pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The best part is that I have seen quite a dramatic change in my fine lines and wrinkles on my face.</li>
      <li>This is a stellar serum!</li>
      <li>I do admire it, but I prefer to admire it on my face, and enjoy the benefits of random smiles, unexpected cheerful hellos, and the joy of my own reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It actually works and your face looks and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>your money and buy fresh fruit and spring water.</li>
      <li>I tried this for a month, right before I could return to ShopNBC.  </li>
      <li>While the application of this product feels good, it did absolutely nothing for my wrinkles nor my minor pigmentation issues.  </li>
      <li>OK, this is going to sound like an exaggeration, but I look in the mirror one week later and see a face more than 10 years younger.</li>
      <li>I still have the same very fine wrinkles as when I started but am now convinced that the company is first rate.  </li>
      <li>The procedure couldn&#x27;t be better; again, but only my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The procedure couldn&#x27;t be better; again, but only my opinion.    </li>
      <li>I want to do what I can to ensure that I will be able to buy this for a long time to come.</li>
      <li>have believed for a long time that if a product is going to work, that it will produce the most dramatic results right off the bat no matter who you are and no matter what the product; because at the beginning you need it most, and have the most improvement to achieve.</li>
      <li>I control how much I put on, and how often.</li>
      <li>For the price of this product, I REALLY regret my purchase.  </li>
      <li>and I have no idea how one product could help so much</li>
      <li>I control how much I put on, and how often.</li>
      <li>It works better at keeping my face clear than the prescription medications I used prior to buying this product.  </li>
      <li>Well this one time, finally, I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>After just three weeks of using Visco-Elastic, my face looks and feels significantly smoother and younger.  </li>
      <li>I have been thinking for a few days how will I write this review, because I have to say something that people will believe, but I can&#x27;t come up with anything strong enough that is believable.</li>
      <li>I do notice my skin tone is more even over all and the circles under my eyes are less puffy.</li>
      <li>it went one smoothly, the skin felt soft refreshed calmed and looked younger.</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;d rather enjoy youthful skin in my reality - in my mirror, and in my life than envy complexions that don&#x27;t even exist at all except only in a makeup-and-spackled manufactured reality that others present as something to be admired.</li>
      <li>The first night I used it the next morning</li>
      <li>and, I have been told, helps me look considerably younger than my real age which is unlisted!</li>
      <li>I happen to live near Dr Jacobs office,  but had purchased the product via Amazon.</li>
      <li>My skin has calmed down significantly.</li>
      <li>I do no recommend this product for women with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have been considering a professional face peel and/or dermabrasion and/or</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>In those low-light, high-contrast reflections I have tried not to look at for the last 5 years, the craggy skin under my cheekbones is gone, the saggy cheeks are firming, the bags under my eyes are now mostly a memory revealed only by fine lines that belie their previous existence, and the lines diminish daily as the skin on the rest of my face tightens in all directions and pulls taught, as if a million tiny surgeons were pulling each pore smaller from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only 37 and have a baby face with the beginning signs of aging around the eyes and some minor laugh lines.  </li>
      <li>I bought it based on other positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re going to want it later so that you can truly appreciate how far your skin has come.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re going to want it later so that you can truly appreciate how far your skin has come.</li>
      <li>I committed myself days ago to write something that does justice to the results I have seen in a mere week of using this product because... to be honest...</li>
      <li>I have in the past read so many rave reviews about so many other skin care products, bought them, and seen such minimal improvements for such expense that I usually give up the treatment within a month or two.</li>
      <li>Well I used it for a week and had to stop due to the adult acne I have developed on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Because this product, at least for me, has been a dream come true.</li>
      <li>We love the philosophy behind Dr Jacobs product - to find what has been used in the past - in ancient Egyptian times - and bring it up to date with a modern approach.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We loved the product - it went one smoothly, the skin felt soft refreshed calmed and looked younger. The effect lasted longer than some of the other traditional skin care products (La Mer Creme - Strivectin) we had used in the past.    We love the philosophy behind Dr Jacobs product - to find what has been used in the past - in ancient Egyptian times - and bring it up to date with a modern approach.</li>
    <li> I find that this cream tightens the area around my eyes and helps to minimize the lines around my lips. It doesn&#x27;t make me look twenty again but it does help me to look the best that I can for my age and, I have been told, helps me look considerably younger than my real age which is unlisted!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it. I believe is a good product but I&#x27;ll find out when my wife tells me she has seen a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using Stanley Jacobs MD Visco-Elastic Transforming Serum for three weeks, and am very pleased!  I can&#x27;t use any products with retinoic acids in them because they make my skin peel after just one application -- but this serum doesn&#x27;t do that.  In addition to seeing a reduction in wrinkles around my eyes, I&#x27;ve also noticed I&#x27;m not breaking out AT ALL, so I think it&#x27;s helping with my acne-prone skin as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! If I can help it I will never be without it. I am amazed that after 4 weeks I actually think I may not have blemishes when I&#x27;m ninety! My skin has calmed down significantly. Now I&#x27;m getting my ance prone son his own supply, so he will leave mine alone! Dr. Jacobs thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different serums and face creams and this is by far the best!! After just three weeks of using Visco-Elastic, my face looks and feels significantly smoother and younger.  I am 100% pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had been using Visco-Elastic Transforming Serum for several months.  My skin just keeps on getting better and better.  I love the silky feel of the serum.  My makeup goes on smoothly over it.  My crows feet have diminished and the skin under my eyes is significantly tightened.  People keep telling me how great I look.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Ok.  I&#x27;m only 37 and have a baby face with the beginning signs of aging around the eyes and some minor laugh lines.  While the application of this product feels good, it did absolutely nothing for my wrinkles nor my minor pigmentation issues.  I gave the product a month to see if it was effective or not.  Not!  For the price of this product, I REALLY regret my purchase.  I bought it based on other positive reviews.  I&#x27;m going to attempt to get a refund and if successful, I will update my review and give the company props for customer service.  I may end up going the botox or cool touch laser route.  Wish me luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m updating my review as the company called me today stating they would refund my money.  It&#x27;s been a long time since I finished the bottle.  I took pictures and documented everything.  It just does not work for me.  I seem to be in the minority here.  I still have the same very fine wrinkles as when I started but am now convinced that the company is first rate.  Lisa in administration is a joy to deal with and offered me many tips to promote younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for about 3 weeks - cannot believe the difference in my skin and in how I look.  this is one of the best kept secrets around.</li>
    <li> Dr. Jacobs transforming serum is fantastic. I have been using this product for about a year. It has erased lines on my neck and upper eyelids. It also raised my eyelids and tightend my neck. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I happen to live near Dr Jacobs office,  but had purchased the product via Amazon. I applied this serum to one side of my face for several months,  then made an appointment to see him. The office manager guessed incorrectly which side I had used it on. Dr  Jacobs himself had to step forward within a foot from me to guess.  I cannot say this product in and of itself makes any significant improvements for me.  I&#x27;m fair skinned, in my mid forties.  I drove a convertible for 20 years, so it&#x27;s not like I have pristine skin that needs no improvement.   I challenge anyone who buys any anti-aging  product to try it on one side of the face.  It&#x27;s the only objective way to see if the product makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care product I have ever used.  It works better at keeping my face clear than the prescription medications I used prior to buying this product.  That is an added bonus which I didn&#x27;t expect. The serum makes my skin smooth and reduces the wrinkles. My family and friends have noticed the difference. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 weeks. Since I am probably older than the average user, I don&#x27;t expect miracles. That is why I&#x27;m only giving it a 4. I do notice my skin tone is more even over all and the circles under my eyes are less puffy. I do plan on reordering. So far, this is the best product I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a stellar serum! It is silky smooth, applies beautifully and has a lovely fresh scent. The best part is that I have seen quite a dramatic change in my fine lines and wrinkles on my face. The texture of my skin appears and feels healthier. People have commented on the healthy glow that I have. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only 1 week and I have no idea how one product could help so much but it does. I have been thinking for a few days how will I write this review, because I have to say something that people will believe, but I can&#x27;t come up with anything strong enough that is believable. Because this product, at least for me, has been a dream come true. Better than that even, because I never knew something could work so fast, and be so effective. I have been considering a professional face peel and/or dermabrasion and/or laser resurfacing for almost 10 years, but haven&#x27;t had the nerve to subject my face to something that could, should something go wrong, be so devastating. I have very thin skin, so any treatment I choose I have to consider very carefully. It is also difficult to schedule recovery times, not to mention the expense. Well, with this one product, I have found the answer. Again, at least for me, because there might be people that it might not work for; it seems however that I am the person that the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product (whatever it is) never works for. I have in the past read so many rave reviews about so many other skin care products, bought them, and seen such minimal improvements for such expense that I usually give up the treatment within a month or two. Not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have believed for a long time that if a product is going to work, that it will produce the most dramatic results right off the bat no matter who you are and no matter what the product; because at the beginning you need it most, and have the most improvement to achieve. Well this one time, finally, I was not disappointed. To say the least, I am stunned. OK, this is going to sound like an exaggeration, but I look in the mirror one week later and see a face more than 10 years younger. In those low-light, high-contrast reflections I have tried not to look at for the last 5 years, the craggy skin under my cheekbones is gone, the saggy cheeks are firming, the bags under my eyes are now mostly a memory revealed only by fine lines that belie their previous existence, and the lines diminish daily as the skin on the rest of my face tightens in all directions and pulls taught, as if a million tiny surgeons were pulling each pore smaller from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable. Truly an unbelievable event in my 53-year-old face, which is fooling me now with its youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s expensive. And I don&#x27;t care if I have to cancel my cable television for the rest of my life to afford one of these every month if that&#x27;s what it takes (I don&#x27;t know how long the bottle lasts yet.) Because I&#x27;d rather enjoy youthful skin in my reality - in my mirror, and in my life than envy complexions that don&#x27;t even exist at all except only in a makeup-and-spackled manufactured reality that others present as something to be admired. I do admire it, but I prefer to admire it on my face, and enjoy the benefits of random smiles, unexpected cheerful hellos, and the joy of my own reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that overboard? I don&#x27;t care. I committed myself days ago to write something that does justice to the results I have seen in a mere week of using this product because... to be honest... I have a selfish motive. I want to do what I can to ensure that I will be able to buy this for a long time to come. And if I write a review that entices people to buy it, then I will have done what I can to promote sales and help to keep the product on the market. Yes, this review has a purely selfish motive. So, if it&#x27;s too expensive, ask yourself how much you have spent on other facial products over the years, and if you need to, stop buying your creams, your moisturizers, your treatments, even your foundation and your lipstick and save up to buy this, because if it works for you like it works for me, you won&#x27;t care about those any more, because you won&#x27;t need them. This is all I need, and I hope it&#x27;s all you will need too. Oh, maybe a little vitamin Eor pure Aloe Vera might help, because it does sting a little (well it&#x27;s an acid - duh) but I&#x27;m sure nothing like a dermabrasion would have. Neither is it dangerous nor traumatic. I think about how Kenny Roger&#x27;s face was ruined by a cosmetic surgeon. Wow. I&#x27;m nobody and I wouldn&#x27;t want that to happen to me. How terrible for him. That danger is non-existent with this product. I control how much I put on, and how often. The procedure couldn&#x27;t be better; again, but only my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: take a picture before your first application in your worst light. You&#x27;re going to want it later so that you can truly appreciate how far your skin has come. I cringed but I did it. And I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When to stop? (sigh...) how about now...because it does sting a little (well it&#x27;s an acid - duh) but I&#x27;m sure nothing like a dermabrasion would have. Neither is it dangerous nor traumatic.

    <li> This works great particularly on my neck!  I will continue using it and hope that Dr Jacobs does follow up with more products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It actually works and your face looks and feels amazing. Thank you</li>
    <li> Overpriced for what it does</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from shopnbc.  The first night I used it the next morning I noticed small pimples on my cheeks.  I thought that was what it suppose to do.  Well I used it for a week and had to stop due to the adult acne I have developed on my skin.  I do no recommend this product for women with sensitive skin.  It is not designed for our skin type.  I tried to write a review with shopnbc and they would not publish it.  So I am trying amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this for a month, right before I could return to ShopNBC.  It was a good price there.  I wanted it to work,I was on value payments :).  I just did not see any difference.  I wanted to, would have stayed with it, it did nothing</li>
    <li> This product is another scam of alcohol and creams...&lt;br /&gt;Jacobs is a smooth talker using $5.00 words.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy fresh fruit and spring water.</li>
