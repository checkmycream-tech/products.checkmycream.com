      <li>..practice makes perfect!</li>
      <li>very good product[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>works really great and</li>
      <li>My hair tends to droop after a couple of hours but with bumpits, I look good all day.  </li>
      <li>Good one</li>
      <li>The smallest one looked good, but the largest one just looked a lot like snooki/alienist.</li>
      <li>I have had them before but lost them so wanted to get more!</li>
      <li>So their cheap and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
      <li>My wife loves these, liked the fact that 3 sizes came in pack.</li>
      <li>Love how it came to me in about 3 days (Thursday) when they said it would be here on Monday.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure teasing the hair you cover it with would solve that.</li>
      <li>i bought this on a whim, because I&#x27;d seen some women with them in and they looked cute.</li>
      <li>I will never be able to use them.</li>
      <li>I bought these mostly out of curiosity.  </li>
      <li>i LOVE it...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an easy way to change your look.</li>
      <li>This item arrived very quickly and it is exactly as described (includes a handy rat-tail comb).</li>
      <li>I did not find that I had any issues with the bumpits staying in, even on un-teased hair - those teeth do offer a secure hold.</li>
      <li>the look , i think, is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>They do make your hair look fabulous though.</li>
      <li>I have only seen one person successfully pull these off, but if you can, I say go for it.</li>
      <li>Im excited to try all of the sizes out</li>
      <li>I found it very easy to use, it stays on and works decently even without teasing.</li>
      <li>You can try it with so many different styles if you are interested and surprisingly they stay on my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that is not thick.  </li>
      <li>Okay so I was kinda hesitate, to either buy it or now, mainly</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>My girls and I had a fun night parading around in them.</li>
      <li>I really liked that this came with three different sizes.</li>
      <li>Many different styles can be utilized.</li>
      <li>Overall fun and definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Although I have not tried it with teased hair, I can only imagine it would work much better, particularly in terms of hiding the plastic inserts.</li>
      <li>Its very simple and easy to do.</li>
      <li>looks great with hair down or pulled back.</li>
      <li>then I thought, very well packaged, &amp;&amp; as soon as I opened the package I tried it on, &amp;&amp; to my amaze</li>
      <li>, im currently wearing one right now!</li>
      <li>One thing that I think would make this product better is a size in between the very tiny size and the two larger sizes.</li>
      <li>They do not stay in and their use is very dependent on the shape of your head, as they are fixed and therefore not flexible.  </li>
      <li>This product will help you to have a new look.</li>
      <li>when i lay the hair back and over it, it spread out really nicely and stayed put with another few spritzes of spray.</li>
      <li>i have shoulder-length straight hair that&#x27;s so fine that it usually can&#x27;t hold a comb.    </li>
      <li>I used the little one in the front and the medium sized one on top toward the back.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a friend and when she opened it she was excited only to try them and find that they are CLEARLY visible even with her hair pulled over it not to mention even the smallest one is a bit bulky and gives her what we call \\&quot;alien head\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably only use them a couple of times, but they&#x27;re fun to mess around with.</li>
      <li>The little baby one came closest to working, the other ones just didn&#x27;t fit on my head well, the teeth poked through my hair...</li>
      <li>But remember only get it if you have thick to SUPER hair</li>

<li> Sometimes for more casual use, I&#x27;d like a slightly smaller bump.</li>
<li> Also, you need a LOT Of hair to cover them appropriately, no matter how much teasing you do.  </li>
<li> was looking for this product for a long time in my local health and beauty/drug stores.  </li>
<li> The only one I ever use now is the little one to put a bump in my bangs directly in front.</li>
<li> These are cheap &amp; do serve their purpose, but the end result winds up looking a bit silly.</li>
<li> My hair is a medium thickness and long.  </li>
<li> ordered the product and it came earlier than I expected.  </li>
<li> I already have thick hair, but to make this work you need to have super thick hair.</li>
<li> I spent like 20 minutes to learn how to work with them.</li>
<li> online&amp;on youtube theirs a bunch of tutorials on how to put It on, &amp; in the package their are instructions, plus styles on how to use the bumpits, give it a couple of tries</li>
<li> i&#x27;m a complete idiot at styling my hair, so i thought that this would be a disaster, but i&#x27;m always so jealous of girls who can tease their hair up in the back that i really hoped this would give me an edge.</li>
<li> If it were made of a softer more malleable material rather than large hard plastic it might work but for us it was just the worst idea ever.</li>
<li> B002BABHZE Bumpits Dark Brown/Black]]</li>
<li> i parted my hair across, spritzed on some hair spray and teased it just a little with the included comb.</li>
<li> This was a waste of money, It does not work on thin hair, I didn&#x27;t have enough hair to cover the bumpits.</li>
<li> it comes with a small teasing comb, &amp;3bumpits, (small,medium,large)</li>
<li> so it just looks dumb to me, too much poof, and looks awkward.</li>
<li> They are near impossible to use.  </li>
<li> Shes always had a hard time getting her hair to puff up, now she can with the bump</li>
<li> You have to have a lot of thick hair for this to work.  </li>
<li> shockingly, this worked like a charm the very first time i tried it.</li>
<li> I got the look I wanted, even with thin hair.   </li>
<li> it hasn&#x27;t worked for you then your probably doing something wrong, go</li>
<li> But when you wear them they can be really uncomfortable.</li>
<li> /&gt;very disappointed</li>

    <li> was looking for this product for a long time in my local health and beauty/drug stores.  ordered the product and it came earlier than I expected.  works really great and the look , i think, is fantastic.  My hair tends to droop after a couple of hours but with bumpits, I look good all day.  very good product[[ASIN:B002BABHZE Bumpits Dark Brown/Black]]</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a complete idiot at styling my hair, so i thought that this would be a disaster, but i&#x27;m always so jealous of girls who can tease their hair up in the back that i really hoped this would give me an edge. i have shoulder-length straight hair that&#x27;s so fine that it usually can&#x27;t hold a comb.    shockingly, this worked like a charm the very first time i tried it. i parted my hair across, spritzed on some hair spray and teased it just a little with the included comb. i stuck in the bumpit and it actually STAYED. when i lay the hair back and over it, it spread out really nicely and stayed put with another few spritzes of spray. i LOVE it...looks great with hair down or pulled back.</li>
    <li> Love how it came to me in about 3 days (Thursday) when they said it would be here on Monday. Im excited to try all of the sizes out, im currently wearing one right now! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use for my Audrey Hepburn updo for Halloween. It worked perfectly. I used the little one in the front and the medium sized one on top toward the back. I was very happy with the results. I got the look I wanted, even with thin hair.   One thing that I think would make this product better is a size in between the very tiny size and the two larger sizes. Sometimes for more casual use, I&#x27;d like a slightly smaller bump.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money, It does not work on thin hair, I didn&#x27;t have enough hair to cover the bumpits.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. They arrived promptly, well packaged. Shes always had a hard time getting her hair to puff up, now she can with the bump it product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought these mostly out of curiosity.  They are near impossible to use.  They do not stay in and their use is very dependent on the shape of your head, as they are fixed and therefore not flexible.  Also, you need a LOT Of hair to cover them appropriately, no matter how much teasing you do.  I will never be able to use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and when she opened it she was excited only to try them and find that they are CLEARLY visible even with her hair pulled over it not to mention even the smallest one is a bit bulky and gives her what we call \\&quot;alien head\\&quot;. If it were made of a softer more malleable material rather than large hard plastic it might work but for us it was just the worst idea ever.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these, liked the fact that 3 sizes came in pack. Works as advertised. Many different styles can be utilized.</li>
    <li> I like these. I have had them before but lost them so wanted to get more! Its very simple and easy to do. And I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them.</li>
    <li> I could not get these to work for my hair.  My hair is a medium thickness and long.  The little baby one came closest to working, the other ones just didn&#x27;t fit on my head well, the teeth poked through my hair...just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> i bought this on a whim, because I&#x27;d seen some women with them in and they looked cute. Well I got mine in the mail and tried it out. I already have thick hair, but to make this work you need to have super thick hair. The smallest one looked good, but the largest one just looked a lot like snooki/alienist. I&#x27;ll probably only use them a couple of times, but they&#x27;re fun to mess around with. My girls and I had a fun night parading around in them. So their cheap and I&#x27;m happy with them. But remember only get it if you have thick to SUPER hair cause you&#x27;ll need it plus tons of hair spray.</li>
    <li> This product will help you to have a new look. You can try it with so many different styles if you are interested and surprisingly they stay on my hair. It&#x27;s really easy to use. I spent like 20 minutes to learn how to work with them. Good one and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> You have to have a lot of thick hair for this to work.  I have very fine hair that is not thick.  I teased a lot and it didn&#x27;t help.....&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed</li>
    <li> I really liked that this came with three different sizes. But when you wear them they can be really uncomfortable. So brace yourself if you buy them. They do make your hair look fabulous though. Pain is beauty sometimes!</li>
    <li> Okay so I was kinda hesitate, to either buy it or now, mainly because I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;believe\\&quot; that it would actually work; but then I decided to give it a try, well it arrived earlier then I thought, very well packaged, &amp;&amp; as soon as I opened the package I tried it on, &amp;&amp; to my amaze yes it did work:D it comes with a small teasing comb, &amp;3bumpits, (small,medium,large), I used it already for a couple of occasions, do I recommend?? YES I DO!&lt;br /&gt;If it hasn&#x27;t worked for you then your probably doing something wrong, go online&amp;on youtube theirs a bunch of tutorials on how to put It on, &amp; in the package their are instructions, plus styles on how to use the bumpits, give it a couple of tries..practice makes perfect!</li>
    <li> This item arrived very quickly and it is exactly as described (includes a handy rat-tail comb). I found it very easy to use, it stays on and works decently even without teasing. Although I have not tried it with teased hair, I can only imagine it would work much better, particularly in terms of hiding the plastic inserts. I did not find that I had any issues with the bumpits staying in, even on un-teased hair - those teeth do offer a secure hold. It may have been nicer if they would&#x27;ve been made of matte instead of shiny plastic, as they can sometimes shine through your hair but I&#x27;m sure teasing the hair you cover it with would solve that. Overall fun and definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> This thing wont even stay in my hair without moving around . Didnt like it at all. You get what you pay for it</li>
    <li> I prefer teasing. Tried to put this in my hair and gave up I am not from jersey so it just looks dumb to me, too much poof, and looks awkward.</li>
    <li> These are cheap &amp; do serve their purpose, but the end result winds up looking a bit silly. I have only seen one person successfully pull these off, but if you can, I say go for it. It&#x27;s an easy way to change your look. The only one I ever use now is the little one to put a bump in my bangs directly in front.</li>
