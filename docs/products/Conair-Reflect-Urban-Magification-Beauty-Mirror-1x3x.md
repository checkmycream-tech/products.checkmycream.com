      <li>I think this mirror is nice</li>
      <li>used it when i got a makeover at a department store, had to get my own and one for my daughter  - now will get one for my step-daughter</li>

      <li>WORKS GOOD WITH A NICE LIGHT OUTPUT.  </li>
      <li>Very light</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it, and I love that I don&#x27;t have to fuss with a cord and can travel with it!</li>
      <li>Love it; does just what I need.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Way better lighting than my bathroom or desk.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>For my first lighted mirror, I think it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
      <li>I have a huge bathroom with a nice vanity area and plenty of light.</li>
      <li>The light is fluorescent which isn&#x27;t the most flattering color of light</li>
      <li>It easily switches between mirror magnification.</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t get into the bathroom, it is easy to put on a shelf or even hold and use.  </li>
      <li>That said, the mirror is fine and not distorted so</li>
      <li>Easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light output, and the ease in which I can collapse it and put it away in a drawer.</li>
      <li>The light could be brighter, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight and fols to fir in my bag when I am away from home.</li>
      <li>It provides okay lighting and good enough magnification for checking plucking the eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Magnification good, make sure you understand how to turn it around and bring it up properly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually right reviews for products I buy, but I LOVE this mirror.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be returning mine and spend a bit more to get exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>For years, I have searched for a perfect travel mirror that was battery lighted, with both 1x magnification and at least 3x magnification.  </li>
      <li>then it&#x27;s a good deal for only 19.99.  </li>
      <li>and I needed something small but bright for my makeup, love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a mirror with a battery powered light, so this is a great find for camping.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t need much magnification and you don&#x27;t mind putting on your makeup in a fluorescent light</li>
      <li>I try to use natural light, but light works in a pinch.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to have it near an electrical outlet to light up.</li>
      <li>Shipping was prompt and appreciated too!</li>
      <li>This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Wish the magnification was higher.</li>
      <li>The light is similar to the &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; light setting on larger plug-in make up mirrors only, not as bright.  </li>
      <li>The mirror pivots on stand but not a lot meaning that you can&#x27;t bend it around as much as desired.  </li>
      <li>so it probably isn&#x27;t supposed to be much).  </li>
      <li>Looks nice, fits on our small glass shelve in bathroom.  </li>
      <li>You actually have to bend over a lot to be able to see your eyes, but it&#x27;s really a minor thing.</li>
      <li>I had ordered a higher magnification, but had to send that back because it was to much</li>
      <li>But overall it&#x27;s a great alternative in poorly lit hotel rooms.</li>
      <li>&amp; I couldn&#x27;t see anything clearly.</li>
      <li>At home, I found the little bit of extra light helpful with some sewing projects but, I would not buy this again.</li>
      <li>The light is not very bright.</li>

<li> Small, lit, and gets the job done.  </li>
<li> The length of the base could be a little bigger, so that the mirror could be over a table</li>
<li> Apparently, my eyes are worst than this strength of magnification can help!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this as a travel make up mirror.  The light is similar to the &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; light setting on larger plug-in make up mirrors only, not as bright.  I ended up just making do with the bathroom lighting at the hotel and gave up trying to use this after the second day.  At home, I found the little bit of extra light helpful with some sewing projects but, I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mirror! I use it everyday. One side is regular, one is magnified. Perfect magnification amount! I had ordered a higher magnification, but had to send that back because it was to much &amp; I couldn&#x27;t see anything clearly. This one is perfect! I can see if there is a lash in my eye, do my eye make up, etc.. Very light so it&#x27;s not bothersome to hold in your hand if you choose to do so while doing your make up. It lights up, which is another added plus. All at a great price! Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Great product, love it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for. It is lighted, but with not cords to plug in. It is light weight and fols to fir in my bag when I am away from home. I like to hang it on the wall to get closer to it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it; does just what I need. I love the fact that the mirror has a magnified side!</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight, portable. Lights could be a tad brighter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a travel mirror. The light is fluorescent which isn&#x27;t the most flattering color of light and it&#x27;s quite bright.  The magnification isn&#x27;t enough for me (although it says 3x so it probably isn&#x27;t supposed to be much).  That said, the mirror is fine and not distorted so it depends on what you want whether or not you&#x27;ll like it. If you don&#x27;t need much magnification and you don&#x27;t mind putting on your makeup in a fluorescent light then it&#x27;s a good deal for only 19.99.  I&#x27;ll be returning mine and spend a bit more to get exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> I think this mirror is nice and I don&#x27;t have to have it near an electrical outlet to light up.</li>
    <li> Provides just enough late and magnification for tabletop close up make up work. It does what it says and it is priced for the quality.</li>
    <li> The mirror pivots on stand but not a lot meaning that you can&#x27;t bend it around as much as desired.  The light could be brighter, but it&#x27;s not.  For me, this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not that great. Doesn&#x27;t magnify like I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually right reviews for products I buy, but I LOVE this mirror. The size and lighting is perfect and the magnifying side is great for grooming eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dorm room.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this mirror.  The magnification and light are both great.  I use this mirror daily.  I also think at the price point, the mirror provides great value.</li>
    <li> used it when i got a makeover at a department store, had to get my own and one for my daughter  - now will get one for my step-daughter</li>
    <li> For years, I have searched for a perfect travel mirror that was battery lighted, with both 1x magnification and at least 3x magnification.  My search is over once I found this one.  It it lightweight and the base folds up for easy packing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great travel mirror - but not intended for every day use.  The light is not very bright.</li>
    <li> It provides okay lighting and good enough magnification for checking plucking the eyebrows. The length of the base could be a little bigger, so that the mirror could be over a table and the person could just sit in a chair and look in the mirror. You actually have to bend over a lot to be able to see your eyes, but it&#x27;s really a minor thing. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was too small...but going from a non lighted mirror to this one was awesome. Way better lighting than my bathroom or desk. I really enjoy it, and I love that I don&#x27;t have to fuss with a cord and can travel with it! For my first lighted mirror, I think it&#x27;s a good one. I will probably upgrade to a bigger one sometime in the future though</li>
    <li> REALLY NICE PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.  WORKS GOOD WITH A NICE LIGHT OUTPUT.  HAVEN&#x27;T HAD TO CHANGE OUT THE BATTERIES YET, AND THE WIFE USES IT EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> Small, lit, and gets the job done.  My wife stores it when not in use.  She can travel with it.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for, I travle a lot and I needed something small but bright for my makeup, love it</li>
    <li> Wish the magnification was higher. But overall it&#x27;s a great alternative in poorly lit hotel rooms.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the purpose of putting in my contacts and doing my makeup while on vacation.  I was hugely disappointed and will be returning it right away, as the &amp;#34;Lifetime guaranteed LED lighting,&amp;#34; is dim and useless-- you&#x27;d get better results from a jar of lightning bugs.</li>
    <li> Magnification good, make sure you understand how to turn it around and bring it up properly.  If you can&#x27;t get into the bathroom, it is easy to put on a shelf or even hold and use.  Looks nice, fits on our small glass shelve in bathroom.  Smaller but works as well as the bigger one upstairs.  I try to use natural light, but light works in a pinch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a mirror with a battery powered light, so this is a great find for camping.  However, it&#x27;s a bit small and dim.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for a bigger brighter one.</li>
    <li> Love it.. But not for the magnification.. Apparently, my eyes are worst than this strength of magnification can help!! ~Not the fault of the mirror! It&#x27;s a great piece. Use it daily to see back of hair view.. Durable.. Easy to keep clean. Shipping was prompt and appreciated too!</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s light output, and the ease in which I can collapse it and put it away in a drawer. It easily switches between mirror magnification. I have to hold it because it is not height adjustable, or hunch over it as it sits on the table.</li>
    <li> Very simple and portable</li>
    <li> I have a huge bathroom with a nice vanity area and plenty of light. I use this mirror for tweezing. I love it. I got one for each of my three daughters. It is a practical little mirror. I recommend it.</li>
