      <li>A great value for the price, though.</li>
      <li>I love it sooo much, awesome product!</li>
      <li>These bobby pins are much better than the ones you can get from your grocery store, but still not the best at holding hair and staying in place.</li>
      <li>I am so much more impressed with these than bobby pins from the drugstore.</li>
      <li>and they are really good for your hair</li>
      <li>a good a</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so good.  </li>
      <li>, I need them and I&#x27;m trying to work with the good ones in the box.</li>
      <li>I know good bobby pins exist, but who sells them?</li>

      <li>I was hoping that these bobby pins would have a superior hold to them.</li>
      <li>I really love this box of bobby pins!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these!</li>

      <li>Really nice bobby pins.</li>
      <li>I never thought I could get excited about bobby pins, but these are great.  </li>
      <li>The 4 stars instead of 5 is because for the box I bought, the coating of the bobby pins comes off very easily.</li>
      <li>Perfect brown color and nearly 800 in a box!</li>
      <li>For being brown, they are fairly neutral and work fine with my &amp;#34;dishwater blonde&amp;#34; hair.</li>
      <li>Price is great but shipping is much more so be aware of that.  </li>
      <li>This are great, they grip hair very well, I don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling.</li>

      <li>They stay really well and have been a great addition to my hair styling products.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE these bobby pins.  </li>
      <li>I am sure these were the bobby pins.  </li>
      <li>Sure?</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;ve had better ones...</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this purchase</li>
      <li>to this I have thrown away many bobby pins.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most are one time use only**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This box will last me awhile - great buy!</li>
      <li>These are MUCH better than the crappy drugstore bobby pins from scunci or goody.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s ok, I can work with it.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s refreshing to do hairstyles I never could before.</li>
      <li>There are so many in here</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it -</li>
      <li>Won&#x27; t be buying more.</li>
      <li>lightyears better than store bought bobby pins.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend, they hold great and stay in place.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>Still worth the buy!!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t lose their shape easily so you can use them many times.</li>
      <li>These baby pins have much better grip and do not slide out of my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Having this many bobby pins come in a box is the best thing ever, we go through so many bobby pins and to have them available all the time due to such a large quantity is awesome!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re strong and easy to use without them bending sideways.  </li>
      <li>I also find that the tips come off easily, which then makes the bobby pin unusable in my opinion since trying to put one in without the protective tip causes the bobby pin to catch and pull on my hair.</li>
      <li>The pins also don&#x27;t stretch out easily so</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many bobby pins I got for such a great price.</li>
      <li>Strong hold.</li>
      <li>Strong hold, didn&#x27;t move throughout the day.</li>
      <li>These are strong Bobby pins that hold intricate hairstyles all day.</li>
      <li>Strong and sturdy-</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but I have LOTS of it</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and most bobby pins won&#x27;t hold my hair because it slips right through them.</li>
      <li>I have a huge problem with losing bobby pins.</li>
      <li>Overall, this was a great purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pound of Bobby pins for cheap.  </li>
      <li>The tips are smooth, though, so no worries about hair breakage.</li>
      <li>, I only waited for 4 days instead of 2 weeks, amazing seller!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Better than drug store brands, but I can tell you they don&#x27;t make them like they used too.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I had high expectations, the reviews seem convincing enough not to try them but these bobby pins are defective, you can not pull them far enough to put your finger through them before they loose the tightness and then they remain wide open, which makes them useless.  In addition, if you try to pull it open it shifts to the left or the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Do to this I have thrown away many bobby pins.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend them?? NO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*plenty of them&lt;br /&gt;*nice brown color&lt;br /&gt;* super tight grip ( I think the tightest grip I&#x27;ve ever had)&lt;br /&gt;* Bobby Pins stay in place all day&lt;br /&gt;* they do stick close to your scalp better than Goody and Vidal Sassoon and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;**You can&#x27;t pull them open far enough to be able to put them on&lt;br /&gt;**Color paint is coming off of them (ALOT) the box has lots of paint chips everywhere&lt;br /&gt;** shifts to the right or left when you try to slip your finger in to open&lt;br /&gt;** The rubber comes off the tip&lt;br /&gt;** Most are one time use only**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THINK THE NEGATIVES ARE REASON NOT TO BUY THEM.  I ignored the negatives reviews myself And look where I&#x27;m at now writing this negative review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I return it ? NO&lt;br /&gt;Because, I need them and I&#x27;m trying to work with the good ones in the box. Average pack in stores is about $3 to $4.00 and you get only (20 total)&lt;br /&gt;This box has (720 BOBBY PINS) for the price I think I might as well keep it and throw away the bad ones as they come up.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could get excited about bobby pins, but these are great.  They&#x27;re strong and easy to use without them bending sideways.  Great color (I have medium-dark brown hair).  Perfect length.  I&#x27;ve used shorter ones but they just don&#x27;t stay put like these.</li>
    <li> I will never run out again.  This are great, they grip hair very well, I don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling.</li>
    <li> These were no stronger than the ones you buy at the grocery store, horrible waist of money. I know good bobby pins exist, but who sells them?</li>
    <li> Really nice bobby pins.</li>
    <li> I have had no luck with normal Bobby pins from a local store. They never hold. I watched a hair tutorial on YouTube and these Bobby pins were recommended. These are the best. They hold my hair in place all day. I can reuse them again and again. One box will last me forever I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
    <li> There are a ton of bobby pins in this box and they work very well. I am always losing bobby pins so it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m covered for at least a little while.</li>
    <li> this is a quality product that can withstand the crazy hair it comes into contact with without breaking, flaking, chipping or having the coated tips fall off. also, it comes in a quantity that satisfies the demand</li>
    <li> I LOVE these bobby pins.  About 13 years ago I had my hair done for a wedding with about 100 bobby pins put in my hair.  I am sure these were the bobby pins.  I have been living off the remnant pins from that updo ever since and could never find anything comparable in the drugstore.  These are incredible.  They are resilient (don&#x27;t bend permanently out of shape easily), strong, tight and hold my hair.  I will never buy another bobby pin.  I am so glad I finally found these.</li>
    <li> Best bobby pins out there! Will defiantly purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> The best-- I am a bridal stylist and need bobby pins that actually lock into the hair and these do the job.  Strong and sturdy- lightyears better than store bought bobby pins. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I bought this item twice. This first time, i received the complete wrong order, and Amazon was great in helping me get my money back.  Nothing from the seller regarding the mishap and no follow up... in any case, i always lose bobby pins so i decided to go ahead and try to purchase AGAIN.  This time, i received the right item.  The box is smaller than you would think, about 2\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;.  The bobby pins themselves are really nice and the curve helps adhere the pin to your head.  They stay really well and have been a great addition to my hair styling products.  The one con about this product is that after you used them maybe twice, the little balls that help protect your head from the sharp ends fall off and you end up stabbing yourself with the bobby pin or throwing it out.  Kind of a waste in my opinion.  Overall though i&#x27;m pleased and hopefully i wont be buying bobby pins for a while to come.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very dark brown, so if you have light brown/dirty blond hair like me, it&#x27;s still a bit dark. But that&#x27;s ok, I can work with it. They sometimes twist around when I&#x27;m trying to insert them into my hair, which can be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: They HOLD sometimes so well that it hurts and I have to fidget them around until they aren&#x27;t pulling on any hairs. But it&#x27;s refreshing to do hairstyles I never could before. I used to buy Bobby pins at walmart and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. I would try hairstyles, but the Bobby pins would always slip out, I thought, because my hair is so straight. But no, it&#x27;s because they were flimsy pins. These are strong Bobby pins that hold intricate hairstyles all day.</li>
    <li> They are so hard to open while holding hair in place with one hand that I&#x27;m not loving them.  The tips are smooth, though, so no worries about hair breakage.</li>
    <li> I ordered the large brown pins and got the small black ones. I have very long thick brown hair and had to special order these since not now carried in stores. Will see how the replacement is handled. I really needed these and will now need to start an order all oveelr and wait for delivery again with a wedding to go to comming up soon. I am not happy they are not even at least brown!</li>
    <li> My wife loves these. She has thick hair and it pushes out normal bobby pins. These heavier duty ones don&#x27;t get pushed out, and she only uses half of the amount of pins compared to what she had to use.</li>
    <li> I get so frustrated when I buy bobby pins at the drugstore and they don&#x27;t hold tight or the paint flakes off. These bobby pins are the best! They stay in nice and tight and they are curved to fit against the head (rather than straight bobby pins like Goody). I am so pleased with this purchase - I know I won&#x27;t run out of pins now and I&#x27;ve stashed them where I need them the most - in my purse, in my desk drawer at work, in my overnight bag, and even a few in my car. I know that I won&#x27;t ever run out (after all it is one pound!) I know where to come if I run out, but there&#x27;s a slim chance of that happening for quite some time. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Yep. This is it. If you have thick hair, you need these. Say goodbye to buying bobby pins every week!</li>
    <li> These are MUCH better than the crappy drugstore bobby pins from scunci or goody. They are very tight and hold my thin hair and many of my friends&#x27; thick hair really well. They don&#x27;t lose their shape easily so you can use them many times. I&#x27;ve never going back to those drugstore ones!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky about bobby pins. The ones you find at the big retailer that starts with a T just don&#x27;t work. These are great! They hold tight.</li>
    <li> It does the job I never have to save bobby pins again, I just always have a pile of bobby pins wherever I need them. It&#x27;s not really meant to be reused like other bobby pins because at times the pins will just stretch out and won&#x27;t retract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is never and issue when you wear it.</li>
    <li> I love it sooo much, awesome product! So much pins for a small amount and the delivery was earlier than expected, I only waited for 4 days instead of 2 weeks, amazing seller! Will definitely order again and again! Big thanks ❤️</li>
    <li> Stronger than regular but they&#x27;re just bobby pins people. After these reviews I was expecting a life change or something.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins have a great grip and do a good job with securing my very long, very thick hair. The 4 stars instead of 5 is because for the box I bought, the coating of the bobby pins comes off very easily. I have dark hair so the flakes that fall off don&#x27;t show in my hair, but then the &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; bobby pins become metallic silver. I also find that the tips come off easily, which then makes the bobby pin unusable in my opinion since trying to put one in without the protective tip causes the bobby pin to catch and pull on my hair. But you do get plenty of bobby pins for a good price so when a tip falls off or it becomes pulled open, I just toss that bobby pin out and move to grab another one.</li>
    <li> Omg. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these! I have incredibly thick hair and these are well made and tight so they hold my styles in place!</li>
    <li> Strong hold. Perfect brown color and nearly 800 in a box! I will order these again if I ever run out ;)</li>
    <li> I really love this box of bobby pins! I have baby fine hair and most bobby pins won&#x27;t hold my hair because it slips right through them. These are pretty stiff, which... yes... does make them a little harder to use, but worth it when your hair stays where you want it too!</li>
    <li> I purchased a different box of bobby pins from this company that worked really well, so when I saw these, I thought they would be even better. I was wrong. Every time I grab one to stick it in my hair, I have to pry it open and hope it doesn&#x27;t twist to one side or another. 95% of the time, it will twist as soon as I open it, making it useless. It&#x27;s so incredibly frustrating when I am getting ready in the morning. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I am so much more impressed with these than bobby pins from the drugstore. These baby pins have much better grip and do not slide out of my fine hair. Definitely worth the cost and shipping. 700 bobby pins will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty pins, paint staying on good.  This is a lot of bobby pins, but I lose them like crazy.  This should last 50 years.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> The image of these bobby pins is of a flat pin, i.e. no crinkles. I open my box and all the pins have ridges. I PURPOSELY bought these to have flat bobby pins. I am getting sick and tired of the falsely labeled items on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really wanted the super strong pins that my hairdresser uses.  She told me you could only get them at a place that sells only to professionals.  Why?  Why this silly prohibition from letting consumers have strong bobby pins?  Are they saving us from ourselves?  Perhaps, unless you are a trained professional, you could break a few strands of hair, mildly irritate your scalp, or god forbid, make a professional looking bun or french twist.  In that case, thank you, oh Marianna Supreme Bobby Pins, from saving me and leaving me with weak buns.</li>
    <li> I got these for my ballerina daughter, but use them for my silly bangs as well, they are REALLY TIGHT, and will pull hair, but they do stay put!</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are much better than the ones you can get from your grocery store, but still not the best at holding hair and staying in place. A great value for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Happy to find well made bobby pins at a good price meets all my requirements I don&#x27;t think I will need to buy again for a long time</li>
    <li> Best bobby pins I have ever had. Permanent customer now</li>
    <li> Pound of bobby pins anyone? This is just how I need the,. I have very long thick hair, so I use a ton of these. This was way cheaper than buying them by the card anywhere else. Also, the pins are the kind I like. They are slightly bent in the middle, kind of curved. They weren&#x27;t in plastic or a bag, so when they came, they were all out of the pin box, and inside the other box. That&#x27;s the only drawback. A pound is a lot of pins though, so don&#x27;t get them this way unless you use a LOT! I think they say it comes out to about eight hundred pins.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pound of Bobby pins for cheap.  Sure? My wife is happy</li>
    <li> These bobby pins hold really well but some tend to twist so it is hard to use them. They&#x27;re decent and 1 lb. is a lot so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> These pins hold well and they seem to be good quality overall. I was surprised to see how small they were - the still work very well for most hairstyles. You get a lot for the price so it&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
    <li> These are literally the best bobby pins I have ever used! I can hold a bun with only 2. This is a lifetime supply.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many bobby pins I got for such a great price. They&#x27;re higher quality bobby pins than I&#x27;ve ever had before.</li>
    <li> You can never have too many booby pins as everyone knows that drawers just eat them. I really like the quality of these.</li>
    <li> This is the best bobby pin I have ever used.  They actually stay in your hair.  Would purchase again !</li>
    <li> Really awesome Bobby Pins! I used them when I was in beauty&lt;br /&gt;school and I have used them ever since. Anyway, fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;and I am really satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and most bobby pins are worthless after one use.  I&#x27;ve used these on a couple of occasions now and have only ruined one, which is totally unheard of.  They also do an excellent job of holding my thick, heavy hair.  I definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> these bobby pins are the best. you can literally do whatever hairstyle with these they stay in forever and are very tight unlike the drug store bobby pins</li>
    <li> I hate bobby pins from a drug store that have ends that stick up - so annoying! These bobby pins are perfect, just like ones stylists use in the salons. They actually lay flat and you don&#x27;t see them sticking up in your hair!</li>
    <li> They work great!  I have fine hair, but I have LOTS of it and I do lots of Up-do&#x27;s with my hair.  Where other bobby pins will just open up and be useless after one use, these have enough resistance hold my hair and not lose their shape after the first use.  Best bobby pins I&#x27;ve found yet!</li>
    <li> These are great pins! I have thin hair and they really keep everything in place. The pins also don&#x27;t stretch out easily so I can reuse them several times. This box will last me awhile - great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife because she is always asking me if I have seen any Bobby pins. They seem to disappear like the other sock.  Buying in bulk is much cheaper than making a run to the 99 cents store every other week</li>
    <li> I like the mass quantity these bobby pins come in, but it was a bummer that my only option was brown. For being brown, they are fairly neutral and work fine with my &amp;#34;dishwater blonde&amp;#34; hair. They are fairly tight pins that hold ok. I&#x27;ve had worse bobby pins and I&#x27;ve had better ones...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d only ever used drugstore bobby pins before, and was never able to get them to hold my hair in place. The Marianna ones work like a charm, my hair stays put all day. Just stick them in and they grab your hair on their own, no need to try to pry them open. The grip is strong and remains so after multiple uses, and the curved shape lays nicely against your head. My only complaints are that the very tight grip makes them a bit difficult to get out, so you have to be careful not to pull your hair; and the little round nubbies at the tips tend to come off, and without them your scalp will get scratched, so at that point they become unusable. But there are so many per box that even if you only use each once, it&#x27;s still worth the price. Overall, these pins do their job well, and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Is good and stong hold for a small bobby pins :)</li>
    <li> Amazing bobby pins!! I LOVE that these have a slight curve to them. They work perfectly when I tease my hair for a poof. They hold all day and are tight unlike others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality- my hair snags a little- but for bulk bobby pins that will pretty much never run out, totally usable and I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> These are high quality, heavy duty bobby pins. One whole pound, that is a lot of bobby pins. I use these on a daily basis. These are durable enough to be used over and over again. They make all other bobby pins seem cheap and flimsy.</li>
    <li> Great bobby pins!  Highly recommend, they hold great and stay in place.  This is the only brand I purchase and use.</li>
    <li> tNot a good a I thought they would be. The ends tend to come off when pulled out of hair. Won&#x27; t be buying more. But then again - will never have to as the box has hundreds</li>
    <li> I got these for kids at my job who need their bangs pulled up.  I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so good.  They are the best bobby pins I have ever used!  Forget work I am using these for me.  Price is great but shipping is much more so be aware of that.  Still worth the buy!!</li>
    <li> Have a snug fit/great hold on your hair and will stay in all day. For normal use (not being a hairdresser), this 1lb. box will last a really long time. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even half way through them and I&#x27;ve had my box for almost 6 months!</li>
    <li> large supply of nice heavy bobby pins, hold well and do not pull my hair when taking them out.  Brown is a deep brown color</li>
    <li> My mom has Alzeheimers and looses her pins so - this was great with 800 in the box!  TY!</li>
    <li> This is a BIG BOX of bobby pins!! Absolutely love it - even though it weighs a ton, I feel like I will never run out of bobby pins again. They are good quality and not &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;, so they are not as noticeable against my daughter&#x27;s dark brown hair. Just right!</li>
    <li> Best bobby pins around. Very sturdy and hold my super long thick hair. My friend used them for my wedding and my hair lasted over 12 hrs without moving.</li>
    <li> i really like these they are the best bobby pins i have ever used and they are really good for your hair i deff recomend them to other users</li>
    <li> I bought these a few years ago &amp; am still no where near the bottom - smartest purchase I ever made!  I was constantly looking for a bobby pin &amp; buying the small backs every time I went to the store - this has saved me a lot!</li>
    <li> Never run out of bobby pins,  have not noticed difference in quality from those bought in a brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> I had been watching how to vidoes on youtube. I realized my bobby pins weren&#x27;t holding well. These are great. Strong hold, didn&#x27;t move throughout the day. GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have a huge problem with losing bobby pins. This box is bound to last me a very long time. There are so many in here and they are extremely sturdy. They are tight and hard to open, which I like because I know that my hair isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Great Product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a Caucasian woman with very thick, curly, frizzy hair that is medium length. There are few things in this life that truly prevent me from having absolutely wild, unruly locks that come close to the likes of Medusa. These bobby pins help tremendously. I have used thousands of bobby pins in my life and these are by far the bast. They stay put for hours. I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple months now and haven&#x27;t had a single one lose the soft little rubber tip from the end.&lt;br /&gt;They are also a much better value than buying those small packages at the drugstore. This box is probably equivalent to a couple dozen of those packages that usually run $2-3.</li>
    <li> I can never get bobby pins to hold my thick hair but these actually work.  Also I will never have to buy any again because there are soo many.  Overall, this was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Having this many bobby pins come in a box is the best thing ever, we go through so many bobby pins and to have them available all the time due to such a large quantity is awesome!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that these bobby pins would have a superior hold to them. They might....if I can get them in. Every time I tried to slide one in or open it in the least so that I could get hair between it, it would twist and bend. If I did get it in at all, it would go in wrong. Pulling them out also pulls out hair. I would not buy these again.</li>
