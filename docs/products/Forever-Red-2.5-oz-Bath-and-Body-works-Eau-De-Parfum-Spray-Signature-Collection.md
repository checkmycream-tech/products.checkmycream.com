      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect gift for yourself or the lady you love because of how passionate it is.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty good price for the quantity you&#x27;re getting.</li>

      <li>Here&#x27;s the thing, if you don&#x27;t buy they perfume you&#x27;re wasting your money because the body mist just isn&#x27;t as good and to me smells hardly anything like what I just described to you.</li>
      <li>I am very picky when it comes to perfume</li>
      <li>It was just what I expected and more.</li>
      <li>You can use considerably less and get your key areas ( behind the nape of the neck, cleavage and shoulders and wrists one tiny splash each area in my opinion) and honestly depending on your own body chemistry you&#x27;ll get both sweet notes and floral but one or the other will be more predominant such as your chemistry might make it less floral and more fruity and sweet or with others</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive and not sure I don&#x27;t like Jovan Musk just as much.</li>
<li> This scent is a bit richer than other scents from Bath and Body Works.</li>
<li> It starts off a bit musky but calms down to an almost candy - like sweetness.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this for anyone looking to depart from stereotypical floral scents.</li>
<li> I wear it everyday</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming and it&#x27;s not a smell that you need to wear a lot of.  </li>
<li> But the bow on the bottle was broken in shipment by the USPS</li>

    <li> This scent is a bit richer than other scents from Bath and Body Works. It starts off a bit musky but calms down to an almost candy - like sweetness.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking to depart from stereotypical floral scents.</li>

    <li> I love forever red. I gave it for my friend and she loved it too. I requested for a quick delivery and it arrived quick. Awsome.</li>
    <li> Not a strong perfume, pleasant. I gave the test and wore it to my sisters home and I knew she would give me her honest opinion, she liked it n said that it really smelled great.. So it&#x27;s a keeper</li>
    <li> I love love this scent...I smelled it in store at B&amp;B and bought it cheaper here!  I will def be reordering this!  Until they DC is of course!</li>
    <li> Ok let&#x27;s talk perfume!.. Red Osmanthus gives you a spicy sensual Asian floral and pomegranate, peach and apple for a touch of fruitiness, Vanilla Rum blended with a oaky musk and a Marshmallow tone it&#x27;s going to blend together a Spicy Asain floral that&#x27;s fruity and sweet. Here&#x27;s the thing, if you don&#x27;t buy they perfume you&#x27;re wasting your money because the body mist just isn&#x27;t as good and to me smells hardly anything like what I just described to you. You can use considerably less and get your key areas ( behind the nape of the neck, cleavage and shoulders and wrists one tiny splash each area in my opinion) and honestly depending on your own body chemistry you&#x27;ll get both sweet notes and floral but one or the other will be more predominant such as your chemistry might make it less floral and more fruity and sweet or with others chemistry more floral and only slightly sweet and fruity. It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance and I think lasts very nicely. It&#x27;s the perfect gift for yourself or the lady you love because of how passionate it is. Well these are my thoughts .</li>
    <li> I was going to order this product from BABW but decided to order from Amazon and I saved money. It was just what I expected and more.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift and i was even surprise how good it was for the cost which was better than i could find any where else. the shipping was great due to i ordered it at the last minute</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to perfume and I really can&#x27;t stand most of it. I smelled this on a customer at my work and asked her what it was because I liked it so much! I wear it everyday and I just can&#x27;t get enough of it:)</li>
    <li> longer lasting than the cologne spray. It&#x27;s a little more expensive and not sure I don&#x27;t like Jovan Musk just as much.</li>
    <li> Thank you as we loved the product.</li>
    <li> love it! smells good and lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for a friend. It was large amount and received quickly. My friend loved the gift. It was great!</li>
    <li> The first Parfum from Bath &amp; Body Works is a Hit! Very sexy, very sensual, very feminine! It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t fade off to the point where you need to keep refreshing. Great fragrance!</li>
    <li> I had bought 20 or more in a short time for this is an amazing smell of sweet and fruity. Definatelt worth buying.</li>
    <li> It is all it says it is!!!!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is the icing on the body cream cake.  I love this perfume added to the body cream.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming and it&#x27;s not a smell that you need to wear a lot of.  It is a sure purchase for the ladies and a fragrance men will love to have their ladies in. Perfect holiday gift for the sweetheart.</li>
    <li> This perfume is great! A wonderful light smell at an amazing value for this 2.5 oz bottle. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The only downside is the seller took quite a while to ship out the perfume so it took over three weeks to receive it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My daughte&#x27;s new favorite fragrance.  She tested it when she was out window shopping with a friend.  She whipped out her cell &amp; saw that Amazon for a better price so there she goes smart &amp; beautiful!  Thats my girl!!  And she smells great too!</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells on me and it&#x27;s a pretty good price for the quantity you&#x27;re getting. Bottle is very attractive.</li>
    <li> I typically buy these products directly from Bath &amp; Body Works, but because I had a credit on Amazon, I decide to go that route. The scent lasts all day and is not too overpowering that it would annoy others.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and I love the price too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift to my girlfriend for her birthday. She loves it!!!</li>
    <li> very nice product with a great price compared to retail.</li>
