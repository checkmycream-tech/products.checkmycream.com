### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for travel -</li>
      <li>Best product regime ever</li>
      <li>Normally great product but</li>
      <li>This set is great for travel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique, Lancôme, Estee Lauder and more and nothing has been as wonderful as these products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more impressed with the Elizabeth Arden Cermide trial I got.</li>
      <li>This is the best skin care product available today.  </li>
      <li>really good</li>
      <li>The products are of superior quality.  </li>
      <li>I am really pleased!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I really liked those and was bummed to see that it is not in the starter kit anymore.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell what the fuss is about.</li>
      <li>The serum is nice</li>
      <li>Thrilled that I could find online as I needed for my travel bag.  </li>
      <li>I love this skin care line.</li>
      <li>Love these products.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I suggest buying a sampler package first to try them and then replacing the ones you like best first</li>
      <li>and I love how it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
      <li>Also, the facial cleanser is THE BEST.</li>
      <li>Exceptional buy for an exceptionally FINE travel size kit of truly fabulous anti-aging skin products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 26 now and am getting fine lines.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it makes any drastic improvements, but if you need a basic skin are regimen, this is great.</li>
      <li>Love the whole line.</li>
      <li>I like how the creams are absorbed into the skin--however at age 74 it will take a lot longer to see results.</li>
      <li>Being someone who has tried everything under the sun, I can honestly say that with consistent use of Patricia Wexler products I actually saw improvement.</li>
      <li>You will notice the positive changes in the texture and condition of your skin immediately.  </li>
      <li>I had purchased and used this set in the past from Bath and Body Works and loved it.  </li>
      <li>My skin has improved so much since using these light-weight products.</li>
      <li>I would be very upset if I had paid full-price</li>
      <li>Financially, the best way to go is to buy each item individually in its much larger incarnations, (i.e.sizes),then religiously use all the products per directions each day.  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they can put the big one in special too.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and clean but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the day or night lotion either.</li>
      <li>The price range is not so high like others</li>
      <li>and this is one of the few indulgements I make sure I allow myself.</li>
      <li>ONLY reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because back when I first tried out this product, it also came with the resurfacing microbrasion wash and intense hydrator.</li>
      <li>It made my skin so silky smooth and took away my acne within a few days.</li>
      <li>This time, I bought the travel size kit for its conveninient smaller sizes, but was also experiencing the ever increasing episodes of economic hardship...</li>
      <li>They are all I use now and people ask me how I keep my skin so young looking at almost 60 years old.  </li>
      <li>and then the others more slowly to space out your budget.</li>
      <li>I have just begun using this after purchasing many of the supermarket brands with little success and lots of wasted dollars!</li>
      <li>when ordered from Amazon it appeared old; the containers were only half full and oilier/more condensed than normal as though they had been exposed to elements or just too old.  </li>
      <li>so I could only afford the starter kit...and Wow!...</li>
      <li>I never really wear sunglasses and don&#x27;t really take care of my skin.</li>
      <li>2nd time buying this from Amazon...a little bit spendy, but exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I first used this back in late 2006 / early 2007.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used for years.  This size not available in stores because of repackaging.  Thrilled that I could find online as I needed for my travel bag.  Love the whole line.</li>
    <li> I ♡ Dr Wexler,  I&#x27;ve been using for almost 10yrs. I actually had a coworker ask me what I did because I looked different, and using it ever since.</li>
    <li> I love this skin care line. I have been using it for 5 years, tried a few other products, but always come back to Wexler. No breakouts, no irritation, not too heavy. I also use the Wexler microdermabrasion set and I love how it makes my skin look and feel.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it makes any drastic improvements, but if you need a basic skin are regimen, this is great. Also, the facial cleanser is THE BEST. Takes off makeup like a charm, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I would recommend the Wexler line without reservation .</li>
    <li> I purchased this travel set to try out this brand. I read tons of rave reviews. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell what the fuss is about. The serum is nice but I wasn&#x27;t amazed by it. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the day or night lotion either. I would be very upset if I had paid full-price but I had some gift cards to redeem. I&#x27;m more impressed with the Elizabeth Arden Cermide trial I got.</li>

    <li> I have just begun using this after purchasing many of the supermarket brands with little success and lots of wasted dollars! These products actually work as they say the do! I noticed a difference immediately. They&#x27;re pricey to purchase but you use such minute amounts that they last a long time for me. I am really pleased! I suggest buying a sampler package first to try them and then replacing the ones you like best first and then the others more slowly to space out your budget.</li>
    <li> Best product regime ever</li>
    <li> I first used this back in late 2006 / early 2007. It made my skin so silky smooth and took away my acne within a few days. I chose to opt out of the acne specific line because I feel like any anti-acne products just make my skin worse. Maybe my skin has just gotten immune to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 26 now and am getting fine lines. I never really wear sunglasses and don&#x27;t really take care of my skin. I had a baby in July last year so my time has been focused on him. But now I want to start taking care of myself and pamper as well. I remembered this product so I went out and got it. And wham bam - only two days later and I&#x27;m noticing immediate results. Lines are getting plumped out already and acne is fading quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because back when I first tried out this product, it also came with the resurfacing microbrasion wash and intense hydrator. I really liked those and was bummed to see that it is not in the starter kit anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care product available today.  I&#x27;ve used Clinique, Lancôme, Estee Lauder and more and nothing has been as wonderful as these products.  They are all I use now and people ask me how I keep my skin so young looking at almost 60 years old.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I like how the creams are absorbed into the skin--however at age 74 it will take a lot longer to see results.Icannot use the eye cream--it causes excess tears.Please no automatic shipments. I have Parkinsons and I sweat profusely ,so I can use it only at nite.</li>
    <li> Love these products. This set is great for travel.</li>
    <li> Being someone who has tried everything under the sun, I can honestly say that with consistent use of Patricia Wexler products I actually saw improvement. The price range is not so high like others so it is affordable for someone like myself who lives on a budget and this is one of the few indulgements I make sure I allow myself. The fragrance is light and clean but not overwhelming.  This is the one of only a few face products I feel no guilt in purchasing because it works!</li>
    <li> Normally great product but when ordered from Amazon it appeared old; the containers were only half full and oilier/more condensed than normal as though they had been exposed to elements or just too old.  I had purchased and used this set in the past from Bath and Body Works and loved it.  This was a disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using products from this line for about 3 years. I struggle with oily skin and had a lot of blemishes. My skin has improved so much since using these light-weight products. The consumers are small but it lasts for a long time. I am sad that it has been discontinued but I will continue to purchase it as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Perfect for travel -</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;works really good and there is nothing like it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they can put the big one in special too.</li>
