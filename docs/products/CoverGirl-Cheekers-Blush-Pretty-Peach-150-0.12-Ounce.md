<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a soft supple, blush and very pretty .</li>
    <li> Will be purchasing this product again! Better price than the store.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am NOT a blush wearer. This is a gorgeous color. Goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s beautiful sheer and so easy to wear. I&#x27;ve made it a part of my daily makeup routine!</li>
    <li> Perfect color, I have light skin and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> The Pretty Peach is a very pretty color for light skin tones.</li>
    <li> Well, the color itself is lovely. I am really glad that I picked the &amp;#34;pretty peach&amp;#34; color because it goes well with my light complexion. However when I opened the box, the powder was all smashed and quite a mess. I guess that is what can be expected from ordering blush online...I will probably go to store next time. For me though I am not too upset about it because it still works just as good...just not so pretty to look at.</li>
    <li> The color was great and the product was easy to apply but the brush was too small to be a good blush brush. Good for travel though because of its small size.</li>
    <li> It came in a box of 3! The brush kinda sucks so I&#x27;ll probably buy a new one. The other con for me was it has glitter.</li>
    <li> I tried it out for the first time today. I am obsessed with blush so I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products. This one was just right for me. Not too dark, not too light. It was super easy to blend. I only had to apply it once and it lasted me the entire day.</li>
    <li> I have very light skin and for some time gave up on finding blush - I thought they all looked awful on me.  On a whim, I decided to give this blush a try.  When it arrived, it looked darker than what was in the picture - or at least I thought so.  I just knew it was going to look silly, but I said &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and put it on anyway.  To my surprise, it was absolutely perfect.  It looks so natural!  I cannot believe the difference it makes.  I am definitely hooked now!</li>
    <li> Another great product from CG, as usual!</li>
    <li> Love product. Very natural and shade is true to color. I was hoping to find something like Orgasm but this is slightly more peach. Still lovely.</li>
    <li> I was happy and surprised that this CoverGirl Blush has such good coverage and lasts almost all day!  I is fairly highly pigmented with a very pretty color, but it is difficult to load the brush because it is hard (that is the one sign that it is a cheaper brand).  It has some shimmer in it.  We have all tried &amp;#34;drug-store brands&amp;#34; that are so frustrating (it wears off fast) to use that you wish you had spent the extra money at the department store.  This is a good drug-store product!  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice peach color, good for fair skin. Great value. No reason on spending any more than this on blush. Every bit as good as more expensive blush.</li>
    <li> Great item, amazing price!</li>
    <li> I liked the color but found that there was far more sparkle than I was expecting. I will not lower the stars given becuase it is hard to tell the shimmer from pictures. The color did stay on most of the say and it didn&#x27;t take that much to get the right color. I didn&#x27;t use the brush that came with it so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is really affordable but it just does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried applying this with several types of brushes, but it is really hard to pick up and apply. It looks very pigmented in the case but when I apply it I can hardly see it, even after going over it several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think I will be using this very often - maybe not at all anymore. I would recommend investing in a better quality blush.</li>
    <li> Love this color!!! I have light skin and this color blended beautifully!</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for a nice pink/coral/peach blush and this one does the job. It is very affordable at less than $5 (online and in store) and for what you pay for, the pigmentation isn&#x27;t bad at all. I wish the compact was a bit easier to use and larger, maybe a circle shaped instead of this rounded rectangle but I do enjoy the color. I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a subtle, affordable pink/peach blush! It does give better staying power if a primer is used and a good quality brush as well. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good value for money and it &#x27;s exactly the colour I wanted.</li>
    <li> nice color and doesnt apply to heavy</li>
    <li> I love CoverGirl products and the shade was really great. Great price too . Love it</li>
    <li> I was looking for cheap but not cheap-quality blush. These are fantastic! The peach color is especially good for my skin tone (I&#x27;m Asian) and I&#x27;m really glad I found these.</li>
    <li> Covergirl makes a lot of good products to be a drugstore makeup. You can&#x27;t beat the price of this blush, and it has a pretty color and decent application.</li>
    <li> Cover girl cheekers blush in pretty peach is great for warm skin tones. It goes on looking natural not too harsh. I have never experienced any irritation or sensitivity from this product and I have been using it for years. I find the color lasts throughout the day yet it is easily removed with face cleanser. I love that the it has great staying power even when the grandkids are kissing my face is stays on. I would recommend that everyone tries this for themselves. Great quality and great price!</li>
    <li> I just happened to order a few make up products I already knew worked for me, through Amazon. On a whim I decided to try this CoverGirl blush at the same time. Who does that?? I have NEVER ordered make up I hadn&#x27;t already tried, color-wise. And I have to say this is not a color I would have selected at at store. Having said that---I&#x27;m seriously happy I ordered this! The color is perfect for me and the coverage is great as well. Years ago I squandered a ton of money on \\&quot;make up counter beauty products\\&quot;, but no more. I&#x27;m finding products just as good at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever...It&#x27;s easy to apply and the color is long-lasting. I&#x27;ve been a user for years,</li>
    <li> I love the Pretty Peach Blush.Its long wearing and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Got the product crashed.</li>
    <li> this is cute the color suits me well, love the color and its easy to put in my purse and its affordable !</li>
    <li> It is a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; light color as the title states but I love CoverGirl and wanted to try something new - works well when applied</li>
    <li> I have olive-toned skin, and the Pretty Peach blush has enough pigment to make it show up nicely without being too flashy. It gives a nice flushed look to my cheeks. I do need to have a light touch up half-way through my day. The item is small enough to fit in my make-up bag. What I don&#x27;t like is the brush because it feels stiff, so I just use another brush from a different kit.</li>
    <li> The color is not very peachy. It is still that pink color comparable to other brands, so I was disappointed by that. Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re still looking for a truly peachy blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush is horrible quality. Don&#x27;t buy this without having your own brush. It applies very unevenly, making me look like a clown by the time I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, it&#x27;s cheap and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> love the color!! makes the skin look bright</li>
    <li> Nice natural color. Have to use my own blush brush, the one included stinks!</li>
    <li> I love this blush it looks really good on fair or darker skin! i use it everyday:) would buy it again !</li>
    <li> Very nice shade and goes on nicely.  It is small, but very handy for my purse and you don&#x27;t need much to give your cheeks that glow.  Very pleased with the price too.</li>
    <li> Very nice and lightweight.</li>
    <li> I love my blush even though I don&#x27;t use it very often. It came very carefully packaged and arrived very quickly. It was a perfect purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very nice shade for my skintone and for spring. Goes on like more expensive brands and not easy to find this in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this color! Perfect for summer!</li>
    <li> it has the same color of what i wear and i like the color and how it stays long in my cheeks</li>
    <li> This gets amazing reviews via Allure and it always ends up on their best of beauty list. However, after doing some research, I have learned that the formula of this creates a blotchy texture.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with it myself when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;It does not contain harsh ingredients which is nice, but there are still better options.</li>
    <li> Its very pretty and light. But it might need to get touched up at times. But works good.</li>
    <li> Too perfect color for my skin tone (Asian). This is one of my favorite blushes, Perfect dupe for high end products for fraction of price! . I have bought this shade pretty peach over and over, its a pink shade with slight shimmer, nothing crazy. it wears well and blends well. I have purchased department store blushes for 25 &amp; 30 $$ and they were chalky, powdery and cheap looking on the skin. CG cheekers blush looks so natural and is sheer yet buildable. fab product!</li>
    <li> I love this blush and it goes on so easy and doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied during the day.  Loved the price !!!</li>
    <li> Covergirl is always the best bet.  I started my daughter on this line of products because it&#x27;s so safe for you skin.  We love covergirl.  And this color was just right for a preteen.</li>
    <li> I bought this through Amazon store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very nice, came on time as stated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glides on smoothly, not cakey, just a pretty hint of peach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful color!! It is a little bit difficult to take product on brush, however color pay off is great! I do recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product. Have used it for years</li>
    <li> I love the shade, and the product works, but the size of the blush was much smaller than they use to be by this brand. A little disappointing, but the product was as described.</li>
    <li> So for this pretty peach shade, it is right on point. The only thing you have to be careful of is how much you apply because if you don&#x27;t watch out, you&#x27;ll look like a 7 year old who just tried on mommy&#x27;s make up for the first time.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner for all this, its worked very well .</li>
    <li> Been using this brand and color for years.  Am light complected, do not tan, and have very senstitive skin.  I use Clinique for everything BUT this blush.  It&#x27;s been great and I will continue using for many more years unless they discontinue.  I am 55 years old.</li>
    <li> One of my favourite colors and brands. Covergirl is hard to find in Venezuela, but easy to buy in Amazon :-) I&#x27;ve used it previously and I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Nice light pink color, price is just right! Did not cause any skin irritation. Easily remived with makeup wipe.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I was on the hunt for a blush and I happeneed to try this one. Do not buy this .....first of all the blush feels like chalk . It just has a chalky consistency and it does not last long! What the actual $&amp;@\\&quot; ... Why would someone buy this? Why would they even put this on the market. Once I got home I tossed it in the trash. I&#x27;ve never used a s***tier product.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit more orange in person than in the picture, but I really enjoy it. I&#x27;m fair, and it is just pigmented enough to show up on my skin without being overwhelming. A very nice product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Love CoverGirl products and love the blush!</li>
    <li> Just received this in Pretty Peach and had to give it a try. Looks great, just make sure you tap the brush to shake off excess or you might get to much. Looks nice, even my daughter had to try it and really liked it. Not to bright or dull, gives a nice almost natural glow. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Very soft  color, easy to apply. Would purchase again</li>
