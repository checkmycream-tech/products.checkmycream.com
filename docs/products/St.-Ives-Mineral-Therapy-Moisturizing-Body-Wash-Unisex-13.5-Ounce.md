      <li>For better moisture I&#x27;d go for Dove, but this is nice for a change.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>I think, for my skin type, I prefer something that leaves me more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling vs moisturized.</li>
      <li>I still need more moisture, so hopefully they will come up with something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love St Ives products and have used them for years.</li>
      <li>I love every St. Ives product I try.</li>
      <li>and I would buy again Love it</li>
      <li>But Amazon had everything nicely compacted and secure in the box.</li>
      <li>I would have paid more for it if I had to, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to, yet.</li>
      <li>This body wash would feel better if there was a scrub element to it, but as is it&#x27;s just ok...</li>
      <li>the fragrance is appealing.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Strong fruit smell; not per my taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a light, pleasant scent-not fruity or anything, creates a nice lather, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling super dry</li>
      <li>My skin felt so smooth afterwards.</li>
      <li>used the free shipping which takes time for products to arrive.</li>
      <li>Not SLS free</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling hydrated and smooth after each use.</li>
      <li>It is paraben free</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin clean and smooth</li>
      <li>have usually been very happy with St. Ives products.</li>
      <li>really just kind of fresh.</li>
      <li>It gets us clean, and moisturizes as well.</li>
      <li>I found everything that claims &#x27;mineral, dead sea, etc&#x27;  is nothing more than attractive marketing.</li>
      <li>and I did an extensive search of the internet for the \\&quot;best body washes for sensitive skin\\&quot; which led me to some women&#x27;s research page which led me to this body wash and boy</li>
      <li>were they right!  </li>
      <li>Gentle formula great for sensitive skin, soft scent that&#x27;s great for the whole family, and a better price than my local drug store, thanks amazon</li>
      <li>The scent is refreshing, and it leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much of this stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for the whole family, so you don&#x27;t have to have several different bottles in the shower.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on okay product, especially for the price</li>
      <li>Feels clean on skin while moisturizing, not heavy like some body washes.</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizing body wash and feels better than the last one I was using.  </li>
      <li>Different people are affected differently, however, this body wash cleans effectively and leaves a gently fresh scent.</li>
      <li>(on our humid summer days anyway), but not oily, and it has a lovely light, but not overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>Love this brand and really helps with my dry skin!</li>
      <li>and I am bathed in so much silky foam.</li>
      <li>It makes it soft at first</li>
      <li>Highly reccomend</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy it again, great subtle smell.</li>
      <li>Best of all, I am able to find it at my local drug store for a third to a fourth of the price it is sold on the internet--so I was able to stock up for at least the next few months for less than 20 bucks.</li>
      <li>The smell is definitely unisex, it&#x27;s hardly any kind of fragrance</li>
      <li>I have soft water at home, but I like to take this one along with me anytime</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin, it keeps it</li>
      <li>Was surprised at the amount of lather.  </li>
      <li>I found it after my old Johnson&#x27;s soft line was discontinued</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent, and even in hard water it leaves skin feeling smoother and less dry than many other inexpensive washes.</li>
      <li>Which bodywash you use is very much a choice of personal preference, but I would definitely recommend this one!</li>
      <li>I use it daily and like the results I have seen so far.</li>

    <li> I like using this product.  It feels great on my skin and the fragrance is appealing.  I use it daily and like the results I have seen so far.</li>
    <li> I first used this bodywash about five years ago, but was never able to find it in stores again. I only recently found it on Amazon and got it through the add on program. It was just as good as I remembered it. It has a light, pleasant scent-not fruity or anything, creates a nice lather, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling super dry once I dry off. I had been using Dove, and I don&#x27;t think the level of moisturizing is different at all, and anyways you should always apply lotion after you shower. Which bodywash you use is very much a choice of personal preference, but I would definitely recommend this one!</li>

    <li> This is a non drying product for every day use. It lasts for a few months of use. I liked it.</li>
    <li> I love every St. Ives product I try. This one didn&#x27;t let me down either.  It&#x27;s great for the whole family, so you don&#x27;t have to have several different bottles in the shower.  The scent is refreshing, and it leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
    <li> My Mom and Dad&#x27;s skin care needs are used to the St Ives brand because they never experience irritation from using it.  Different people are affected differently, however, this body wash cleans effectively and leaves a gently fresh scent.</li>
    <li> It feels amazing. My skin felt so smooth afterwards. I thought it would be grainy but it&#x27;s not so that was surprising</li>

    <li> This is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Liked:&lt;br /&gt;- It is paraben free&lt;br /&gt;- Lathers good&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin clean and smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- Pricier&lt;br /&gt;- Not SLS free&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves the skin a little dry&lt;br /&gt;- Strong fruit smell; not per my taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good if you are looking for something that contains lesser chemicals and if you like fruit smell</li>
    <li> This body wash is amazing! It leaves your skin feeling hydrated and smooth after each use. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This body wash would feel better if there was a scrub element to it, but as is it&#x27;s just ok...For better moisture I&#x27;d go for Dove, but this is nice for a change.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!! I don&#x27;t have to use very much of this stuff and I am bathed in so much silky foam. I love it!!!!!! I have a hard time finding a body wash that I can use that gives me the moisture that my skin needs. I hope they never discontinue this stuff. I had a hard time finding it but now that I have I will continue to buy it, stock up on it even so that I don&#x27;t run out ever!!!!!!!!!!!! Highly reccomend</li>
    <li> Love this brand and really helps with my dry skin! The discount was awesome and I would buy again Love it</li>
    <li> So far so good. Don&#x27;t feel like I have to rush to the lotion. Works well in spite of our hard water. A little goes a long way. Fragrance is not over powering. I still need more moisture, so hopefully they will come up with something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have usually been very happy with St. Ives products. I like the size. It is easy to handle. Cap opens and closes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the free shipping which takes time for products to arrive. But Amazon had everything nicely compacted and secure in the box.</li>
    <li> This mineral formula is one of my favorites from the St Ives line of bath products. It has a pleasant scent, and even in hard water it leaves skin feeling smoother and less dry than many other inexpensive washes. I have soft water at home, but I like to take this one along with me anytime I have to stay in a hotel where I&#x27;m forced to shower in hard water.</li>
    <li> I love St Ives products and have used them for years. Mineral Therapy Body Wash is cleansing and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever found.  I found it after my old Johnson&#x27;s soft line was discontinued and I did an extensive search of the internet for the \\&quot;best body washes for sensitive skin\\&quot; which led me to some women&#x27;s research page which led me to this body wash and boy were they right!  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin, it keeps it just moisturized enough that I don&#x27;t have to apply lotion  (on our humid summer days anyway), but not oily, and it has a lovely light, but not overwhelming scent. Also it has a wonderful, luscious lather that makes bathing pleasurable.  Best of all, I am able to find it at my local drug store for a third to a fourth of the price it is sold on the internet--so I was able to stock up for at least the next few months for less than 20 bucks. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it I would have paid more for it if I had to, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to, yet.</li>
