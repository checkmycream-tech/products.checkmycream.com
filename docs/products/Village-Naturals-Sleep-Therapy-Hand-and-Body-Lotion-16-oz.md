      <li>It&#x27;s a more floral scent.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product before and love the fragrance and the thickness of the lotion.</li>

      <li>I would recommend it. :)</li>

      <li>The lotion is light and non-greasy.</li>

      <li>I can not recommend this for massages at all, although some people may find it adequate for moisturising their elbows or something...  </li>
      <li>It has helped me tremendously</li>

      <li>The first night I used it, I fell asleep quicker than I had been.</li>
      <li>The scent is not at all appealing - although the herb combination sounds relaxing and is pleasant in other products by other manufacturers in this lotion it is not.</li>
      <li>It not only relaxes me enough to fall asleep, but the fragrance pleasant</li>
      <li>It did not contribute positively to their experience at all.  </li>
      <li>The product is always what you expect and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know so much about the sleep inducing properties though chemically lavender scents have shown an abillity to aid in sleep</li>
      <li>The lavender scent of the Sleep Therapy Lotion really relaxes and makes me stop thinking about the cares of the day and smell the lavender.</li>
      <li>Using it with their other sleep therapy products really does help me get more rest, and smells heavenly.</li>
      <li>I do love their other offerings - just not this one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps you sleep, but it sure does makes a routine that calms you down before going to bed.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.  </li>
      <li>Also it makes your skin very soft.</li>
      <li>She used it for 2 days until we had a supply of our regular massage lotion delivered, and it was the first time we&#x27;ve ever had patients complain about their massage.  </li>
      <li>and it makes my skin soft.</li>

<li> In a word: awful.  </li>

    <li> I adore this company. The product is always what you expect and reasonably priced. This leaves your skin feeling soft and absorbs easily. I don&#x27;t know so much about the sleep inducing properties though chemically lavender scents have shown an abillity to aid in sleep so if it works for you then that is just another bonus to a good product.</li>
    <li> I love Sleep Therapy people ask what Im wearing I give it as gifts to many of my friends they all love it Please never stop makeing it</li>
    <li> These products from Village Naturals are so nice. The lavender scent of the Sleep Therapy Lotion really relaxes and makes me stop thinking about the cares of the day and smell the lavender. I really like this one and the price is good!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion. The lavender scent is relaxing and not at all overpowering. The lotion is light and non-greasy. It makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> SMELLS LIFE HEAVEN A GREAT WAY TO RECHARGE A STRESSFUL MOMENT</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best ever...AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Final found the Village Naturals products on Amazon. Great line of natural products. Can&#x27;t say this made me sleepy but it does help with rough dry hands in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have had insomnia issues for years - this product is absolutely amazing!!! It has helped me tremendously and I would recomment this to anyone who has sleep issues.</li>
    <li> Well..Like I said my wife loves it, shes happy, I&#x27;m happy.  I don&#x27;t know about all  the mind easing claims, but it has a nice sent, light not heavy and its not greasy.  If the sent helps you sleep, great! It makes a nice anytime gift.</li>
    <li> Good lotion. Does not seem to help with sleep though.</li>
    <li> I like it. I don&#x27;t know if it helps you sleep, but it sure does makes a routine that calms you down before going to bed. Also it makes your skin very soft. Nice product. I would recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for our massage therapist to try.  In a word: awful.  It immediately balled up on the skin and became super tacky.  It would be impossible to use this for a real massage, no slip or give at all.  She used it for 2 days until we had a supply of our regular massage lotion delivered, and it was the first time we&#x27;ve ever had patients complain about their massage.  It did not contribute positively to their experience at all.  I can not recommend this for massages at all, although some people may find it adequate for moisturising their elbows or something...  a waste of money IMO</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and love the fragrance and the thickness of the lotion. The value is also very good compared to some of the higher end lotions.</li>
    <li> Slow delivery. Love lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this lotion for my mom because she was complaining of split dry hands. She absolutely loves the stuff!</li>
    <li> I was having trouble sleeping but didn&#x27;t want to take a pill to help me sleep.

    <li> Love the smell.  Meets all my requirements for a fine lotion.  It absorbs well and is not greasy.  Easily dispensed.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I have insomnia. Did this help ?!? I have longer periods of sleep. It does relax me and calm my mind. Anyone with trouble sleeping should give it a try. On a side note, not greasy !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Uses it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use it a couple times and feels really good.</li>
    <li> The lotion is not greasy, absorbs quickly and moisturizes well. I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent though. It&#x27;s a little too perfume-y for me and doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender. It&#x27;s a more floral scent. The label says lavender chamomile and passion flower but I think it&#x27;s misleading to say the smell is lavender. I&#x27;ve bought lots of lavender lscented lotions and Shea butter and was looking for something affordable. This is not for me...</li>
    <li> The scent is not at all appealing - although the herb combination sounds relaxing and is pleasant in other products by other manufacturers in this lotion it is not. I do love their other offerings - just not this one.</li>
    <li> I use this every night.  It helps me sleep better and it improves your skin.  You also smell very good which put you in a better mood.</li>
