<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought it in my area&#x27;s downtown section at an antique shop. So glad to see it on Amazon so now I don&#x27;t have to find a parking space. It absorbs very well but does leave a protective film. It&#x27;s labeled &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; but is more of a cream. This way you are not paying for a watered down version. Yes, as others have stated, it has an initial strong scent. I think it is due to the sunflower oil. After rubbing it into skin, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable to me and I&#x27;m sensitive. A person&#x27;s reaction is due to their level of sensitivity. There are nicer fragrances out there but I prefer to have the product help my skin which it does. Due to my work, I was my hands a lot and develop cracks on thumb and fingertips. At night I&#x27;ll put some of the Naked Bee lotion and cover with band aids. It really helps as the cracks/splits hurt. I intend to buy this and use as gifts.</li>
    <li> Love having the product  in tube so I can take it with me easily.  It is never sticky or greasy.  The light orange smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t know if I reviewed this already but I am absolutely addiiiiiicted to this lotion - not just the lotion, but the scent itself. It smells JUST LIKE Smarties candy! It does NOT smell like Honey or Orange Blossom (I hate the smell of Orange Blossom, it literally makes me ill). But it smells like candy. People are always asking me What is that sweet smell, are you eating candy? I have like 7 tubes stashed everywhere I might be. I also have the soap (not very scented) and the hand salve stuff. I agree with another reviewer: They need to make this into a Body Spritz. It would be up there with my Number One, Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace, as sprays I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> There is fragrance in this and retinyl palmitate; I thought that it would have natural fragrance from essential oils but no.  The fragrance is nothing like honey and orange and it smells artificial to me. I wish amazon would list all the ingredients.  It is pretty expensive and the tube wasn&#x27;t even sealed so I don&#x27;t know if it has been used!  Not worth the shipping price to send back.</li>
    <li> Scent is way too strong for me. It&#x27;s as though odor molecules are floating through the air and into my respiratory system, making me cough and sneeze.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave Amazon reviews but I had to chime in to agree with the 2-star review: this lotion smells nothing like honey or orange and everything like plastic and chemicals.  So disgusting that after putting it on my arms and legs and letting it sit for a few minutes, I had to get up and go take a shower to get it the heck off of me.  My husband admitted he hated it as much as I did.  Seriously gross.  I gather from all the positive reviews that perhaps it&#x27;s one of those lotions you either love or hate the scent of... but just be forewarned that, like me, you may be in the latter group.  What a waste of $7.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.. Tried my coworkers and now I have to buy it!  The smell is nice and it moisturizes the skin.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations perfectly.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at my hair salon and just fell in love with the smell and texture that it leaves on your hands.  Very soft and subtle feeling, even after you wash them.  All of my friends now use it for the same reasons.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase it.  Even my husband now uses it for his hands.  I just love the smell!</li>
    <li> I originally tried the sample at the checkout counter of my company&#x27;s gift shop.  I had a slight rash on my index finger that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of by using first aid cream or anti-itch creams.  After using this stuff for a few days - it healed right up! A little bit goes a long way.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  I believe it has magical healing powers and it really smells great!  I no longer work at that company and the makers of it only sell to retailers.  Glad you guys carry this!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Add my name to the list of people that are impressed with this lotion. I just love how silky it feels, without that greasy feel that most lotions tend to have. I even use it on my face as it&#x27;s that non-greasy. I swear by calendula for the complexion anyway which is what first caught my eye with this product (I used to be a huge fan of Kiss My Face&#x27;s Honey &amp; Calendula but they changed their product and I can&#x27;t stand the feel of it anymore). After testing it on my hands in a local store, I immediately bought it. It&#x27;s higher in price than a lot of lotions out there, but I think you get a fair trade in quality and a little bit goes a long way. I plan to buy more and I was just checking out its availability and pricing on Amazon (decided to write a review while here). The smell is a bit strong at first, but not offensively so in my opinion. I actually like it and I think it fades as the day goes on (but the feeling lasts). I&#x27;m impressed. Please don&#x27;t stop making it or change anything.</li>
    <li> Not only is this great moisturing lotion but the scent is fabulous.  I wish this company made a body spray in this orange blossom honey scent.  And, the same scent in soap would be nice.</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion this summer on vacation and now I can&#x27;t be without it.  It has a very pleasing, subtle sweet smell that is not overwhelming like some lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2.25 oz size is just perfect to throw in your purse or carryon when traveling.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift. I cannot stand the way it makes my hands smell.  Maybe I got a bad batch.  Even in the tube it smells nothing like orange blossoms or honey. I tried it 3 times and ended up washing it off.</li>
    <li> Light, sweet, intoxicating scent.  I never use up products and I used this one up quickly.  Like that it takes out some of the nasty ingredients found in many products.  I will be buying this stuff as gifts for others and for myself for a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion! I am a teacher and all of the teachers now want it. The smell of the orange blossom honey is awesome! It is so creamy and I just love to keep smelling it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not usually recommended to use perfumed lotion on eczema prone skin. This is the only non- presciption cream that I can happily use on my hands without experiencing burning and worsening of the condition. It leaves my hands feeling super soft! But the best part is the smell which reminds me of holidays in Europe in the sun as a child. I just wish they made more products.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had this lotion and I loved the smell of it and the consistency.  As soon as I got home I was so happy to find it on Amazon and ordered some for myself.  I love that a little bit goes a long way.  I love that there is no greasy residue after it&#x27;s all rubbed in.  I love the smell!!!!  It is a little pricier than I would have expected, $10 for a 2.5 ounce tube, but oh well I had to have some.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this item.  It goes on smoothly and smells great!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing lotion, but it smells wonderful. I use it in-between using a more moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a local museum called Woolaroc and LOVE it!! People are constantly asking me what lotion I&#x27;m using cause they love the smell, and I&#x27;m constantly battling my 6 year old for MY lotion (hence the reason I&#x27;m on Amazon ordering more).</li>
    <li> The orange-honey scent beyond discription.  I tried a sample, thought it was too expensive, walked a block down the street, smelled my hand again and went back to buy the lotion:)  I wish I could find more product in this area.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law has very dry skin and no other lotion gives her the relief this product does. Would definitely recommend to those looking for a very rich product.</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves my skin feeling young and smooth again. The scent is remarkably fresh and clean.  Unlike other lotions Naked Bee keeps your skin smooth and healthy looking.  It&#x27;s not cosmetic surgery but, it looks like it!</li>
    <li> Love the Naked Bee products</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this lotion after buying in a small town shop, but ended up ordering it off amazon. It heals your skin and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Picked up my first tube at a gift shop.  Loved the texture and the smell is WONDERFUL! Have since purchase both here on Amazon and at another retail store.  Nice addition to my lotion collection.  Not to oily or sticky.  Absorbs well.  Very nice!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is fabulous and the moisturizing power of this lotion is strong!  I use it on my body and hands.  I wish it was a priced a little lower so I could buy more, I would put some in each room of the house.  As it is, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; lotion for my purse and bath only!</li>
    <li> Although this lotion works well and a little goes a long way, I&#x27;m just not diggin&#x27; the scent at all.  I&#x27;m a lemongrass and verbena or any other fresh scent kind of gal.  This smells, ummmm, kind of artificial or something.  I just don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but others apparently do.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  No greasy, oily, thick feeling. It&#x27;s light and lasts almost all day long. I was actually looking for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift and just happened across an entire display.  And I liked the fact it is 70% certified organic. What I bought for myself was the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; because I get migrain headaches from &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; products.  I bought my Mom the Orange Blossom Honey- the Chai Tea-and the Pomegranate.  She can decide what she likes the best.  I did buy the grapefruit too.  It is &amp;#34;grapefruity&amp;#34; and will awaken your senses right up.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of product.  And it does make your skin soft  for those of us with &amp;#34;older skin&amp;#34;.  Definitely a great purchase and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> this product has a nice subtle aroma, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes. As an ER RN, I wash my hands alot and they become dry, cracked and irritated.  This product is great for long lasting relief</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to use hand cream or lotion because it typically leaves a greasy or slimy feeling on my hands.  When my hands get super dry and cracked I will use Eucerin but i don&#x27;t like the residue it leaves behind and also I am switching out all products with parabens for obvious health reasons.  This hand lotion exceeded all my expectations.  It leaves my hands soft with no residue and like i don&#x27;t have anything on.  It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product.</li>
    <li> Love it , very moisturizing. I also bought the Lavender while in TN. , will you have it again?&lt;br /&gt;  Would love to buy the Lavender. Thank you for a great lotion. Vivian Stevens</li>
    <li> Smelt more like honey and rancid oranges than orange blossoms. Really looking for an edible cream like Yume Blush Orange body cream.</li>
    <li> Love this smell of this lotion.  Great for hands, knees and shoulders after evening shower.  My experience has been that it helps me rest better and sleep easier at night.  First became familiar with it in a small store in another town while on vacation.  Could not locate it at home.  Amazon is the best place to find little known, unique and hard to find products.  Also, sales or package deals made this purchase even more attractive.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream!  It&#x27;s intoxicating!</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t overly moisturizing.  If using as a hand lotion, please be aware that it takes time to sink in and you will leave fingerprints all over everything you touch until then.  It won&#x27;t last through a hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with this product was the smell.  I do agree with previous reviewers that compared this to SweetTarts, but the dry down has an artificial, almost rancid quality that I can&#x27;t stomach.  I threw this away before I finished half because the smell was so overwhelming.</li>
    <li> have been using this lotion for years........absolutely love it !!</li>
    <li> It smells just like fresh squeezed orange juice. Makes my hands nice and soft without any stickiness or residue. I really like the high quality and natural ingredients. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was because the scent is on the sweeter side, and I would prefer it just a little milder.</li>
    <li> This product not only has a great fragrance that is clean smelling, is not greasy nor oily, makes the skin feel silky (like one is giving a moisture treatment to the skin) and this product adds lasting moisture and fragrance.  It did arrive on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> As others mentioned, the smell is &amp;#34;unusual.&amp;#34; In fact, so much so that I really can&#x27;t use it--it&#x27;s overly cloying, strangely sweet and has final notes of musk that aren&#x27;t any more pleasant than the initial hit of dying flowers. Sadly this wasn&#x27;t any orange or honey fragrance I&#x27;ve ever smelled in nature, just a very fake, chemically enhanced, man-made scent instead. I think the lotion itself works well, but the smell is just too much for me; glad I only purchased a small size.</li>
    <li> Love love love the fragrance of this lotion and it&#x27;s moisturizing quality.  I use it on my hands during the dry winters and its lovely.  I purchased two large pump bottles and a small tube for my purse.  Wonderful product for those who enjoy a lemony fragrance and don&#x27;t like heavy perfumed lotions.</li>
    <li> it makes me skin feel so soft, and it&#x27;s not greasy! The scent is very nice and unique. I can smell it on me all day.</li>
    <li> VERY strong smell..too perfumy for me. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like oranges or honey to me</li>
    <li> SMELLS WONDERFUL. SO SOFT AND SILKY</li>
    <li> I buy this lotion again and again because it is an awesome lotion for hands and body. It is full of good for you ingredients, with none of the bad stuff. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Excellent hand cream. Love the way it feels. Love the way it smells. The 6.7 ounce tube is the better value. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It is not only soothing, but smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It makes my hands feel soft without the greasy feeling.  I also love the fact that it smells like sweet tarts.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
    <li> This must be the best smelling hand lotion ever! I would say it smells like pez candy. It hydrates my skin well, too. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This moisturizing lotion is AWESOME!!  I love using this daily and carrying it with me for using whenever possible.  Love the smell of it also, so refreshing and makes my skin so nice and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for my purse. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used. I work at a job where I wash my hands a lot and this product works really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;And I love the smell! It smells like Smarties/Sweetarts!</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin so soft and smells so good, bought as a gift for my mom and had to get another for myself to.</li>
    <li> This is clean smelling and goes on nicely..not greasy. I like that it is natural. This product was shipped quickly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter</li>
    <li> This product is so rich that a little dab will moisturize a large area.  It smells so clean and fresh!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff- it&#x27;s not greasy and smells great. Lasts a long time too!</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion.  It smells so good!  Actually smells alot like sweettarts the candy.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone that likes a lotion that smells sweet and thats almost all organic.</li>
    <li> I found this lotion in a little gift shop in TN and was thrilled to discover you also carry it.  Excellent hand lotion!</li>
    <li> You may like the non-greasy texture of this pleasant, light hand lotion. But for a \\&quot;honey\\&quot;-containing item, it has a strong fragrance that I found a little disconcerting.</li>
    <li> Really like this product for my hands.  Keep in nightstand and always put on before i go to bed.  I abuse my hands all day and this feels so good to them!</li>
    <li> I just bought a tube of this the other day and it is without a doubt the BEST lotion I have EVER purchased! I wish I could buy it in gallon jugs - that&#x27;s how good it is and smells!  Well worth EVERY penny!  I am absolutely hooked!</li>
    <li> This stuff has okay scent (I hate the smell of honey, and it&#x27;s stronger than I expected), but mostly, it&#x27;s just super greasy. I can&#x27;t stand it. The residue stays on my hands until I wash them, and then... what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying again!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I live in a dry climate where daily moisturizing is a must. Absorbs quickly, not greasy, nice refreshing fragrance.</li>
    <li> This lotion not only smells wonderful but also makes your hands or feet feel silky smooth.  It really softens the rough spots/callous on my hands.  Would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I happened to see this at a tourist area and bought some to try it because it smelled so good and it felt so nice when I tried it. I absolutely love it..It stays on and your skin feels so nice and silky. I just love it. I got on Amazon to see if it was sold on here and was very happy to see that it is so got to get some ordered so that I don&#x27;t run out. Just glad Amazon has it. Try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is GREAT... probably the best I have ever owned. It is super moisturizing and it feels really nice on the skin. Absorbs completely. It also smells really good too. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service, great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion after trying a co-worker&#x27;s.  It has an unusual fragrance that I like.  The lotion goes on well and is not greasy or sticky.  It lasts a long time on your hands and makes them very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> i love this cream.it softens my hands and especially my rough winter elbows.i gave it to my friends and they love the smell and that is organic from bees.Friends have been ordering the Lavender scent now.</li>
    <li> In love it smells amazing and works great doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or anything</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought, but be careful on the size you buy, because for what I paid for this I could&#x27;ve got the 7 oz tube.</li>
    <li> Very light fruity smell. Feels great too. Bought one for my desk and one for my purse. Don&#x27;t even use perfume anymore</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Naked Bee products, and I think the Orange Blossom Honey lotion might just be my favorite of all of them.  Very moisturizing without feeling greasy.  A great light scent.  And best of all, I feel great about using Naked Bee products on myself and my little ones.  I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful to rub on your hands and arms.  The scent is delicious!  This was a gift for my sister as she had given me the Lavender Scent for my birthday.</li>
    <li> For the size (I should have paid more attention) it is not worth the price at all.  Has a bad smell and the ingredients are not all that great.  It kinda smells like feet that have not been washed and then you put lotion on them..just yuck.</li>
    <li> Again, like many other reviews, I did not look at all the fine print and did not notice the size was the 2.25 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My error, but I&#x27;ll be returning the product even if postage is more than the cost - - it looks like Epic Sales Group catches quite a few purchasers not listing the product size on the product line.</li>
    <li> I first tried this lotion when a friend gave me some in the middle of a Wisconsin winter when my hands were starting to crack.  I had to buy it when I found it on Amazon!  It has a light orange blossom scent, that is sweet, but not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;.  The lotion isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> Creamy and rich and moisturizing. It goes on smoothly and feels and smells good. It is a good value and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is delightfully refreshing in scent and is not greasy. One application lasts through a few hand washings, though the scent does fade.</li>
    <li> Originally saw this product at a museum gift shop.  It smells wonderful, is thick, soaks in, and I feel its smoothness all day, or through the night. The smell is not overpowering, and would probably not cause an asthma attack.  Lovely product and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Best hand/body lotion I have found!  The only lotion I have found that moisturizers without leaving me feeling greasy!  Wonderful!</li>
