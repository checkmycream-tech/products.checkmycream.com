    <li> i can&#x27;t see that it does anything.  not worth the money.  would not recommend nor buy again.  total waste of money.</li>
    <li> use daily --get fewer wrinkles</li>
    <li> This works real well if you use it twice a day.  Im not sure if it is the real Hydroderm that I ordered off TV.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money!!  Judy Ramsey</li>
    <li> Cannot see any real difference in skin or wrinkles.  Lot of money for little result  Would not recommend product or use again</li>
    <li> I really did not think this would work when I frist got it .I started using Hydroderm original age defying wrinkle serum and in about 2 weeks my wrinkles and fine lines were almost gone .I am 47 years old and looks much younger .I would recommend this product to anyone . I just loves it .Thank you Amazon for selling this wonderful product .</li>
    <li> Works fairly well, but there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice difference in appearance or condition of my skin. Disappointed I spent most of my gift card on the product.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Been using it for years</li>
    <li> I have used this product faithfully and nothing has changed at all. It&#x27;s like another review mentioned, it&#x27;s like applying water to your face.</li>
    <li> Hydroderm Original Age Defying Wrinkle Reducer is a great product.  I saw results immediately.  My skin is softer and my wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great product -- it works!</li>
    <li> Awful!&lt;br /&gt;NO results!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item it was with the understanding that it was the product as advertised. When I received it, I soon discovered it was not the same product. I have tried to communicate with the seller but the seller has terminated email communications with me. I am very frustrated that the seller has tried to sell an item that is mis-advertised. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Hydroderm always works well.  I have been using it for years and it really helps my skin. I first noticed the effects when I used it on my hands. I received the package promptly and was please with the item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly a month and have not seen any difference in my skin but I&#x27;m not sure how long you need to use before seeing any changes. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing again as there are many other products on the market. I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago along with the eye serum.  I use this system along with two other systems so I don&#x27;t use this product every single day. I&#x27;m not sure about the results but using it along with my other products I am hoping long term to keep the wrinkles at bay.  I am 44 years old and a sun worshiper. I can say I am pretty much wrinkle free so what I&#x27;m doing seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Hydroderm Age-Defying Wrinkle Serum in the past and decided to try the Wrinkle Reducer this time.It has a different consistency.  I&#x27;m not sure whether or not it is better or if I can even tell any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Hydroderm to replenish collagen hoping for long term effects even though immediate ones are not noticeable.</li>
    <li> I ordered Hydroderm a long time ago. I used it faithfully and didn&#x27;t know whether it was working or not, but my daughters kept telling me my skin was &amp;#34;so nice&amp;#34; (for my age, of course)!&lt;br /&gt;I ran out and didn&#x27;t have the funds to keep getting it regularly. After a couple of months I noticed lines all over my face that I had never seen before! They were disturbing, especially in certain light conditions. I thought it was old age creeping up and couldn&#x27;t do anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to go online and see how much it was costing. I found a good deal and ordered a bottle. I started noticing a difference the first month. I am going to try to keep using it. I really think it works!</li>
