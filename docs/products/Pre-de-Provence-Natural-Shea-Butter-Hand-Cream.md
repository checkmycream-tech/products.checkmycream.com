<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I guess I have fairly dry skin in general, but I felt like it was really aging my hands, so I bought this lotion to keep in my desk at work (where I use chalk all day).  After about a week of daily use my hands look and feel much softer (someone even complimented me on the softness of my hands!).  I now use it only when my hands feel dry, but my skin looks and feel healthier even without daily use.  The lemon verbena smell is also amazing.</li>
    <li> I found this at a fancy hotel in Florida and I live it. My absolute favorite</li>
    <li> Very good!It can be a very good repair cracking of my hand!</li>
    <li> Ordered this cream because it sounded very similar to the L&#x27;Ocittane 20% shea lotion that I use and love but came in a bigger size (2.5oz vs 1oz) and was cheaper. Bad decision. Used it once and my hands started itching. I&#x27;m still a little itchy, 3 days later. The verbena scent was a little bit overwhelming too, not mild as mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my Grandmother she lives in a cold dry area and her hands crack. She says the cracks have healed and it smells delightful. I loved that it was all natural. And Safe for her sensitive skin. Would highly recommend this product to friends and even a stranger in the grocery store looking at lotion for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Very much. Light taste, is better in this winter</li>
    <li> Reading a lots of good reviews and think to give a trial. It is ok. I was not super impressed. However, as long as it is natural, I am fine with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shea creams including the L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter 20%. I prefer the feel of this rich cream by Pre de Provence, which absorbs quickly and also leave less residue. My hands are still soft, even after washing hands many times throughout the day. Great for feet as well. The smell is a true Lemon verbena, bright and lemony, not perfumy. I became hooked on this hand cream from the 1oz size, which I bought at a local spa and is great for carrying in my purse. Stocking up on the larger size now.</li>
    <li> Pre de Provence is one of the best hand creams I&#x27;ve ever used.  Being in the midwest, winter can be very drying, and this helps so much.  Never disappointed with this brand.</li>
    <li> This shea butter hand cream is indispensable for me. I have very dry hands, and washing them with soap just leaves them feeling like they&#x27;re about to crack open. The hand cream deals with that, and is non-greasy -- it also doesn&#x27;t leave that weird slick texture that lots of lotions advertized as &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; will. I love it. I have a tube at my desk, and by my bed, and a little tube in the junk drawer in the kitchen, and finally another little tube in my purse. I usually get the lavender scent, but the verbena is nice as well.</li>
    <li> Okay scent, a bit like lemon cleaning products, but not offensive.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This cream smells exactly like the moist towelettes you get at KFC and on airplanes. I&#x27;m a little disappointed it isn&#x27;t something more unusual, but it&#x27;s not a bad scent and it fades fairly soon. The cream works well, it&#x27;s thick/heavy but not greasy.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this product...it gives a Very nice sheen to my skin (without being greasy). This is also my first time using this scent. The scent is heavenly just wish it was stronger and would last longer. Recommend.</li>
    <li> The hand cream is great but I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance. Verbena is not my favorite scent by a long shot. But the hand cream is wonderful. I&#x27;ll use up the tube and get another fragrance next time.</li>
    <li> Feels great and smells delicious. Despite the price, you&#x27;re getting what you pay for.  Six more words required, but I think I&#x27;ve said it all.</li>
    <li> We live on a ranch in New Mexico and our hands get dry dry dry.  This hand cream really moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling.  It is the best.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well, but leaves your hands a bit greasy for a few minutes.  It smells great and is comparable to Loccitane.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Absorbs well and my hands feel soft long after without a greasy feeling.  Smells wonderful too! Can&#x27;t beat Amazon Pricing!</li>
    <li> Smells good, does the job. This is one of the higher priced &amp;#34;spreads&amp;#34; (i.e., lotions) but it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  I found it once on vacation in TN a few years ago and once I used the bottle, I could not find it anywhere.  I was THRILLED to find this stuff again and I will be a lifetime user.  I only wish I could get a discount for buying in bulk...</li>
    <li> I have been buying Pre de Provence lotions for years and this particular 20% cream verbena is my favorite! I find that at $10.00 on Amazon the price is more than fair for this exceptional quality.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Occitane products, but they are pretty costly, so thought I would try this brand.  It is half the cost, but it is a comparable product.  I have bought a few tubes for gifts as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first item from Pre de Provence but not the last. This hand cream is exactly like the ones made by Loccitane though much cheaper. Leaves my hands nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this hand cream. The smell is a light citrus and the cream makes my hands feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my purse. I use hand cream all the time due to dry skin. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This works great, and smells even better.  I have very dry, flakey skin.  After using this, my hands are soft and smooth.  And, the bonus is that it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was slightly cheaper than the L&#x27;Occitane shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the same &amp;#34;20% Shea Butter&amp;#34; but this one leaves my hands greasy feeling and shiny, as opposed to the L&#x27;Occitane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for dry climates!  It penetrates gently and does not have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on gently and evenly</li>
    <li> Loved how it made my hands feel, but smelled just a little bit like baby poop to me. Maybe I&#x27;m crazy (I am pregnant, so smells are setting me off), but I can&#x27;t use it because of the scent.</li>
    <li> My hands feel soft all winter using this hand cream it is my favorite</li>
    <li> I bought L&#x27;occitane shea butter hand cream over Christmas and love it.  This product is billed to be the same as their hand cream but hands down isn&#x27;t.  The scent smells awkward and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the L&#x27;occitane product.  I will not buy this again.  I really should return it as I don&#x27;t think I can tolerate the smell!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Verbena and that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was a good buy - a one ounce tube usual cost $10, but I was able to get 2.5oz for about the same price.</li>
    <li> gorgeous scent, not cheap and chemically. Love the creamy consistency. Not a light watery lotion, but a thicker cream. love it.</li>
    <li> nothing special in terms of working for a dry skin, and this cream smells very heavy and awfull. I do not like it.</li>
    <li> Very mositurizing and the lemon verbena smells divine.</li>
    <li> Best hand-cream on the market. The scent is very subtle but appealing, even to frangrance-sensitive noses. The cream absorbs very quickly into the skin and does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I buy it all the time ... the best!</li>
    <li> Great price for an excellent hand cream that smells wonderful!  I&#x27;d order again, especially for this price.  Arrived quickly too.</li>
    <li> Truly the only hand cream my husband can use on his severely cracked hands.. His myeloproliferative disorder, PV, makes his hands crack open whenever they are in water or outside in the winter.</li>
    <li> Very nice, refreshing scented hand cream with shea butter for moisturizing dry hands.  I carry this one in my purse.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, just a little pricey for me</li>
    <li> I was given this lotion as a gift and liked it so much that, when I ran out of it, I wanted to purchase it for myself. The product I received, however, does not have the same scent as the one I had previously. I actually don&#x27;t like the scent of this lotion much at all. The lotion works well, but based on the scent I would not purchase this particular item again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002SB8UG0 Pre de Provence 20% Shea Butter Hand Cream, Verbena, 1-Ounces Tube]]I had been using L&#x27;Occitane 20% Shea butter, which is quite expensive so&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try the Pre de Provence hand cream. I have Raynaud&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Syndrome so my fingertips are always cracked and dry. The Pre de&lt;br /&gt;Provence cream at half the price, was almost as good as the L&#x27;Occitane.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Already knew this product.  It&#x27;s the bomb.  Nice gift.</li>
    <li> I keep a tube of this in my bag for work - it&#x27;s a great lotion that can be used yearround and the Verbena smell is fresh but not overpowering.  The tube is made out of alumnimum (or some lightweight malleable metal) which I appreciate because it doesn&#x27;t leak in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful lotion so soothing and it smells so good. It arrived on time, I just love it!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe its just me, but it smells kinda weird. it does okay on moisturize your hands. I would try another brand next time though.</li>
    <li> Rich hand cream, unparalleled fragrance. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hand cream! Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of Pre de Provence, and their hand creams are no exception!  Great smelling, rich and long lasting!  They are all about quality products.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is amazing! I got a 2oz tube and fell in love with it the first time I used it. Yes, the scent is great, but there are many lotions and creams that smell nice. What I love is how it feels and makes my hands feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience the usual greasy feeling that I normally do with other hand creams. It absorbed very well! My hands are so soft and even feel that way after a good washing!</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I use.I am a healthcare professional and wash my hands every 15 minutes. I tried a lot of different creams for hands by different makers.This is the most superior of all of them.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels wonderful! I am very picky about my hand lotion and hate lotion that feels the least bit greasy.  This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve felt, and I have certainly sampled a lot of lotions.  My son loves it too.  The verbena has a fairly pronounced but pleasant lemon smell.  I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells and do wish I could have gotten this 20% shea in unscented, but it wasn&#x27;t available.
