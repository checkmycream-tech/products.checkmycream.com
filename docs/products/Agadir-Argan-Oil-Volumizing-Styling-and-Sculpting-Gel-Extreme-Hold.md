    <li> I have recently discovered the many benefits of using Argan oil.  I use the Agadir shampoo and conditioner, finally after all these years I have found my new permanent hair products.  I have short, course, thick, naturally curly/frizzy hair.  Using the shampoo I have already noticed a difference in the texture of my hair, reduced frizziness and a luster shine.  This gel just gives me that extra little hold I need, instead of using a heavy hair spray, without weighing it down or making my hair look oily. I love all things Argan.</li>
    <li> for me great product for volume</li>
    <li> This gel is great. It minimizes frizz and defines my curls perfectly. I did not need to use a lot of it and my hair was not stiff at all. The tube is a little awkward to use but good for controlling product amount. It works much better for me for my wash and go than the eco-styler gel.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair, not recommended for fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smells great &amp; works great.</li>
    <li> Made my daughters curls tighten and become hard</li>
    <li> Leaves too much build up. Didnt like it</li>
    <li> I will never use &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; again. This works so much better for my hair, smells great and given that I transitioned to being natural it works really well when I decide to do a wash n go. I mix this and Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner and my curls are poppin !!!! Plus Amazon of course as almost always has things at a greater and cheaper price !!! This will FOREVER be a staple product for my hair !!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have fine hair and when I use Agadir Argan Oil Volumizing I feel like I have so much hair even though it&#x27;s fine.  After washing my hair I squeeze a few drops in my hand and then massage it into the roots.  A little goes a long way.  After blowing my hair dry my hair feels very natural and full. It not only works it smells wonderful. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I applied it out of the shower with wet hair and blow dryed my hair. It left my curly hair sticky/oily/heavy feeling, with no definition. I tried using it a few different times using varying amounts of product (wanted to give it a good chance) but I ended up giving the bottle to my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Solid product. My hair is kept smooth while given form and volume. Exactly what I was going for.</li>
    <li> It gives an excellent hold and conditions at the same time.  It smells nice and I love it.  Don&#x27;t use too much - it only takes a little.</li>
    <li> This gel is great - not sticky or heavy.  Love the volume it gives.  Easy to style with it too!</li>
    <li> I love the Agadir product line and this was a great addition to my collection!  I absolutely love the scent and it provides great hold for my curls without being sticky or causing tangles.  I highly recommend this product line!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little lighter and less gucky than most hair gels so it gives hair volume and hold. I am going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product gives my fine hair much needed volume!  I told my hairdresser about it and he now stocks it too!</li>
    <li> My daughter is a  prominent hair consultant and had me try this product. To my surprise, I became very found of the entire Agadir line and this is all I use. My hair is baby fine and hard to manage. Well not anymore.</li>
    <li> I recently began using Agadir Argan Oil Shampoo and wanted a styling product to match the shampoo. Naturally, I tried Agadir Styling Gel, and I have been completely satisfied with it. The scent matches the scent of my shampoo, and it does indeed hold my hair in place all day. A little bit goes a long way, so it is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell and like most products boast of the argan oil content for shine.  The Xtreme hold is an exaggeration for for this gel, smooth, soft styling and large tube.</li>
    <li> really works well for thin hair</li>
    <li> This is really sticky stuff, so if your more into a more natural looking hold this may be a little over the top. If you are into extreme hold, then you will like this product.</li>
    <li> as expected since I have been using</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  It really holds my hair in place and minimizes frizz.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product. Gives my hair more hold and smells good</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome. It defines my 3c curly hair and gives it nice volume. My new staple gel!</li>
