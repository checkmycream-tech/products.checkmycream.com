### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The handle is excellent and the appearance is as well.  </li>
      <li>and it gives an excellent shave!</li>
      <li>The appearance and handle are wonderful, the razor is not.</li>
      <li>An affordable razor made in Italy that works great...</li>
      <li>The handle is nice and hefty and the butterfly doors work perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great razor.</li>
      <li>Awesome nice close shave...</li>
      <li>and I was so happy with it</li>
      <li>a surprisingly aggressive shave using a Derby blade...</li>
      <li>i&#x27;d avoid this one, folks; looks nice, but you may not be happy...</li>
      <li>Build quality is good</li>
      <li>was really good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of look and feel, it is beautifully chrome plated and a nice weight for me at 3.1 ounces - somewhat heavier than most of my razors.  </li>
      <li>The first shave was excellent.</li>
      <li>and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>The handle is 0.45 inches in diameter and balances nicely where the knurled shaft meets the bulb beneath the head.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about medium on the aggression scale, so it&#x27;s very efficient, and it gives very good audible feedback.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better values you will find for shaving.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>The razorock tto is a more aggressive razor and will give you the closer shave you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
      <li>Excellent shave with Shark blades, better than my old Gillette that I  have had for 55 years,  now my primary razor.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful razor, I had ordered the RazoRock Jaws open comb razor which gives me a nice smooth shave</li>
      <li>with this one I get a closer shave and no razor burn, this razor is more aggressive than my mission.</li>
      <li>I find it very easy to grip and manipulate this razor with exactness, which I think results from a combination of effective knurling, a nice balance point, and a somewhat large diameter handle.  </li>
      <li>A decent TTO razor that is a bit aggressive and shaves great.</li>
      <li>Best shave in a long time.</li>
      <li>love the weight and length of the razor and the door open smoothly, for the money this is a very good razor.</li>
      <li>ejde89 is a fine, well made razor and is indeed intended for beginners.</li>
      <li>grip feels a bit too fine, so it feels like sandpaper rather than grippy -- to where you don&#x27;t want to grasp it tightly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>not worth to return this considering its cost - wish i had gotten a good one - good luck to you</li>
      <li>the huge blade exposure makes it feel like you are dragging a pop can across your face not a blade.  </li>
      <li>I have been shaving for many years, and I have rarely cut myself.</li>
      <li>affordable, attractive and solidly built, but doesnt shave well  </li>
      <li>Outstanding -  &#x27;just right amount of aggressiveness&#x27; yet still smooth and nick free two way shave.  </li>
      <li>When I ordered this product, there was a problem with billing, but the seller responded quickly, and was able to steer me in the right direction.</li>
      <li>It has a nice weight to it which makes it easier to shave with,  also love the twist to open feature.  </li>
      <li>It has given me great BBS shaves with minimal treadwear, which is the acid test of any razor for me.  </li>
      <li>I checked my grip on the razor handle, and I hold the razor near the end of the handle, not at the top, so I don&#x27;t see how my grip could loosen the doors.</li>
      <li>Gives a great shave everyday with some classic barbasol shaving cream in a can.</li>
      <li>Part of the enjoyment of DE shaving is the sound it makes, but this thing is ridiculously loud and again sounds like Tin or a pop can going over the face.  </li>
      <li>With the knowledge that this is NOT adjustable, I was willing to give it a shot for the price</li>
      <li>Your product really does Rock!</li>
      <li>I ordered an ej de89 thinking a higher priced razor would enhance my experiance.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive for what you get!</li>
      <li>I can get a two pass shave and BBS on my face and neck with many of the more aggressive razors in my den with less irritation by far.</li>
      <li>I was even able to shave the areas that are usually problems for me (around lips, under nose, neckline) easily.</li>
      <li>My first straight edge razor was an Edward Jagger.</li>
      <li>By the way you will be amazed at how well these razors are constructed for the small price they cost, I fact they are both better and give me a closer and comfortable shave then my $98.00 Merkur adjustable.</li>
      <li>So I was really keen to try a modern stainless twist-to-open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;3. feels cheap, no indication of country of origin or materials - razor is only 10 grams heavier (88 grams) than the tiny Parker travel razor or 20 grams heavier than the cheap Chinese-made Weishi 9306E twist-to-open razor</li>
      <li>the real reason I&#x27;ve stowed it away for over 6 months now is because it is just too aggressive for me.  </li>
      <li>Customer service is prompt and very curteous.</li>
      <li>That is how much I like this TTO.  </li>
      <li>really wanted to like this razor</li>
      <li>I really like the idea of a TTO stainless, which is a throwback to the classic days of safety razors (albeit before my time).  </li>
      <li>The razorock Classic met my expectations for a TTO razor.</li>
      <li>Highly recomended</li>
      <li>The edge of blade will have too much of the vibrating action that makes it work as a scraper instead of a cutter.</li>
      <li>the butterfly razor heads are usually made with smaller combs than three piece razors which makes  butterfly razors to have unique shaving experience that is not too mild nor too agressive.</li>
      <li>I will say that I have tried the Chinese &amp;#34;One Touch&amp;#34;, as seen on tv drugstore special razor, and at a little less than the cost of this, it is a better razor.</li>
      <li>I find it much easier to use, especially with the butterfly blade opening feature</li>
      <li>Works very well, and is solidly built.</li>
      <li>In other words, the blade is closer to the comb on one side than the other, which I&#x27;m sure will result in an uneven, if not bloody shave.  </li>
      <li>I decided to order this classic twist open to put in my travel shave kit,</li>
      <li>I double checked the mechanism, and  it seems to tighten down securely.</li>
      <li>in mind I&#x27;d only been using a safety razor for a year when I bought this, specifically a Merkur Progress (normal handle).  </li>
      <li>I personally have been recently letting my other butterfly model which Is called ll Ceppo razor a bit loose,something can only be done with butterflies, to give the blade some freedom of glide over the skin and have been getting better results</li>
      <li>This thing destroys and tears up my neck and no other razor in my collection does that.  </li>
      <li>However, for the price of return shipping, versus the cost of the product, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>

<li> However, for the price of return shipping, versus the cost of the product, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
<li> This is the only razor I have shaved with so far since it arrived, and I have other razors that also work well for me:  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad, because this is a heavy, beautifully finished razor, and the fist shave</li>
<li> The overly long handle and the aforementioned destruction of my neck makes this something I wish I would not have purchased.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d say the razor is \\&quot;middlishly\\&quot; aggressive - about as aggressive roughly speaking as an Above the Tie medium head,</li>
<li> The handle is too long for a TTO and the head is cumbersome.  </li>
<li> However, the &amp;#34;post/bar&amp;#34; that  the blade fits over is crooked when closed.  </li>
<li> The razor head could have been better plated but nothing too bad especially for the price.</li>
<li> I gave it several months, at least one month dedicated and the rest of the time in &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34;, and tried blades like Astra SP (my go-to), Gillette Silver Blue, 7&#x27;0clock Green, Shark, Wilkinson Sword and even the Dorco and Derby blades that I&#x27;d previously written off as not sharp enough.  </li>
<li> The safety bar with the little combs (the part that glides against your face) doesn&#x27;t look like it was machined properly.  </li>
<li> awkward to unload - has a hollow, lightweight handle and twists to open from &#x27;top&#x27; of ribbed section of handle; this section is obviously of thin metal (possibly aluminum?)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a while and wanted to try a TTO.  </li>
<li> It is not very well made.  </li>
<li> Also, when the blade is in place and the butterfly doors are closed, they don&#x27;t line up.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Someone gave me this model to start me in wet shaving, and as I began to appreciate the benefits of this form of shaving</li>
<li> ; you have to grasp the extremely small &#x27;ball&#x27; underneath the blade to open the razor - not fun if your hands are wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The razor is just over 4 inches from the base to the top of the butterfly head, which is both convenient to use and which places the blade</li>
<li> nothing too crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this little guy an average of 4-5x a week</li>
<li> I have been shaving with this for a little over two weeks</li>
<li> here are a few things i found out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I have not had to mess with it in any way aside from the usual cleaning.  </li>
<li> sometimes 3 when I&#x27;m living dangerously, but with this TTO, it was just too hard to get a smooth shave without irritating the skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read some positive reviews on this product, so it may just be the proverbial one bad apple in the barrel.  </li>
<li> but, This thing has way too much blade exposure in a bad way.  </li>
<li> so I can use my new razor and when it was all said and done; I was surprisingly disappointed and found myself missing my razorock</li>
<li> This butterfly however, has an awkward head that does not have the curvature that any double edge razor should have.</li>
<li> and I have been using this razor now for the past 5 weeks without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks RazorRock!</li>
<li> However, on the 2nd and 3rd shave, the silo doors loosened, resulting in me cutting myself badly.</li>
<li> bad quality control - razor arrived with flaking plating on bottom on handle</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a wonderful razor, I had ordered the RazoRock Jaws open comb razor which gives me a nice smooth shave and I was so happy with it I decided to order this classic twist open to put in my travel shave kit, But after trying this one I think I will just go ahead and put the open comb one in the kit.  By the way you will be amazed at how well these razors are constructed for the small price they cost, I fact they are both better and give me a closer and comfortable shave then my $98.00 Merkur adjustable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a while and wanted to try a TTO.  Build quality is good but, This thing has way too much blade exposure in a bad way.  It shaves like a slant but the huge blade exposure makes it feel like you are dragging a pop can across your face not a blade.  The handle is too long for a TTO and the head is cumbersome.  The handle is excellent and the appearance is as well.  This thing destroys and tears up my neck and no other razor in my collection does that.  A feather blade in this makes for a two pass shave on my face a breeze but it hammers my neck.  I can get a two pass shave and BBS on my face and neck with many of the more aggressive razors in my den with less irritation by far. The overly long handle and the aforementioned destruction of my neck makes this something I wish I would not have purchased.  Part of the enjoyment of DE shaving is the sound it makes, but this thing is ridiculously loud and again sounds like Tin or a pop can going over the face.  The appearance and handle are wonderful, the razor is not.</li>
    <li> It is not very well made.  Granted, it is not your high-end razor (you get what you pay for) at $25.00.  However, the &amp;#34;post/bar&amp;#34; that  the blade fits over is crooked when closed.  The safety bar with the little combs (the part that glides against your face) doesn&#x27;t look like it was machined properly.  Also, when the blade is in place and the butterfly doors are closed, they don&#x27;t line up.  The blade itself is crooked.  In other words, the blade is closer to the comb on one side than the other, which I&#x27;m sure will result in an uneven, if not bloody shave.  I haven&#x27;t even used it yet, as I am concerned with this last point.  I&#x27;ve read some positive reviews on this product, so it may just be the proverbial one bad apple in the barrel.  I thought about returning it, and maybe still should.  However, for the price of return shipping, versus the cost of the product, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it.  Lesson learned.  I will say that I have tried the Chinese &amp;#34;One Touch&amp;#34;, as seen on tv drugstore special razor, and at a little less than the cost of this, it is a better razor.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these. Works very well, and is solidly built. This is one of the better values you will find for shaving. Very inexpensive for what you get!</li>
    <li> Awesome nice close shave...</li>
    <li> I initially rated this razor as 5 stars. The first shave was excellent. However, on the 2nd and 3rd shave, the silo doors loosened, resulting in me cutting myself badly. I have been shaving for many years, and I have rarely cut myself. I double checked the mechanism, and  it seems to tighten down securely. I checked my grip on the razor handle, and I hold the razor near the end of the handle, not at the top, so I don&#x27;t see how my grip could loosen the doors. It&#x27;s too bad, because this is a heavy, beautifully finished razor, and the fist shave I got from it was really good. It&#x27;s about medium on the aggression scale, so it&#x27;s very efficient, and it gives very good audible feedback. I was even able to shave the areas that are usually problems for me (around lips, under nose, neckline) easily. I&#x27;m scared to try shaving with this razor again, however, so back it goes.</li>
    <li> I would definetely order from this seller again. Not only is the product as described, you are receiving a qualtiy product for a low price. When I ordered this product, there was a problem with billing, but the seller responded quickly, and was able to steer me in the right direction. Customer service is prompt and very curteous. I would encourage customers to buy from this seller, you will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> A decent TTO razor that is a bit aggressive and shaves great. The handle is nice and hefty and the butterfly doors work perfectly. The razor head could have been better plated but nothing too bad especially for the price. I recommend to someone looking for a bit aggressive TTO.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;d avoid this one, folks; looks nice, but you may not be happy... here are a few things i found out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. bad quality control - razor arrived with flaking plating on bottom on handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. awkward to unload - has a hollow, lightweight handle and twists to open from &#x27;top&#x27; of ribbed section of handle; this section is obviously of thin metal (possibly aluminum?) tubing, as it does not feel solid in the hand; you have to grasp the extremely small &#x27;ball&#x27; underneath the blade to open the razor - not fun if your hands are wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. feels cheap, no indication of country of origin or materials - razor is only 10 grams heavier (88 grams) than the tiny Parker travel razor or 20 grams heavier than the cheap Chinese-made Weishi 9306E twist-to-open razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gave a surprisingly aggressive shave using a Derby blade... not worth to return this considering its cost - wish i had gotten a good one - good luck to you - looks like a roll of the dice on this razor from this manufacturer</li>
    <li> The description says it is supposed to come with a trial of 5 blades, which it did not. I needed this.</li>
    <li> My first straight edge razor was an Edward Jagger. After daily use over 6 weeks, the chrome began to peel from the head. I contacted Edward Jagger customer service and received a reply within a week requesting photos and a summary of my daily routine of using it. I replied the same day with photos and details of use etc. I never head anything back after waiting now for 5 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase this razor instead (at a dramatically lower price) and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I find it much easier to use, especially with the butterfly blade opening feature and it gives an excellent shave! I have noticed no difference at all over the EJ and I have been using this razor now for the past 5 weeks without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks RazorRock! Your product really does Rock!</li>
    <li> This is the only razor I have shaved with so far since it arrived, and I have other razors that also work well for me:  That is how much I like this TTO.  It has given me great BBS shaves with minimal treadwear, which is the acid test of any razor for me.  I&#x27;d say the razor is \\&quot;middlishly\\&quot; aggressive - about as aggressive roughly speaking as an Above the Tie medium head, if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of look and feel, it is beautifully chrome plated and a nice weight for me at 3.1 ounces - somewhat heavier than most of my razors.  The handle is 0.45 inches in diameter and balances nicely where the knurled shaft meets the bulb beneath the head.  I find it very easy to grip and manipulate this razor with exactness, which I think results from a combination of effective knurling, a nice balance point, and a somewhat large diameter handle.  The razor is just over 4 inches from the base to the top of the butterfly head, which is both convenient to use and which places the blade exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like holding the RazoRock TTO, I like shaving with it, and I can&#x27;t believe the price!  In fact, the price seems so low in relation to the quality that I wonder how well this razor will hold up.  I will post an update if issues arise, but for now I am giving it a well earned five star rating.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of a TTO stainless, which is a throwback to the classic days of safety razors (albeit before my time).  With the knowledge that this is NOT adjustable, I was willing to give it a shot for the price offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind I&#x27;d only been using a safety razor for a year when I bought this, specifically a Merkur Progress (normal handle).  So I was really keen to try a modern stainless twist-to-open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip feels a bit too fine, so it feels like sandpaper rather than grippy -- to where you don&#x27;t want to grasp it tightly.&lt;br /&gt;But the real reason I&#x27;ve stowed it away for over 6 months now is because it is just too aggressive for me.  I keep my Progress around 2 - 2.5, sometimes 3 when I&#x27;m living dangerously, but with this TTO, it was just too hard to get a smooth shave without irritating the skin. I gave it several months, at least one month dedicated and the rest of the time in &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34;, and tried blades like Astra SP (my go-to), Gillette Silver Blue, 7&#x27;0clock Green, Shark, Wilkinson Sword and even the Dorco and Derby blades that I&#x27;d previously written off as not sharp enough.  I guess it would compare to my Progress set to about 4, but that&#x27;s too aggressive for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this razor, in fact I still like the idea of the razor.  I just don&#x27;t like the implementation of it.</li>
    <li> The razorock Classic met my expectations for a TTO razor. Gives a great shave everyday with some classic barbasol shaving cream in a can. An affordable razor made in Italy that works great...</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with this for a little over two weeks and I have no complaints.  It has a nice weight to it which makes it easier to shave with,  also love the twist to open feature.  I would say this is moderately aggressive but nothing too crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this little guy an average of 4-5x a week and I love it.  It has held up well and I have not had to mess with it in any way aside from the usual cleaning.  Highly recomended</li>
    <li> For the price of an ej or merkur you can buy two of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone gave me this model to start me in wet shaving, and as I began to appreciate the benefits of this form of shaving I ordered an ej de89 thinking a higher priced razor would enhance my experiance. Coincidently a friend was complaining about his multiblade shavers so I gave him my razorock (paying it forward) knowing I was expecting my ej in a couple of days. I eagerly awaited my scruff to grow so I can use my new razor and when it was all said and done; I was surprisingly disappointed and found myself missing my razorock tto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ejde89 is a fine, well made razor and is indeed intended for beginners. The razorock tto is a more aggressive razor and will give you the closer shave you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave with Shark blades, better than my old Gillette that I  have had for 55 years,  now my primary razor.</li>
    <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First shave today using Gillette Silver Blue blades &#x3D; Outstanding -  &#x27;just right amount of aggressiveness&#x27; yet still smooth and nick free two way shave.  This guy is hanging with my Jagger, Merkur and  Gillette 3 piece razors!! Recommend A+++++</li>
    <li> This is my second Razorock I have the mission as well, with this one I get a closer shave and no razor burn, this razor is more aggressive than my mission. love the weight and length of the razor and the door open smoothly, for the money this is a very good razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Best shave in a long time.</li>
    <li> affordable, attractive and solidly built, but doesnt shave well  the butterfly razor heads are usually made with smaller combs than three piece razors which makes  butterfly razors to have unique shaving experience that is not too mild nor too agressive. that is the reason why I chose them as my go to razors. This butterfly however, has an awkward head that does not have the curvature that any double edge razor should have. The edge of blade will have too much of the vibrating action that makes it work as a scraper instead of a cutter. I personally have been recently letting my other butterfly model which Is called ll Ceppo razor a bit loose,something can only be done with butterflies, to give the blade some freedom of glide over the skin and have been getting better results</li>
