<li> I would recommend this anyone the 16 oz bottles last you a long time.</li>
<li> a little goes a long way and it really does result in far less bumps if any!</li>
<li> but since this stuff is pricey I bought the one that was the cheapest, especially  since other sellers had single 16oz bottles for the same price I paid for this two pack.</li>
<li> so I can leave one in my bathroom and one in my husband&#x27;s (the berry scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long..</li>
<li> i have sensitive skin so its hard to find something that works well and doesnt leave a rash.</li>
<li> only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is because I&#x27;m not a fan of the pear berry scent, I&#x27;d recommend the green tea one -</li>
<li> Oh, and the 16oz bottle lasts me about 3 months, and this is after I learned 2 other people in my household have been using it without my knowledge, a little goes a long way with this stuff!&lt;br</li>
<li> I baught a small bottle of this cream at my local &amp;#34;dirty book store&amp;#34;, and paid a fortune !!!  </li>
<li> I have dark course hair and it softens it before and during shaving.</li>
<li> It cuts down on shaving rashes and in-grown hair.</li>
<li> i have thick long hair, and my hair has never felt softer.</li>
<li> Leaves little or no stubble.  </li>
<li> it will work if your shaving everyday or once a week!</li>
<li> I still get some bumps after shaving, but it is not as bad as it was when I used soap or standard shaving cream.</li>

    <li> Wife and I use this product when shaving body hair.  It is the best we have found. It cuts down on shaving rashes and in-grown hair.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It leaves my legs feeling super soft and a bottle last forever because all that is a super thin layer.</li>
    <li> Leaves little or no stubble.  Best shave product I&#x27;ve tried to date.  I even use it under my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a go, and I&#x27;m finding that it really does in fact work. With each shave the hair is getting finer and finer. My husband is starting to use it now.</li>

    <li> Amazing for shaving and even conditioning your hair :)</li>
    <li> I used coochy to shave my legs, bikini area, and underarm several years ago and loved it but then i kinda forgot about it until recently, after getting razor bumps. I purchased coochy rash free shave cream through amazon and now i can&#x27;t be with out it. a little goes a long way and it really does result in far less bumps if any! it goes on smooth and makes your skin feel softer than regular shave cream. I have dark course hair and it softens it before and during shaving. I would recommend this to anyone who shaves...men, women, teens. I use venus razor so i never get any nicks and adding this product has given me very good results.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and the Coochy shave cream is one of the few products that does react with my skin.  It makes shaving my legs so much easier with a lot less cuts and razor burn. I still get some bumps after shaving, but it is not as bad as it was when I used soap or standard shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Coochy shave cream is the best. I&#x27;ve never found anything that works this good!!!! You get no rash and your skin is super smooth.</li>
    <li> I loev using this product.  It truely leaves your skin feeling very smooth and not stubbly after you shave.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 9yrs!</li>
    <li> I love this formula. I ordered the two pack so I can leave one in my bathroom and one in my husband&#x27;s (the berry scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long.. so don&#x27;t worry about it being too feminine). Clean, close shave with no rash burn or ingrown hairs for all of your furry body parts. Everything a shave cream should do.</li>
    <li> i have been using this produce for almost 4 years now. i have sensitive skin so its hard to find something that works well and doesnt leave a rash. my husband bought the sample pack for me to try and i absolutly loved it! i works EVERYWHERE on the body. it protects your skin, and leaves it smooth and soft. it will work if your shaving everyday or once a week! i highly recommed this product.&lt;br /&gt;i have also used it as a hair conditioner. it worked wonderfully!!!! i have thick long hair, and my hair has never felt softer.</li>
    <li> I baught a small bottle of this cream at my local &amp;#34;dirty book store&amp;#34;, and paid a fortune !!!  Found this deal on Amazon, and the rest is history !!  Guys, get this for the wife of girlfriend, They will LOVE you for it !!!  I use it to shave with now....  Its GREAT !!</li>
    <li> This cream smells amazing!! Its nice and gental on my skin and I never cut myself. :-) It has a simpel pump system that never cloggs, leaks, or breaks. And the bottle lasts me for months.</li>
    <li> The company did a great job getting it to me on time.  I love the product, ordered two of them, but neither pump works so I have to pour it out and I seem to use more product that way.  The best thing I have found for shaving! Worth a try.</li>
