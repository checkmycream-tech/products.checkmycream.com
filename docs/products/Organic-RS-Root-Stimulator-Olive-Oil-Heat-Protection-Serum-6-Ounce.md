      <li>Pro - It works great against heat for those flat ironing their hair.</li>
      <li>I think it delivers higher quality though and does a better job than the non-greasy ones.</li>
      <li>I rarely straighten my hair, but when I do, this is my go-to product!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good product that I&#x27;ll most likely purchase again.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this and have found it sold at Walmart, Walgreens (which for some reason is really stepping up</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>this product works tremendously</li>
      <li>I can appreciate a nice healthy shine, however I don&#x27;t need any products that are going to wear my hair down.</li>
      <li>I flat iron or blow dry my hair and the results have been wonderful.  </li>
      <li>My family and i are going a more natural route</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>but it was well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This product came quickly and does EXACTLY what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I cannot go 2 weeks without washing my hair because after a week this product becomes very very greasy.</li>
      <li>a little oily but does good in the hair.</li>
      <li>I buy from Amazon all the time and this is my first review.</li>
      <li>I used this oil not sure how it would go, but I really liked it!</li>
      <li>and it makes it look smooth and natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first heat protector I bought and some others were not as greasy as this one.</li>
      <li>I originally found this in the \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair care section at Wal-mart and was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>It really goes above and beyond and is such a good value.</li>
      <li>It feels just like putting pure olive oil + honey in my hair.</li>
      <li>do not use a large amount at one time.</li>
      <li>I find myself having to wash my hair very often when using this.</li>
      <li>but if you hut too much it makes it greasy</li>
      <li>I really like this organic hair heat protection.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells really nice&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>My daughters have straight hair and they have no issues with it.</li>
      <li>Really does protect my hair from heat damage.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I can&#x27;t tell all that much difference when I use this product versus when I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Fine to use on damp or dry hair in my opinion.</li>
      <li>but mainly every 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Came extremely fast, considering I ordered this Saturday kind of late and here it is Tuesday.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend</li>
      <li>The smell is okay, but I&#x27;m definitely switching back to my old brand.</li>
      <li>/&gt;BE CAREFUL HOW MUCH YOU APPLY, IT WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR LOOK SUPER GREASY</li>
      <li>and i was in search for new hair care products.</li>
      <li>only use a little at a time but hair seems to stay healthy looking instead of burnt from straightening iron</li>
      <li>It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
      <li>I have frizzy, wild hair</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy/frizzy hair, and this does nothing for it, contrary to all of he reviews I read before deciding to purchase it to try it out.</li>
      <li>split ends so far</li>
      <li>I will only use this product now right after I have finished washing my hair prior to blow drying.</li>
      <li>Again, really make sure you put like a nickel to quarter size amount first and then start slowly and small from there.</li>
      <li>It does something strange with creating static electricity tho, and don&#x27;t use too much or it will drag your hair down and look greasy.</li>
      <li>Just be careful not to use too much.</li>
      <li>i have natural hair..and use this  product when I wear a weave just for different styling.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything positive or negative to say.</li>
      <li>Con - I on the other hand have curly hair, and I cannot use it throughout my whole</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this over any other heat protecting spray.</li>
      <li>I needed more because I&#x27;m down to maybe two or three quarter-sized amounts, which won&#x27;t be enough for my thick hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No matter how little I used, I got that old-school greasy hair affect. It seemed to intensify over the course of the day, so I actually had to wash my hair after all three uses, before I finally showed it to the trash. I finally had to cave and purchase the much more expensive product my salon uses to get the results I was seeking.</li>
    <li> Great product to use in protecting hair from heat. It is not a spray but a liquid. It has a light oil feeling and smells awesome.  You can use this on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I used BioSilk for years (when I could afford it) and loved the way it left my hair shiny and silky. But it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a heat protection product. This is the best of both worlds. It provides shine and protects against the heat. It smells great and leaves your hair nice and silky. I&#x27;ve used it after washing my hair and before flat ironing and as an every day heat protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy and oily, just the perfect amount of protection. I LOVE this and have found it sold at Walmart, Walgreens (which for some reason is really stepping up it&#x27;s ethnic hair products, yay!) and here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I buy from Amazon all the time and this is my first review. because I am completely in love with this product. It is amazing. I have very thick and wavy long hair, and I only need about a nickel size drop for all my hair, and there is enough product to last a very long time. The quality is amazing for the price, I haven&#x27;t used any hair product that has done everything I needed it to and more. It smooths and shines your hair without leaving any greasy residue, and it smells really wonderful. I would highly recommend this over any other heat protecting spray. It really goes above and beyond and is such a good value.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair nice and shiny. Great for daily use! Fine to use on damp or dry hair in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s like a serum that gives shine and smoothness. But I&#x27;m not sure in heat protection-wise. I guess it&#x27;s hard to tell whether or not a thermal protector is working. My hair still get damaged a little over time because I use curly iron quite often. But giving it some shine makes it look better. Anyway, I treat the product more of a shine serum</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Good for the hair when you&#x27;re hot curling or blow drying!!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy either!!!</li>
    <li> a little oily but does good in the hair. do not use a large amount at one time.</li>
    <li> Here are the positives and negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;Smells really nice&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply on hair evenly&lt;br /&gt;My hair has gotten better looking when I apply this before blow drying&lt;br /&gt;No split ends so far but I didn&#x27;t have any before I used this product either&lt;br /&gt;Good size and cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL HOW MUCH YOU APPLY, IT WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR LOOK SUPER GREASY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the first heat protector I bought and some others were not as greasy as this one. I think it delivers higher quality though and does a better job than the non-greasy ones. It&#x27;s also not greasy looking if you put in a SMALL amount. Again, really make sure you put like a nickel to quarter size amount first and then start slowly and small from there. Over all it&#x27;s a pretty good product that I&#x27;ll most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product for protecting hair against heating irons.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it provides protection and it allows your hair to look healthy by maintaining a shine. Love it.</li>
    <li> I originally found this in the \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair care section at Wal-mart and was very pleasantly surprised. It is a good product no matter your ethnicity. You only need to use a small amount and rub it all over..I sometimes do it before and after I straighten. I have frizzy, wild hair and it makes it look smooth and natural. Just be careful not to use too much. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great, leaves my hair shiny but not greasy and it really protects my hair considering I style it at about 400 degrees and have yet to see any type of heat damage</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and does EXACTLY what it says it does. I have very coarse hair and it smoothed everything out while adding moisture and shine. I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I really like it it makes your hair shiny protacts from heat really good but if you hut too much it makes it greasy and if you touch it sometimes your hands feel greasy</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and my daughters and I use it daily. Pro - It works great against heat for those flat ironing their hair. My daughters have straight hair and they have no issues with it. Con - I on the other hand have curly hair, and I cannot use it throughout my whole hair(doesn&#x27;t feel smooth. More like it&#x27;s too sticky).</li>
    <li> I love products from the Organic Root Stimulator line and this one is no exception.  I use it every time I flat iron or blow dry my hair and the results have been wonderful.  No stray or dry hair here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this serum is not greasy.  The last thing I want is for my hair to look like a grease pit.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using the serum I&#x27;ve seen a lot of changes in my hair when I am flat iron and blow drying it this product works tremendously well I definitely recommended it.</li>
    <li> My hair is soooooooo silky bc of this .</li>
    <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
    <li> only use a little at a time but hair seems to stay healthy looking instead of burnt from straightening iron</li>
    <li> I really like this organic hair heat protection. My family and i are going a more natural route and i was in search for new hair care products. This works great, leaves hair soft, smells fine too. Glad I purchased this and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used this oil not sure how it would go, but I really liked it! It smells good and made my hair very shiny. I have thin, fine hair, but it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look oily at all.</li>
    <li> I tried this, and don&#x27;t see how people like it. It feels just like putting pure olive oil + honey in my hair. It made my head feel so sticky, and was hard to wash off of my hands. I have naturally wavy/frizzy hair, and this does nothing for it, contrary to all of he reviews I read before deciding to purchase it to try it out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t always find it at Wal-Mart, and I have yet to see it in the beauty supply stores here. I needed more because I&#x27;m down to maybe two or three quarter-sized amounts, which won&#x27;t be enough for my thick hair. Smells awesome...Great feel and shine...Really does protect my hair from heat damage. One bottle lasts me for 6 months or less if I flat iron my hair once a week. Was packaged neat and tight. Came extremely fast, considering I ordered this Saturday kind of late and here it is Tuesday. Wasn&#x27;t due here for another 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product from this seller again. They seem to have several items I purchase anyway, so I might start buying other items in the near future as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time now..i have natural hair..and use this  product when I wear a weave just for different styling. I use it take help blend my hair with the weave..it works okay for about a week. I find myself having to wash my hair very often when using this. Everybody knows African Americans don&#x27;t wash their hair everyday. Maybe every week..but mainly every 2 weeks. I cannot go 2 weeks without washing my hair because after a week this product becomes very very greasy. Its really heavy and is not light on your hair at all even though I use tiny tiny amounts. I was curious about what other serums would do to my hair since this is the only one i have ever used. I switched over to a more expensive one..but it was well worth the money. Also this product does kind of product against heat for awhile but my hair still broke off from the flat iron. It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t have a problem with having to rewash your hair every 3 days.</li>
    <li> Love this product combined with Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Replenishing Conditioner. My hair is the softest ever! It does something strange with creating static electricity tho, and don&#x27;t use too much or it will drag your hair down and look greasy.</li>
    <li> This product left my thick brown hair looking and feeling OILY not shiny, even with the tiniest amount! I didn&#x27;t even dare use it long enough to tell if it actually protects from heat. The smell is okay, but I&#x27;m definitely switching back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> Very good product, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and works like a straightener lotion.</li>
    <li> Keep the good work going loved it</li>
    <li> This hair serum is amazing!!!!! Smells great and works. Just use a dime size amount! This bottle can go a long way. Not bad for the price. You may purchase it at any beauty supply store nearest you.</li>
    <li> It was a lot thicker than i expected on the hair. I can appreciate a nice healthy shine, however I don&#x27;t need any products that are going to wear my hair down. I will only use this product now right after I have finished washing my hair prior to blow drying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect.  I rarely straighten my hair, but when I do, this is my go-to product!  Timely delivery as well.</li>
    <li> I use the heat protection every day. But when i put this oil, my hair did not look shiny, smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy it again. If I can return I would do it.</li>
    <li> Love it, and the smell is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything positive or negative to say. I guess the smell is nice. Otherwise, I can&#x27;t tell all that much difference when I use this product versus when I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Made my hair softer, but didn&#x27;t control frizzies.  I must say that I have yet to find anything to control frizzies in humid southern Louisiana!</li>
