    <li> Thank you, There is not a better product, that I have found, for cleaning out the colon. Glad you sent it so fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the great reviews. But in my case this tea did not work for me. I have been using it for 2 weeks and nothing and the tea taste awful. Also I ordered 3 boxes of this tea and only got 1 then again the other 2 would have just been thrown away.</li>
    <li> My chiropractor introduced me to this product. Unfortunately for him I found it on amazon for less than he charges me. One tea bag makes enough for two days. Drink it before bed time for best results.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the advise of my Chiropractor to help relieve my occasional constipation. The flavor is nice, but make sure that you follow the direction exactly as they say or you could be sorry.</li>
    <li> This tea does exactly what it states it does. Stay close to a bathroom, you will not be disappointed.  It definitely works overnight!</li>
    <li> Chiro-klenz is gentle but efficient. I have used it for years, every other day to stay healthy. My doctor says it is a good way to stay regular and I don&#x27;t become immune to it.</li>
    <li> My mom had a problem with constipation all her life.This tea work gently, but surely.It is all natural.Higtly recomend to everybody!</li>
    <li> Great Tea.  Yes, it works.. prepare to drop the bomb of your life..</li>
    <li> Have been using this tea since 1993 for sluggish bowel. Works great.</li>
    <li> I use this tea for my monthly cleansing.  it doesnt make me sick and doesnt make my stomach hurt.  it is definitely the best ive had yet.</li>
    <li> Works very well and has a pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction every time and the product is great!</li>
    <li> Excellent tea. Tastes good, gentle on the system.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 years. It works very well but you need to be prepared to stay home the morning after you take it. It is powerful and you don&#x27;t want to be stuck in traffic when this kicks in! This product is much more powerful than other teas like this I have tried. I highly recommend it for a cleanse.</li>
    <li> Got for my wife, she loves this tea.  very healthy</li>
    <li> I really like this tea. It&#x27;s not my favorite flavored tea, but I bought it for the cleansing benefits. And it definitely works! The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about it is that  it is hard to measure the exact effect you are going to get. Sometimes the tea steeped a little longer. Other times I had more water. etc... and as a result sometimes it was a mild effect while other times it was strong. However, I suppose that would be the same with any cleansing tea and not particular to this product.  Still, I have tried the regular &amp; lemon flavor &amp; just ordered the cinnamon. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> i got this for a friend because they wanted it. i did my job. they have lots of claims for what it does, but really its only job is to help you poop. thats what it does and it tastes terrible and has no fda reporting because it&#x27;s herbal which is trash, but the people that drink it poop so it&#x27;s got that going for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant believe i have this on my account...... i doing this just to get rid of the emails telling me to review it... so belive what part of this you want, but if you drink this you will poop....</li>
    <li> Product came earlier than expected! Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love this tea. It is delicious, light and works. Planning to buy another large box.  Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> The best tea before going to bed each evening, I recommend it to everyone.  Give it a try right now, you won&#x27;t be a sorry!</li>

I had  very serious constipation problems and after trying so many different product this worked wonders for me. I use it at night and next day, I have no issues. When I first tried the lemon one, I had a few cramps the first day, it all went away after the second time I used it. I&#x27;m also doing Hcg diet, so my losses have been very good.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than anything on the market.  To top it off, it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t give me an upset stomach.  Great product luckily since I buy from you I can have it shipped directly to my mom as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now and it&#x27;s always worked great. But this time from this supplier, it&#x27;s done nothing for me. Why? I do not know. I&#x27;ve taken up to three servings a day and still nothing. Is this the real deal?</li>
    <li> Tastes great and i feel is really working!</li>
    <li> Love this tea. Drink it daily to cleanse my body of all the bad things. Caution. Drink it at night but be home the next day. Lol You don&#x27;t want to go off to work or out on this!! Love this it&#x27;s amazing. Keeps my weight down and if you have stomach issues it will help you too. I drink the lemon and cinnamon flavored.</li>

    <li> All met my expectations.  Very happy with chiro- Klein, steve malfeasance  It works. It helps me keep the weight off.</li>
    <li> This tea is a wonderful cleanse. If I have a cup around 9:00 pm, by 7:00 am I use the bathroom and feel better and not as bloated&lt;br /&gt;Irregular. Just be careful and make sure you use the bathroom at home before you leave because there isn&#x27;t much time to make it to a bathroom once you feel you need to go. Sorry TMI but would rather you know beforehand.</li>
