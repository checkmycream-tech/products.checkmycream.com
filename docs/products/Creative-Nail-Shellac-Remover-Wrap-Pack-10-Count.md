<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Huge bottle, it usually lasts me about a year doing my nails every two weeks. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad CND has made the bigger size bottle as this is an essential near-to-last step in the shellac process.</li>
    <li> I say &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; because I actually use my strengthening base coat, regular (even cheap!) polish and then this to top it off and it stays shiny for up to two weeks just like it says! I got bored with all the bland colors they want to use (the shellac colors are so limited!) so I tested and tested and finally found this method - been using it for months now and my nails are still strong (thanks to my base coat) and shiny thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> this is so easy and last so long.  i use the base and top coat gels with my own nail colors using the UV light it is so quick.</li>
    <li> Finally a large size bottle is on the market for both the Top Coat and the Base Coat. I am learning that it doesnt take a lot of the top coat you actually need to apply it very thin or else it will be thick and can lead to peeling off and clumpy humps especially if you are not careful around the edges of your nails. It is with practice and lots of applications I am learning more and more. I purchased all the items online and practice on my neighbor every two weeks and the most important tip when using the top coat that I can give is to keep it thin, your nails will look great and last longer!</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product on Amazon and had to get the supplies and give it a try. I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol. I also bought a 9 watt lamp instead of initially shelling out over $100 for the 36w and above. I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase. Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don&#x27;t have to shell out the money anymore for one. I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails. I clip my cuticles, file the nail, buff away the calluses on my feet, and then start the Gelish process. The only difference is that since I have the 9w lamp so I do 10 minutes instead of the 2 they suggest. It turns out perfect. I just bought 2 more colors. Pink Smoothie and Red Roses.  I didn&#x27;t buy the Shellac nail polishes because through reviews I read they have less colors to choose from.  So I decided to mix and match.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to do Shellac manicures at home.  Once this order was on the way I started researching colors and found that I preferred the Gelish colors over the Shellac so decided to risk mixing the Shellac top and base coat with the Gelish color.  So far so good....worked just as it was supposed to and so far no issues with chipping or lifting.  I also tried using the Shellac top coat over regularly painted toes that I did the day before the Shellac arrived.  I was just looking to get the ultra glossy top coat Shellac provides...also so far so good!   I love this product and so easy to use!</li>
    <li> Started doing Shellac nails myslef at home and I love it!!! My current at-home manicure is almost 3 weeks old and looks like it was done yesterday!  Love, love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using shellac for over a year at home now and my last bottle was empty so I had to order new and went with this larger size since I use much more top coat than any other polish. I don&#x27;t know if they have updated the formula for this or not but this new order is even more scratch/chip resistant and longer lasting than the smaller size bottle I bought last year. I had been getting up to 3 weeks of wear out of the last bottle but this new one has been on my toes for almost 2 months without any signs of wear. Also, I went to change my fingernail color after over 3 weeks and actually had to soak my nails in 100% acetone for twice as long as before to get through the top coat and really scrape it off with a manicure tool. I am very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Purchasing this product along with the base coat and the curing light will save me so much money in the long run by doing my own \\&quot;at home\\&quot; manicures. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the work of my manicurist, she is a miracle worker! but when I don&#x27;t have the time or the money to make it to the salon this is PERFECT!!</li>
    <li> Love shellac, I use two layers of the topcoat and it really protects my nails.</li>
    <li> When I purchased the product the brush was messed up and couldn&#x27;t be used. When I contacted the supplier they did nothing not even an email of apology for poor product quality.  I would have been happy with just a replacement brush but no contact to try to make it right by the vendor at all.  Since the brush couldn&#x27;t be used the top coat product itself was useless. I hesitate to purchase anything from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> this stuff works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 3 months now and love the results.  Your manicure and polish really do last up to 14 days. The larger size is also more convenient!  The shellac process is so fast to do at home, especially for those busy moms.</li>
    <li> I had a Shellac manicure applied the day before I left for vacation. I had a French manicure done using the Shellac products. My nails looked amazing afterwards. During my vacation I was at the beach, in and out of the pool, and I even climbed a large rock wall where I dug my hands and nails into the stubs on the wall. I was amazed when I jumped off the rock wall and my nails looked just like they did right after my manicure. I am also a firefighter. When I got home from my vacation I proceeded to put my nails through multiple drills with the fire department. I performed search and rescue, used a chain saw to cut a hole through a roof, and did bail-outs among other activities. In addition to all of this, I am a chiropractor and I did multiple adjustments with my manicure. Although my nails grew out, this manicure lasted for an ENTIRE MONTH and looked just like new each day! I painted the grown-out part of my nail with a matching color so that you could not see the growth. I will definitely get this type of manicure again. It survived salt and sand at the beach, concrete at the pool, a rock wall, and various firefighting drills. My nails were pretty long at the time of painting and they did not break at all during the whole month. I highly recommend this product!!!I forgot to add this as well. People in other reviews have mentioned something about not spending a lot of time on a keyboard. My boyfriend is in Afghanistan and I spend multiple hours every single night typing to him on Skype. Even through all of that abuse my manicure held up absolutely perfectly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d spent the past year paying $45 for a gel mani and pedi. Decided with the recession, I would curb my spending without sacrificing love for nice looking nails. Purchased this item as apart of my gel nail supply list (UV lamp, Axxium gel starter kit, Shellac Top Coat). Shiniest, most fabulous manicure I&#x27;ve ever had. I get soo many compliments. I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about the Shellac top coat, but the trick is ladies...a little goes a long way. Get a UV lamp that is strong enough (42W ), be frugal, and have fun ; )</li>
    <li> Fantastic quick service and loving the product.  Professional ffinish that u can easliy do your self for a fraction of cost .  Cnd website awesome if you need help</li>
    <li> I did not like,tryed few times,just does not dry!!!waste of money and my time...i use the uv. lamp just do not work! CND shellac !!!!</li>
    <li> Saves me so much money giving myself my own shellac manicures at home. .5 oz bottle has lasted me more than half the year now.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails at home and love CND Shellac. It is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days. My nails always look amazing and I get a ton of compliments. I also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to add to your nail polish collection.  Will keep polish from chipping for almost a week, sometimes longer, depending on what you do.  I love it.  Hope you do too.</li>
    <li> The ideal topcoat. Gives a nice shine and long kept on the nails. Good perfect balance with other brands. This is the best of all topcoats.</li>
    <li> I like it, good top, I like to use C N D Shellac Creative Nail Shellac UV Top Coat ,</li>
    <li> Use all the time, great product.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my nails grow strong and nice without harming my natural nail.  A little difficult removing old shellac, but well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> works great,lasts at least 2 weeks and very simple to apply. I love this stuff and so will you!! Shellac is the new 20 minute nail treatment that you will get addicted too. It does not harm your nail bed and gives you that shiny polish finish for long lasting beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great, however I&#x27;ve had chipping occur so not sure if it&#x27;s the Cream Puff I bought off amazon or if it&#x27;s this. I won&#x27;t know for sure until I lay on another color.</li>
    <li> i like the shellac as it stronger and lasts longer than regular nail polish, not so easy to apply perfectly but a good product</li>
    <li> This is a little expensive, but I have saved a fortune doing this at home myself. and when it&#x27;s low, I&#x27;ll order it again....</li>
    <li> I love this stuff; I use it all the time..makes your nail beautiful &amp; strong...recommend it to all who like lovely nails....</li>
    <li> CND brand is a great quality brand and product! This top coat lasts a good amount of time and is easy to apply. Just don&#x27;t do it too thick. It is cured under a UV lamp, and dries so smooth and shiny. I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. I will use this product again I will try to maybe find a better price little high for my budget but it worked great and I like using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gellish on my nails for several months and decided to try CND shellac. I love how much more durable this product is. It makes my own nails stronger and I can usually go 8-14 days between changes. Remember this is a soak-off product... but well worth the extra trouble.</li>
    <li> one of the best produts that you can use in a beauty salon, the only problem that is bery expensibe to bring to my country</li>
    <li> I like them so much never tried another brand. It goes on other shellac as well as on a regular polish.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver! I love shellac and this works great! I  use this top coat and their base coat with China glaze&#x27;s Gelaze which has a built in base coat for extra staying power and I have client getting 3-4 weeks staying power!!! This top coat stays shiny for weeks! I have clients that are nurses who wash thier hands multiple times a day whise mani stays on 2-3 weeks! Seller was awesome, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I have purchased quite a few CND shellacs, and this is the only one that I&#x27;ve been extremely unhappy with.  It is so clumpy I can&#x27;t even spread it no matter how long I shake it.  I took it to my salon and the manicurist said she&#x27;s never seen one this bad.  I wonder if it&#x27;s due to the larger size bottle (all the others I own are in the 0.25 oz size).  I purchased it less than two months ago and opened it just a few weeks ago.  I will have to toss the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the CND shellac polishes!</li>
    <li> I love the way shellac lasts, but it&#x27;s so expensive at the salons. I thought I&#x27;d give the at home shellac a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I wouldn&#x27;t skimp on a no name brand. CND is what my salon used, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It gets thicker after a while, just be sure to shake it well, and turn the bottle.</li>
    <li> I am so glad they make this in the big bottle. I use the polish and love it. Now I will not have to try to buy this so frequently. Love it!</li>
    <li> Shellac is the best brand of gel nail color on the market. This top coat self levels &amp; stays shiny for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> CND is the only way to do your nails.  Shellac is the number one product for nails that keeps the healthy and strong.  Wonderful colors and instructions.  You can even  mix the colors for your very own one-of-a-kind color!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  The larger size is wonderful.  My order was shipped as I was told and my order was accurate.</li>
    <li> Easy to use with a nail dryer. Stays on and shiny till you remove it. Does not chip off. You can leave it on for 2 to 4 weeks and still have the shine. Will buy again. It will last a long time before having to replace it. So the price is good.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item after i got a uv light as a gift and absolutely loved it!!!!!  I did a lot of research to make sure i was getting a good brand and after trying it, the results are better than i expected.</li>
    <li> The polish was in great condition (new and in the box).  It arrived very quickly. I went on smoothly so it didn&#x27;t even seem like the box had been sitting on a shelf anywhere for a long period of time.</li>
    <li> The only complaint for this product is the cost. It&#x27;s an excellent product! My French manicure looks great and lasts much longer. This top coat also has a lasting shine!</li>
    <li> This new large size bottle is a great price for the size bottle at a great price.  Would order this size again when needed.</li>
    <li> This was a re-order for me. I am in love with Shellac. It is much better than gel or nail polish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months.  I was having issues with the tips of my nails wearing and the color starting to chip but I&#x27;ve been using 2 coats of top coat and drying the final coat for 5 minutes and that seems to help.  I haven&#x27;t gotten 2 weeks of wear from the polish yet, but I am hard on my nails.  Also, I like to change the color after about a week anyway so I&#x27;ve been happy with the results.  Please be aware that the CND Shellac system requires a UV lamp to cure the polish between layers.  If you don&#x27;t use the right lamp, the polish will NOT dry.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.++++AAAAA</li>
    <li> i love shellac is the best! my clients are very happy, and this bottle last a lot of manicures! it is worth the price</li>
    <li> Shellac stays on my nails.. I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong with this specific bottle but it is really weird.. and 1-2 days after a new manicure a few of them will just peel right off.. all the way! im not gonna be buying bigger bottles anymore maybe that&#x27;s what it is</li>
    <li> Definitely not the same quality as in the salon. Even after 3-4 coats it still chipped and started peeling off in big pieces. The one at the salon had to be soaked in acetone for at least an hour to remove. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is a replacement product. It is required final step product. my wife and daughters love the shellac products.</li>
    <li> I love that I can purchase CND Shellac products on Amazon. Note that you need a UV light to cure them, which is a fairly expensive initial cost, but has significant savings in the long run from doing your own manicures. I like the CND branded one better than the cheaper ones out there, I think it works better because of the higher wattage bulbs. You also need all the steps- base coat, color, and top coat. I am proficient at painting my own nails, and if you watch youtube instructional videos you should be able to recreate the salon results without the bubbling/wrinkling of the polish upon curing that I have heard many negative reviews about (thin layers, finish the edges, full coverage). The manicure can last 2-3 weeks, if you take care of your nails (for example- not using your nails as prybars, and using gloves when cleaning and doing dishes- a good habit for nice looking hands anyway). Removal is easy, and requires cotton balls, acetone, and foil for best results- also the youtube videos are helpful for this also. I even do my friends/family&#x27;s nails sometimes too. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used others, but this one tops them. It has a thicker consistency. It is easier to fully remove from nails.</li>
    <li> Works great every time</li>
    <li> Use this shellac weekly on my nails, love it. works great as I am allergic to acrylic and no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product...super fast delivery.....will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
    <li> Glad I can use this product at home and not have to spend time at the salon.  It is more affordable that way.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle thinking it was the normal size but it is actually the large size bottle! Works as described, must use the UV cure lamp.... Shellac is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I like the new larger size and Shellac is the best gel polish I&#x27;ve used. Definitely a better quality than some of the others offered!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, It keeps my nails looking healthy and strong. So far this is the best product i&#x27;ve used on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;quick shipping was a plus.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the advise given me, but I have always had great results with other CND products so I tried this.  Too bad for me........even after a LONG time under the UV the nails are still tacky. The product also turns yellow almost immediately. I have already ordered the OPI and can&#x27;t wait to get it.</li>
    <li> Top coat is a must have. I&#x27;ve been doing my nails at home for over a year with items purchased on Amazon. I&#x27;ve saved lots of cash and my manicures are just as professional. Doing my own nails enables my to do little touch ups which make my manicures last much longer than 2-3 weeks.  I have the base, a color as well as this top coat.</li>
    <li> I love CND shellac, long lasting and very good quality, the package size is much more convenient than the smaller one</li>
    <li> I love CND Shellac Nail polish. This is a bigger bottle so I expect to get a lot of manicures out of this bottle.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I could find the bigger bottles for a reasonable price. Will be using this for a wedding.</li>
    <li> Fast service. I love CND. I don&#x27;t pay a salon to do what I can for a lot less. Awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews, I decided to give CND Shellac topcoat a try.  I stop polishing my nails due to the chipping after a few days.  I work retail handling shoes, clothes, etc and my hands get a workout. CND Shellac came thru with flying colors, no chips.  Only slight lifting from typing; I free edge every layer.  I use a regular ridge filler/base coat, 2 THIN coats of regular nail color and 1 thin coat of UV-activated topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;I allow the regular nail polish to dry using a nail drying polish and a nail drying machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason, I allow the regular polish to dry completely and something that I have not seen on any video or comment is the use of UV blocking gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase and use UV blocking gloves. Therefore, the regular nail polish is dry before putting on the gloves and applying the UV topcoat and placing my hand under the UV lamp. It&#x27;s a personal choice.&lt;br /&gt;Although the recommendation is 99% isopropyl alcohol, however I have 3 bottles of the 91% isopropyl alcohol and it works fine, simply wash your hands with liquid soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final step, I add cuticle oil and apply it nightly to keep cuticles moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the cost of CND Shellac UV-Activated Topcoat, which is no reflection on the products performance.  Since I&#x27;ve order the product, the cost has gone up, I&#x27;m sure due to demand.  So, Im considering a more economical UV-activated topcoat that is available locally.</li>
