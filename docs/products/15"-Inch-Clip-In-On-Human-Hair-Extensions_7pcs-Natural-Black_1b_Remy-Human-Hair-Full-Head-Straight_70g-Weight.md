      <li>and I just love them.</li>
      <li>I love them.. perfect for my hair and it is real human hair.</li>
      <li>so that the hair is not bunched up on top of each track.  </li>
      <li>I like the snap on hair pieces and the price is better than stores.it</li>
      <li>we have a name and we are many colors</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use this item at all.</li>
      <li>and I love them</li>
      <li>Im in love with my clip ins</li>
      <li>And I love them .</li>
      <li>These extensions are pretty good.</li>
      <li>The clips are strong and durable, and customer service is very friendly.</li>
      <li>Curling them is just fine , put hairspray and you&#x27;ll be okay .</li>
      <li>Good for someone with straight hair.</li>
      <li>I have to say that the quality of hair is good, their customer service really cares for the client</li>
      <li>They were really easy to put in, and they didn&#x27;t fall out when I brush them.</li>
      <li>Oh this was too easy.  </li>
      <li>but they were easy to spot and remove.</li>
      <li>The price is amazing for them thanks for having them !</li>
      <li>but i washed them and they were fine.</li>
      <li>It clips in just fine.  </li>
      <li>Smooth and Easy to deal with</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy</li>
      <li>It looks great but one of the clips already broke and I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times.</li>
      <li>One pack would get the job done but two creates a nice, natural look :)</li>
      <li>I tried it, LIKED IT! and ordered another because the hair is thin but it looks good once you have it in:)</li>
      <li>I will need to color the extensions to match my hair color and sew in another clamp and hopefully everything will turn out fine because the hair is actually not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>For the price, I love how it feels and it curls really well with my curling wand.</li>
      <li>But definitely human hair love it just needa more hair.</li>
      <li>Overall, these are good and worth the price.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to do, a child could, and hair styles are endless with this 100% human hair, great product!</li>
      <li>I would totally buy more!</li>
      <li>The clips break really easy but other than that I love this hair!</li>
      <li>I place a second order to combine the sets and obtain the thickness that I was looking for ( and it looks very nice together), the second order arrived 20 days after the order got placed, toke a bit more time than my first order</li>
      <li>but Im waiting until I get a fresh relaxer for blending purposes.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>so I have more than enough hair for them to look full.</li>
      <li>and it comes super fast.</li>
      <li>Natural movement  and easy to remove when you are finished with it.</li>
      <li>The delivery was super fast</li>
      <li>My grand daughter already had a head full of long hair.</li>
      <li>Stays in fine , plus hair really soft too .</li>
      <li>Save your money and pay for a higher quality product.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not difficult to put in or take out.</li>
      <li>This was my first time ever using these hair clips</li>
      <li>It seems to hold heat pretty well.</li>
      <li>Although it just looks like I have high lights !!</li>
      <li>There is some blonde strands but that&#x27;s okay .</li>
      <li>Lastly, these are very true to length.</li>
      <li>the color 1b is technically a dark brown, that works for me now that my hair is not dyed, but if it was it wouldn&#x27;t blend as nicely.</li>
      <li>I centered the extensions mostly towards the back and sides of my head and the thickness looked realistic.</li>
      <li>so I think that was pretty good especially since the expected date was 30 days from now</li>
      <li>Not as much volume as I thought it would give my hair.</li>
      <li>The hair gets tangled up too much.</li>
      <li>the picture is very misleading.</li>
      <li>The picture for these is very misleading.</li>
      <li>People say they get tangled easily , but not really .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Color says black but its really dark brown. Good for someone with straight hair. It doesn&#x27;t add much volume because its not much hair but it did give me length.</li>
    <li> Good hair for the price.  Hair is quite thin so if fullness is what you want, you will need more than one pack.</li>
    <li> I received this product today (I got next day delivery and arrived on time) and it was not what I expected. It came in a small box that was 3 by 9 inches. The quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t bad but how it was made was. I measured all the pieces out to be 25 inches all together. The hair is very thin which many buyers stated so I purchased 2. I didn&#x27;t even bother opening up the other box because I was very disappointed.  I have made clip in extensions before and I thought I was buying quality extensions. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> These hair clips weren&#x27;t what I was expecting at all ..they were thin n the clips aren&#x27;t attaching n clipping properly to my hair...I&#x27;m not satisfied at at all ..my email fatgold1203@gmail.com</li>
    <li> The clips break really easy but other than that I love this hair! I would totally buy more!</li>
    <li> It looks great but one of the clips already broke and I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times.</li>
    <li> The first thing I have to say about the hair is that is real human, and is a bit thin. I read a review on the item about the same topic but i wanted to see it for my self, once I got it in a week time (that made my day) I place a second order to combine the sets and obtain the thickness that I was looking for ( and it looks very nice together), the second order arrived 20 days after the order got placed, toke a bit more time than my first order but still it came between the scheduled window. I had that concern about the different shipping time for the same item and got in touch with their customer service department and they reply instantly giving me a reasonable explanation. That was very good. My review is 4/5 because of the thinnest of the hair and the color 1b is technically a dark brown, that works for me now that my hair is not dyed, but if it was it wouldn&#x27;t blend as nicely. I have to say that the quality of hair is good, their customer service really cares for the client and it comes super fast. I will buy again. The price is really good!!!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this product worked perfect;y for me. The weft are really thin also so you will need more than one pack. It did a decent job for the price and i received complements on the product. There are some gray and blond strands in some of the weft but they were easy to spot and remove.</li>
    <li> Very very thin and sheds a lot. Experienced a lot of tangling, and it took forever to arrive. I will not order this product again. Owigs will get my business for QUALITY clip in hair extensions.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappoint in this product.  The hair was a little thin and you really need more than one pack.</li>
    <li> Took about 10 business days and very very very thin. But definitely human hair love it just needa more hair.</li>
    <li> Color didn&#x27;t look natural black, like my previous purchase, more like medium brown.</li>
    <li> The picture for these is very misleading. The hair is very, very, thin, the color is not a match (I ordered a 1B and it looks like a light brown), and it was shedding as soon as I opened the package. Very disappointed, won&#x27;t order from this company or this brand again.</li>
    <li> I basically just wasted my money. Didn&#x27;t even got my money&#x27;s worth. It was so thin that it look stringy.</li>
    <li> I love the clip ins hair extensions.😇😄</li>
    <li> I can change my style easily! It is so easy to do, a child could, and hair styles are endless with this 100% human hair, great product!</li>
    <li> Very thin. I purchased 2 sets after reading the other reviews, and that didn&#x27;t make any difference. Save your money!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time ever using these hair clips and I just love them. They were really easy to put in, and they didn&#x27;t fall out when I brush them. The hair and my hair blended together perfectly, I will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> I like the snap on hair pieces and the price is better than stores.it do not cause hair to breakage.</li>
    <li> Very thin looks nothing like a full head of clips.  Hair seems nice though.</li>
    <li> Barely had any hair on each piece. It looked too thin. It was the worst hair i ever bought. If i could i would give no stars</li>
    <li> My grand daughter already had a head full of long hair. I couldn&#x27;t imagine why she felt she needed this. But it added to her already amazing look. She loves them. The best part: She doesn&#x27;t need a salon. They aren&#x27;t detectable underneath her hair. They&#x27;re not difficult to put in or take out.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this product! The hair was advertised as 100% HUMAN remy hair! ….first things first….It took over 3 weeks for me to receive the hair. I was very disappointed with the shipping time because I ordered a cooking pot from other Amazon merchant that was located in the same area that this merchant is located and received the pot within a week and a half of the shipment date. And to make matters worse the hair was shipped before the pot was ordered…. yet it still too many weeks for me to receive the hair. On top of me waiting 3weeks to get the hair, I was very angry when I found out that the hair that I received was synthetic! I was so shocked that I logged back on to Amazon.com to double check that I had not accidentally purchased synthetic hair over human hair. I was very disappointed to find out that I had been scammed…It turns out that this merchant lied! He/she is advertising real human hair but is actually mailing out synthetic hair. When I contacted the seller about the issue he/she never responded! I filed a complaint with Amazon and am hoping that I can get my hard earned money back from this liar and thief! Please do not waste your money or time buying from this merchant… it will be a HUGE disappointment.</li>
    <li> The hair in the picture seems thicker than what I received and the color is more of a brown/reddish color than a natural black. As soon as I opened up the package an ran my fingers thru the hair quite a bit was already shedding. I was disappointed because I clipped on one of the single extensions to see the color better and the clamp instantly broke; however, I was glad that I received two extra clamps with the delivery. I will need to color the extensions to match my hair color and sew in another clamp and hopefully everything will turn out fine because the hair is actually not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 pack, the hair is very thin and does not offer a full look. Would not recommend it</li>
    <li> Its possible they are, just that the hair is really soft and smooth. I ordered these Saturday of last week and got them today which is Saturday. I live on the east coast so I think that was pretty good especially since the expected date was 30 days from now lol. Also I ordered natural black its a little lighter but not enough to make a difference I say if you want to get them do it. Its not a bad price especially since other ones will run you in the 100&#x27;s I don&#x27;t regret I bought 2 packs of hair just to be sure and unless your hair is really thin I recommend you do the same. Overall I&#x27;m happy but I guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> The hair gets tangled up too much. Also, there was not enough pieces to cover much of your head.  Very thin.</li>
    <li> Too thin. Thought it would be fuller. I think I either need to buy another set or buy from another fuller product entirely. Color is closer to 2 but I thin with a fuller set, it will blend well (my natural hair is a 1B)</li>
    <li> this is the worst clip ins I have ever gotten I hope all the hair isn&#x27;t the same because the hair I got was very thin and no where near 70grams also the clips aren&#x27;t high quality clips they hurt your head and break off after 2 uses</li>
    <li> Blends in perfectly, quality hair. Came way before it was scedueled. Would totally buy from them again. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Wow I got my hair extensions yesterday ordered then the 1st and I love them they are perfect for my hair and so natural! The price is amazing for them thanks for having them !</li>
    <li> very very thin. not at all what i expected. the strips are so miniscule and have really no hair on them. what a waste!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair it is very thin and it says 1b ...it is really dark brown with copper highlights....the picture is very misleading.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It is a very affordable price, and because of that I was skeptical at first. However, I received the product in basically 1 day and it is high quality. Yes, the hair is thin, but if you order 2 packs then it should be fine. The clips are strong and durable, and customer service is very friendly. I will definitely order for this company again!!</li>
    <li> Oh this was too easy.  Braided my own hair in 4 braids, leaving the top out for coverage...start clipping the hair in from the bottom back of the head, spacing at least a finger and a half so that the hair is not bunched up on top of each track.  Be careful not to clip it in too tight, it will pull your hair out when you start styling if you do.  Good rule of thumb...if it feels too tight and you are not brushing, its going to feel too tight when you do.  Natural movement  and easy to remove when you are finished with it.</li>
    <li> For the price, I love how it feels and it curls really well with my curling wand. I did not clip them in my hair yet but Im waiting until I get a fresh relaxer for blending purposes. But I took it out the package and curled it. It seems to hold heat pretty well. Looking forward to wearing :)</li>
    <li> It clips in just fine.  Please do not try to apply heat of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot flat iron, curl, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since when did human hair burn like plastic when heat is applied?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is false advertisement and Amazon should remove this seller from thier Site.</li>
    <li> These extentions were a joke. There were pieces of thread weaved in. Lint all over them. Super thin. The clipps were uncormforble! Do not buy if you are picky and want natural looking hair</li>
    <li> Very nice, and in good time to delivery</li>
    <li> I saw some reviews and people say their really thin so I bought 2 . And I love them . I have a pixie haircut and it covered all my hair . They aren&#x27;t black , their actually like a darkish brown . Some hair fell out , like I brushed threw them and about like 7 pieces of strands fell out on each hair piece , but oh well . It&#x27;s real human hair . Using heat products gave a burning smell , but not really that bad . Curling them is just fine , put hairspray and you&#x27;ll be okay . Stays in fine , plus hair really soft too . There is some blonde strands but that&#x27;s okay . It came in the mail less than a week . People say they get tangled easily , but not really . I would buy them again . But remember , I bought 2 packs , that&#x27;s why I love them .</li>
    <li> Good hair loved the results ! It came extremely late !!! But great quality it was very bright I thought I ordered black black but it looks like medium brown ! Although it just looks like I have high lights !! So cute</li>
    <li> Great quality. I have thick hair and ordered two packages. If you have thick hair, order three.</li>
    <li> Black women isn&#x27;t  who we are remy..we have a name and we are many colors and we&#x27;re  tired of the system calling us out of character..is good hair but your advertising  isn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> The hair was very thin and it was synthetic like barbie doll hair.</li>
    <li> I saw other reviews saying tese clip ins were thin so i got 2 packs they came earlier then expected. They have a weird scent to them but i washed them and they were fine.</li>
    <li> I Love It! Smooth and Easy to deal with and it flows nicely!</li>
    <li> Im in love with my clip ins it gives my hair more volume fullness and everything im so happy I decide to get these clips ins</li>
    <li> Hair is good for the price. But is definely not the right color is brown with blonde strings and 14&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These extensions are pretty good. The clips seem strong, and the pack came with a few extra clips too. The color is a bit more #2 than 1b, but looks good blended with my hair. The hair curls really well and stays great with hairspray. They are a bit thin but my hair is pretty thin too and I only needed one pack. I centered the extensions mostly towards the back and sides of my head and the thickness looked realistic. Lastly, these are very true to length. I actually trimmed some (the ones I put on the bottom), because they were just too far down my back. Overall, these are good and worth the price. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Really good extensions. For the price, I am very satisfied. I have two sets and also an 18&#x27; set so I have more than enough hair for them to look full. I have naturally thin hair so I want something close to my hair as fair as fullness. One pack would get the job done but two creates a nice, natural look :)</li>
    <li> I ordered natural black hair and It wasn&#x27;t black at all, instead,  it was this dull looking brown. I wasn&#x27;t able to use this item at all.</li>
    <li> This is probably the most disappointing online purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. The hair is poor quality and definitely not even worth the $12 spent. At the base of the weft the hair seems full when in fact, less than 1/4 of the strands are actually 15 inches long. The hair severely tapers off into nothingness -- about 5 strands of hair are actually 15 inches. Just imagine a bad bald-headed comb-over where you can see how a man tried to take three strands of hair and cover his entire bald pate! Save your money and pay for a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> Natural hair , but very little</li>
    <li> Too thin somewhat disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love them.. perfect for my hair and it is real human hair.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made clips were porrly sewn into place and the hair was of extremely poor quailty dont waste your money please.</li>
    <li> Not as much volume as I thought it would give my hair.</li>
    <li> Some of hair seems synthetic so don&#x27;t have the heat super high on flat irons</li>
    <li> my daughte like them a lot so i order more this week for her came with in the estimated time</li>
    <li> i ordered this for a friend it was sooooo thin i was ashamed to give it to her. it went in the trash</li>
    <li> I have not installed these yet because I just got them. The delivery was super fast and I think the price was wonderful. Today I will be installing these in my hair and I honestly believe they are gonna look great.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> These clip in human extension  is the best.</li>
    <li> I read the comments about this product and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy it or not, but I went ahead and made the purchase because you can never truly form your own opinion based off of what someone else has said. I tried it, LIKED IT! and ordered another because the hair is thin but it looks good once you have it in:)</li>
    <li> I love this hair extensons they are a little thin but the work great I was kinda worried when I read everyone&#x27;s else reviews  , but they are great !! I would totally tell someone to but these !!</li>
    <li> Hair is very thin it did not come in a package like shown in picture ,The invoice was on the outside of the envelope not sure if hair is human, some of the clips were sewn on the hair backwards not quality at all. I will not purchase again from this company.</li>
    <li> The hair is wavy and thin, and looks NOTHING like the picture. It also has a few gold strands in it. But it&#x27;s pretty soft, and definitely human hair. The package also comes with a few extra clips, which is helpful. I still wouldn&#x27;t fully recommend buying this...</li>
    <li> Opened up the package and there was lint  all in the hair  Do not purchase this hair  not worth the money  I threw it out in the trash</li>
</ol>
