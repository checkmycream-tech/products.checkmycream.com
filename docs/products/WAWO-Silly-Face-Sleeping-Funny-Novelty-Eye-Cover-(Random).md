### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I purchased these as an item to include in the goodie bags for a tween sleep over and they worked perfectly.  </li>
      <li>u get what u pay for lol.</li>
      <li>The girls loved the faces and how they attached over your ears rather than around your head.  </li>
      <li>I found these on Amazon and worried they were too inecpensive to be good.  </li>
      <li>It works and is very cute.</li>
      <li>Very cute.</li>
      <li>I love these sleep masks!  </li>
      <li>I gave these as party favors for a tween bday party and they loved them:)</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for fair quality and some interesting feature, then this is it for you.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s fun waiting to see which one you will receive!!!</li>
      <li>and I still need 5 1/2 dozen more.  </li>
      <li>And it has OK quality.</li>
      <li>I was thinking i will get more than one pair!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cute</li>
      <li>I may get more for this year&#x27;s Christmas stocking gifts.</li>
      <li>The mask was really cute and my 12 year old granddaughter loved it.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable and the zany designs were a hit with the kids.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re all sorts of quirky, fit your face well, and don&#x27;t let any light in!  </li>
      <li>but it was my own fault for not just spending a obvious amout of money and w this product</li>
      <li>I ordered one for my nephew and got a pink one, I think he liked it anyway.</li>
      <li>The eye cover looks funny.</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t cover the light completely.</li>
      <li>She travels alot especially to her father&#x27;s homeland in Belgium and was looking forward to wearing it on the plane so that she could sleep through most of the trip.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my nephew who is sensitive to light.  </li>
      <li>These faces are intense.  </li>
      <li>it was pink and cute.</li>
      <li>That means, you can see little bit of light around the edges of the eye cover.</li>
      <li>Ordered this item for my 8 yr old niece.</li>
      <li>This is something you would get at the dollar general.</li>
      <li>Therefore, if you want to sleep in the complete darkness, you should buy different one.</li>
      <li>I am now at a loss for my daughter&#x27;s gift bags, and the print on this is sunglasses (not very cute).I would send this back if shipping weren&#x27;t add much as the product.</li>
      <li>Cotton quality.. definitely not good.. but seems comfortable to wear..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only giving 2 because tho it does keep the light out, leaving the product on your face for even a short length of time causes your skin to become sweaty and icky feeling because of the material.</li>

<li> colors and print are not bright or colorful as you see in picture.</li>

<li> I was looking on line at other masks</li>
<li> However, I think it is for toddler or teenagers, and absolutely NOT for baby!</li>
<li> Quality is not good, but not very upset since I did purchase it for a child.</li>
<li> I knew they were silly, but the one was just strange.</li>
<li> However, the straps only go around your ears (which feels a bit awkward to me) instead of all the way around your head, so it does sometimes fall off while you&#x27;re sleeping -</li>
<li> It confused me when I bought it.</li>
<li> thin and weird feeling won&#x27;t buy again</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t pick the design and the one I got was just weird.  </li>
<li> so I bought because of the random pack.  </li>
<li> I was wrong about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Perhaps I should have bled it in cold water before using it...  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t really be mad</li>
<li> I&#x27;m shocked because its not mention that is the price is for just one pair!!&lt;br</li>
<li> I was disappointed by the fact that we could not choose the sleeping face.</li>
<li> /&gt;So disappointed.</li>

    <li> i dont like it ! was not what i was expecting they send me one that i dont like it and also i dont know who thats work because its very different to put in your head, so know i lose my money in these</li>
    <li> I quite like this sleep mask. It works and is very cute. The mystery of the random pick is fun, too. Takes a very long time to ship, though.</li>
    <li> I love these sleep masks!  They&#x27;re all sorts of quirky, fit your face well, and don&#x27;t let any light in!  However, the straps only go around your ears (which feels a bit awkward to me) instead of all the way around your head, so it does sometimes fall off while you&#x27;re sleeping - but you&#x27;re already asleep so who cares!    A couple weeks after I started using this sleep mask, The black dye from the back of the mask began to seep into the printed front.  Perhaps I should have bled it in cold water before using it...  But it won&#x27;t stop me from using this mask again!</li>
    <li> The mask was really cute and my 12 year old granddaughter loved it.  She travels alot especially to her father&#x27;s homeland in Belgium and was looking forward to wearing it on the plane so that she could sleep through most of the trip.</li>
    <li> Actually, you just can get ONLY one from a bundle of those. It confused me when I bought it. And it has OK quality. However, I think it is for toddler or teenagers, and absolutely NOT for baby! Babies don&#x27;t like you leave something on their faces.</li>
    <li> These faces are intense.  You can&#x27;t choose what face you get, and I got some sort of bug-eyed, hung-over looking dude.  No problem to me, I&#x27;m asleep, but it confuses my husband.</li>
    <li> My sister can&#x27;t sleep without an eyemask so she expressed interest in a &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; one.  I found these on Amazon and worried they were too inecpensive to be good.  I was wrong about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I ordered is histerical!  She loves it....she says she just hopes she doesn&#x27;t die in her sleep...someone&#x27;s going to get quite a start!  (She&#x27;s a retired comedy writer.)</li>
    <li> Comfortable and the zany designs were a hit with the kids. I may get more for this year&#x27;s Christmas stocking gifts.</li>
    <li> Shipping almost a month. Finally got mine it was pink and cute.</li>
    <li> Cute but makes me sweat at night. I like it for the price tho! And it&#x27;s fun waiting to see which one you will receive!!!</li>
    <li> The ear holderbdnt hold all that well and the mask is thin and weird feeling won&#x27;t buy again I also do not like the face I was shipped</li>
    <li> It was funny and silly and promises, but just thin and doesn&#x27;t completely block out all light. and the straps might hurt ear in the morning</li>
    <li> I bought this item about two weeks ago and used it for couple times. The eye cover looks funny. However, it doesn&#x27;t cover the light completely. That means, you can see little bit of light around the edges of the eye cover. Therefore, if you want to sleep in the complete darkness, you should buy different one. But if you are looking for fair quality and some interesting feature, then this is it for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving 2 because tho it does keep the light out, leaving the product on your face for even a short length of time causes your skin to become sweaty and icky feeling because of the material. Being that the price was so low I can&#x27;t really be mad but it was my own fault for not just spending a obvious amout of money and w this product u get what u pay for lol.</li>
    <li> I was thinking i will get more than one pair!&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m shocked because its not mention that is the price is for just one pair!!&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as an item to include in the goodie bags for a tween sleep over and they worked perfectly.  The girls loved the faces and how they attached over your ears rather than around your head.  Very cute.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t pick the design and the one I got was just weird.  I knew they were silly, but the one was just strange. I bought this for my nephew who is sensitive to light.  The plus side to this mask is it cinches around the ears which makes it easier for kids to keep on.</li>
    <li> Ordered this item for my 8 yr old niece. Quality is not good, but not very upset since I did purchase it for a child.</li>
    <li> This item broke when I took it out of the packaging. It wasn&#x27;t at all what It looked like on in the picture. DO NOT ORDER THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the fact that we could not choose the sleeping face. I ordered one for my nephew and got a pink one, I think he liked it anyway.</li>
    <li> Product image is reaaaally generous with the product.. colors and print are not bright or colorful as you see in picture. Cotton quality.. definitely not good.. but seems comfortable to wear..</li>
    <li> I was looking on line at other masks that where $5.99 for a dozen.  This popped up as something other customers bought.  The picture has a dozen and it was compared to others that are sold as a dozen so I bought because of the random pack.  I feel like a jerk, $30 bucks and I still need 5 1/2 dozen more.  This is something you would get at the dollar general.</li>
    <li> It gave my child a rash on her face</li>
    <li> I was also misled and thought this was A12 pack.This was grouped in with the other 12 packs and showed a group in the photo.I am now at a loss for my daughter&#x27;s gift bags, and the print on this is sunglasses (not very cute).I would send this back if shipping weren&#x27;t add much as the product.What a bummer.</li>
    <li> They were a hit!! Definitely recommend...I gave these as party favors for a tween bday party and they loved them:)</li>
