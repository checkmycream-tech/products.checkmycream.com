      <li>It is light yet moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to sound like an info-mercial</li>
      <li>spot treatment is light weight, oil free and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>those that aren&#x27;t familiar with the brand, you have to try it.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure this would be a better alternative to Proactive&#x27;s spot treatment, but so far it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>I have tried and fallen in love with quite a number of 100% Pure products; the Brightening range and their body washes are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>apart from the fact that its natural,this is the only good thing I like about it.</li>
      <li>It helped my skin tremendously...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and it feels good on my skin.</li>
      <li>She has sensitive skin and this has really good ingredients and all natural.</li>

      <li>It is very soft and applies easily without leaving face greasy, almost as a moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think it did much for my mild acne.</li>
      <li>too!The only con I found is that the pump mechanism releases too much than needed sometimes, though it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>But as said before, I will continue to use this product after I run out of my first bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams/ointments/scrubs/etc.</li>
      <li>I started looking more at their entire line.</li>
      <li>The first is the smell.</li>
      <li>I use to breakout a lot and this product really helped!</li>
      <li>If they only changed to a more efficient pump.</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t dry or flakey, but feels healthy and tighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t harden or dry out like most spot treatments, either.</li>
      <li>;  I wish 100% Pure would rethink their packaging on this and ll f their &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; products because they all have these issues.  </li>
      <li>I stumbled upon 100% Pure while looking for make up that was organic.</li>
      <li>100% pure is the exception.  </li>
      <li>but it certainly does the trick.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;re at the end of your rope about your acne!</li>
      <li>but as this had none I felt very compelled to do it.</li>
      <li>I really, really like this \\&quot;zit cream.\\</li>
      <li>didnt really seem to work for me.</li>
      <li>This spot treatment really does help with all kinds of my acne.</li>
      <li>spot treatment has really cleared up my spotty skin.</li>
      <li>I really expected better from this line, since they are THE line I swear by for skin care, but this did not work for me at all.</li>
      <li>really recommend this product</li>
      <li>I love this product as well as other products from 100% pure.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re familiar with 100% Pure&#x27;s Purity range, the tonique is very similar to the spot treatment.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve tried many different products over the years and obviously continued to look.</li>
      <li>WELL WORTH THE HEFTY PRICE especially if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Firstly, the pump didn&#x27;t seem to work properly but after some time and maneuvering the pump is fully functional.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to write reviews</li>
      <li>The same problem for most of their liquid/cream products due to faulty pump.</li>
      <li>I ordered the 100% Pure Purity Spot Treatement figuring \\&quot;why not\\&quot; especially since I knew what the ingredients were.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan if 100% Pure; I use their argan oil moisturizer and the coffee bean eye cream, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>local vendor was sold out of this spot treatment at the time and they order directly from 100% Pure</li>
      <li>I used this, and an hour later I could see how much the acne had dimmed and how the redness had gone away.</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and between stress, hormones, heredity and anything else that can cause acne, I get hit with it.</li>
      <li>but it does help considerably quicker than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything</li>
      <li>After starting a supplement called Biotin, my skin started to break out for the first time in years (other than as a reaction to makeup or lotions).  </li>
      <li>I look forward to trying other products from 100% Pure as I use up the products I currently have</li>
      <li>With all the various causes of acne, I&#x27;ve had all the various kinds of acne: cystic (horrible under the skin kind that usually leave a great looking scar), white head, your standard zit...</li>

<li> They both have the same base of ingredients and both emit a pungent, medicinal scent.</li>
<li> Stress related acne could be one of the worst kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I break out from hormones and stress and can also get nasty cystic acne.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to write reviews but as this had none I felt very compelled to do it. I really, really like this \\&quot;zit cream.\\&quot; I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and between stress, hormones, heredity and anything else that can cause acne, I get hit with it. I&#x27;ve been trying to get back to the basic when it comes to skin care and such. I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;tree hugger\\&quot; but I began to figure when it comes to ingredients of the products I use, the simpler the better. I stumbled upon 100% Pure while looking for make up that was organic. I had never heard of them before. I bought their face powder and my face liked it. I started looking more at their entire line. With all the various causes of acne, I&#x27;ve had all the various kinds of acne: cystic (horrible under the skin kind that usually leave a great looking scar), white head, your standard zit...I don&#x27;t want to sound like an info-mercial but I&#x27;ve tried many different products over the years and obviously continued to look. I ordered the 100% Pure Purity Spot Treatement figuring \\&quot;why not\\&quot; especially since I knew what the ingredients were. I love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the benzoyl peroxide stuff does (I know, duh) but it certainly does the trick. It&#x27;s not a miracle overnight cure for all acne but it does help considerably quicker than anything I&#x27;ve used before. Like with the face powder, my face likes it (I fully understand what works for some people may not work for others). It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and my skin has not gotten used to it to the point where it doesn&#x27;t work (I&#x27;ve had that happen before too). Using it as a spot treatment it seems as though a little goes a very long way.  There are two reasons I didn&#x27;t give this stuff 5 stars even though I will continue to buy it. The first is the smell. It&#x27;s not horrible? It just takes some getting used to. By looking at the ingredients, I understand the smell. Again, it takes some getting used to but after it&#x27;s put on, the smell doesn&#x27;t hang around. The other thing that&#x27;sa little odd to me is the pump bottle. I use this as a spot treatment for each blemish, not over my entire face. Maybe it&#x27;s just the bottle I got but when I go to dispense just a little bit, it seems to shoot out sometimes missing my target finger completely. But as said before, I will continue to use this product after I run out of my first bottle. I just wanted to put it out there the way I saw it in case anyone else is thinking about purchasing this. I look forward to trying other products from 100% Pure as I use up the products I currently have (I don&#x27;t have the money to just toss away what I have to buy more expensive products). I do understand that you pay for what you get, usually. To me this company is most definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Burns and drys up skin</li>
    <li> I use this as an all over treatment, not just a spot treatment. I am an Esthetician and know that you have to treat the entire skin when it comes to acne, not just individual blemishes after they have popped up. Anyways, I love the ingredients and feel of this product, along with the matching Cleanser/Mask and Toner. Def recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything and this is the best acne spot treatment---it reduces redness in blemishes yet doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m only giving this product 2stars because it did not do what the name implies ,it did not clear or even help a little with the few pimples on my face and surely did not clear or even fade my spots.but it did help with my oily T zone,the product is kinda dry so if I apply it under my make up,it keeps the shine off in a good way.I might even buy it again just for that purpose,it&#x27;s not greasy at all. apart from the fact that its natural,this is the only good thing I like about it.</li>
    <li> Not the most effective but I buy it because there is no garbage in it!&lt;br /&gt;I used to use benzoil peroxide but I have not gone back to it since I found this.</li>
    <li> I love this product as well as other products from 100% pure. However, my biggest gripe is the packaging. The pump doesn&#x27;t work towards to end of the tube. I have to remove the pump and squeeze out the product when it&#x27;s a bit over half used. Even then it&#x27;s difficult to get the last several applications so it&#x27;s wasteful.  The same problem for most of their liquid/cream products due to faulty pump. It&#x27;s been brought up about by many customers for a while now but they don&#x27;t change it. If they only changed to a more efficient pump.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working.  I love the smell, very clean.  I just wish it came in a larger size.  Other than that I have no complaints.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and it feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time, twice a day, and get the best price on Amazon.  I have had a lot of trouble with the pump not working and I&#x27;m also frustrated by how much product is still in the tube when the pump runs &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34;  I wish 100% Pure would rethink their packaging on this and ll f their &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; products because they all have these issues.  The spot treatment does work well, though.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out even more. Stopped using after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> The cream has a nice rosemary and pine smell to it. It is light yet moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think it did much for my mild acne.</li>
    <li> didnt really seem to work for me. made my face feel greasy</li>
    <li> Firstly, the pump didn&#x27;t seem to work properly but after some time and maneuvering the pump is fully functional. The packaging is an exact replica of 100% Pure&#x27;s best selling, caffeine eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local vendor was sold out of this spot treatment at the time and they order directly from 100% Pure which indicates that it&#x27;s a great seller. I am looking forward to the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with 100% Pure&#x27;s Purity range, the tonique is very similar to the spot treatment. They both have the same base of ingredients and both emit a pungent, medicinal scent.

I am quite pleased with the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that aren&#x27;t familiar with the brand, you have to try it. I have tried and fallen in love with quite a number of 100% Pure products; the Brightening range and their body washes are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret trying the line!</li>
    <li> Love this brand and product, had to buy it here bc the site was sold out.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams/ointments/scrubs/etc. to clear my face, but nothing really works &amp; usually dries out my skin. I used this, and an hour later I could see how much the acne had dimmed and how the redness had gone away. My skin isn&#x27;t dry or flakey, but feels healthy and tighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE 100% and seriously recommend their store if you&#x27;re into using completely natural, healthy, and GOOD products for your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing about this product is that it smells kinda weird, but it&#x27;s really not a big issue in the long run :)</li>
    <li> Stress related acne could be one of the worst kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, which is prone to breakout more easily.  I had been breaking out around my eyes (close to forehead) and lower side of cheeks (jaw area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The acne seems to NOT make it &#x27;all the way&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;* I use it daily, am &amp; pm&lt;br /&gt;* No over drying of skin, nor irritation, nor allergic reactions to it have occurred.&lt;br /&gt;* It does NOT smell.&lt;br /&gt;* It is very soft and applies easily without leaving face greasy, almost as a moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cylinder I received is different than the one you see in the picture.  It looks more like a toothpaste container with the pump at the bottom where it stands.  It contains one (1) once.  The packaging is quite elegant, fancy if you will.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m a big fan if 100% Pure; I use their argan oil moisturizer and the coffee bean eye cream, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spot treatment has really cleared up my spotty skin. I break out from hormones and stress and can also get nasty cystic acne. This spot treatment really does help with all kinds of my acne. I use it at night before bed, and in the morning, anything that was cropping up the night before is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin that dries out whenever I use other kinds of spot treatments. Not so with this one. I highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;re at the end of your rope about your acne!</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t dry out and leave white spots on face, and heals scars too!The only con I found is that the pump mechanism releases too much than needed sometimes, though it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I cannot use 99.9% of products I try on my skin.  100% pure is the exception.  And this product was no different.  After starting a supplement called Biotin, my skin started to break out for the first time in years (other than as a reaction to makeup or lotions).  I ordered this and it has basically cleared my skin up.  WELL WORTH THE HEFTY PRICE especially if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I heard about 100% pure line!! It helped my skin tremendously...I use to breakout a lot and this product really helped! really recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love their makeup and I adore their skincare products, but I can&#x27;t do this one. I&#x27;m not so crazy about the texture, as it is very greasy and slippery, which my oily-prone skin does not agree with. It doesn&#x27;t harden or dry out like most spot treatments, either. I really expected better from this line, since they are THE line I swear by for skin care, but this did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my daughter and we have definitely repurchased it.  She has sensitive skin and this has really good ingredients and all natural.</li>
    <li> I thought for sure this would be a better alternative to Proactive&#x27;s spot treatment, but so far it&#x27;s not. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but it doesn&#x27;t clear up blemishes either.</li>
