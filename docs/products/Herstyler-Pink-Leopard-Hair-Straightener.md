      <li>Best flat iron ever !</li>
      <li>Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description.</li>
      <li>, it heats up fine, no snags, totally smooth, great curls and straight styles with no damage (I use living proof phd treatment</li>
      <li>I love amazon and their hassle free return policy</li>
      <li>Love the cheetah print and it gets hot quick,  I love it!</li>
      <li>Love that they get really hot !</li>
      <li>Two years later, it still works great, the plates are intact and smooth</li>
      <li>It really made her hair look nice.</li>
      <li>But anywho I love this flat iron it gets extremely hot but not so hot to damage my hair or my clients&#x27; hair GREAT BUY!!!!</li>
      <li>My hair is very curly though!!!</li>
      <li>is 5 stars in my book and worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Ok if your hair is already straight!</li>
      <li>Pretty sure my wife is going to throw this away.</li>
      <li>It does get VERY hot VERY fast too!!</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>i really want to order the ceramic plates i feel cermamic works better on my hair than titanium plates do.</li>
      <li>and I needed a quality titanium flat iron for a good price</li>
      <li>Works perfectly fine for me does have a funny smell</li>
      <li>an it leaves my hair lOoking good all day long.</li>
      <li>But overall its ok!</li>
      <li>Gets hot without having to wait a great length of time and doesn&#x27;t burn the hair as much as other straightening irons in that price range.</li>
      <li>I want an excuse to splurge on a new one that has these features, but I can&#x27;t let myself while this one is still giving great results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought another one right away</li>
      <li>the plates came right off</li>
      <li>It works great and this is usually a 200 dollar straightener</li>
      <li>My oldest daughter has a her styler and it works great, but this one takes a long time to warm up and does not get warm enough to straighten her thick hair.  </li>
      <li>Be smart buy this product!</li>
      <li>and it got here super fast.</li>
      <li>First of all let me just say the shipping took no time.</li>
      <li>My first grown-up straightener.</li>
      <li>Came on time and fast!</li>
      <li>I will definitely check amazon first from now on!!!</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
      <li>For this price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair straight all day and gives it shine and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Recommended from a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast.</li>
      <li>Arrived really fast.</li>
      <li>so I looked on amazon and about died when I saw the same exact one on here for 25 dollars!!</li>
      <li>actually like this better than a hand me down ghd one a friend gave to me because of how smooth the barrel is.</li>
      <li>I paid a lot more for this at a kiosk in the mall over two years ago, and I even haggled the price down from $120 to $70.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Really makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
      <li>WASTE OF TIME, GET A STRAIGHTENER WITH BETTER FEATURES,</li>
      <li>Barely gets hot.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;ll send you a new one.</li>
      <li>however when something is bought new</li>
      <li>it would be the same quality being from the same HerStyler brand and all, but it just doesnt leave my hair with the silky, smooth look like the SEASONS and my Chi do.</li>
      <li>love my pink flat iron! ^_^</li>
      <li>I bought this straightener a few weeks ago and its fantastic, my hair looks healthy and that alone is a tough job being a natural brunette constantly dying my hair blonde, all the prossessing has nearly fried my hair so I to find straightener that help make my hair straight and makes it look 100% healthy</li>
      <li>meaning you don&#x27;t have to pay for a new one you can send of the old one</li>
      <li>Even though there&#x27;s only an off and on switch, it still gets hot enough really fast.</li>
      <li>and my niece likes besides using it frequently.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 13 yr old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>It made my real hair really dry and brittle.</li>
      <li>You only have to run the flat iron through your hair once &amp; it gets bone straight.</li>
      <li>THE ONLY COOL THING ABOUT THIS DULL STRAIGHTENER IS THE COLORS, IT DOESN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING FOR HAIR.</li>
      <li>It works fine on my thin hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this exact straightener in the mall in December and paid 200 dollars for it!!!!!!! I love it so much and so does my boyfriend&#x27;s daughter.  I wanted to see about getting a second one so nobody suffers when she spends the night away from home so I looked on amazon and about died when I saw the same exact one on here for 25 dollars!! I will definitely check amazon first from now on!!!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! We love it!</li>
    <li> The BEST flat iron I have ever bought. I love the way it straightens my hair and makes it so silky. And it&#x27;s so cute!!!</li>
    <li> I order the herstyler pink leopard and I got it today. the plates came right off and I don&#x27;t have a no ideas how to contact the owners for this problem. I will not order anymore</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair feel so soft. Love this straightener!</li>
    <li> Love the cheetah print and it gets hot quick,  I love it!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order it because of the bad review. I love amazon and their hassle free return policy so I took a chance. I love how it looks, but I totally love how it flattens my hair. For the price you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I got this for my best friends graduation gift and she fell in love with it! It works great and this is usually a 200 dollar straightener so I was VERY impressed!! Came on time and fast! I will be ordering more for myself!! I recommend! Perfect gift for any girl and perfect for personal use!</li>
    <li> Awesome color &amp; great product.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever ! I bought one of these a few years a got but I accidentally broke it after two years of use and I bought another one right away doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and NO FREEZ and I have really thick and curly hair !!</li>
    <li> I received this today and i&#x27;m alittle disppointed to be honest.  When i got the product the paint was already faded which isnt really big deal however when something is bought new i expect it to be in good condition.  also in the directions it says that the herstyler flat irons have a temperature control and i didn&#x27;t see one maybe i just missed it though.  I tried it out and i like how it straightens my hair, I would just like to know if there is a way I can control the temperature?</li>
    <li> This is one of the better straightening irons that I have boughten. The plates move which allows a closer straighten at the scalp. Gets hot without having to wait a great length of time and doesn&#x27;t burn the hair as much as other straightening irons in that price range.</li>
    <li> WASTE OF TIME, GET A STRAIGHTENER WITH BETTER FEATURES, THE ONLY COOL THING ABOUT THIS DULL STRAIGHTENER IS THE COLORS, IT DOESN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING FOR HAIR. NOT WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> Ok if your hair is already straight! But overall its ok! Color is very cute!! My hair is very curly though!!!</li>
    <li> Is very nice, your colours i like it buy it for a gift and my niece likes besides using it frequently.</li>
    <li> It made my real hair really dry and brittle. It works great on track extensions how do I return this?</li>
    <li> I paid a lot more for this at a kiosk in the mall over two years ago, and I even haggled the price down from $120 to $70. I have the purple leopard one. Two years later, it still works great, the plates are intact and smooth, it heats up fine, no snags, totally smooth, great curls and straight styles with no damage (I use living proof phd treatment and it&#x27;s a 10 serum). I almost want it to break since it doesn&#x27;t have a swivel chord and my model only has one heat setting. I want an excuse to splurge on a new one that has these features, but I can&#x27;t let myself while this one is still giving great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like this better than a hand me down ghd one a friend gave to me because of how smooth the barrel is. The ghd one also snagged my hair a tiny bit and this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herstyler doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles the latest and greatest straighteners have (swivel chords, multi country voltage capabilities, automatic shut off, temperature adjustment) but it is really an amazing straightener. For this price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want shiny awesome healthy soft snag free hair and trust yourself to turn it off, this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. It really made her hair look nice. Yet when we did the curls they didn&#x27;t stay, and the smell of it heating is very strong. Yet it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! Even though there&#x27;s only an off and on switch, it still gets hot enough really fast. It keeps my hair straight all day and gives it shine and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my pink flat iron! ^_^</li>
    <li> First of all let me just say the shipping took no time. I order this product like 2 days ago and it got here super fast. I work in a salon and I needed a quality titanium flat iron for a good price and I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better deal. All of the original paperwork came with it and it comes with a warranty which is great being in the hair industry meaning you don&#x27;t have to pay for a new one you can send of the old one and they&#x27;ll send you a new one. But anywho I love this flat iron it gets extremely hot but not so hot to damage my hair or my clients&#x27; hair GREAT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description. well worth the money, great price.</li>
    <li> OMG love my her stylers! These are A1 flatirons, long lasting .. Had them for 3 years now . Still amazing ! Love that they get really hot !</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener a few weeks ago and its fantastic, my hair looks healthy and that alone is a tough job being a natural brunette constantly dying my hair blonde, all the prossessing has nearly fried my hair so I to find straightener that help make my hair straight and makes it look 100% healthy is 5 stars in my book and worth every penny! Be smart buy this product!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly fine for me does have a funny smell</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 yr old daughter for Christmas.  My oldest daughter has a her styler and it works great, but this one takes a long time to warm up and does not get warm enough to straighten her thick hair.  It works fine on my thin hair but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought a pink leopard one for myself. A little disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my cousin has the seasons and it worked AWESOME on my hair, Im a Chi owner and decided to try this thinking it would be the same quality being from the same HerStyler brand and all, but it just doesnt leave my hair with the silky, smooth look like the SEASONS and my Chi do.It straightens &#x27;good&#x27; and heats well/fast, Decent price, but I cannot say its the BEST out there!</li>
    <li> Works amazing and got it for a good price.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite straightener&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever bought. LOVE it!! It does get VERY hot VERY fast too!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely lOve this straightener it works amazing an it leaves my hair lOoking good all day long. I was debating weather to purchase it or not because of the bad review, but in the end it came out good.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! I love it. You only have to run the flat iron through your hair once &amp; it gets bone straight. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We really love this straightner.  My daughter and I both use these irons and really love them.  They are excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived really fast. Love the color and the pattern also loved how my hair turned out.</li>
    <li> My first grown-up straightener. Recommended from a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast. Flattens well.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair but alot of it.  Wish it was hotter.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Just as described</li>
    <li> i really want to order the ceramic plates i feel cermamic works better on my hair than titanium plates do.</li>
    <li> Barely gets hot.  Pretty sure my wife is going to throw this away.</li>
