      <li>This is such a great cleanser.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s conveniently available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It really cleans your face well, and it smells really nice.  </li>
      <li>but def worked for me, shipping was super quick, and came in prestine!</li>
      <li>And, while I love this product, and can happily use an aggressive scrub on my skin, I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the “gentle” category for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I purchased this product because the price was more reasonable than in the department stores.</li>
      <li>I have healthy adult male skin, but it&#x27;s cleaned up black heads, virtually no breakouts, wonderful smell &amp; a nice glow.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this exfoliator my skin turned red and began to flake while still burning, I attempted to use a nice water based moisturizer after and my skin burned even more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a product junkie for years but have never had such great and fast results.  </li>

      <li>This is my new favorite product.  </li>
      <li>downside: the cap isn&#x27;t very sturdy and breaks easily when dropped or knocked around in a suitcase.</li>
      <li>It smells great, exfoliates gently enough for daily use, and really cleans your face squeaky clean!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best gentle exfoliator on the market! Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes but I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s quite amazing...and still somewhat affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product regularly for many years. Glad it&#x27;s conveniently available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It really cleans your face well, and it smells really nice.  It has little beads in it that help clean, but they are not too big as to feel bad on the face.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. It smells like oranges and leaves skin soft after use. I have been using this line for nearly 25 years after trying all others. Great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser/exfoliator is very gentle for sensitive skin.  I use it daily and found that it keeps my skin feeling softer and less dry.  The exfoliation is mild and perfect for daily use.  Note that it would not be ideal as a once or twice a week exfoliator and you may want to supplement with something heavier duty once in awhile.  The citrus smell isn&#x27;t very strong and is quite pleasant in the morning.  One downside: the cap isn&#x27;t very sturdy and breaks easily when dropped or knocked around in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> This product smells *amazing*. It really does. I wish it would have worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample and tried it out. Like the name says it is definitely gentle. The exfoliating beads are very small and fine. I personally prefer a little more abrasion but if your skin is too sensitive to other exfoliating products this might be a good choice for you.</li>
    <li> gentle but does the job for anyone needing daily facial exfoliation...it make my skin pretty and happy</li>
    <li> I would recommend this seller, I got my product quickly and it was exactly what I ordered. (Missing the original packaging--but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy , I intend to buy again when new promotions  will  appear. My niece and I are very happy even.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product before and like it.&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle for someone with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to close friends. My 4 yrs exp. is that a lil goes a long way. You need to gently massage ur face with a pea sized amount, and if ur skin adversely reacts at first, start out small. I have healthy adult male skin, but it&#x27;s cleaned up black heads, virtually no breakouts, wonderful smell &amp; a nice glow. I agree with what a Pro* told me, drinking lots of water, eating healthy, but mainly low sugar (less collagen breakdown) and sun protection, along with a good moisturizer are key. Along with this cleansing product, I like 3 masks. 1. plain Aloe. 2. Orange Zest &amp; Yogurt (plain/organic) + a lil Honey. 3. Rice Milk (warm) + a lil Honey (soaked paper towel \\&quot;mask\\&quot; 8-o) Be happy with Yer hot mUg![[ASIN:B002AMUFOC Clarins One Step Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser, 4.32-Ounce Box]]</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this cleanser while living in London.  A WONDERFUL product - and just what it says, a gentle exfoliator and cleanser.  I keep it in the shower, just wash and rinse - a little moisturizer afterward and I&#x27;m good to go. Lovely, non-overpowering orange fragrance is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 60, but my 21-year old daughter, whose skin runs to acne, begs to use it too.  In general, I&#x27;m NOT a fan of expensive skincare products, but this one is definitely worth the price.  Try it - I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll be hooked too.</li>
    <li> This is very gentle cleanser which you can use for everyday. I love the orange scent! will buy another bottle for sure.</li>
    <li> I have always used Clarins.  I love the smell of this cleanser and it&#x27;s just the perfect amount of exfoliant without being to abrasive!</li>
    <li> Smells like oranges and is very gentle on the skin.  I highly recommend this product.  It is worth paying the money for it.  Works better than any other facial cleanser I have found in a store.</li>
    <li> Something weird happened with this product. Let me give you my history. I used Clarins for a long time. I would say for years off and on mostly in my 20&#x27;s.  I tried a lot of their products. I would say I like about half.  The ones I did like, I used over and over for a very long time.  I used their lifting serums, the orange lifting facial mask, some of their creams, though their creams weren&#x27;t my favorite. I bought their toners but never seemed to use them.  Then because of finances I have to stop using this line in my 30&#x27;s.  So at 34 I am at the mall and remember I like the Clarins line.  Though I was not out for a facial wash, the scheming sales woman at Nordstrom&#x27;s talks me into buying one. I must say, I had some sort of bad feeling about it, which I wished I had followed.  I go home and wash my face with it which is what you are supposed to do. As I am lathering up with the wash, I look in the mirror and see a scary sight.  My under eye area which would go slightly bluish when I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep,  suddenly puffs out away from my face as if it were trying to  become detached from the rest of my face.  My under eye area has never puffed out. Prior to this it was slightly, only slightly indented.  I see the puffing out of my under eye area and kind of freak out. I rinse the product off my face and under eye area has become noticeably depleted and hollow looking.  As if something poked them with a needle and they became deflated and hollowed out.  It was horrible. I freaked out.  I called the Clarins department. I called Nordstrom&#x27;s. I wrote letters to Clarins and Nordstrom&#x27;s.  I was very distressed.  My eyes have never looked the same since.  You see a lot of older women with this hollowed out eye look which I guess they did not have when they were younger.  I have heard that some people have an allergic reaction to Menthol which is in this product.  I do not have any known allergies, but obviously I had a reaction to this product. My guess is that other people have as well.  The reason so many women have hollowed out under eye areas is from products like these.ople have as well.  The reason so many women have hollowed out under eye areas is from products like these.</li>
    <li> It works great with clarisonic.  My skin has never looked as good..  This is my second purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to gently exfoliate and cleanse their face.</li>
    <li> Facial cleansers are not that different as far as I can tell.  I love some Clarins products but don&#x27;t find this one to be a must-have on my list.  I bought this with other Clarins products that I do find indispensable.</li>
    <li> Great Product; Always feel fresh and clean after using it!</li>
    <li> I needed something that would remove the dead skin from my face. The beads inside the cleanser are not that abrasive to cause any irritation. I also didn&#x27;t have any extra dryness. This is really helping to decrease the breakouts I was having.</li>
    <li> I LOVE CLARINS.  THIS EXFOLIATOR IS JUST PERFECT.  THIS IS JUST GREAT FOR THOSE BLACKHEADS AND DEAD SKIN, GREAT EXFOLIATOR.</li>
    <li> This is such a great cleanser. It smells great, exfoliates gently enough for daily use, and really cleans your face squeaky clean!! I will never change face products after I found this gem!</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and is the correct product. I use this cleanser with my clarisonic and it is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. I have combination skin, and prone to acne and this is the only product that seems to work. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser, but not sure the juice is worth the squeeze.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll spend this much for an OTC again, at least not this one.  It does smell good.</li>
    <li> this is the only cleanser that works for me and husband.  from the very first use,  skin feels soft.  gone are the days when i feel that my face is so heavy, as if it wasn&#x27;t clean at all.  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for a couple of years and I love the smell and the deep clean.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> Clarins Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser is not harsh on your face.  It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This is better than any face wash you have tried before.</li>
    <li> I like a daily (if gentle) or weekly (if not) scrub for my skin.  Clarins One Step Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser with Orange Extract has “gentle” right there in the name.  And, while I love this product, and can happily use an aggressive scrub on my skin, I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the “gentle” category for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin.  It&#x27;s oily in the T-zone and normal on my cheeks.  It definitely needs a good weekly scrub.  The citrusy smell of the scrub is great!  The scrubbing beads are large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cleanser on a damp face and scrub until I feel lathered and clean.  Then I rinse it off with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations After using this cleanser, my skin feels a little tight and looks shiny.  It also leaves “bead poop” in my sink.  There&#x27;s  a noticeable layer of clear, round, scrubbing beads that get left behind after I rinse my face.  Kind of like the sand that&#x27;s left behind in the shower when you clean up after a trip to the beach.  I’m not entirely comfortable rinsing these down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser definitely removes all traces of makeup.  I like that.  And it does make my skin feel smoother.  However, I personally don&#x27;t feel like my radiance has been renewed or that my moisture has been balanced--if anything, I feel a little dry immediately after use.  And I don&#x27;t think the microbeads are all that gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t feel this scrub is gentle enough for daily use, I love the way it smells and I&#x27;m a sucker for orange things.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and if you like a more aggressive scrub for daily use, I&#x27;d recommend this.  If you&#x27;re on the more sensitive side, this would still make a great addition to your routine once a week.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the most abrasive exfoliators I have used from any skin care line. The first time I used this exfoliator my skin turned red and began to flake while still burning, I attempted to use a nice water based moisturizer after and my skin burned even more. Since then my skin has gotten used to this product and I am glad I continued using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have \\&quot;dead spots,\\&quot; or dry spots, and my skin is turn over is incredible. The blackheads on my nose have almost disappeared and I am getting less acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because for a few reasons-one is there adding coloring in it (yellow 6), which for a line that touted being \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; for years seems a little odd. Another issue is there is not a ton of research backing up the benefits moringa seed in skin care, so some of the claims made are debatle. Last-it is expensive even for a department store scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is expensive and can be tough on your skin at first-it is also tough on skin problems. My advice is to use this when your skin is not as sensitive or not being exposed to extremes, and to keep using it because it takes a while to get most of the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: Oily, acne prone, 20 something, semi sensitive, semi pigmented, few lines</li>
    <li> I have been using this product to about 10 hearts now. Never thought to look for it on amazon until now. Got a great deal on a product I already love.</li>
    <li> gentle, smells wonderful..</li>
    <li> some review said the smell is awful but I find it delightful. since it&#x27;s milky so no harsh rubbing but medium exfoliating result</li>
    <li> A must have cleanser. Really very gentle. I use it once or twice a week. Leaves my face clean, soft and doesn&#x27;t give that feeling of dryness afterwards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice oil, Its amazing.It really cleans my face well, and it smells really nice.its  helped with my blackheads.</li>
    <li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results. Really like and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. Love how my skin feels after, never dry and smooth. Love the scent as well!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time. I have not however purchased from this merchant. I usually purchase it at a Department store counter. This did not have the beans for exfoliating.  It was defective.</li>
    <li> It smells great and does a good job on my skin.  The grains are very fine so they aren&#x27;t as scratchy as some other cleansers.  This is especially nice in the winter when the nose/lips area can be very sore and chapped.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff--it&#x27;s gentle but gets my skin clean and smooth. And the orange-y smell is delicious.</li>
    <li> The incorrect product was sent , however, I  accepted it and would try it....it burns the eyes, be careful.  I wanted the one step cleanser ....not exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Love this exfoliating cleanser; I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I use a few Clarins products and although I think they are a bit pricey, at least the products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I noticed a difference after the first use - no kidding!  My skin is clearer and softer.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and have very sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been a product junkie for years but have never had such great and fast results.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  Highly recommended.  This is my new favorite product.  The only reason I&#x27;m not throwing all 5 stars at this product is due to price.  It is expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and very greasy combination skin. I have tried many products over the years. Most of which either dry me out, break me out or cause me to become very oily and splotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some years ago, I went to work for Clarins. I have since stopped working for the company, but continue to use their facial cleansing products. (Some of the other products I like, some I do not. The line over all is expensive but generally worth the price in my opinion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The One Step is by far the best cleanser I have ever found. Not only does it clear up my blotchy oily/dry flaky patches, it helps to balance out areas where I have freckling and skin damage. My skin is so soft and I never have flairs of acne anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 35 years old and after using this product for two years, I am often mistaken for someone about to turn 30.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because the price was more reasonable than in the department stores. I love the product and think it does a great job both cleaning and exfoliating my face without overdrying it. I only dropped a star because instead of one bottle, I got two smaller bottles which I thought was weird.</li>
    <li> I feel like my skin is cleaner. It is gentle and still exfoliates. The smell of citrus is divine. Will continue buying.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! When I get done using it my skin doesnt feel dry or tight but I will still use the clarins toner after cleansing. Once I use the toner my skin has never felt softer. On top of the toner, the clarins bright plus moisturizer really makes my skin feel and look 100 times better! The cleanser is gentle enough for me to use everyday and I can feel the difference it makes my skin feel immediately. The  price on amazon.com is a very good price compared to the $37 I paid for it in Younkers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has a pleasing, fresh fragrance,  My skin is smoother, has brighter tone, and pores are shrinking and / or disappearing.  Will definitely re-purchase.  I have used many top-name, department store skin cleansers and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff. Its amazing. It smells nice. It feels nice. Its also really helped with my blackheads.</li>
    <li> This Cleanser is the best!  I did a lot of research on cleansers.  I wanted to have a more youthful appearance and fresher, clearer looking skin.  After using this product, I really did see an improvement.  I recently ran out of my first tube of this product and since I didn&#x27;t order right away, I thought maybe I could substitute witha cheaper product. I tried to combine a cheap exfolliant with a gentle form cleanser, and right away I noticed that my skin started looking dull and old.  I just bought my second tube of this cleanser and will stick to my routine from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that you try this!</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser regularly for many years and just keep it in the shower for daily use. (The Clarins counter at Macy&#x27;s cannot keep it in stock, so I&#x27;ve started ordering it instead.) The small, smooth granules feel like you are polishing your skin to a healthy glow. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love Clarins&#x27; exfoliating cleanswer - it is safe enough to use every day and it leaves the skin soft.</li>
    <li> I tried this exfoliating cleanser from a free sample and I just fell in love with it. I bought one for my sister for Christmas and she loved it too. I find mind very useful especially in the winter time. It is a bit expensive, but it is worth every penny. The exfoliating cleanser is gentle on your skin yet very efficient. I also love the smell. It has a great orange smell which I much prefer to flowery ones.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It is definitely worth the price it makes your face feel squeaky clean, but not dried out. I have normal to dry skin and this is awesome not sure if it&#x27;d clean oily skin so well but def worked for me, shipping was super quick, and came in prestine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clarins products for a couple of decades and they are wonderful.  After use, my skin feels so clean and nice.  Expensive, but you don&#x27;t use much, so in that way it&#x27;s a good value considering the result.</li>
    <li> This is another Clairn product that I highly recomend. It smells nice and it very good for cleaning up the areas on your face that are not welcome.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this one step exfoliating cleanser for quite a while now and will continue to do so.  The little grains make all the old skin disappear and my skin regains its smoothness.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I have yet to see how Clarins exfoliator is different from other exfoliators out there in a similar price range. But this product feels very gentle on my skin, a little goes a long way, and it smells divine. I usually hate fragrances in products and don&#x27;t go for smell, but this product is very gently and smells so fresh. I love it. I have combination skin and use this twice a week on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I once tried this at a mall on the persistence of a sales person, and loved it instantly. She did a small patch of my skin, and I liked the fact that it became clean and not dry. It mositurises as well as cleans, and it smells so good and fresh. Love it. Even my husband uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Little beads help scrub excess oils off skin. I used this to replace philosophy Purity. Id recommend it. I have sensitive skin too</li>
