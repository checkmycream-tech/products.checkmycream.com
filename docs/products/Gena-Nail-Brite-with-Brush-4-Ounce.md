### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>purchased the Colgate Whitening Toothpaste and found out that it is an AWESOME AND INEXPENSIVE way to whiten and brighten nails.  </li>
      <li>I ordered Almost Gel nail products from here as well the growth product is GREAT.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and one that I do not ever want to not have on hand.</li>
      <li>Very nice polished sheen.</li>
      <li>Great product that I would recommend for keeping those nails looking good.</li>
      <li>Good value for the cost.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>This would be good stuff for someone to use who gardens or gets art supplies under their nails.</li>
      <li>Amazing to brighten up nails after a day in the garden.</li>
      <li>I may need to buy more.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly  to scrub under my nails when cleaning them out.</li>
      <li>I found this product to be just ok.  </li>
      <li>I am always amazed at how many people don&#x27;t bother to read instructions on anything they buy.  </li>
      <li>I had better results using Colgate Baking Soda and Peroxide whitening toothpaste.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Keeps natural nails beautiful.</li>
      <li>Here is the review that tipped me off to the best &amp;#34;hack&amp;#34; i&#x27;ve seen in a long time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am changing my original 3 star review to 2 stars because it is nothing more than toothpaste and is WAY overpriced for what it is.</li>
      <li>This product makes my nails look SOOOO clean  : )  </li>
      <li>I like it, you can notice some change in the first week, but is not like a magical thing, you have to have time for this, but if you are ok with time, it will work.</li>
      <li>But the brush is fine &amp; I am still using it.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, easy to clean up afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good results with regular bleach, but I bought this for when I have cuts on my cuticles.  </li>
      <li>My favorite nail colors are the very darks and the very pales.  </li>
      <li>I guess this stuff would be great, but my nails are stained yellow from wearing red nail polish...</li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth the money because it is runny and the 4 oz is gone really, really fast.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I noticed a whitening of the nails after the first use, and think it will continue to work better with regular use.</li>
      <li>Save your money and use regular household bleach; it works 10 times better.  </li>
      <li>No problemo for Nail Brite, does the job quickly and completely.  </li>
      <li>Simple and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I will never again spend big bucks for a product with a fancy name and huge price tag.</li>
      <li>I am trying to get my toe nail summer ready</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference using it though.  </li>
      <li>My nails are really growing.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
      <li>It doesnt really work at all.</li>
      <li>I have not notice much change in my finger nails and toe nails after using this product.</li>
      <li>I will return to Sally&#x27;s nail brightener until I find a new product to replace it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty thick and sticks easily to nails.</li>
      <li>It makes no sense to pay this price when the exact same results can be had for a fraction of what this costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, when shopping for a different nail whitening product, I saw a review that said you can get better results for less by using Colgate Whitening Toothpaste</li>
      <li>I tried this product based on a previous review and my nails and skin are completely clean and even whiter than they were before the paint debacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the only nail cleaner that I have found really works.</li>
      <li>My nails arent really that yellow</li>
      <li>sometimes the Polish don&#x27;t the color of the natural nail out.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, but don&#x27;t leave it on for more than the recommended time 2 to 3 minutes as it is a little difficult to remove if left on too long  : )</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t interested in using chemicals like paint thinner on my hands because they are so dry in the Minnesota winter.</li>
      <li>This product is comparable to a much more expensive brand, but much, much cheaper.</li>
      <li>although on single use i didn&#x27;t find much change in my nail color</li>
      <li>This stuff barely touches it.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have particularly high hopes for the Gena Nail Brite as it is promoted as using lemon juice as well as other lighteners to achieve results.  </li>
      <li>Some did whiten a little; others did absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty, subtle, natural look.</li>

<li> Some did whiten a little; others did absolutely nothing.  </li>
<li> It is a pretty, subtle, natural look.</li>
<li> Received this today nails aren&#x27;t long enough yet I only brought it to Whitten the tips of my nails.</li>
<li> Worked for my minor orange-ing of nails and cleaned red residue from just cleaning red nail polish off.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t pay this much for a product that is no better than inexpensive Dollar Store whitening Toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t leave it on the nail long enough.</li>
<li> Apparently it is the other lighteners in this that do the trick.  </li>
<li> and I can already testify that my nails are indeed returning to their natural color from a stained dark reddish color due, to Skin Lightening products.</li>
<li> so if your nails are yellow from wearing dark polish you can expect a slight improvement but they will still be yellow.</li>
<li> This product whitened my nails completely in only a few minutes.  </li>
<li> I painted a door dark brown without wearing rubber gloves (not smart) and the paint was stuck to the underside of my nails.  </li>
<li> I recommend leaving it on for as long as you can before brushing with the stiff nail brush provided.</li>
<li> I wanted it to get rid of dark streaks on one of my nails due to me using a hardener with formaldehyde.</li>
<li> Sorry to say, I had much enthusiasm based on all of the ratings</li>
<li> and I found that all of these nail whitening potions are pretty expensive for the small quantities</li>
<li> I saw slightly less yellowing after using this product, but I might have imagined it too.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve have very long thick nails.  </li>
<li> It does not clean my nails.  </li>
<li> The expensive specialty nail products work well, but are too much money for a small amount of product.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed and the price is very reasonable.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried lemon juice in the past with no improvement whatsoever.  </li>
<li> Colgate is a mere $2.61 for 6.6 oz while this product is $5.76 for only 4 oz.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase it if I run out though.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use base coats, so colored polish stains my natural nails.  </li>
<li> My nails are brittle and weak due to artificial use and polish.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, sometimes the darks leave my nails discolored.  </li>
<li> Failed to do that.</li>
<li> If my nails were simply dirty</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> although on single use i didn&#x27;t find much change in my nail color</li>
    <li> This is the only nail cleaner that I have found really works. Like all things , you have to read instructions and follow them. I am always amazed at how many people don&#x27;t bother to read instructions on anything they buy.  Good product. This is my second purshase.</li>
    <li> This does whiten nails but it is not a holy grail or miracle product so if your nails are yellow from wearing dark polish you can expect a slight improvement but they will still be yellow.</li>
    <li> Amazing to brighten up nails after a day in the garden.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use.  Works like a charm.  If you wear polish (and who doesn&#x27;t) you need this. Keeps natural nails beautiful.</li>
    <li> I noticed a whitening of the nails after the first use, and think it will continue to work better with regular use. It&#x27;s pretty thick and sticks easily to nails. I recommend leaving it on for as long as you can before brushing with the stiff nail brush provided. Nail brush is also well made. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Enh.  If my nails were simply dirty I guess this stuff would be great, but my nails are stained yellow from wearing red nail polish... This stuff barely touches it.  I *think* I saw slightly less yellowing after using this product, but I might have imagined it too.  This would be good stuff for someone to use who gardens or gets art supplies under their nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, once yesterday and once today and I can already testify that my nails are indeed returning to their natural color from a stained dark reddish color due, to Skin Lightening products.</li>
    <li> I like it, you can notice some change in the first week, but is not like a magical thing, you have to have time for this, but if you are ok with time, it will work.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, but found that my local vendor was no longer keeping it in inventory. Great product that I would recommend for keeping those nails looking good.</li>
    <li> This product makes my nails look SOOOO clean  : )  Easy to use, but don&#x27;t leave it on for more than the recommended time 2 to 3 minutes as it is a little difficult to remove if left on too long  : )</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear nail polish so I don&#x27;t get the yellow stains from those dyes. I use it mostly  to scrub under my nails when cleaning them out. Sometimes I use it after cooking with carrots, etc. I don&#x27;t see much difference using it though.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t leave it on the nail long enough. But the brush is fine &amp; I am still using it. Not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase it if I run out though.</li>
    <li> Received this today nails aren&#x27;t long enough yet I only brought it to Whitten the tips of my nails. My nails are brittle and weak due to artificial use and polish. I ordered Almost Gel nail products from here as well the growth product is GREAT. My nails are really growing. I&#x27;ll give this product  one star because I haven&#x27;t used it yet. But I hope it works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and one that I do not ever want to not have on hand. Please do not stop making it. I use it every time I work in my gardens and greenhouse.....Love,love it!!</li>
    <li> It works for clearing the nails.  You have to be patient with the product as it begins the whitening process.</li>
    <li> It doesnt really work at all. My nails arent really that yellow but this didnt do any thing at all i think i should give it a 2...</li>
    <li> I am trying to get my toe nail summer ready and this fits the bill. use as directed and you will see a difference. As we age are nails get yellow. It works for me</li>
    <li> Did not whiten, and in fact, removed some of the nail strengthener I had just applied.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be just ok.  I had better results using Colgate Baking Soda and Peroxide whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Did not work! Very disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> Very nice polished sheen. It is a pretty, subtle, natural look.</li>
    <li> I wanted it to get rid of dark streaks on one of my nails due to me using a hardener with formaldehyde. Failed to do that. But did overall brighten all my nails.</li>
    <li> My favorite nail colors are the very darks and the very pales.  Unfortunately, sometimes the darks leave my nails discolored.  No problemo for Nail Brite, does the job quickly and completely.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked for my minor orange-ing of nails and cleaned red residue from just cleaning red nail polish off. My nails became bendy, but could have been the cleaning and water. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I painted a door dark brown without wearing rubber gloves (not smart) and the paint was stuck to the underside of my nails.  The nail and skin where they meet on the sides were also stained.  I wasn&#x27;t interested in using chemicals like paint thinner on my hands because they are so dry in the Minnesota winter. I tried this product based on a previous review and my nails and skin are completely clean and even whiter than they were before the paint debacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion would be to use a stiffer brush than the one that comes with this if there is paint or a lot of dirt to remove. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have not notice much change in my finger nails and toe nails after using this product. I may need to buy more.</li>
    <li> It does not clean my nails.  Or get them back to white.</li>
    <li> This product is comparable to a much more expensive brand, but much, much cheaper. Good value for the cost. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use base coats, so colored polish stains my natural nails.  I&#x27;ve had good results with regular bleach, but I bought this for when I have cuts on my cuticles.  I left the product on 3 times longer then recommended; and it only lightened &amp; brightened about 1 shade.  Save your money and use regular household bleach; it works 10 times better.  The thought might make you cringe; but how often do you get your hands covered in bleach cleaning the house anyway.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pay this much for a product that is no better than inexpensive Dollar Store whitening Toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked for me, but I had to use A LOT OF IT to get results.  It just wasn&#x27;t worth the money because it is runny and the 4 oz is gone really, really fast.  One bottle gave me only about 4 uses!  I purchased it twice before looking elsewhere and I found that all of these nail whitening potions are pretty expensive for the small quantities you receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when shopping for a different nail whitening product, I saw a review that said you can get better results for less by using Colgate Whitening Toothpaste and so I tried it.  Here is the review that tipped me off to the best &amp;#34;hack&amp;#34; i&#x27;ve seen in a long time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IZZXT7F9R3N3/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0013JBBOG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Colgate Whitening Toothpaste and found out that it is an AWESOME AND INEXPENSIVE way to whiten and brighten nails.  Colgate is a mere $2.61 for 6.6 oz while this product is $5.76 for only 4 oz.  The expensive specialty nail products work well, but are too much money for a small amount of product. I will never again spend big bucks for a product with a fancy name and huge price tag. I am changing my original 3 star review to 2 stars because it is nothing more than toothpaste and is WAY overpriced for what it is. It makes no sense to pay this price when the exact same results can be had for a fraction of what this costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the Colgate Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://amazon.com/Colgate-Peroxide-Whitening-Fluoride-Toothpaste/dp/B00099XMF2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_2?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424651232&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;Colgate+Baking+Soda+and+Peroxide+Whitening+toothpaste</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of nail whiteners.  Some did whiten a little; others did absolutely nothing.  I didn&#x27;t have particularly high hopes for the Gena Nail Brite as it is promoted as using lemon juice as well as other lighteners to achieve results.  I&#x27;ve tried lemon juice in the past with no improvement whatsoever.  Apparently it is the other lighteners in this that do the trick.  This product whitened my nails completely in only a few minutes.  Easy to apply, easy to clean up afterwards.  I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have very long thick nails.  This product did nothing for me. Sorry to say, I had much enthusiasm based on all of the ratings however my nails did not brighten. are you even left it on 5 minutes. I use this product as instructed 3 times a day just couldn&#x27;t get it to work for me.I do not have yellow nails I was just looking to brighten the white tips sometimes the Polish don&#x27;t the color of the natural nail out. I will return to Sally&#x27;s nail brightener until I find a new product to replace it.</li>
