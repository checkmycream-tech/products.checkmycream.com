      <li>This self tanner is amazing.</li>

      <li>This one is in fact very light.</li>
      <li>a lot goes on smooth no lines ,nice product</li>
      <li>I love the look of a tan but have NO desire to expose my skin to the suns dangers.</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments.</li>
      <li>and I love the color, so</li>
      <li>Love that there was no odor though.  </li>
      <li>it may look healthy...</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper tanners from the drug stores work better.</li>
      <li>You will look nice and not sickly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice does not irritate sensitive skin good for face to</li>
      <li>You can reapply easily to get the desired depth of color.  </li>
      <li>Dries so quick and goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>my husband thought I layed out in the sun and thought I was looking extra beautiful</li>
      <li>This product gives a nice color and goes on pretty evenly.</li>
      <li>This one is so cheap compared to that, and you still get a tan.</li>
      <li>I have ordered countless tanning products my favorites are shisiedo and this great foam.</li>
      <li>That is a huge help with application and keeps your hands clean too.</li>
      <li>It will give you a nice, very natural tint.</li>
      <li>There is absolutely no odor and the cost based on its performance is great.</li>
      <li>the color is a dream come true..</li>
      <li>Dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve gone through my first bottle too quickly.  </li>
      <li>I put it on after my shower (I use baby oil right before I get out) and I&#x27;m not orange.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t stain my hands, and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>I have very light facial skin since I keep my  face out if the sun-</li>
      <li>If anything, don&#x27;t buy it as a primary self-tan, but buy it to make all other tanning products better, or just use it by</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the odor the first 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I always put body lotion on first.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several self tanning lotions, many claiming they are non streaking.</li>
      <li>First the Good:  very, very slight, if any, after-smell;  dries quickly;  natural-looking tan (not orange tinted on me); works especially well with the Ulitmitt tan applicator mit.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not like I have much color to begin with.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a white girl like me, who doesn&#x27;t get tanned even after all day of sun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Have tried many self tanners and this one works really well...with little or no fragrance.</li>
      <li>The smell is okay and not very strong.  </li>
      <li>I also felt that my legs (the only place I used it) had a distinctly orange cast to them, and since I have cool-toned skin, I felt it looked very unnatural.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new using this product</li>
      <li>Very natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate so using lotion first helps get the foam on evenly.  </li>
      <li>Not as bad as many others that I have tried over the years however, so I will say it might not bother most people.</li>
      <li>I returned this as it was marketed as non orange and nearly scentless.</li>
      <li>Extremely natural looking.</li>
      <li>No odor, no mess.  </li>
      <li>no regrets buying this, will be using this now.</li>
      <li>I get lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;...but glad to share my &amp;#34;tan in a can&amp;#34; (as my husband calls it) secret.  </li>
      <li>Even after only one application, the color was enough to go bare legged with confidence.</li>
      <li>I found both claims to be false in my case, perhaps I have a super sensitive nose, but the smell was off-putting.</li>

<li> and my skin was dry...</li>
<li> This will not do, for the club, or to compliment your new little black dress.</li>
<li> It is only 1 oz less than a 40.00 bottle!</li>
<li> And washing it off my hands was no problem like I&#x27;ve had with other products staining before I could wash them..</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other self tan  products on my face for 15 years</li>
<li> it no more touched my white skin and the tan appeared ..</li>
<li> Also, it does not fade oddly after days of adding layers.</li>
<li> Not even the little hint of DHA that you smell even though all self-tan products claim there is no smell.</li>
<li> however this one is a waste of money.</li>
<li> It also has a very, very slight sticky feel.  </li>
<li> : This is a St. Tropez mit with a dollop of Sun365 and a spritz of Fake Bake regular formula to compare.</li>
<li> I have fake tan smell later after application..</li>
<li> When putting this product on, I used it in combination with a Fake Bake spray I had laying around, just to give it some tint to apply it evenly, and it even removed the smell from Fake Bake!</li>
<li> The Bad:  expensive for the size bottle you get;  </li>
<li> I have had disastrous results with other self-tanners, but this foam goes on evenly and without that horrible smell!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
<li> All this being said, I am thinking I am going to reorder because the Good/OK outweigh the Bad.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t deal with - can&#x27;t stand bad</li>
<li> Very very disappointed in this product-</li>
<li> Some products get a nasty</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product gives a nice color and goes on pretty evenly. I don&#x27;t like the odor the first 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Turned me orange when I went out in the sun.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Applied daily until the color I wanted was achieved, then every four days to maintain.  No odor, no mess.  Extremely natural looking.</li>
    <li> What a great product! I have had disastrous results with other self-tanners, but this foam goes on evenly and without that horrible smell!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to tell my friends!</li>
    <li> I was happy with this foam.  It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t stain my hands, and looks natural.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and I find the color to be great.</li>
    <li> For the price &amp;#34;what a gift&amp;#34;...the color is a dream come true..it no more touched my white skin and the tan appeared ..my husband thought I layed out in the sun and thought I was looking extra beautiful.. Best part..no smell!! I can&#x27;t deal with - can&#x27;t stand bad smells - and this product was awesome in that respect too. Some products get a nasty I have fake tan smell later after application.. But not this baby..I&#x27;m new using this product and I didn&#x27;t put moisturizer on before putting on the liquid bubble like foam and my skin was dry...I think it should do even better with moisturizer on for a more flawless application.. And washing it off my hands was no problem like I&#x27;ve had with other products staining before I could wash them..I&#x27;m considering a mitt applicator ..no regrets buying this, will be using this now.</li>
    <li> I love the look of a tan but have NO desire to expose my skin to the suns dangers. Have tried many self tanners and this one works really well...with little or no fragrance. You can reapply easily to get the desired depth of color.  I get lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;...but glad to share my &amp;#34;tan in a can&amp;#34; (as my husband calls it) secret.  Stay out of the sun and tanning beds...it may look healthy...but it is NOT.  Also bought a foam &#x27;mit&#x27; to apply tanner.  That is a huge help with application and keeps your hands clean too. I have not used it on my face..but suppose it would work there too.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is amazing. I&#x27;ve used several self tanning lotions, many claiming they are non streaking. This is the only one I have used that has gone on evenly with no streaks later on. Even after only one application, the color was enough to go bare legged with confidence. I have fair skin so it&#x27;s not like I have much color to begin with. There is absolutely no odor and the cost based on its performance is great.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it advertised.Cheaper tanners from the drug stores work better.</li>
    <li> I returned this as it was marketed as non orange and nearly scentless. I found both claims to be false in my case, perhaps I have a super sensitive nose, but the smell was off-putting. Not as bad as many others that I have tried over the years however, so I will say it might not bother most people. I also felt that my legs (the only place I used it) had a distinctly orange cast to them, and since I have cool-toned skin, I felt it looked very unnatural.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice does not irritate sensitive skin good for face to</li>
    <li> Very very disappointed in this product- I have very light facial skin since I keep my  face out if the sun- I applied this product 3 times at separate intervals throught the night after cleansing- and there was no difference before and after-i  even let it stay on overnight- I&#x27;ve used other self tan  products on my face for 15 years so I know self tanners will work- however this one is a waste of money. I gave it 1 star because there is no self tan smell</li>
    <li> First the Good:  very, very slight, if any, after-smell;  dries quickly;  natural-looking tan (not orange tinted on me); works especially well with the Ulitmitt tan applicator mit.  The OK:  takes a few applications to really make a difference, but I think this is why it doesn&#x27;t have that bad smell, so that&#x27;s OK.  It also has a very, very slight sticky feel.  The Bad:  expensive for the size bottle you get;  I feel like I&#x27;ve gone through my first bottle too quickly.  All this being said, I am thinking I am going to reorder because the Good/OK outweigh the Bad.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The color looks good - not orange at all.  The smell is okay and not very strong.  I don&#x27;t wear gloves but I do wash my hands as soon as I&#x27;m done applying.  I always put body lotion on first.  I live in a dry climate so using lotion first helps get the foam on evenly.  It takes 2 or 3 applications over 2 or 3 days to notice a difference in skin color.</li>
    <li> I have ordered countless tanning products my favorites are shisiedo and this great foam. I have received many compliments. Very natural looking tan. Very lightweight. No scent. I like to put it on when I get out of the shower. Dries quickly. Great results.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a white girl like me, who doesn&#x27;t get tanned even after all day of sun.&lt;br /&gt;I did bought a mitten it was easier to apply</li>
    <li> Excellent sunless tan foam. Dries so quick and goes on very smooth. Highly recommend. Love paulas choice products!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot goes on smooth no lines ,nice product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a qualified self-tan expert. I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun from salons, to take-home machines, to lotions, foams, sprays, and of course all the brands they come from. This one is in fact very light. It will give you a nice, very natural tint. Don&#x27;t expect to get bronze goddess from this, but it&#x27;s perfect for throughout the week, at the office, and church places. You will look nice and not sickly. This will not do, for the club, or to compliment your new little black dress. This product will not smell at all! Not even the little hint of DHA that you smell even though all self-tan products claim there is no smell. When putting this product on, I used it in combination with a Fake Bake spray I had laying around, just to give it some tint to apply it evenly, and it even removed the smell from Fake Bake! I was in shock! Also, it does not fade oddly after days of adding layers. Sometimes a patch of tan skin cells comes off leaving you looking like you have vitiligo, but not with this stuff. If anything, don&#x27;t buy it as a primary self-tan, but buy it to make all other tanning products better, or just use it by it&#x27;s self. Also, the price for the quality and quantity is awesome. Most good foam tanners run 35-50 dollars. This one is so cheap compared to that, and you still get a tan. Just don&#x27;t forget to shake well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pic1: This is a St. Tropez mit with a dollop of Sun365 and a spritz of Fake Bake regular formula to compare. Again, I just did this to make it easier to apply evenly. I think the reason there is literally no after smell in this product is because it isn&#x27;t tinted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pic2: How big the bottle is. It is only 1 oz less than a 40.00 bottle!</li>
    <li> One word:  streaks.  Love that there was no odor though.  Loved that Paula&#x27;s Choice products are not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I actually received this a while ago but didn&#x27;t try it until now cuz I was nervous lol! I put it on after my shower (I use baby oil right before I get out) and I&#x27;m not orange. I&#x27;m on day 4 using it and I love the color, so I can just maintain it now! Not spots on my feet, elbows or knees!</li>
