      <li>lol</li>
      <li>the shamppo itself is so nice and creamy, go for it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell which isn&#x27;t overly \\&quot;flowery\\</li>
      <li>It is also a good value, as you don&#x27;t need a lot to lather up.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a fair amount of silver in it, but it isn&#x27;t noticeably coarser then the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s feminine &amp; flirty and I immediately loved it.</li>
      <li>FanTASTIC price, and GREAT results!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shampoo is exceptionally good.  </li>
      <li>it seemed good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for the week it supposedly takes to give me stronger, more beautiful hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells really pleasant too, kind of floral . .</li>
      <li>It also has a pleasant scent, and a nice consistency.</li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I honestly think the Suave products I use are just as good as this.</li>
      <li>and this does it all, also leaves the hair in silky smooth shape, not drying it out one bit!!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it smells amazing</li>
      <li>but it works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>It was a nice change.</li>
      <li>Have used this every day for a week, and my hair is shiny, clean and smells great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about 6 months or so, and I can honestly say that my scalp and hair (I have naturally wavy/curly hair) look the best I have have seen!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the scent either, but it wasn&#x27;t very strong to me</li>
      <li>Apart from the cheap floral fragrance, I think it is a good value.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to see better moisturizing and detangling qualities.</li>
      <li>MUST use a shampoo that is cleansing (so that the top of my head doesn&#x27;t look oily), isn&#x27;t drying to my scalp or hair, and smells nice.</li>
      <li>Love this new brand, leaves your hair looking and feeling great!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
      <li>It smells awesome too which is a welcome change from typical dandruff shampoos.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>[My hair is very fine.]  </li>
      <li>I used it mainly on my scalp, working it very good.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works for leaving my hair feeling clean and moisturized, which is good, because I blow-dry a lot.</li>
      <li>It smells very strong, a pleasant smell, but so strong it makes it smell cheap.  </li>
      <li>Sulfates are very cheap and create bubbles.</li>
      <li>But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
      <li>Does my scalp feel better, well, yes.</li>
      <li>I urge everyone this product is great for a whole but please the moment you start noticing more hair in your brush please stop.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t expect much, even after reading all the great reviews.  </li>
      <li>This looked like more of a woman&#x27;s sort of product, so I gave it to the missus to try out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>and I needed more help with my scalp then my hair.</li>
      <li>My scalp does feel better.</li>
      <li>I so love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the smell of this brand.</li>

      <li>opened this shampoo and was immediately in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Nourishing Shampoo in my opinion is better than the Head and Shoulders.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s become one of my favorite shampoos.</li>
      <li>, while I love the shampoo, the conditioner for me leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
      <li>smell, but not something I&#x27;d use again with better alternatives for my hair on the market.</li>

      <li>It reminds me of Herbal Essences &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>To this day, I can&#x27;t get my haircut without the stylist, any stylist, saying they have never seen hair so shiny or healthy and they never believe me that they are looking at hair that is also home dyed each month, which should strip</li>
      <li>I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with.  </li>
      <li>If I hadn&#x27;t had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one.</li>
      <li>the way, I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so happy this new brand is on the market!ket!</li>
      <li>I do not wash my hair every day, and I find that this shampoo gets my hair very clean</li>
      <li>Functionally, this is a pretty good shampoo.</li>
      <li>So I think this would be perfect for people that have dry hair and</li>
      <li>I simply dry my hair and it looks great!</li>
      <li>Europe you&#x27;d not find shampoos with sulfates and fortunately they are phasing out in the United States as people get more educated.  </li>
      <li>So far, my hair looks great.  </li>
      <li>So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the shampoo, it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance of it as well -- clean and not too perfumy.</li>
      <li>It has many nourishing oils in it and makes hair feel clean and silky.  </li>
      <li>and I can easily go 2 to 3 days between shampoos.</li>
      <li>liked this shampoo so much that I ended up getting more on subscribe and save.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The bottles are also fairly easy to use.</li>

      <li>I am using this shampoo with Clair Strong Lengths conditioner.  </li>

      <li>The smell is pretty nice as well.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, soft apples-and-violets scent.</li>
      <li>free hair care</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo, finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
      <li>very fresh</li>
      <li>So fresh and clean smelling!</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and is much more manageable, and the itchy dry scalp seems to be much better after just 2 washes!!!</li>
      <li>I was excited to use it on my hair.</li>
      <li>Then one day I saw this in a magazine ad, decided to try it, and after a couple of weeks using it I had, for the first time in years, a healthy scalp.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only shampoo and conditioner i have found that works on my dry scalp</li>
    <li> I have a VERY sensitive and dry scalp and so far the only shampoo that really works for me, doesn&#x27;t stink, and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out is Biolage Cool Mint Shampoo.  Since that is so pricey, I decided to give this a try.  It smells very strong, a pleasant smell, but so strong it makes it smell cheap.  It left my hair limpless (is that a word!!?) and also my scalp dry and irritated.  Back to the pricey stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and the way it leaves my hair feeling. I have gotten tons of compliments from my hair cutter saying that my hair is so soft and healthy!</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo very much but I also ordered the conditioner and that was hard to come out of its container.  I had to&lt;br /&gt;squeeze it all out into a different container to be able to access it.</li>
    <li> I saw this shampoo in a magazine and was intrigued by it.  I came and found it on amazon and purchased it along with the conditioner.  I love it.  It is great shampoo and it leaves my hair smelling great.  I can already tell a difference with my dry scalp and my hair looks great too.  I will definitley be buying this again.  It is a wonderful shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised that such a reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner work so well...  I&#x27;ve always had problems finding mild enough products to clean and leave the hair soft, but not \\&quot;weighed down\\&quot; with conditioners... or shampoo&#x27;s that don&#x27;t dry the hair out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much, even after reading all the great reviews.  Since turning 50, my hair has thinned, is changing as it turns grey, and my scalp is so dry I have horrible itchy dandruf - which I&#x27;ve never had to deal with in my life.  I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; dry scalp, mild shampoo&#x27;s over the past 2 years, and even the harsher \\&quot;head and shoulders\\&quot;, \\&quot;medicated\\&quot; types, which are WAY too strong . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and conditioner do the trick.  My hair feels so soft and is much more manageable, and the itchy dry scalp seems to be much better after just 2 washes!!! I&#x27;m so happy.  It smells really pleasant too, kind of floral . . very fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizing version of Clairol&#x27;s Herbal Essence shampoo (the one that comes in the blue bottle) for years now. When I saw this shampoo, it sounded relatively comparable, so I thought I&#x27;d check it out. I&#x27;ve been using it for the week it supposedly takes to give me stronger, more beautiful hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly short, thick, dry hair that curls just enough to be nearly unmanageable if I let it grow too long. As long as my hair is really short, I usually just shampoo and condition, and then comb my hair lightly into place and it works. As my hair gets a bit longer I often use a mousse or leave-in conditioner as my hair is still rather dry even with the moisturizing products. This product has been working pretty much the same way. My hair is just on the cusp of getting too long, and if I just shampoo and condition, this product leaves my hair a bit flighty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product looks, feels and works much like Herbal Essence, except that it&#x27;s white in color rather than blue. It has a thick, rich feel to it and it lathers up nicely, even with the small dime-sized amount I usually use. The product seems to rinse cleanly from my hair. It has a decent, mild, floral scent. Despite the claim that it helps dry scalp, I have not noticed any change in this product from Herbal Essence, either during the washing process or afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in a bottle that has a wide, flat base that doubles as product dispenser. Personally I would prefer a container that could be stood on either end. It is helpful to store the product on its cap as it&#x27;s getting low, but when the bottle is full, storing it on its cap tends to produce a rush of product when the valve is opened, which results in much more product than I need, and there&#x27;s no way to return the excess to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a good product, but not necessarily better or worse than Herbal Essence. Whether or not I would buy this in the future will depend solely on pricing - I would buy whichever one is cheaper.ld buy this in the future will depend solely on pricing - I would buy whichever one is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I am using this shampoo with Clair Strong Lengths conditioner.  It is mild shampoo and only a dash is needed for your hair, no matter what the hair length.  It has many nourishing oils in it and makes hair feel clean and silky.  In addition to oils, this shampoo also has multiple bio-nutrients; combination of minerals and vitamins will make your hair stronger and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo does not have strong fragrance; it is just right.  It also keeps frizz out of the way, very helpful feature for humid climate customers.  Sturdy base of the product makes it stable to use and lay out in the shower.  You will never make a mistake which bottle is shampoo and which one is conditioner.  Shampoo label is upside down while conditioner can be read normally.  Shampoo has light see true color, while conditioner has thick white color - another distinction if you are not paying attention to the lables and you just start queezing the product out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally enjoy the product very much and recommend it to others.  It is a kind of product that can be used by the entire family.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo and it left my hair light and fluffy.  The scalp was well moisturized, and left the hair smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review for long term results</li>
    <li> Functionally, this is a pretty good shampoo. It cleaned my hair without stripping it down to squeaky nothing, it didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out in any sort of rash, and it did seem to reduce the dry-skin-itchiness that i get on my scalp in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint i have about it is the scent. It has a sort of generic middle-tier-department-store-perfume-counter-medley smell. A little floral, a little fruity, totally non-specific, and a little cloying. It didn&#x27;t really stick, though, so at least i didn&#x27;t feel like i was walking around wearing cheap perfume all day.</li>
    <li> FanTASTIC price, and GREAT results! I am a broke-ass hack model who can&#x27;t afford to buy salon products. I get my hair cut at Supercuts, so I&#x27;m not looking to spend a ton of cash on shampoo. This stuff is available everywhere, and is very affordably priced. And a little goes a looonnnng way, so it lasts FOREVER. **HIGHLY** recommended! I bought some for my mom, and she likes it too!</li>
    <li> I so love this shampoo.  Found it by accident here on Amazon.  I have super fine hair with a dry itchy scalp.  Well not any longer!!  Will not use another shampoo again for this problem.  Am here now to buy more.  It smells good, comes out of bottle without a problem.  Majorly recommend.</li>
    <li> May 8  2014.  Ms. LeeJai Cook, Roaring Springs, TEXAS USA.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is exceptionally good.  I hoped that the shampoo might make my hair more coarse. [My hair is very fine.]  It did not make my hair more coarse but is left my hair very shiny and soft.  I would buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I heard a few good reviews on the conditioner. I typically use Pantene ProV, but decided to give this a try since my shampoo had run out. I have fine, long hair that is not color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it was extremely difficult to distribute throughout my hair. As another reviewer mentioned, it had the consistency of lotion that just would not sud up. I thought that was no big deal, I&#x27;d just use more the next time. My hair felt stripped when I had rinsed the shampoo out. Stripped as in my hair didn&#x27;t feel slippery and smooth like it typically does, it felt tangled and rough. I used my Pantene ProV conditioner (since I still have a bunch left) and it felt like it was just rinsed off without doing anything for my hair (i.e. the texture of my hair hadn&#x27;t improved at all like it normally does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried it, I did get a little bit of suds from the shampoo, but when I used my conditioner it started foaming up. I&#x27;ve never had this happen to me so maybe there is a bad chemical reaction going on between my hair, the shampoo and the conditioner. Or maybe the shampoo and conditioner are not compatible. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s just a little bit too high maintenance for me and I&#x27;m going to trash it rather than risk my hair breaking or coloring because of the chemical stress. I&#x27;ve mixed different brands of shampoo and conditioner before like Redken, Pantene ProV, Suave, and Herbal Essences and have never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I love the smell. It reminds me of Herbal Essences &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with my dry scalp. Also, a drop the size of a large green pea makes way too much lather.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a 5 star product. It takes care of dry scalp like nobodies business. Can go up to 4 days without washing my hair. I have long thick oily hair and this product works better than the other expensive products i have tried. This shampoo and conditioner i can&#x27;t say enough good about. It&#x27;s just to bad they discontinued it. Do Not know what im going to do now.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could find a shampoo for dandruff or dry scalp that would not only smell great but also actually help my scalp and this does it all, also leaves the hair in silky smooth shape, not drying it out one bit!! Great shampoo, finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> We chose to try out the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair shampoo to see if it&#x27;s all it claims to be. Both my wife and I have used it, and I would have to say it&#x27;s lived up to expectations. The shampoo is pretty thick, so after you&#x27;ve scrubbed it into your hair some, I would recommend getting a little more water in your hair and scrubbing some more to get a good lather going. It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell which isn&#x27;t overly \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; so if you&#x27;re a man you shouldn&#x27;t be scared to use it. My wife has colored hair and says that it&#x27;s been a little harsher on her color than other shampoos she has used (she usually uses Pantene). Other than that, we both think it&#x27;s a decent shampoo that is worth trying out to see if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought lots of shampoo and conditioner online and never really had any issues with leaking during transport, until this line of Clear Scalp products. The bottles themselves seem to have a high than usual leaking problem. Out of the 4 bottles I had shipped to me, 2 of them were leaking in some way. Not a lot came out, but enough to know that at some point while they were in the mail, they had started to leak some. The shampoo itself works well and as long as you wash it out thoroughly, leaves hair feeling clean. Probably works best on dry and normal hair. If your hair is particularly oily, you might find a lighter formula works better, since this is a slightly thicker and heavier shampoo. Nice shampoo, but be wary that you might find a little has leaked out during transport.</li>
    <li> I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp.  I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair.  I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews.  This shampoo is not for everyone.  If you&#x27;re at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away.  I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with.  Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best.  I don&#x27;t work for them. I&#x27;m just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.</li>
    <li> I picked up this shampoo because I have a very dry sensitive scalp, especially in the winter time.  Typically my go-to shampoo and conditioner has been [[ASIN:B001F51RCY Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 23.7 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)]].  It&#x27;s not glamorous and certainly isn&#x27;t as fun as the salon shampoos I&#x27;d prefer to buy, but it&#x27;s treated my scalp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works equally well at keeping my scratching at bay and gives me another brand to choose from.  But it&#x27;s not perfect.  Compared to Head and Shoulders (and other shampoos I try) I personally find the scent overpowering.  Not much scent seems to carry over to my hair, but opening it up in the shower the smell is just too much for me.  It&#x27;s very floral and not that pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while I love the shampoo, the conditioner for me leaves a lot to be desired.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and silky as what I am used to and at times, it&#x27;s made me feel like I forgot to use conditioner at all.  While it doesn&#x27;t impact my opinions of this shampoo it does make me question whether I&#x27;ll see the full benefit of using this product as even if I continue using this shampoo I will likely switch to a different conditioner to get my silky hair back and it advertises that you see the best results by using both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I suffer from ecxema and recently Ive had it on my scalp.  Ive tried therapies like Neutrogena T Gel but it dried my hair out terribly.  This shampoo helped alleviate the itchiness and the shamppo itself is so nice and creamy, go for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the smell of this brand. My boyfriend loves it too; I have to remind him I&#x27;m not a flower and he shouldn&#x27;t go around sniffing me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner for the last month &amp; was immediately hooked. I decided to try the shampoo since my hair and nose seemed to agree with the conditioner so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo, like the conditioner, has a sweet, floral smell. It&#x27;s feminine &amp; flirty and I immediately loved it. The texture is fairly thick but still a bit silky if you rub it between your fingers (this is important for me because I can&#x27;t have shampoo that&#x27;s too drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly long, naturally curly, and thick. I wear it naturally (air-dried and curly) about twice a week so that it can recuperate, and flat iron it to death the rest of the time. I want my hair to be as shiny, soft, frizz-free, and generally healthy as possible either way I wear it, which is a tall order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to accomplish this I&#x27;ve developed an optimal routine over time &amp; experimentation. I use a miniscule amount of shampoo ONLY on my scalp, &amp; condition the bottom half of my hair BEFORE rising. This way, the shampoo is pulled through the strands &amp; cleans them without overly-drying the bottom half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I MUST use a shampoo that is cleansing (so that the top of my head doesn&#x27;t look oily), isn&#x27;t drying to my scalp or hair, and smells nice. All of this has been accomplished so far with the Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo. Note that a little goes a LONG way. If I use too much I notice that my hair won&#x27;t be as silky &amp; a bit on the dry side. However, it&#x27;s all a matter of adjusting and figuring out what amount works for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 100% plan on continued usage of both the conditioner and now the shampoo. I&#x27;m crazy about the conditioner but I like the shampoo too. I&#x27;m so happy this new brand is on the market!ket!</li>
    <li> I have dry, damaged and color treated long hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I seen this shampoo I was excited to give it a try hoping that it would help my hair out from all the damage that I cause it!&lt;br /&gt;My scalp in the summer seems to get itchy at times from the heat and the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;This has helped with that, the conditioner has probably helped with that as well.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers very well and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;It rinses out clean and after I follow with the [[ASIN:B007RTR8T8 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] my hair looks and feels much better!&lt;br /&gt;I really like this and the price is excellent!</li>
    <li> I am unfortunate enough to have dry hair, and a scalp that can start looking oily if not washed at least every other day. I really like this shampoo for the most part - it does a gentle, yet effective, job of cleansing one&#x27;s hair and smells terrific. However, this is almost *too* moisturizing for my hair! If I don&#x27;t use a cleansing shampoo about once a week, my scalp looks greasy even with daily washing. So I think this would be perfect for people that have dry hair and scalps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate enough to receive this through Amazon Vine.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for about a week without any change. My scalp is just as dry and itchy as it was when I started using it. I gave the rest of the bottle to my mom, she seems to like it but doesn&#x27;t have a dry scalp. lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about 6 months or so, and I can honestly say that my scalp and hair (I have naturally wavy/curly hair) look the best I have have seen! Best to use everyday to keep the itchy dry scalp at bay. My only complaint is that it seems as though they have discontinued this specific product, as I can no longer find it in stores and their website no longer lists it as one of their products.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo seems to be like many others that launch into the \\&quot;clear\\&quot; or \\&quot;clean\\&quot; phase.  However, unlike the good ones that go that route and put in better ingredients to truly be clear, this still has sulfates, the cheapest ingredient you can put in a shampoo and that strips your hair horribly...which is why it&#x27;s used in floor cleaners to strip a floor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having worked in cosmetic and chemical ingredient sales in the past alongside the scientists that created products, I learned a wealth of info I took with me and I eliminated sulfates long before it was easy to find sulfate-free shampoos dotting the shelves everywhere. To this day, I can&#x27;t get my haircut without the stylist, any stylist, saying they have never seen hair so shiny or healthy and they never believe me that they are looking at hair that is also home dyed each month, which should strip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Europe you&#x27;d not find shampoos with sulfates and fortunately they are phasing out in the United States as people get more educated.  Unfortunately, in the U.S. we equate bubbles with cleaning and don&#x27;t realize the two really have nothing to do with whether or not the shampoo is working. Sulfates are very cheap and create bubbles. The alternatives are costlier, have less bubbles, clean your hair better, and don&#x27;t strip it at all meaning you get a shine kind of like you see on TV commercials...not from oil, but from your hair not being stripped and dying and breaking.  It is still oil-free. Plus, sulfates strip the color out of your hair and even create hair loss, which occurs naturally as we age so helping that along isn&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of this shampoo but it didn&#x27;t have ingredients any different from the cheapest ones on the shelf in the supermarket, just better marketing and the \\&quot;clear\\&quot; phrase that some may equate with being a better brand, especially when it also claims to be moisturizing which it quite simply can&#x27;t be with these ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the bottle very difficult to squeeze, as it gets low. When you get to the last part of the bottle, you have to take the lid off to use it because it will no longer squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, but not something I&#x27;d use again with better alternatives for my hair on the market.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the bottle very difficult to squeeze, as it gets low. When you get to the last part of the bottle, you have to take the lid off to use it because it will no longer squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, but not something I&#x27;d use again with better alternatives for my hair on the market.</li>
    <li> My hair is hip length, very straight, medium thick and very fine. There&#x27;s a fair amount of silver in it, but it isn&#x27;t noticeably coarser then the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that tends to split at the ends, and using Clear products,there has been a lot less splitting than I&#x27;ve had with shampoos before. It&#x27;s actually comparable to shampoo free hair care routines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smells nice, and has rich feeling lather that rinses well. The scent may be a little too feminine for some men to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with the matching conditioner, it does leave hair well conditioned/moisturized, soft and shiny. It&#x27;s become one of my favorite shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone who normally uses the cheapest shampoo I can get because my mindset was any shampoo worked just as well.  I may be changing my tune after using this.  After only a few days using this nourishing shampoo and conditioner together I found that I was running my fingers through my hair.  Well, that&#x27;s not a normal thing for me to do because I swim a lot and usually my hair feels like straw.  Not so using this!  Some people have mentioned there being a strong scent with this shampoo; I like a lot of scent and to me this has very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this shampoo so much that I ended up getting more on subscribe and save.  I still find myself running my fingers through my hair; definitely a winner for me!  :-)  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that both bottles of shampoo I received (the original one and then one on subscribe and save) leaked.  The bottle was taped but a small amount of shampoo still leaked out.  We live in the desert so I imagine it got too hot and the shampoo expanded.  I still do recommend this highly if you want soft silky hair like mine now feels!  :-)</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo and found that it gave me too much volume. My two kids are swimmers and this shampoo worked well for them. It smells nice and dealt with that swimmer pool/sheen that some shampoos don&#x27;t deal with properly. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp. I have problems with itchy scalp, hair loss, and dry hair. When I first used this product, I noticed a difference in how my hair felt. It was super soft and I didn&#x27;t notice that filmy feeling I have with other shampoos and conditioners. It was a nice change. A month later, I am still using both products. My scalp does feel better. My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much (not sure if that is from my change of diet though or the shampoo), and my hair still feels soft. My sister purchased this product for colored hair and complained of build up. I have not noticed this. My hair still feels as soft as when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are also fairly easy to use. One opens from the top and the other from the bottom which is nice otherwise you can get the bottles mixed up (which on is the conditioner and which one is the shampoo).  You just press one side of the top and it opens up, press down and it snaps back in place. No mess. The shampoo and conditioner bottles look almost exactly alike, but like I said, they open differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is thick and wavy. I&#x27;ve noticed my waves are more pronounced because they aren&#x27;t dragging down from build up. I really like this shampoo and will continue to use them both.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but nothing unique about it. From the commericals you will think this was some great shampoo but it&#x27;s really not. Not that it&#x27;s not a good product but it&#x27;s not worth the price at all. I honestly think the Suave products I use are just as good as this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was good as a basic shampoo. It is a thick shampoo that smells good, lathers very well and rinses easily. My hair did not feel like straw/dry after using it. It is advertised as a \\&quot;dry scalp\\&quot; shampoo though, and I did not feel like it did anything at all for the dry scalp issue, so I did knock off 2 stars for that. It is great as an everyday shampoo, though, and should be marketed as just that. If it was marketed as just \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; with no mention of the dry scalp, it would have been a 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of using the matching conditioner - it wasn&#x27;t bad, but not the best. I would have liked to see better moisturizing and detangling qualities. While using the set, I did not see an improvement with dry scalp problems.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works for leaving my hair feeling clean and moisturized, which is good, because I blow-dry a lot. It has a pleasant, soft apples-and-violets scent. (It reminds me of something from my childhood, but I can&#x27;t quite remember what.) Don&#x27;t be surprised when you see that the product is the same lavender color as the bottle.</li>
    <li> After reviewing the anti-dandruff shampoo, I purchased the conditioner, and decided to also try this shampoo. I have been very pleased with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t generally get flaky dandruff, but my scalp is dry, and this shampoo is perfect. I love the fragrance of it as well -- clean and not too perfumy. I do not wash my hair every day, and I find that this shampoo gets my hair very clean and I can easily go 2 to 3 days between shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have normal hair, but suffer from a little bit of dry scalp especially in the winter time. I normally use \\&quot;Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp\\&quot; which is good shampoo, but nothing special. CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo in my opinion is better than the Head and Shoulders. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or greasy, and I like the fragrance much better than the other brand. It&#x27;s a little on the strong side, but I like it. The price is also right for a quality shampoo. If you&#x27;re looking for a dry scalp formula shampoo, I recommend \\&quot;CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. It also cleans well, but not great, which I guess should be expected if it is for dry scalps. I would have given this 5 stars but felt that it was very hard to rinse off. I felt a bit of film, and not like I feel after I condition my hair. Now, I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so when it feels filmy, that&#x27;s saying something. I do think it is this brand, as I have had similar experience with some of their other shampoos. That is the minus for me. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker, and I think other may not mind this as much. It is also a good value, as you don&#x27;t need a lot to lather up. Does my scalp feel better, well, yes. If it didn&#x27;t feel filmy I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it smells amazing but it works amazingly well. After using it twice my scalp was starting to get softer and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love this new brand, leaves your hair looking and feeling great! It smells awesome too which is a welcome change from typical dandruff shampoos. Never get itchy scalp since I&#x27;ve started using</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and when I put this shampoo in my hand I thought, \\&quot;Oh great, this is going to make my hair go totally flat.\\&quot; Sure enough, this shampoo left my hair feeling heavy and greasy. This is not the shampoo for me. I think it would work well for someone with a large amount of hair that is dry and damaged. The shampoo has a great sent and may be the perfect solution for someone else. So, I cannot recommend it for someone with hair like mine, but for the price it might be worth a try for someone else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clear products before and have liked them but this particular one caused my scalp to dry out. Go figure.</li>
    <li> I have been using Clear shampoo along with Clear conditioner to care for my long hair.  The scent and texture do not stand out in any way, but what I look for is results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider my shampoo a positive success if it helps me avoid split ends and dry, flaky scalp.  So far, my hair looks great.  I continue to get compliments on my silky, shiny hair, so the shampoo is doing its job.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I don&#x27;t really have dandruff...just a bit of dry scalp from time to time. Since using this shampoo, I haven&#x27;t had any issues. That&#x27;s the best testament of all - it works. It also has a pleasant scent, and a nice consistency. Highly recommended for those with dry scalp...or anyone who wants to avoid it.</li>
    <li> The conditioning of this shampoo is quite good, and it never left my hair frizzy or dry. As for the dry scalp prevention or treatment, it works better than a regular shampoo, but not quite as good as one of the dandruff brands that is made for dry scalp. The problem is, those dandruff brands can be hard on the hair. So I used this shampoo every other day, alternating with the harsher brand, and it worked out pretty well. The scent was a bit overpowering. It cleaned the hair well, and I was able to use less so a bottle lasted for a good month, even with my long and thick hair.</li>
    <li> very nice! it give my hair shiny and my scalp clean...</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditional cause it seemed good and I needed more help with my scalp then my hair. I have thin hair but a lot of it and I have now been using this product for a few months and a few weeks ago I started to notice my hair was starting to fall out. I was able to pull stands and strands out of my hair. I didn&#x27;t think it was the product until the other day where I research why I was losing so much hair cause at this point I now have handfuls coming out. And the majority of the reviews mentioned the same thing losing hair. So I stopped immediately. I urge everyone this product is great for a whole but please the moment you start noticing more hair in your brush please stop.</li>
    <li> I feel compelled to write a review on this product because of the damage it has done to my hair. I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest, this is not it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CAUTION THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT AND IRRITATE YOUR SCALP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with hair breakage to begin with and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse. But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market. FYI... if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Dry Scalp), with a price between the two extremes, has a floral fragrance that reminds me of cheap children&#x27;s perfume and lingers all day. It is not terrible, but I think a simple \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell would be much better.  The \\&quot;Clear Men\\&quot; shampoos have a nicer smell, which would work well for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is much like lotion, but it lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, but it might be a bit heavy for some people.  It reminds me of a shampoo+conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Dry Scalp shampoo is a good shampoo for women who have very dry hair.  It would be particularly valuable during the winter.  Apart from the cheap floral fragrance, I think it is a good value.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with a dry scalp, but my hair itself is very dry so I thought I would try this out. It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. It works fine for normal cleaning, but because I have such thick, dry, frizzy hair, I didn&#x27;t see any great improvements and would not use this over my regular hair care products (Aussie). I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the scent either, but it wasn&#x27;t very strong to me so it was bearable.</li>
    <li> This looked like more of a woman&#x27;s sort of product, so I gave it to the missus to try out. Here&#x27;s what she had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level. My doubt came from the low price and sort-of-cheap bottle design. I usually pay $10 to $20 for a bottle of shampoo from name brands such as Frederic Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Pureology and The Body Shop. I didn&#x27;t think it fair to compare Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy Moisturizing Dry Scalp shampoo with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear shampoo is comparable with some of the shampoos mentioned above. It has nice fragrance, cleans my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with [[ASIN:B007RTR8UM CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]. Although I won&#x27;t say the quality of Clear shampoo is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear shampoo is great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle design. I don&#x27;t like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle. I wish it had a nozzle dispenser or round shape so that it&#x27;s easier to hold with wet hands. When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoo, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!</li>
    <li> It might seem ridiculous to have some dandruff as well as oily hair. My hair gets oily in about 3 days. I try to not wash more than every 3, to not dry out my hair on the ends. This means I do get some dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened this shampoo and was immediately in love with the scent. So fresh and clean smelling! I was excited to use it on my hair. The shampoo alone did a nice ob, but it left my hair a little lacking after rinsing. If I hadn&#x27;t had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one. I used it mainly on my scalp, working it very good. I worked it through the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After air drying, my hair was shiny and silky. However in a day, I noticed more oil than normal on my scalp and hair near my roots. In 2 days, I found myself needing to wash my hair, when typically I can do another day. So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the shampoo, it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I use my treadmill every evening and go to the gym most days, so my hair gets pretty sweaty and flat. Have used this every day for a week, and my hair is shiny, clean and smells great. Not dried out, manageable. I&#x27;d get it again!</li>
    <li> nedded something for dry scalp and this seems to work for me. use it a couple times a week. was a great price.</li>
    <li> THE only thing that helps it besides prescription shampoos.  Really a blessing. Helped stop my breakage issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much:)</li>
    <li> When I hit 49 my hair started falling out and my scalp went nuts...dry, itchy, crunchy weird build-up that the dermatologists first put down to dermatitis, and then to thyroid disorder. No matter what I tried, it never improved and often got worse with treatment. Even though the derms assured me that after I got my thyroid balanced it would go away...it never did. I tried moisturizing shampoos too, but nothing worked. Then one day I saw this in a magazine ad, decided to try it, and after a couple of weeks using it I had, for the first time in years, a healthy scalp. I guess I didn&#x27;t really have anything wrong with my scalp except for a need for a shampoo that didn&#x27;t strip my skin. It&#x27;s a relief to have no flakes, no itch, and a smooth, clear scalp. Dermatologists were laughably wrong!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always been hard for me to find shampoo/condition that works for me. I have medium length wavy hair and most shampoos either weigh my hair down and straighten it, or make my hair go frizzy. This is the first shampoo/condition that I&#x27;ve found that does neither and actually improves the look of my hair; it finally looks healthy! I don&#x27;t need to use any additional products once I&#x27;m out of the shower. I simply dry my hair and it looks great! The smell is pretty nice as well.</li>
