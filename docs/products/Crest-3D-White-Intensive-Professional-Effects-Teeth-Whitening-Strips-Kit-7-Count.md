<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this to use before my wedding. The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They work well, a noticeable difference&lt;br /&gt;2. You only have to do it 7 times&lt;br /&gt;3. They stay on really well (compared to previous versions) even if you are talking to someone&lt;br /&gt;4. The taste is much better than previous versions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Holy geez did my teeth hurt by day 5. I don&#x27;t consider myself someone with sensitive teeth, but I would get these random incredibly painful jolts in my mouth that were pretty unpleasant. It wasn&#x27;t just in the few hours after using them, it was any time. This went away within a few days of finishing the last one.&lt;br /&gt;2. Two hours is a long time, but any stronger and I think it would be too difficult to tolerate&lt;br /&gt;3. For the cost, I didn&#x27;t think the effect lasted that long. It&#x27;s hard to tell because the whiteness fades gradually and depends on what you eat. For me I&#x27;d say it lasted a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it did exactly what it was supposed to do. Considering the price and the pain factor, I&#x27;d only do this for very special occasions.</li>
    <li> This really whitened my teeth. I saw visible results after one use. My teeth were a little bit sensitive after using this, but it went away after a couple of hours. These strips are really easy to use and give long lasting results. Do not brush your teeth before using this though, because that would make your teeth too sensitive.</li>
    <li> Received brand new and on time! Very happy customer here!! Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> Had to buy new shades because this stuff was so good.</li>
    <li> Great product but pay attention to the reviews if you have sensitive teeth.  I didn&#x27;t use it every day. I used it every couple days when my teeth felt better.&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t feel sensitive while it was on, but they did the day after for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, even using them a few days apart, they work great.</li>
    <li> i like crest 3d whitening strips. i loved to try all of crest 3d whitening strips to fine one i really would like to stick with.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Teeth sensitivity did happen, so I whiten every three days. Been using the entire 7-day treatment twice a year and it continues to keep my teeth white and beautiful. :)</li>
    <li> This is the third time I bought this product from Crest,&lt;br /&gt;Great results, لاetter than any other product I try</li>
    <li> Bought these at a wholesale store with a damaged box - so only got 3 sets. Loved the product so ordered thru amazon. Better price than in stores. Strips cause my teeth to be sensitive for day or two after, so wanted to use professional 2 hour system to get best result. Very impressive and many of close friends/family notice whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Philips Zoom whitening which is done by a professional in a clinic, I had sensitivity for about a day only. After 6 months of the procedure I wanted to keep my teeth white so I decided to get this from a store and It was really amazing! It kept my teeth white so far &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I should warn you that you should NOT squeeze the strips when you place them near the gum as it might release some ingredients that might burn your gum and causes hypersensitivity. So be careful when you place them and don&#x27;t put them on the gum too just close to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck &#x3D;)!</li>
    <li> I have tried both the Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects with level 4 whitening and the Intensive Professional Effects with level 5 whitening. I have also had professional whitening done in the past through the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to state up front that whitening your teeth will not be a painless process. You are putting peroxide and other whitening ingredients onto your teeth and they are made to permeate the surface. You have nerves inside your teeth and peroxide burns. Tooth and gum sensitivity is to be expected. You&#x27;re bleaching your teeth. Do not whiten your teeth expecting zero sensitivity or pain. To expect that is like expecting exercise to not make your muscles really hurt when you haven&#x27;t exercised them in a very long time. It&#x27;s going to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you deal with the sensitivity? What I do is start brushing with a toothpaste made to cut back on sensitivity at least 14 days in advance of the whitening process. Also use a mouthwash or rinse made for sensitivity as well. DO NOT BRUSH YOUR TEETH RIGHT BEFORE APPLYING ANY WHITENING PRODUCTS!! The reason for this is because when you brush your teeth you commonly get very tiny cuts in your mouth. To use whitening products too soon after brushing your teeth is basically to put peroxide directly into these tiny cuts which equals a lot more pain, and you&#x27;re also directly putting the peroxide into your bloodstream which can make you sick. Wait at least an hour after brushing to apply the whitestrips. If you&#x27;re worried about debris on your teeth you can rinse your mouth out with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few days expect a lot of tooth sensitivity. I learned to take a Tylenol in advance of applying the whitestrips and it significantly cuts down on pain. With the professional effects series of whitestrips you can drink water, but I recommend using a straw if possible  because if you get the strips too wet they will start to slip and you digest some of the gel which can make you sick to yourstomach. I hydrate prior to whitening so I&#x27;m not having to guzzle water during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whitening results go, I did find the Intensive professional Effects whitestrips to have the most whitening. Don&#x27;t expect  to get teeth as white as what you see on TV or in magazines. Unless your teeth are already white and have been whitened before professionally you aren&#x27;t likely to get blinding white results. As a kid my teeth were discolored by Tetracycline, so I had my teeth professionally whitened years ago The thing is, really deep stains DO start to reappear over time so whitening is not permanent, especially if you drink coffee, soda, tea and eat staining foods. If you are a heavy soda drinker or eat a lot of acidic foods you may have enamel loss and that will also make whitening significantly less effective and whole lot more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do the Intensive Professional Effects whitestrips compare to the real deal professional whitening? Honestly, it&#x27;s not the same, but this is the best over the counter whitening kit I have ever used, hands down. When I had my professional whitening done it cost $300, and that was just my top teeth and was back in the late 1990s, so I&#x27;m sure it would be way more expensive now. My professional whitening was syringes of peroxide gel I added to a custom fitted plastic tray that I wore twice a day for 2 hours each time. I had extraordinary results from it with all my yellow Tetracycline stains removed and my whitening was whiter than their charts. I did 3 rounds of the professional whitening system and my teeth stayed white for years, but in the past couple years I have had to touch them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your teeth are not too badly stained or you have done professional whitening before, this kit is excellent. It will save you a lot of money, time, and effort. If you have really deep stains, enamel loss, or other concerns I would recommend you save your money and get your teeth professionally whitened bya dentist. If you are concerned about pain, I would recommend you talk to your dentist and find out what whitening method would be best for you.</li>
    <li> i used it for 2 days because it make my teeth very senstive but the results were great, my teeth were changed in its color and become little brite</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  Takes some getting used to leaving on for 2 hours and did experience some sensitivity, but it works :)</li>
    <li> I bought these for my fiance and I for an upcoming photo shoot. We shared the package because to get the effects you really only need one application. Do all 7 yourself for the full effect. We each did 2 before the event and our teeth were significantly whiter. We had adverse reactions. My fiance had no issues at all, but my teeth became extremely sensitive. I had to take pain medication and switch to sensitive toothpaste for 2-3 days following the treatment. It was awful, but I&#x27;ll still probably use them again before the wedding.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed that my teeth got any whiter, besides they became more transparent kind. Lots of pain when simply breathing  after I removed it and now have to restore my enamel cause its damaged and got very sensitive. I used Crest whitening stripes before and was always happy with the result, but this is something I can&#x27;t even do anymore because of the pain it causes afterwords. Sleepless night for me it is!</li>
    <li> THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES MY SITUATION ONLY AND IT IS NOT GENERAL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this thing in a hope to get a better smile, I really get annoyed of my yellow teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I got the 5th level one, the one says intensive and professional effects.&lt;br /&gt;After long and hard 7 days of pain, there was barely a difference, nothing really changed.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m 100% certain that my teeth aren&#x27;t that yellow, I&#x27;ve seen much worse.&lt;br /&gt;Even though when I&#x27;ve visited the dentist he said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t recommend to get a 400$-600$ laser treatment, your teeth aren&#x27;t that bad and it&#x27;s not worth it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And now, I regret the 40$ I&#x27;ve spent on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Not much changed, after all this effort and pain.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product, it&#x27;s gonna be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I hope, and really hope, it&#x27;s only me who didn&#x27;t get a satisfaction result.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I need another box, just to see &#x27;some&#x27; result.&lt;br /&gt;And again, this is NOT a general situation, just a personal experience.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying this because pretty much all of the one-star reviews said it caused terrible tooth sensitivity ... Luckily for me I didn&#x27;t experience that problem, though I can see how it would cause sensitivity (it&#x27;s really strong stuff, you leave them on for 2 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the seal is very sealed, (lol, I don&#x27;t know a better word) the first 10 minutes or so you can taste the stuff--at least I did. It wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it wasn&#x27;t delightful either. I was able to drink while using the strips, which is good because I drink A LOT of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get the 5th star from me because it doesn&#x27;t cover all of your teeth. I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference, but for the price the strips should cover all of your teeth. Unless you smiles like a weird clown and show ALL of your teeth, it&#x27;s really not noticeable.</li>
    <li> I forgot my crest at d hotel holiday Inn &amp; housekeeper denied seeing it :( finderskeeper! Liar liar!!! so I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it is effective or not due to the amount of gum pain this causes. I can only get through two days of whitening and then I wind up with a day of Advil and Ambesol! I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wanted my teeth white or atleast a bit whiter. Did absolutely nothing waste of my money. Want a refund like they said or atleast another boss to try it again but this was a terrible experience</li>
    <li> What can be said about this product. This product sells itself. A little too strong on your gums though. ITs good</li>
    <li> Well, after three treatments people can notice my teeth look whiter and brighter, but It&#x27;s been a week now since I&#x27;ve used them. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of sharp pains and have had to take the bottoms off early because those are always the most painful. I&#x27;ve been gathering courage to start them up again. I use them at night so I can fall asleep before the pain sets in, but for the whole next day my bottom teeth are painfully sensitive and throbbing all day. It&#x27;s hard to eat and makes my mouth water all day long. They&#x27;re working so far, but like I said - they&#x27;re painful, for me at least.</li>
    <li> it is true is is working well buuuuttt it made my teeth hurt like a ... . I have sensitive teeth i admit it and i shouldnt have done it in the first place but i am always like what da just do it.&lt;br /&gt;to be honest since i love white teeth i would do it again and i will in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just know your limits. If you have a low pain limit just dont take the harsh ones.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time fan of the Crest Strips since their inception.  With this particular box, the lower strips have not been staying on properly.  I haven&#x27;t experienced this problem before, except occasionally with the old models, which did not have the same staying power to begin with.  Have a slight increase with sensitivity, as I have had prior, but nothing shocking.</li>
    <li> These work well and they&#x27;re a good value for the price. However, for a few days after use, I had sharp, shocking pains in my teeth that lasted a few seconds each. This happened maybe half a dozen times in the 2 or 3 days following use. My dentist said it was normal - these heighten sensitivity since they are so concentrated. Be prepared for that!</li>
    <li> These seemed to work but watch out the make your teeth so sensitive I had to use them every 3 days. Wouldn&#x27;t use again though.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much I can add to the reviewers that have come before aside from my personal experiences... In terms of the Crest3D whitening strips I found that they did, in fact, whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were an off white color (as embarrassing as it is to admit) and because of this product they are now a few shades whiter. I&#x27;m hoping to get another package soon to see if it will whiten them further as they are not fully white yet but as the results of the first go were pretty positive I&#x27;m happy to know they most likely will work to further whiten. It&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re worried, like me, your teeth aren&#x27;t white enough.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a product that really works: Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects. Since the strips are easy to use, the customer compliance is good. They brighten teeth effectively without too much trouble. Coffee and tea drinkers can benefit from them.</li>
    <li> I reviewed a similar item a few years back when these whitening strips were more-or-less in their earlier years and I gotta admit, they did exactly what they sought out to do, which was whiten your teeth.  However, one night I accidentally left them on and, while removing them from my teeth, I accidentally tore off the protective emzymes off my teeth and I had a nasty tooth ache for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new \\&quot;Intensive Professional Effects\\&quot; is even more potent than the stuff I used.  I used it for three days and, due to prior dental work, had to stop using them because, one night, I accidentally left them on while playing Skyrim (it&#x27;s addicting to say the least).  An hour or two later I removed the strips and felt the most horrific tooth ache since I had my braces tightened in high school.  Out came the applesauce and the dread of ever utilizing the strips again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that the product does not work, it certainly does, but one has to be really careful when using them.  I highly recommend you use a timer to bleep loudly like a fog horn so you won&#x27;t be distracted by the awesomeness that is Skyrim or any other heavy distraction less you take an arrow to the knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Crest definitely wants their consumers to know that their products, in any way, are not to be used as a substitute for regular dental work and I have to agree as no strips can beat the total care of having an almost total stranger probing a part of you that you cannot see with a metal hook.  Cynical, but it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price so long as you follow the instructions and do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-they adhere snugly to your teeth which allows you to talk while they&#x27;re on&lt;br /&gt;-they are visible from up close, but not too bad&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x27;t make my gums burn like some of the other white strips products have.&lt;br /&gt;-when you remove them there isn&#x27;t a lot of slimy residue left on your teeth like other white strips products have.&lt;br /&gt;-they are notched so they wrap evenly over your teeth.  Other types don&#x27;t have the notches so towards the back of your mouth the strips go off the side of your teeth uncomfortably.&lt;br /&gt;-they do whiten your teeth noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-My teeth sometimes get a little sensitive after using them&lt;br /&gt;-Have to leave on for two hours.  No eating or drinking during this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are a good, reliable choice for safely and inexpensively whitening your teeth.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, these are much better than the standard white strips (which I have used several times). The old/standard whitening strips never stuck to my teeth properly and with a little saliva, were off my teeth in no time. These new 3D strips are a vast improvement over the older ones and do stay on my teeth longer (they actually seem to grip the teeth). The whitening was good as well, but certainly not like a professional whitening at a dentist office. The price of these is higher than the older ones ($40 vs $20s), but $100s of dollars less an alternative dental visit. So better, might be good in a quick fix, but not optimal.</li>
    <li> I love the 3D white Intensive Professional Effects.&lt;br /&gt;It whitens your teeth and stays in place. I can even talk, so much better than the olders ones&lt;br /&gt;I have purchessed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about every Crest Whitestrips product made.  I will summarize by saying that I ONLY use the ones with Advanced Seal.  The other ones are just too much of a goopy mess and slide around or get stuck to itself or lift with saliva, etc., etc.  My favorite to date, by far, is the Professional Effects which you get 20 sets of strips for about the same price as this product here (INTENSIVE Professional Effects) where you only get 7 sets of strips.  The other main difference is that you wear the regular Professional Effects for only 1/2 hour, but you wear these Intensive Professional Effects for 2 hours.  Note the information on the Amazon website is wrong.  It is not 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, I don&#x27;t think there is really much of a difference in results between the two products.  For the same price, IMO, you are just getting 1/3 of the products.  Also, wearing these for 2 hours is a long time.  Despite their claim that you can drink water while wearing them, I don&#x27;t like to, and blocking out 2 hours without drinking or having to be on the phone with a whitestrips-in-your-mouth lisp is hard to do.  I would rather stick with the regular Professional Effects and get 3X as many strips and only have 1/2 hour treatments yet over more days.  Do yourself a favor and be sure to skip the bargain non-Advanced Seal ones as well as the 5-minute quickie touch-up ones as well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  Excellent whitening!  Teeth very sensitive for about 2 weeks, but they did recover. Strips cling to teeth and are much heavier than the earlier strips.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that this product works. I noticed after the first use that my teeth were whiter. Of course, my teeth aren&#x27;t really stained horribly either, but I could still see improvement. On the first use, I experienced a little bit of lower teeth sensitivity, but it faded within a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it got worse. Last night I used the fourth in the package (I was using them every other day instead of every day because of the teeth sensitivity) and the effects of the sensitivity for my lower teeth has YET to wear off. I took the strips off nearly 12 hours ago and my bottom row still hurts. I can&#x27;t even speak because the feeling of air rolling over my teeth makes it hurt even worse. It should be noted that I have NEVER really had issues with tooth sensitivity before (I say \\&quot;really\\&quot; because if I&#x27;m eating ice cream and I try to use my front teeth it stings a bit, but that&#x27;s it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use whitening strips once a year. Last year I used Crest as well, but it was a lower grade on the intensity level and I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all. Of course, I didn&#x27;t see such great results either. There WERE results, mind, just not as...well...\\&quot;intense\\&quot; as these Intensive Professional Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the product works, but you might have some pain WHILE it works. Then again, Beauty Is Pain.</li>
    <li> Fastest most effective whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> these work well as long as you continue to use them straight through. You will probably need to use them several times to get a really white smile.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Didn&#x27;t change the color of my teeth at all.</li>
    <li> These doesn&#x27;t work and makes your teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> I already have pretty clean teeth, I was just looking for something to really make them stand out and look white. I followed the directions just as the box says, but I never saw an improvement. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shipping or the packaging.</li>
    <li> These white strips do a great job! I have been using them for years but this is the latest type. You must leave them on your teeth for 2 hours for 7 consecutive days. I use them once or twice a year and always get compliments on how white my teeth are. . .even from my dentist and hygienist! I will continue using this great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use but didn&#x27;t see any difference after using as directed. Would have preferred a noticeable change in teeth colour.</li>
    <li> Each package contains 7 whitening treatments with 1 upper and 1 lower strip per envelope. The upper and lower strips are clearly illustrated on the back of each individual envelope with instructions of how to use.  Each strip is very sturdy and easy to adhere to your upper and lower teeth.  Crest recommends the user to wear the strips for 2 hours each day for 7 consecutive days in order to get intensive professional effects.  They also provided options for a 30 minute use to expect vivid, advanced vivid and/or professional effects or for 5 minute use for gentle routine and stain shield. I found it extremely easy to use and used them each night when I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be eating or drinking.  There is a faint toothpaste taste during use but nothing strong or irritating.  I found that once I applied the strips to my teeth that the strips didn&#x27;t move.  Once I wore the strips for the recommended time I easily removed the strips and discarded. There is a gummy film upon removing the strips so I ended up rinsing my mouth and teeth to remove the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users noted teeth sensitivity but I lucked out and didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity. I noticed my teeth becoming whiter by day 3 and by day 7 I found a brighter smile.  Nothing as vivid or bright white as on television but I didn&#x27;t expect results like that after 7 days.  The bonus to the brighter/whiter teeth is $9.75 in coupons for Crest products including a $7 coupon for another box of Crest 3D White Whitestrips Intensive Professional Effects.  I would definitely recommend and consider future purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> I finish the entire box and you will really see the difference before and after. It really whitens my teeth. Will continue buying this product in the future..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on Day 3. I&#x27;m wearing them right now. I can see results already (I think), probably better than any other whitening product I&#x27;ve used, although I&#x27;ve never had it professionally done by a dentist. So I guess this is as good as you&#x27;re going to get without the dentist visit.  My big gripe, and why I&#x27;m writing this review now and not after Day 7, is the pain these strips create. I don&#x27;t typically suffer from tooth sensitivity, but my teeth have felt an unusual ache ever since I started wearing them, even hours after taking them off.  The strips are indeed more adhesive than similar products too. It feels like you&#x27;re wrapping a piece of tape around your teeth rather than just some slimy flimsy piece of film. I&#x27;m used to feeling the product seep out into my mouth but with these, it&#x27;s extremely minimal (which I guess is good given that you have to wear them for 2 hours at a time).</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item and it has always met expectations.  Will do it again without question.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the sensitivity so I figured I would by Sensodyne so my teeth didn&#x27;t get sensitive, I brushed my teeth everyday with it for more than a week. Also, just before applying the strips I put on Oragel in my gums so I wouldn&#x27;t feel anything. I applied the strips and everything fealt fine I took them off 8 mintues before I had to. Just to be on the safe side I took two pain pills. Not even 20 after removing the strips my teeth starting hurting. The same night I woke up from the pain and could not sleep for more than 5 hours. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> Just as the title says - wish these strips worked faster.  I like the 30min ones, also by Crest and had great results.  I did this system for a week and I really liked the white teeth, but really disliked that I had to do it for 2 hours at a time.  I&#x27;d suggest instead getting the 30min one: [[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Whitestrips, 14 Pouches Containing Upper/Lower Strips (28 Total Strips)]]</li>
    <li> I have professional in-the-dentists-office whitening done, and this product comes very close to delivering the same results. It&#x27;s only drawback is that it takes much longer--a week as opposed to sitting in a chair for an hour or so--but then it&#x27;s also much more reasonable than what you&#x27;d pay for a pro whitening. Excellent product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These strips worked fairly well.  Just for kicks I set up a camera and took a picture of my teeth before I started using them (control) and then after each use, trying to keep the lighting as consistent as possible.  After about 3 days I saw some whitening/brightinging of the teeth.  The strips stay one well and the whole proces is pretty simple.  I did not notice any of the sensitivity issues some other have reported, and my only problem with the product is the 2 hours you have to set aside to use the strip.  Still the pay-off for the time investment is whiter teeth without needing a trip to the dentist, so for me at least, that was a worthy use of the time.</li>
    <li> I have custom bleach trays and use them from time to time with carbamide peroxide but haven&#x27;t done that in at least two years. So my teeth were in need of whitening when I used these Crest 3D Intensive strips. I was surprised at how effective these white strips were. I used all 7 sets within 9 days and saw a significant difference in the brightness of my teeth. My teeth didn&#x27;t look like a movie star&#x27;s afterwards, and I didn&#x27;t expect that. But they looked at least a good 3-4 shades brighter.   They stick extremely well -- in fact, you need to peel them off with a little force after the bleaching session is over. I did have some sensitivity in my teeth after the sessions, and especially by the time I finished the 7th set, but it was minimal, did not interfere with normal eating, and went away totally within a few days.  These are immensely better than the whitening strips I tried maybe 8-9 years ago. Those didn&#x27;t stay on very well, and the results were just OK. Perhaps strips in general have improved since then.  I don&#x27;t know. But these at least do a very good job and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different tooth whitening products over the years, ranging from tray systems with whitening gels to most of the variations of Crest Whitestrips. So far, this has been my favorite whitening product. While I&#x27;ve had good results from the gels/trays, I&#x27;ve never found them convenient or comfortable to use. With other Crest Whitestrips, I&#x27;ve also had pretty good results, but I&#x27;ve dislike the number of consecutive days that you had to use them (I don&#x27;t recall exactly now, but I think I did one box that was for 14 days and another that was for 20 days). While it&#x27;s true that you have to use these for 2 hours a day as opposed to only 30 minutes a day for the other Whitestrip variations, I actually preferred it this way. I never mind keeping the Whitestrips on for 2 hours...my problem is always remembering to use them every day. So only having to use them for 7 consecutive days is better for me than having to remember about them for two to three weeks straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a fair warning though, 2 hours a day may be an issue for those with sensitive teeth. I do not usually have sensitive teeth, but I was feeling quite a bit of sensitivity for the week that I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my whitening results with this product, I was pretty pleased with how well it worked, but I feel like it could still be a little better. My teeth actually were noticeably whiter after the first day, but then I felt like it hit a plateau after day four. After that day, I could not see any more improvements, yet I feel that my teeth could still be a little bit whiter (and have been in the past from other products). Overall though, this version of the Whitestrips did make my teeth a lot whiter and the convenience compared to the gels/trays and longer regiment Whitestrips make this a great product for me. I think in the future though, I may just use these for four days straight, and then use the remaining three strips once a month for touch-ups as my teeth start to yellow again.</li>
    <li> So I bought these, I used all 7 top and bottom strips as it was directed in the instructions, I did feel my teeth get very sensitive and at times it did hurt but nothing that anyone wanting whiter teeth can bear. So after the 7 days, no joke but my teeth were pearl white, and it was very noticeable, all my family and friends would compliment my teeth BUT 3 days later I noticed my teeth were back to the regular color, not so white, not that my teeth were yellow or even close, they were just not white anymore, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars...... Works but then it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. It comes with 7 upper and 7 lower strips that you wear at the same time for two hours a day for seven days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my fifth day and my teeth are considerably whiter. I was concerned about the claims of the strips causing tooth sensitivity but I barely felt any. One night the one tooth I had a root canal on hurt for an hour or two and that was it. This tooth hurts if I eat on it anyway because the tooth is cracked and the root canal didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good product if you don&#x27;t want to spend $500 dollars to get your teeth bleached.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;d like to point out I am reviewing Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects. This product was released by Crest on December 26, 2011. Amazon started shipping the product on December 28, 2011. I say this because the reviews for this product cannot be \\&quot;true.\\&quot; I mean the product was not available for sale to the public during any of the dates of the reviews you see on Amazon under this product prior to mine (older than mine).  I pre-ordered mine from Amazon and it arrived December 30, 2011. I have used the product twice now. I wanted to write my review early because of what I shared in my first paragraph and to discuss a painful side affect I experienced last night. I got a pretty painful sore throat. It still hurts 24 hrs later! Nothing is killing the pain for me. I see nothing on Crest&#x27;s website about this side affect nor do I see anything with the product about it. I read online, and if what I saw was true the peroxide in the strips has caused my pain. Yes, I followed the instructions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot; on the first application. I drank nothing during the two hours. I did my second treatment today, and I took sips of water several times during the process and lightly brushed my teeth with water after the treatment. It is too early for me to say if this will resolve my side affect, but I thought I&#x27;d share this in case it helps others. I found Crest&#x27;s website contained use information I thought should be included with the product, e.g. drinking during treatment, brushing teeth after treatment, etc. I highly recommend reading their site information for this reason.  Now I have never had my teeth bleached at the dentist or used an OTC bleaching product before, but I discovered when I used this product for the first time yesterday that it does not treat all of your teeth nor does it treat all sides of your teeth. I am very, very disappointed in this. I feel misled by the packaging. The packaging states like the dentist. I thought dentists bleached all teeth and surfaces. Anyway, just thought some of you might want to know this in making your purchasing decision.  I will update this post as I progress though treatment (I think I can edit my post. I hope so.)</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. My teeth are considerably whiter and I have 3 more treetments to go. I was hesitant about purchasing it at Target and Walgreens because of the cost, but the price online was a perfect price point for me. I would buy these again, if needed. Lastly, I was hesitant to try it because of  the postings about sensitive teeth, however I had minimal sensitivity.  Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Crest&#x27;s Whitestrips and these are no exception! Having used the ones you leave on for twenty minutes in the past I was worried that these wouldn&#x27;t stay on my teeth for a whole two hours but they have a different solution inside of them that prohibits them from moving around as much as the old style.  Two hours is a little long for me but with the results you get after one use it was easy to motivate myself to leave them on for the whole two hours.  Somewhere I read that you can leave your house with these on but that option didn&#x27;t seem like something I&#x27;d want to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive teeth and they did hurt a little bit more than they do when I used the normal gel-type Whitestrips that you leave on for 20 minutes.  They also hurt for longer.  My sister gets her teeth professionally whitened and she said that even the treatments the dentists give you leave your teeth sensitive afterward.  Beauty is pain I guess.  They fit in my mouth no problem and they worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Crest White Strips, but these R the best! After one use dramatic results. A little sensitive the next day but TOTALLY worth it.</li>
    <li> The white strips are definitely cheaper here than anywhere else (Walgreens, WalMart, Rite Aid, CVS). I have only whitened my teeth once, professional laser-whitening at the dentist, and have mild sensitivity. The white strips do make your teeth and gums quite sensitive, but as soon as it&#x27;s unbearable just take them off! Obviously it&#x27;s one of those things that is different for each individual. If you don&#x27;t have super sensitive teeth normally, definitely at least give these a try. They definitely work and help me maintain my pearly whites instead of doing the very expensive laser treatment every year. The results are visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major con that costs this product one less star is that they do tend to foam up from saliva penetrating after a while (even with the new and improved seal, its impossible to get a perfect fit to your teeth) and then you get this unpleasant baking soda taste in your mouth. It may be because I don&#x27;t have the standard large teeth, though.</li>
    <li> package damaged and too expensive for too little</li>
    <li> I think these 3D intensive whitestrips worked very well!&lt;br /&gt;I am a college student so I have been drinking coffee a lot lately. I was getting worried about the staining on my teeth so i decided to give this product a try. I was skeptical at first because i do have teeth sensitivity. I never used sensodyne as most people here have advised, I was just so eager to try the strips. I put my 1st one on while i was doing some homework at night and had no problems with sensitivity or anything. I was actually incredibly excited because my teeth looked considerably whiter after just the first use. The next day i couldn&#x27;t stop smiling because i couldn&#x27;t help how great my teeth looked. I am now on my last strip and i have to say that this product worked incredibly great. My teeth are so much whiter. I feel like they are celebrity status white! My family and friends have complimented me as well and i still haven&#x27;t shared my secret :) I would recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;TIP- apply on dry teeth! I felt that the strips worked better and sticked better when the teeth was dry. Where it is wet the strip will not stick or work as well. So try applying the bottom strip first before applying the top! :)</li>
    <li> First off, I wished the box had more strips. There are only 7, and I think that was not enough for me. I had little to no sensitivity while using them. They adhere to the teeth very nicely. They whitened my teeth significantly, but I still have more to do. I&#x27;d say it whitened my teeth to a level 4. Currently, I have been using Crest Supreme, which is significantly stronger and those have better results than these strips. If you don&#x27;t have very little to no sensitivity and mild yellow teeth, give these a try.</li>
    <li> love it... have a wonderful smile in just one week. Super effective, you should try these product.will recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I read quite a few reviews on this product and almost everyone complained of tooth sensitivity. I must admit I figured they all exaggerated. Nope. No, they did not. I have never had an issue with senstive teeth and after the first strip I felt like I had cavities in all of my front teeth. It was very, very uncomfortable. That said, it really DOES whiten. After the first 2 hour session I noticed a difference. I waited a day before using a second strip and this time I only left it on for one hour. That was this morning. So far no sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> Product is very good and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of doing all the days consecutive, I did two days in a row then did one every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is of course the most powerful out of all the crest white stripes.  I don&#x27;t have horribly yellow teeth, just the normal for an occasional coke drinker.  I buy these stripes every so often, but don&#x27;t use it 7 days in a row due to sensitivity.  It does a great job on whitening my teeth with just one use so I use one stripe every 1-2 months or when I feel like it is needed.</li>
    <li> I have used crest whitestrips in the past and have been pretty pleased with the results. When I heard about the new intensive strips I wanted to try them. *First of all, buy from amazon...they are way cheaper than at Target!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips made my teeth more sensitive than past strips, but it wasn&#x27;t bad. I just stayed away from cold drinks and I was fine. The 2 hour time is honestly nothing. I even wore mine out when running errands and went about my day...no big deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are pretty good..but I don&#x27;t think it really compares to what you&#x27;d see from a professional whitining treatment. But I guess you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll probably use the strips again in the future...I&#x27;m happy with the price and the results.</li>
    <li> This product is not something I will pursue, due to no apparent effect and an offensive taste.  This is disappointing, as Crest toothpaste variations are the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many teeth whitening products over the years and Crest Advanced Seal products are easily the best. They bind very well to the teeth and are easy to wear. You can even drink while wearing them! This is in contrast to the old style strips that are gummy and don&#x27;t make good contact (not as good results) or the big trays that make it hard to breath. Just having something on your teeth may irritate you at first, but give it some time and you&#x27;ll likely forget they are on. I&#x27;ve come close to going to work with them on multiple times! They are clear, but the whitening gel foams up, so they give your teeth a bright white funny look while they are on. Fine for around the house, working in the yard, etc., but not something people won&#x27;t notice.  The strips come in different strengths to allow people with sensitive teeth to use them. This \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; product is not for the faint of heart, but the pain and sensitivity is primarily bad around days 2-3 in my experience.  The more common strips require around 20 minute sessions with the strips, but these strips, which take only a week for a full treatment, require 2 hours!  Whereas I could easily find 20 minutes a day, namely during my commute, 2 hours was a challenge.  However, having a full teeth whitening in a week would be perfect for short notice.  For example, if you just found out about a reunion.  If you are not in a hurry, and particularly if you are afraid of the intense treatment, I suggest the 3D advanced white strips.  While the number of options from Crest is almost comical at this point, I think this is another good addition to the Advanced Seal line.</li>
    <li> Not the best strips they have ever produced.</li>
    <li> Having to keep these on your teeth for 2 hours a day for 7 days is pretty awful but your teeth will be 2 or 3 shades whiter. I did have some issues with sensitivity but after getting sensodine the problem will be fixed. I will use again in 6 months</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product, and it works far better than I had expected.  I am happy with the outcome. Extremely amazed that this product can do the same job as the laser whitening method.  I will continue to keep this product on hand, for as long as it is around.</li>
    <li> Simply the best is the ONLY way to classify these whitestrips.  They provide noticeable whitening after only 1 treatment with full effects after the entire series of 7 is completed.  These whitestrips are far better at not slipping than previous ones.  A lot of these reviews say wearing them for two hours is annoying, but for me the amazing whiteness they provide makes the time worth it.  Amazon had the best price on these, almost $20 less than my local retailers - definitely money well spent.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its worth the pain for people with already sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Teeth it will be BAD! Try at your own risk!</li>
    <li> I got my teeth bleached at a dentist and the assistant told me the 2 hr express versions works just as well. It did. Plus, at the price, I can get three treatments instead of one at the dentist. After doing this every couple of months for the last 2 years my teeth are a lot whiter. I get compliments all the time and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried the 30 min strips before and although the results took time to show, they were ok and only made my teeth slightly sensitive but with these ones... great results, fast but it hurts like hell... I would not recommend this version to people with sensitive teeth as I cannot even sleep at night..:-(... and it&#x27;s mainly painful on my lower teeth, so next time I will use the suggestion another reviewer made and cut the strip so it doesn&#x27;t fold over my teeth and use a mouthwash for sensitivity as well,  perhaps it will help. I recommend them, they do a great job but again, mind the sensitivity. For me, it makes me pull out every single one of my lower teeth... although that would not be very beneficial..:-)... Crest does warn about the side effects, to be fair!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any results. This product hurts my teeth after about 30 minutes. The pain feels like an intense tooth ache across the front of all my teeth</li>
    <li> I have quite white teeth by myself. Never ever whitening them before. But years drinking tea and coffee they aren&#x60;t so shiny anymore. I really wanted try this product and because good reviews I decided try. Here in Finland whitening at the dentist cost about 300 and I think that is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strips remain very well on teeth and they are very easy to put on. I keep them 1 hour 7 days. First couple days my teeth ached, not sensitive. I had to take one painkiller both days. On the third day the symptoms disappeared completely and after that everything went smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say my teeth are definitely whiter now. I highly recommend the product!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about these white strips for a couple reasons. First, I had already tried the regular white strips. You know the one&#x27;s that came out like 10 years ago? Yea, those. And they didn&#x27;t work. Another reason was because of all the reviews about how they are extremely painful for sensitive teeth, which I have. These strips are awesome, though. They definitely whiten teeth and they have a great adhesive, so they don&#x27;t slip and slide like the old ones. And I would highly recommend not just blowing these off b/c everyone says they hurt sensitive teeth. Mine are very sensitive, and while there is SLIGHT pain, and I mean slight, it&#x27;s totally tolerable and barely noticeable. I wouldn&#x27;t promise they won&#x27;t be painful, but they MAY not be, even with normally sensitive teeth. I mean, they&#x27;re a great price compared to professional whitening, so you really don&#x27;t have a lot to lose. The only problem is they are very noticeable, but if you can find 2 hours to yourself once a day for a week, I would highly recommend these strips.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any whitening strips of any kind. I used these Crest stripes for a week and by the end of the week, there was a definite change in the whiteness of my teeth. And they weren&#x27;t kidding when the box says that you&#x27;ll notice a change after the first use. One of the reasons I&#x27;ve been hesitant to use the white strips is that some people that use them have that freaky unnatural whiteness to their teeth but I didn&#x27;t notice that effect on my teeth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are quite easy to put on and they stayed on without moving the whole two hours. I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitivity on my gums or teeth during or after the strips but it is possible to have that happen. Just make sure not to drink or eat anything while you have the strips on. Also if you have fillings on the teeth that you are using the strips on, it&#x27;s not recommended that you use the strips. But other than that, I would have no problem recommended these strips to anyone looking to do a home whitening.</li>
    <li> Crest&#x27;s whitening strips work really well (and were actually recommended by my dentist), especially in comparison to some of the other whitening products out there.  I&#x27;ve experienced some minor tooth sensitivity when using them, but that goes away quickly.  These also leave a bit of gummy residue when removed, but that&#x27;s easily remedied by rinsing with water.  My reason for giving this version of the white strips 4/5 is that two hours is simply not convenient.  No food (only water) can be consumed while wearing them; additionally, the strips aren&#x27;t exactly attractive, so it&#x27;s something I want to do at home which limits how frequently I can use them.  The version that takes half an hour is a better fit for my lifestyle as I can put them on right before leaving for work and remove before walking into the building.  I&#x27;d recommend the two hour strips only for those who either have the time or need their teeth whitened in a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only  used the strips twice because of the extreme sensitivity you feel after the second time.  The first time, wasn&#x27;t too bad.  There was a bit of discomfort but definitely not a big deal.  Then the second time, my teeth hurt for almost two days.  It was not fun.  I plan on using the rest once every two weeks or so.  All that being said- the results were there!  My teeth were noticeably whiter!</li>
    <li> If your teeth are sensitive or you have any dental issues this product may irritate it so maybe just test it out by leaving the first stip on for a shorter time period then what is recommended.  My teeth didn&#x27;t get sensitive until after the 3rd day of using them so then I skipped a day and then left them on for a shorter time and that seemed to help.  I thought they did just as good of job as when I had my teeth professionally whitened and this was alot less expensive so I was satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I loved these whitening stripes compared to the others that take much longer.  But by the fifth day my teeth were getting a little sensitive!  but by that time my teeth were white enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitestrips before and purchased these knowing that they&#x27;d be painful, but WOW... Maybe it&#x27;s because you wear these for 2 hours instead of 30 mins? Usually the pain from the 30 min. strips is manageable and I recover within a couple of hours. But when I used these I couldn&#x27;t even finish the 2 hours because of the pain. I took ibuprofen, aspirin AND naproxen and yet continuously felt the pain from 2PM (when I took them off) until I went to bed at night (around midnight!). I couldn&#x27;t eat/drink hot or cold foods because of the sensitivity...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product is great (I&#x27;ve always had great success with Crest brand whitestrips), but be warned of the pain! Another reviewer mentioned that using Thera Dent oral mouthwash helped her with the pain, so I&#x27;ll have to try that. But until then, I&#x27;m too scared to continue using these!</li>
    <li> Works really well!!  People always comment on how white my teeth are.  This is the only thing I use to get them this white.</li>
    <li> So I appreciate what Crest is doing and I am crazy about whitening my teeth but the PAIN was too much. I used to think I have high pain tolerance but I guess not for tooth ache. I used the strips once and may have left them in about 15-20 minutes longer than recommended but the pain from sensitivity lasted for about 3-4 days. It wasn&#x27;t even when I was drinking hot or cold drinks but in general, all day long, I had this ache and I just lost interest in trying them again. Maybe I will go shorter bursts. I had to use my electronic tooth brush to get all the gooey pieces off. To be honest, I could not tell any difference after one use. SO maybe you have to go through the whole thing if you can stand the pain! I will add that they stick to your teeth like glue and it was serious work taking it off.</li>
    <li> works really well my teeth were glowing the next day. I would invest my money in this product, I think you should to.</li>
    <li> I started the first treatment today and have been in throbbing pain for 12 hours...I cannot eat, drink, or talk without seething pain. There definitely is a difference-my teeth are whiter and brighter-but for me it is not worth it and I will not be finishing the treatment. I do not have a history of sensitive teeth. I would suggest trying the treatment for only a hour to start to see how your teeth react before committing to the 2 hour treatment.</li>
    <li> got this for my husband and he refused to use it after 2 strips. he said his teeth have gotten so sensitive and bothersome that he lost sleep the night of the treatment. I read reviews and it seems to happen to many other people too. Maybe bc of an incomplete treatment, i do not notice any improvement in whitening. Hate to waste it as it is not an inexpensive product...</li>
    <li> I was always skeptical about the Crest 3D whitening strips, so I decided to buy them to see for myself the &#x27;wonderful&#x27; results that many people brag about. I followed the directions on the box- use once a day for 2 hours for 7 days- and I did notice some results but they were not dramatic. I will admit that they did cleanse my teeth but I still have some yellowing. Needless to say, I was disappointed because these strips are the most powerful formula that Crest sells, and the whitening did not satisfy me. I am glad that I found this online for a much lower price because if I would have bought them at the store, I would have been extremely disappointed for the expensive price of $50+ dollars. I give it a 3/5 for the cleansing.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest White strips in the past but this was my first time with the Intensive 2 hrs strips. First let me say, P &amp; G (the Manuf) always develops create innovative product lines. These strips really do work! And they provide great results in a short amount of time for sure, however, the PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;If you have somewhat sensitive teeth, DO NOT Buy these! I did not even think my teeth were so sensitive but I have proven wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second whitening treatment over the course of one week. Schedule looked like this:&lt;br /&gt;Monday 3/12 Purchased them and did had them on for 1.5 hrs in evening&lt;br /&gt;Woke up @ 4am with throbbing tooth pain-almost cried from pain for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Tues 3/13 Pain lasted all day until about 8pm (terrible, terrible pain)&lt;br /&gt;Used Sensodyne week prior to 1st treatment and used for week after twice day&lt;br /&gt;Sunday 3/18 2nd Treatment-1 hr in evening&lt;br /&gt;Work up @ 5am with throbbing tooth pain&lt;br /&gt;Today, 3/19 have had unexplainable terrible terrble pain. Have taken 6 advils since 7:30am (3 hrs) and hasn&#x27;t even touched it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I may have paid $60.00 for 7 treatments but the money is not worth this much pain. I will stop using them. Thought decreaisng it from 1.5 hrs to 1 hour would help but has not. Needless to say my teeth look whiter but can not tolerate the pain.</li>
    <li> Definitely do see results, sometimes I couldn&#x27;t tell but my friends definitely did point it out.&lt;br /&gt;Does make teeth sensitive, also becomes sensitive to temperature. And waiting for 2 hours can be a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that works just PERFECT :O)</li>
    <li> Okay so just to give you an idea of where this review is going...never have I reviewed a product on Amazon before and never have I had sensitive teeth before. After noticing whiter smiles on two of my friends and having them separately recommend Crest Professional Effects, I though I&#x27;d give it a go. I&#x27;ve whitened my teeth before with crest strips back a few years ago and never really noticed that much of a difference but never experienced any side effects either. I&#x27;m a pretty impatient person, especially when it comes to seeing results so the two hour intensive strips appealed to me. I read how other reviewers mentioned these cause tooth pain and not to use them if you have sensitive teeth. Me, not even knowing what tooth pain or sensitivity feels like, thought I could handle anything and naively ordered the strips. Well right when they came I put a pair on and wore them for the whole two hours. Everything seemed fine and I went to bed a few hours later. Then in the middle of the night, for the first time in my life, I actually was awoken by a horrible piercing pain in one of my canines. The pain was absolutely terrible but went away after a few seconds so I went back to sleep, oblivious that this was foreshadowing my next few days. When I woke up in the morning, every one of the teeth I whitened was aching. It wasn&#x27;t unbearable but definitely extremely uncomfortable. I noticed when I was walking down the street I couldn&#x27;t talk because that would mean opening my mouth and exposing my teeth to the cold air which sent aches throughout my whole body. The pain subsided by nighttime and I, stubbornly dismissing my discomfort from earlier, decided I REALLY wanted whiter teeth and put another set of strips on. Well. The next day I woke up very early in the morning with excruciating pain in all of my teeth. It was so bad I couldn&#x27;t go back to sleep. No matter what I did, the pain would not go away and it got to the point where I was holding back tears just going about my daily routine. You may think to yourself now what a wimp I am but I assure you I have a very high tolerance to pain and I&#x27;ve never experienced tooth sensitivity, even when whitening my teeth before. The pain got so bad that I googled remedies then drove down to the store and bought some Sensodyn. This helped a little bit but I had to keep applying it and I have a feeling that morning I ingested way more fluoride than the amount anybody should in a two hour period. The worst part was that I had a lot of work to do that morning but just could not for the life of me concentrate on anything; I actually felt like pulling my own teeth out I was in so much pain. Not only were my teeth aching, but any loud or sudden sound gave me the feeling of nails on a chalkboard; it was very weird and unpleasant. This pain lasted into the night and I made a promise to myself I would never use the strips again. Stupid me though a week later thought to myself \\&quot;well it was probably just the result of using the strips twice in a row\\&quot; and I applied them again! As expected, the next morning I awoke in unbearable pain and went through exactly what I experienced the week before. On another note, my teeth are a little whiter from using the strips three times. DEFINITELY not worth the pain though. And I&#x27;m willing to go through a lot in the name of beauty. Next time I&#x27;m going to try the regular 30 minute professional effects crest white strips and hope for the best. You should too, if they work, its by far worth avoiding the pain for an extra week or so of whitening.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth turning slightly yellow and had tried white strips when they first came out and liked the results. I got a good deal on these that were on sale and with the first use almost all the yellowing is gone. So far no pain in my teeth but I&#x27;m expecting some after the next few applications. The advanced seal stuck perfectly and I could tell how strong the bond was when I removed the strips when I was finished. Overall very pleased to have spent money on a product with great results.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips are great. My husband had extremely yellow teeth due to coffee drinking. After one 7-day treatment his teeth are so white.  We will continue with treatments 2-3 times a year with this product.  Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> I got these to whiten my teeth up before my wedding. I also used a few of the other Crest whitening products and I&#x27;ve been very happy with all my results. My teeth did hurt periodically while I was using these, but within 24 hours after my last strip I was back to normal with noticeably whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The only frustration I had with these is that Amazon was running a coupon for $7 off and advertising the purchase price less the $7 and the $10 mail-in rebate. The Crest rebate DOES NOT apply if you receive any discount on the purchase price, so I was out the $10 rebate. Bummer about the rebate, but the strips still worked very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase this product again in the future.  It works better than anything else I tried.  I especially enjoyed the strips adhering to my teeth in such a way that I could talk and consume liquids after placing them.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit expensive but it works fairly quickly. I would buy it again and suggest it to friends.</li>
    <li> Im a total skeptic but decided to give it a try! I am so glad I did! Ive tried other whiteners in the past and none of them worked!&lt;br /&gt;So was amazed at the instant change to my teeth! I did go through the pain of sensitivity, so be aware of that(and I have a high pain tolerance)if you decide to the 7 day whitener! I also followed up my whitener by getting the toothpaste and I LOVE my new smile! Wud defo recommend this!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and I figured I would give these crest strips a shot. You might be thinking that $40 is expensive for a 7 day thing however, it will be a well $40 spent. My sister noticed my teeth were very white after using them for only 5 days! I told her I was using them and I still had 2 more days to go! I was very pleased with this product as most products you tend to buy never really work or do the job it says. This my friend really works! You leave them on for 2 hours a day which seems like it&#x27;s a long time, but I can tell you time flies by when you keep busy. They stick on very tight, which you will notice when you try and peel them off. The do become sensitive i would say around the 5th day, at least for me, but I went through some of the pain because i noticed how nice and white they were becoming. The only down fall is once you are done they might not stay as white as when you are using them. I went to buy another pack at walmart $60!!!!! NO WAY. I ordered a new pack from here and will be using them soon. I would wait at least 3 weeks before using them again as the sensitivity can be too much after 7 days. Overall, def happy with this product.</li>
    <li> These strips claim they whiten as well as a professional treatment, but I don&#x27;t buy it. They did not work for me; my teeth were only the tiniest bit whiter after using all the strips, and I&#x27;m not sure if they were actually whiter or I was just telling myself that so I wouldn&#x27;t feel like I had wasted my money.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Yeah, you have to leave them on for 2 hours but there are only 7 treatments so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal to find time to do it. I&#x27;ve only used 5 of the 7 strips and I am very happy with the color so I&#x27;m going to let my husband use the other 2. My teeth were VERY sensitive after the first couple times I used them, that was super unpleasant. But it went away after a day.</li>
    <li> This product works, but I suggest you don&#x27;t buy it if you have a gag reflex. I can&#x27;t use both upper and lower strips at once, it makes me gag and I have to take them off after max 5 minutes. No way I can get anywhere near 2 hours. I&#x27;m currently trying to use one at a time, but that means I need to take 4 hours out of my day to whiten my teeth. It&#x27;s a good thing I&#x27;m a student with a lot of papers and study time for finals. If it wasn&#x27;t for that, I wouldn&#x27;t use them at all. I spent money on this product and I will find a way to make it work, but I strongly advice getting the strips that take less than 2 hours. Who cares if it takes more than 1 week? You&#x27;re teeth aren&#x27;t getting any whiter right now without ANY products, are they? I suggest taking your time.</li>
    <li> I am so proud that I ordered these Whitestrips. I did experience tooth sensitivity, however, I took some advice and used the Crest children&#x27;s mint flavored flouride mouthwash twice a day and it has worked wonders!!  Needless to say, my teeth are at their whitest after only three days of using these strips.  They bond so well with the teeth that you don&#x27;t even know you have them on.  Even though I have achieved the whiteness I want, I am going to finish up the next four days and start the process over in six months.  I would recommend Crest Whitestrips to anyone!!</li>
    <li> very good ítem. Leaves my teeth whiter without cause sensitivity</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous whitening products over the past few years, not wanting to spend $300+ at the dentist. What I&#x27;ve found is you may or may not get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a little bit expensive for me but so far my experience has been good. They aren&#x27;t trays but they&#x27;re also firmer than some of Crest&#x27;s other whitening strips (or at least they&#x27;re firmer than the ones I tried a couple years ago). I like this because they actually stay in place even if I move my mouth or try to talk - this is important because you have to wear them for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I liked them, of course, is because they&#x27;ve actually worked for me. For whatever reason I&#x27;ve never had the greatest results with other whitening strips, or maybe was expecting too much. My teeth aren&#x27;t badly stained but they could use some whitening, so it&#x27;s disappointing to get mediocre results. The 3D White Intensive strips have had noticeable results in four days, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, some friendly advice to anyone interested in using these: get yourself some Orajel and/or sensitivity toothpaste. I&#x27;ve never experienced tooth sensitivity in general or with other whitening products but The 3D White Intensive trips have given me pretty intense tooth sensitivity. If you have issues with sensitivity in general, you may want to steer clear from these. If you don&#x27;t, you might want to use them every other day after the second day or so (the second or third day was when I started having sensitivity issues to the point where I decided I needed to give my teeth a temporary break). Even though I&#x27;m using them every other day, I&#x27;ve still noticed positive results.</li>
    <li> I have tried better effective whiteners and the after effect is quite uncomfortable. I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> These met my expectations, made my teeth white. Check. Easy, check. They stay on well. So easy it fell asleep wearing them</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and use fluoride rinses and/or teeth sensitive toothpaste (such as sensodyne) a good 3 weeks before using the strips.  Even at that I couldn&#x27;t use them on consecutive days. I had to skip 2-3 days between to tolerate them.  However, this is a great product for whitening even when you skip a couple of days between sessions!</li>
    <li> I really like these strips! But I had severe problems with sensitivity after the second day, so I had to stop for 2 or 3 days. I couldn&#x27;t do it in one week, actually I finished the treatment after 3 weeks. The good thing is that if you need a faster whitening treatment, these give you perfect results even after just two days.</li>
    <li> Worked really well, although, teeth were too sensitive for full result, I didn&#x27;t finish the box, good price though &amp; helped a lot</li>
    <li> I was pleased that these whitening strips came in so quickly! I started using the strips as soon I received them and saw results just after the first two applications. Be careful if you have sensitive teeth! I would recommend using them every couple days or even less often.</li>
    <li> I used the strips as directed and experienced such extreme pain that I had to take Tylenol to fall asleep at night. I never experienced any discomfort due to teeth sensitivity before in my life!</li>
    <li> These are fine - they do what they are supposed to. I was glad to get them at a reduced price.</li>
    <li> With the Crest 3d White Intensive Whitening Strips I did not experience very much tooth sensitivity. I&#x27;ve never used strips before this and they seem to have done a good job.</li>
    <li> I thought the crest white strips would work alot better but found out that the mouth wash and tooth paste worked better</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase b/c 1-they offered a rebate of $10 which they will not issue me b/c I used my $5 off CVS rewards at time of transaction. READ the fine print. I went thru completing the paper work, providing original receipt, cutting box for UPC. I called company and rep didn&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;2-I think the generics would just as well as these overpriced strips.3- I prefer the CVS paint on whitening that comes in a bottle with brush. I thought I would try these. They are messy and don&#x27;t whiten as well. WASTE of money!!</li>
    <li> I used these same Crest Whitestrips 6 months ago, and should have done a touch up with a strip each month as my teeth are almost the same yellow color before ever using this product. The whitening toothpastes did nothing to slow down the yellowing, just made my teeth more sensitive.</li>
    <li> It works whitening my teeth but my teeth felt really sensitive the day after using it. I saw immediate result after one usage so I am gonna spread out the application to ease the sensitivity issue.</li>
    <li> I bought these strips to brighten my smile for my wedding day. Thank goodness I tried them 2 weeks before my big day because they caused them to hurt so badly (after I used sensodine for 1 week before applying the white strips!) They also caused streaking which was highly noticeable! The streaking finally faded about a week later. My teeth were whiter, but with the streaking and sensitivity, I decided not to continue using them. I contacted Crest, and they refunded my purchase price. Great customer service at Crest! I have used strips before, but these particular ones must be super potent to cause such issues!</li>
    <li> I needed to brighten up my smile for a wedding in short order and these came in handy.  I applied them once a day every day and they made my teeth whiter, and didn&#x27;t leave me with the &amp;#34;fake white&amp;#34; look.  It&#x27;s been about 4 months now and the whitening is subsiding gradually and has lasted quite well, especially for the price.  The strips adhere securely to your teeth and form a strong bond to the front, and back.  It&#x27;s evident you have strips on, so I end up using them at night at home, but you can still have a conversation, without it interfering with your speech.  I have used other white strips in the past which have bothered my teeth and left me with occasional sharp pains, but these did not.  Next time I need to whiten in a hurry, I&#x27;ll grab these.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and paid the full amount. And when it arrived, I received a totaly different product which is cheaper than what I paid (Crest whitestrips 2 hour)  for. I am totaly disappointed. I will never order here again!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. For someone with chronically yellowish-white teeth, this cleared me up 3-4 shades. I&#x27;m not afraid to smile! About the sensitivity; yes, there is a little bit. But beauty hurts, people. For myself, it was the kind of sensitivity one might have immediately after biting into something soft and cold. Hold an ice cube against your bottom teeth for 25 seconds; that kind of sensitivity. Certainly not debilitating, like some of the reviews have stated. People need to suck it up; as if a dentist bleaching doesn&#x27;t cause a little pain either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, great product, used 7 days consecutively with no major problems, even letting it overlap on the gums to see what the pain fuss was about. On a scale of 1-10, maybe a 1-2 in pain, during and 30 minutes afterwards. That&#x27;s it. Though the survey of pain subjective, I think anyone who desperately wants whiter teeth will not mind in the slightest.</li>
    <li> Beautiful results from using these like others have experienced after using for 4 days I took a break and brushed with sensodyne like my dentist recommended to help with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! After one use I saw results. I love my smile :D this is making the world a brighter place</li>
    <li> This Product did not do what I expected. not Worth it in my opinion... six more Words six more words</li>
    <li> light good quality big box easy to use it i used it and my wife also  . love it because the size and efficiency</li>
    <li> Great product. Although I would suggest brushing with a sensitive toothpaste. Noticed a difference and it only took 7 days rather than 10</li>
    <li> These strips are honestly so intense in terms of both whitening and pain!  I don&#x27;t normally have very sensitive teeth but my teeth really hurt for a few days after using just 1 application.  That being said, I really feel like I only need 1 application every couple of months because the amount of whitening this does in a single 2 hour time frame is remarkable and very noticeable for me.  I&#x27;ve used dentist whitening products in the past, as well as the less powerful crest white strips, and although they work, nothing delivers whitening results like these in such a short amount of time!  I really can only handle doing it once in a while because of the sensitivity, but they really do get the job done if you&#x27;re after a whiter smile!</li>
    <li> The last time I tried white strips, the plastic was not as flexible nor as effective as these strips are.  Though the taste has not significantly improved, this is an effective way of keeping stains from coffee, wine or another sinful pleasure.  Though I do not endorse looking like the &#x27;vegas girl&#x27; in the commercial with neon white glow-in-the-dark teeth, it is equally obnoxious in our society to have brown stained teeth.  This is a very cost effective way of keeping your teeth looking nice all year long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, these don&#x27;t work as well as a dentist applied whitening treatment.  But they don&#x27;t cost hundreds of $$ either.  These are best used as maintenance between dental visits.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t whitened my teeth in about a year. I should say that when I do whiten them I don&#x27;t try to go for the Chiclets look. I like them to look a shade whiter without being blindingly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other Crest products and I do like the way they whitened my teeth in the past. I decided to try this \\&quot;intensive professional effects.\\&quot;  I noticed that it did not have the same \\&quot;taste\\&quot; as the other whitening products I have used in the past. I can&#x27;t describe what it used to taste like, but this time there was no aftertaste. So that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips adhered to my teeth well. It took a little tugging to get them off, but never for a moment did I think \\&quot;oh no I am stuck!\\&quot; They did not slip and slide around in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product says to use for two hours. Personally, I was worried what the effect would be so I only used them for an hour. As stated before I dont like the bright white look.  They worked well and I noticed my teeth were a bit brighter(which is fine for me).  Crest does say that you will notice some spots on your teeth because these are natural and are your teeth. I noticed them as well, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  Lets face it, as much as I want to believe I have perfect teeth, they are slightly flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pleased with the product. It did what it stated. It would brighten my teeth.  If I had used the strips as directed I am sure that my teeth would be brighter.  I will say that I feel no sensitivity with them either. Sometimes people experience that, but my teeth feel the same.</li>
    <li> Great 7 day teeth whitening system.  works well.  Easy to use, professional grade system.  Easy and not messy.  Leaves your teeth feeling clean and white.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw great results, especially after the first couple of strips. I definitely would recommend this product before spending $500 for professional teeth whitening.  I am now finishing my 7th strip and my teeth are noticebly whiter.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t whitened my teeth in about 5 years and so decided to give it a shot again. My teeth already are pretty healthy and white but wanted them even whiter :) The strips, unlike others stay pretty attached to the teeth. They will not move and you can drink water. I did wear them for 2 hrs a day for 7 days. I saw great results after the second day. The only drawback is after I finished wearing them, my teeth would be in so much pain. It was a very sharp pain on 2 of my teeth on the shop and one on the bottom. Happened a lot when my teeth would come in contact with the air. I havent felt pain like this in a long time. It would last for a good 30sec to a min. After the brutal 7 days, I am VERY satisfied. I would recommend just be aware of the pain factor.</li>
    <li> I used the longer (21-day) regimen a few years back and I believe that it worked better. My friends would comment on how white my teeth were. This time with the 7-day regimen, nobody noticed. :(</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were supposed to work much quicker than the other strips. I did see that they whitened my teeth a little bit, but they definitely did not have the \\&quot;intensive professional effects\\&quot; i thought they would. They work OK but are very expensive and not extremely effective so i probably would not buy them again. They also do cause sensitivity which would be expected since you have to leave them on your teeth for 2 hours.</li>
    <li> It does what it says great product better than spending $100 at the dentist! It does make your teeth a little sensitive but that feeling goes away in less than a week!</li>
    <li> These really do work very well. I went from slightly yellowish teeth to white with no yellow at all. Buy them here for the best price. Target sells these for sixty five dollars.&lt;br /&gt;They stick so well they can be slightly hard to remove and none of the gel seeps out so that you can even drink water with them on. Yes it&#x27;s two hours but I don&#x27;t find this a problem.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t terribly visible. I had used the regular Whitestrips a few years ago and they lightened about two shades but these lightened about four shades. I don&#x27;t want that blindingly white teeth look some people have that makes it hard for me to stop staring at their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;So these are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I avoided pain and sensitivity to these. I only wore them every two or three days. And I was meticulous about not letting them touch my gums at all.&lt;br /&gt;I never experienced a moment of pain or discomfort. And I left each one on for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure this would work for everyone but it worked for me. Make sure you don&#x27;t have any cavaties before you use these. I&#x27;m a little bit surprised by all the people talking about pain from these since I didn&#x27;t experience that so it&#x27;s an individual thing I guess but do try only using them every two or three days. For me it is a no brainer to use these instead of going the five hundred dollar dental office whitening route.</li>
    <li> Worked somewhat okay.I expected more given the claims.Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $500.00 for a professional to whiten my teeth.Plus, I got extreme sensitivity.Doubt I will use this again.Having said that,they might work better for someone else and the price was very good.</li>
    <li> I used this product for several days and I convinced myself it was working but the effects appeared to wear off within a day.  I have had professional whitening by my dentist in the past and feel that&#x27;s a much better option.  You can get your dentist to make you the trays and then buy the same gel he/she sells online for much less.  Long term I think that&#x27;s a cheaper option than buying these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has to be worn considerably longer than the trays I&#x27;ve used in the past and unless you have perfectly straight teeth, they may not conform properly to your teeth.</li>
    <li> I had no problem with sensitivity.  Noticeable improvement after 1st use and they stay put very well. I went to bed with them on and had no difficulty falling to sleep.  I love red wine but it did take a toll on my teeth; this product brightened them up.  I intend to use them 2x a year.  To me these strips are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This worked ok. It was certainly easy to use and seemed to whiten my teeth. It&#x27;s always hard to tell unless you choose to only do the top teeth or only do the bottom. Then you have a row of teeth to compare too.  I suspect you must keep using it to keep your teeth white and I would probably choose this over other products on the market.</li>
    <li> I noticed these were working from the first strip! My teeth were much whiter and I didn&#x27;t even use the last strip.. I also didn&#x27;t use every day and took a day off between mostly because it&#x27;s hard to find 2 hours a day to use them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do make your teeth sensitive but I took ibuprofen 30min before to reduce swelling and pain and brushed my teeth with sensodyne a few days before, during, and a week after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend especially for the price</li>
    <li> I ordered these intense professional strips that you are supposed to wear for 2 hrs as explained above but I didn&#x27;t receive them. They sent me 7 of some other cheaper version that you wear for1/2 hr. They also came loose in an envelope without any directions. I think the ones they sent me usually come in a box with more strips and are cheaper because they are not as intense. They probably split up the box into several pks of 7 and try to pass them off as the intense 2 hr versions and also charge the higher price! Don&#x27;t buy them</li>
    <li> let me start with saying my teeth aren&#x27;t yellow at all. I was expecting this product to brighten my smile up a little more. I don&#x27;t know if it was too old, but the ten dollar rebate promo on the box expired about 2 years ago. I have no idea if these kinds of things expire, but this was an old product. It didn&#x27;t really white my teeth, and I didn&#x27;t get any sensitivity either. So I don&#x27;t even know if it worked. I&#x27;ve used the lower-end crest whitestrips before and they worked great, so i was expecting this &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; version to be even more amazing. Next time, I&#x27;ll just buy whitestrips from the store.</li>
    <li> So unbelievably painful. I used it once today and it hurts like hell!!! I can&#x27;t even talk, breathe, smile, ..nothing. I&#x27;m g2 stop typing now bc I&#x27;m in sooo much pain. Avoid....</li>
    <li> I had used the 30 minute whitening strips before and I was satisfied and experienced very little sensitivity.  These do the whitening job very well I have used 4 and I am very happy with the whitening result. HOWEVER, after every use I have constant excruciating pain in my teeth. So much that it keeps me up at night and it lasts at least a day afterwards and no amount of orajel or sensitive toothpaste alleviates the pain. I probably won&#x27;t try these again even though they did the whitening job pretty well.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I started using a sensitive, whitening toothpaste about a week in advance of using the strips. It helped, but by the last strip my teeth were definitely sensitive. Thankfully, the sensitivity didn&#x27;t last. I was eventually able to use a regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight difference after the first strip was used. By the end, my teeth are noticeably whiter. Maybe the whitening toothpaste helped boost the effect too, because I noticed after I was done with all the strips that my teeth got even whiter after a while.</li>
    <li> I am on Day #3 of 7 and have had a great experience so far.  Not to discount others who may be having issues with sensitivity, but I have had none.  The strips stay on perfectly and do take a bit of work to get off at the end of the two hours.  My teeth are MUCH brighter than three days ago and I can only imagine that I will be even more pleased on Day 7.  I do go out in public with them on and do talk to people... it is just not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While others advise not to buy the strips, I think that it just depends on your own sensitivity and it is unfair to predetermine what others experience may be.  I can only say what my experience has been and it has been very much worth it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished up the 7 day program and could not be happier....product worked just as it said it would and I had no sensitivity issues at all.  I would highly recommend the product and as I said before.... each person will need to figure out if it will work for them, but no one, in my opinion, should tell someone else if they should purchase the product or not based upon their own teeth sensitivity !</li>
    <li> the trick to avoid the sensitivity (as well as multiply life of those strips) is NOT to fold them over the down edge of the teeth. I just cut them half horizontally and glue it only to the front part of the teeth:) No sensitivity at all... Though after folding them as instructed I experienced sharpest pains, so came up with this solution. Teeth are pearly white and no pain:))) good luck to everyone:)</li>
    <li> I was very suprised how well these white strips worked.  They worked fast and my teeth look fantastic!! Tooth sensitivity was an issue but I did research on the internet and it said to brush with a floride toothpaste after use and it really helped, you can always take a motrin.  If worse comes to worse you can skip a day.  The results were well worth a little discomfort.  My teeth look great!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have excessively yellow teeth. Just the normal yellowing that occurs over time with drinking tea/coffee ever so often. Enough to make me want to brighten them up, so I bought the Crest 3D White Strips 7-day process which requires a 2 hour application daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently 1 hour into the two hour application on day 3. The last time I used Crest White Strips was when they first debuted with the 14 day process. Back then, the strips were full of a gooey clear sustance and slid all around on my teeth, even oozing the gooey stuff out over the edge of the strip into my mouth. Now, with this newer 7 day process kit, the strips have a thin layer of solid gel on them that seem to activate into a more liquid state when they lay onto the teeth. These also grip really tightly onto the teeth, to the point  where I have to use a little strenght to pull them off after the 2 hour time is up. The width is enough to cover the upper 6 teeth with a small overlap to the ones on either side. The bottom strip covers the same width. The strips are little higher than the height of my teeth so I fold it over and stick the excess to the backside of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The application process is easy and after day 2 of the full application times, I can see a significant difference in the brightness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 30 minutes into day 1 I got a sharp pain shooting up through my fang tooth for approximately 20 seconds. I keep the strip on though. After day 2 my teeth were super sensitive to cold liquids and would radiate pain through all of my teeth. This reaction lasted 24 hours and just went away prior to my applying the strip today for day 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I will udate this review once I complete the entire 7 days*</li>
    <li> I just received this today and started my first 2 hour treatment. I am truly amazed at the whiter brighter teeth in just one treatment. I can&#x27;t wait to see the end results. I&#x27;m not a coffee or pop drinker but I do indulge in teas. I just cannot stop looking at my teeth.....in ONE treatment!</li>
    <li> I know that this product was supposed to be intense, but it&#x27;s far more than I had expected. After the 2 hour application time, my teeth will start to ache, which is far more painful and annoying than it sounds. The pain won&#x27;t fade for a whole day. I&#x27;m not even sure how much it actually whitened my teeth since I&#x27;m unable to finish the 7 days with the strips.</li>
    <li> As a heavy coffee drinker, I&#x27;ve had had an interest in whitening products for a while now. I decided to go all out and give the \\&quot;Intensive Professional Effects\\&quot; a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, these things work, really exceptionally actually. In just a single day of use, my teeth had become noticeably whiter, and good deal of my coffee stains had vanished as well. The problem, which I had the misfortune of not noticing until the third day of use, (One application per day is recommended.) was that these whitening strips increase your tooth sensitivity to cold temperatures exponentially! While this happens with the other, less concentrated ones as well ([[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3d White Advanced Vivid Teeth Whitening Strips 14 Count]]), the effect here was absolutely horrid. Just the air of my own breath was enough to send massive pangs of pain throughout my face. The experience was rather akin to having my teeth drilled into as part of some dental procedure sans anesthetic. On the bright side, the effect is temporary, only lasting about a day, and causing no actual harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, these white strips definitely get the job done, but as to whether the agony is worth it, I suppose that just depends on how much of a hurry you happen to be in.</li>
    <li> I love the product it works but my goodness it hurts the crap out of my teeth within the 1st hr and I am not norm suscible to sensitivity. Painful</li>
    <li> These stung and made my teeth very sensitive. I used Sensodyne, and it helped tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t complain about the whitening, it was pretty obvious how much of a difference it made. I would recommend, but only if you have toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Did just a good a job as the regular pro effects whitening strips, just faster.  You pay a premium for the quicker results however.</li>
    <li> Worked fantastically! Turned my teeth bleach-white! For those who don&#x27;t floss, you will not see the best results so get on it before using this product! ;)</li>
    <li> I rated this product 4 stars because personally the solution was too concentrated for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works as intended, and I was able to notice results after two uses. However, the pain that throbbed through my teeth the day after my first treatment was nearly unbearable and I almost quit using the 7-day treatment completely. I decided to continue through the pain (by avoiding foods that were too hot or cold) and finish all packets. On the bright side, I DO notice a considerable amount of whiteness compared to how discolored my teeth were before treatments. Although I am satisfied with my results, I will not be returning to this product. In the future, perhaps I may purchase a whitestrip of lesser intensity and duration - perhaps the Level 4 Professional Effects strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviewers noted, this product may not work for everyone; my bottom teeth were HIGHLY sensitive to the strips. If you are looking for a product that is powerful enough to remove simple surface stains and partially bleach the tougher stains, Crest 3D Whitestrips (level 5) will do just that. Sensitivity is noted as a normal side effect, but this is common with most other whitening treatments.</li>
    <li> These strips definitely made a difference, but it was not as good as what I&#x27;ve seen on people who have had professional whitening.</li>
    <li> This turned my teeth at least 3 shades whiter, if not more.  It works.  The downside is it comes with tooth sensitivity.  I expected that, so I used the strips with Sensodyne.  That did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the strips stick to your teeth.  They won&#x27;t come off until you give them a good tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist noticed the difference difference.</li>
    <li> It will only whiten where it sticks and the dryer your teeth when you apply it the better it sticks the better it whitens. This blew the socks off of a local salon in town that does whitening for $125 and it also worked almost every bit as good as my $350 trays I had made then lost when I moved.</li>
    <li> For white teeth quickly - this willl do it - I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and my teeth get stained quickly, these 2 hour jobs really get the teeth white, however - they Really open them up and expect a little pain at night.  The results are worth it for me - DO NOT do these right before bed, do them earlier in the day and you will be fine:)</li>
    <li> I have THE most sensitive teeth and in the past have had to quit halfway through whitening treatments due to sensitivity. So my whole plan was to cram all the pain into seven days, tough it out, and have blindingly-white teeth to show for it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitivity wasn&#x27;t bad at all. I found that after a few days of using the strips as directed, it hurt a bit to bite on very hard foods (pita chips, for example) but sensitivity to air/temperature was not bad at all. I bought a toothpaste for sensitive teeth in anticipation of using these and I ended up not even needing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the results just . . . aren&#x27;t that great. I have never had my teeth professionally whitened because I think $200-$400 for whiter teeth is just ridiculous, but if this is all you get for $40, then I might need to reconsider. My teeth were already whitish but I wanted to take it that extra step, to the point that someone would describe my white teeth as a defining feature. This definitely did NOT do that. They look a tiny bit brighter. It&#x27;s a more blue white than the white I had before but overall, not that impressed. Might even see if I can get my money back, if satisfaction really is guaranteed.</li>
    <li> THEY DID WHITEN MY TEETH BUT NOW MY TOPS ARE WHITER THAN THE BOTTOM. DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS AND I DID USE ALL OF THEM FOR 7 DAYS</li>
    <li> The strips didn&#x27;t hold very well on your teeth  didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I guess that I would not purchase this item again</li>
    <li> this is a great prodict! it works really well. It made my teeth very sensitive after use, but i got some sensitive teeth toothpaste and it helped, also its only 7 strips so it was bearable. And the results were great! HIghly recommended</li>
    <li> It works, but it is painful. I read the reviews beforehand and kind of brushed them aside, thinking it couldn&#x27;t be THAT bad... It was that bad. I could only manage to use them every other day, and ended up not being able to finish the whole pack. The pain lasts way beyond the time you&#x27;re wearing the strips. There were a couple of times when I couldn&#x27;t sleep because my teeth still hurt so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does whiten very well, but to be honest, I don&#x27;t think there is enough to difference in the results to justify buying this over the next level down. The others work perfectly well with less time commitment and less pain.</li>
    <li> It works but does not make that huge difference comparing to the pain it causes.</li>
    <li> had my teeth looking fresh</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects Whitestrips exceeded my best expectations. Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of the reviews here on Amazon, and saw many comments regarding sensitivity-pain, and several regarding the difficulty of removing the strips from one&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read the instruction sheet that said (paraphrasing here) \\&quot;If you want to speed up the process, use two applications per day\\&quot;. So that&#x27;s what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity - Yes, there was some, especially on the fifth set of strips. It was only really noticeable when drinking something cold, or eating something hot. An Alleve worked just fine. I used all seven strips in a recent 3-day weekend and it was a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal - Jeez, just peel them off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness - Awesome. It&#x27;s not often that a product does exactly what it says it does. Crest hits it out of the park with this one. Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, climb down and throw the dice. Amazon has aggressive pricing on these, and they work great. Strongly, strongly suggested!!</li>
    <li> Either my teeth didn&#x27;t need as whitening as I thought...or it just worked okay for me.  I probably got a couple of shades lighter.  Although, I must say, I was worried about the tooth sensitivity issue I&#x27;d read in other reviews.  But I never experienced any pain at all. Overall, I guess it&#x27;s not a bad product, but personally, I woudn&#x27;t probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Its almost expected for a more intense level of whitening to be a bit painful. Just like if you were going to get a piercing and expect it to be pain-free, most likely isn&#x27;t going to happen. I switch out my regular toothpaste for one that is made for sensitive teeth (I use Senseodyne)a few days before and after i use these. It really does help!</li>
    <li> I have always used Crest Whitestrips so I tried the Professional Effects, it works just as expected. No complaints, your teeth will be noticeably whiter. The downside is the extreme sensitivity, your teeth will hurt for about a week if you use them consistently. I had to wait a couple days between each use.</li>
    <li> Very good and easy to use...excellent results for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Was advised by dentist that the strips are the best ones to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I love the whitening achieved just from the first application... but the sensitivity pain is out of this world...Clearly my bottom teeth are made of paper and just can’t handle the strips. I’ve used them 3 times on my top teeth &amp; twice on the bottom. *Note to user* DON’T use these every day. I’ve used them once every couple weeks or so and I’m still getting serious results. I also recommend using sensitive toothpaste regularly/in conjunction with the strips. This product totally works, there’s just some prep work involved if you don’t want to spend 24 hours with a toothache.</li>
    <li> Using these things could be considered a chore, but considering how much cheaper these are compared to dental work, I think a minor annoyance is worth it. I put them on after I came home from work (after I had dinner). I had them in my mouth while I would use Rosetta Stone, so it did not seem to modify my voice excessively. I definitely did not sound normal though, so it would be obvious if you had these things on at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few times I felt slight discomfort from the tenderness of my teeth. Most of my enamel has worn off above my teeth, so it should be noted if someone was going to feel shattering pain, it would be me. I never felt anything as bad as when I go to the dentist and a dash of cold water is sprayed above my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even a few months after I wore these things, people would comment on how white my teeth are (mainly non-Americans). I never told anyone I had used these strips, so I just let people continue thinking all Americans have great teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use these again, based off the results.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Actually does whiten to give a dramatically visibly whiter teeth. I mean this pretty much covers all the cons really.&lt;br /&gt;For my teeth, did not hurt at all. No sensitivity for me what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The damn things feel weird on my teeth but no big deal really.&lt;br /&gt;Have to remember to put them in every night. Setting an alarm on the cell phone does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Also have to clear our the 2 hours a night when you wont be eating or drinking anything.</li>
    <li> Used only 4 strips and my teeth were amazingly white. I received many compliments on vacation. Quick and effective way to bleach teeth. Thanks !</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****SUPER TIP TO AVOID TOOTH PAINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok before I ordered these I read almost all the reviews on Amazon about them and reviewers kept talking about severe tooth pain. So much so that I considered order the level below this version since less people reported any pain and some of the reviewers said that in comparison the others are better if you want to avoid pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not a wuss so I ordered these and figured I&#x27;d take the pain to have the whitening process work quicker. Plus I figured I&#x27;d save money cause with the intensive Professional Effects, you use less since they are stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok I ordered them and used them just like normal teeth strips and I experienced some tooth pain and severe sensitivity after about the third use and stopped using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some more research and experimenting and i realized that the tooth paint and sensitivity is more prominent when you completely fold the strips over your entire teeth. Essentially the contact with the very tip of your teeth (where it is thinnest and where you experience the most pain/sensitivity) is a large part of the problem. So after the fourth use I started cutting the individual strips in half and applying them JUST on the front and back of each row of teeth. I did not completely encase the teeth in the strip and essentially left the very tips/points of my teeth uncovered by the strips. I still get the full benefits of the whitening...BUT I EXPERIENCE LITTLE TO ABSOLUTELY NO TOOTH PAIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is extremely important: If you want to use these or even strong strips without experiencing tooth pain or hightened sensitivity, DO NOT ALLOW THE STRIPS TO COMPLETELY COVER/ENCASE YOUR TEETH. Cut or apply the whitening strips such that the crowns of your teeth are exposed. In my experience it is mostly when the crowns of your teeth are covered by the strips for the 2 hour time period is what mostly triggers the tooth pain. And no I didnt use sensodine or any other products to reduce the pain/sensitivity - I just cut the strips so that they completely cover the front and don&#x27;t folder over to the backsides of my teeth. Doing this has made using these strips for the recommended period of time bearable.</li>
    <li> Great product it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and came in plastic seal .... One week later and I can def tell my teeth are whiter :)</li>
    <li> I have used these on and off for many years and love them. They are truly perfect if you have a slight off coloring in your teeth (like me, from coffee and wine), and need a little sprucing up. In fact, my dentist was the one who suggested to me as he told me they would work at a fraction of the cost of doing the process in his office. Love them.</li>
    <li> 1. My teeth became very SENSITIVE after 1st treatment. But after 3rd treatment, the sensitivity was less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There was NO noticeable whitening after 1st use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. After the 7-day treatment, my teeth are NOT whitened at all. Instead, they are more shiny because most of stains on the teeth are removed. Teeth color is more HOMOGENEOUS. So, they look whiter, but they are, in fact, not whitened.</li>
    <li> These things work, no doubt.  The biggest question is whether the intensive model is *too* strong for most.  I can say, I have quite sensitive teeth, so I was worried about this beforehand.  but after using, I can safely say that its not a big deal.  Your teeth will hurt, kind of like a dull aching, for a day or two after use, but I was still able to eat/talk/drink stuff just fine during this time.  If you have any grit, the dramatic results make it quite worthwhile putting up with a day or two of sore teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on Nov. 25, 2012. It requires you use it for 2 hours/day for 7 days; after the 4th day I had to stop using it just to stop the agony I suffered! It makes your teeth extra sensitive (my teeth are still sensitive till the moment I&#x27;m writing this review!!) and your gum very irritated. I couldn&#x27;t eat anything that required chewing for 2 days. I cannot comment on the whiteness since I didn&#x27;t use it for 7 days as required. But even if it makes your teeth shinning, it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
    <li> Unmatchable teeth whitener and over the counter!  only $40, cheap and it actually works.  YOUR TEETH GO FROM DIRTY BROWN TO NATURAL IVORY</li>
    <li> Withen 2 days I saw results . 7th day I had paper white teeth, Only thing I recommend is that after you brush with sensodyne toothpaste to avoid the excrutiating pain.</li>
    <li> If you want white teeth this will do the trick.I saw results the very first day! I have to say that my teeth felt sensitive the second day so I skipped a day my teeth felt better and then I just skipped a day and the results are great.I can&#x27;t imagine them getting any whiter so if you want something you can rely on to work ,This is IT !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the results. My bright white teeth gave me more confidence and I just wanted to smile all of the time. :-)</li>
    <li> In just three uses my teeth were brighter and whiter than ever before. These strips sell for 60-70 dollars in a regular pharmacy, so this is a great deal! Brides, you will love them!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works as advertised. The Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips were delivered on a Tuesday it is now Thursday. After my amazement when viewing the results of the original treatment I have found that after 3 days I have reached a level of whitening I am pleased with. I plan on keeping the other 4 treatments for touch up. I read reviews warning about sensitivity and was concerned. In practice I found very little sensitivity which disappeared after roughly an hour or so. This is a product I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I  got my braces of, no stain (thank goodness) but my teeth were less than sparkling. So I searched and found these. First day I was skeptical but 3 days lat my mom goes, did you bleach your teeth? Lol! So let&#x27;s just say there was a big difference</li>
    <li> The product really works, but if you have sensitive teeth, don&#x27;t purchase the 7 day strips. Crest has other products in this line that would be better suited for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Bought these and was concerned about expiration date. Great seller. They worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it a try in the near future</li>
    <li> My teeth are definitely whiter after using this product.  You do have to leave the strips on for a long time.  But it is well worth it.  I&#x27;m an ex smoke and had pretty stained teeth.  My teeth are so much whiter now.  I did not experience any burning on the gums or gum discomfort, other reviewers reported.  Highly recommended.  Much cheaper than going to a teeth whitening dentist and paying 5 times as much for an outcome that my not get your teeth as white.</li>
    <li> After seven days of using this product, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the color of my teeth. During the seven days of usage, my teeth were more sensitive, howeve this went away within a few days after treatment was completed. I&#x27;m considering having my teeth whitened at the dentist&#x27;s office, although the last time I spoke to her about doing this, she didn&#x27;t think I needed it.</li>
    <li> Kind of gets to you. Suggest you wipe your teeth dry before application and the strips will stick better. I don&#x27;t now have Kennedy teeth, but they are a lot whiter.</li>
    <li> These killed my teeth during and for hours after!</li>
    <li> The product worded fine although I would have liked another 2 shades whiter. I had no pain as others had and the strips stayed on fine.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after running out of the level 2 of Crest 3D whitening strips. It had been around 2-3 weeks after those when I started using these. I had my first pair on for almost 2 hours, but it was halted by horrific stinging of my bottom teeth at around an hour and 45 minutes of application. I would have random stings on my teeth for another hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product again a week later, really wanting a whiter smile and the same thing happened. The pain is AGONIZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use something with less strength!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased and impressed on how well this product seemed to have whitened my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;By far the best product over the counter I&#x27;ve found to do so, without going to a dentist and having&lt;br /&gt;it done professionally. Would definitely recommend these whitening strips.</li>
    <li> I love thee whitestrips!!! My teeth are so white!!! They do cause sensivity but no pain no gain right, lol...Thank you for my new white smile!!! :)</li>
    <li> I rely on these for teeth whitening since I can&#x27;t use toothpaste or mouthwash containing alcohol. I also just so happen to drink a lot of coffee and black tea, so my teeth can get stained pretty fast. When I started using them 2 years ago, my teeth would be terribly sensitive to the point of keeping me awake at night. Now, after using them, my teeth are only mildly sensitive to hot and cold. I do not use the whole pack at once, only one strip every once a while to strip off the surface stains. They turn out a very natural, healthy tooth color (bright white just looks wrong to me). The difference after 1 use is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this, received the package, with the bottom slit and no whitestrips. were not included. I contact and filed a complaint. My money was refunded. Will not order again. n</li>
    <li> They worked phenomenally well. I&#x27;ve never used whitestrips or any whitening products (except for toothpaste) for that matter. While I will admit, 2 hours is a long time, but I just studied with these on. I have very thin enamel layer and they were indeed a little painful, but I did expect that, sensodyne helps with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you dry your teeth, I used a paper towel or even a hair blower with no heat. This way they stay on your teeth very well. Dry teeth are mote important for the intensive one because they need to stay on for 2 hrs. Also, someone here suggested to avoid tops of teeth (surface of your teeth that actually chew the food) — this is where enamel layer thickness in minimal — to reduce sensitivity. I&#x27;ve only read about this in my last day on the 7 day course and it worked very well, I have no sensitivity at all.</li>
    <li> Pro: Easy to apply. Not quite as uncomfortable as everyone described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Didn&#x27;t whiten quite as much as I would have liked due to my own teeth being white already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a dental cleaning before purchasing these strips. When your teeth are clean nothing stops the bright white power!</li>
    <li> It whitens just like it&#x27;s supposed to!  I&#x27;ve done 2 of the 7 treatments and see a noticable difference.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have to say that so far is looking good. A lot pain the first and second time I used it, I was about to give up the treatment because of the horrible pain, but my mom told me to put in my teeth olive oil and garlic an hour after the treatment and that would it takeoff the pain, and thanks god I did cuz it really work. I am getting less pain and I am able to use it and continuing with my treatment. I only give this product a 4 star because I haven&#x27;t finish the treatment and I most know if its really work. I am in my third day so let see.</li>
    <li> This product does whiten however it is not worth the pain.  The first strip I tried made my teeth pretty sensitive and I resorted to taking ibuprofen for a few days, even though I typically stay away from taking medicine unless I have to.  I waited a week before trying the second one and the pain and sensitivity were extreme.  I was unable to sleep and over the counter pain killers were not helping.  I am returning my box and getting my money back.  TRY PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS INSTEAD ( they resulted in little to no sensitivity yet excellent whitening effects).</li>
    <li> These work great, but have some sensodine toothpaste on hand to help with the soreness. For me, there was soreness after the first treatment, so I skipped the second day and brushed with sensodine. The 3rd day, the soreness was gone, so I started the treatments again and continued using sensodine. I didn&#x27;t get anymore soreness and the whitening results were amazing.</li>
    <li> These work well and stay in place much better than cheaper alternatives.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> as said, your teeth will hurt after using several times.&lt;br /&gt;but the result is very very good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel my teeth got any whiter and it even left a stingy soreness after I used it. The soreness went away the day day after use but it was painful. I would not have minded the pain if my teeth got whiter though</li>
    <li> I did notice an improvement after the first day.  Was very happy with the result.  It sure beats paying for a professional treatment at the dentist.  Both my husband and I did the treatments at the same time and we intend to continue using this product once a year.  They have improved the product and it adheres better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product definitely met our expectations and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The white strips worked well for whitening, and did not fall off as some other strips easily do.  However, there was extreme discomfort and gum irritation, even days after whitening.</li>
    <li> I tried this product last night as soon as I received it. It takes a little while. To get use to, but the results are great. I only had mine on for  1-1/2 hrs. I definitely saw a difference.  Can&#x27;t wait to do it  today. I would recommend this to anyone. You do, however, need to remove the strips slowly. Start at the back of teeth and finish at the front.</li>
    <li> i had butter yellow teeth and wasnt sure that anything affordable would work. I already made up my mind to just pay 500 at the dentist but decided to give these a try and im glad i did im not even finish with all the stripes and my teeth turned from butter yellow to extreme white, this is the whitest my teeth has ever been and saved me a whole lot of cash, only downfall is it leaves white spots on my teeth but they are fading away and evening out, my teeth also became sensitive but i pop in 600g advil and the pain isnt bad at all!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping to brighten up my smile a little and they didn&#x27;t end up working, only whitened some spots making some spots white and the rest the same old color - dulls after a couple days but after application as obvious as anything. After that, I gave them to my brother who has staining from when he was a baby and they made that go down an insane amount! Just another box for him and he should have them almost gone. HIT OR MISS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure these work well but are very painful to use everyday . You have to leave them on for two hours and that is tough to do. I didn&#x27;t make it through the whole box because my gums were way too sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. My teeth were medium cream color, not yellow but closer to ivory &amp; I wanted a super white frost look, and I didn&#x27;t get it. I got my teeth whitened a little bit, but you can&#x27;t tell much of a difference. Maybe this is best for those who have really yellow teeth. My complaint is that these do cause sensitivity as stated on box, but my big complaint is the strip not wanting to stay on after my mouth naturally salivates &amp; separates the strip from the teeth not allowing for full whitening to happen.&lt;br /&gt;It was decent for the price.</li>
    <li> ... And I mean, much less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product providing great results. I have been whitening my teeth using Crest whitening strips for years and would not use any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, my husband would not believe that Crest results could match professionals. I proved him wrong and now he&#x27;s in the &#x27;club&#x27; as well.</li>
    <li> For Crest&#x27;s top of the line I expected my teeth to be whiter than white. Same results as regular white stripes. But they do stay on. Still think a lot of whitening gets lost from normal mouth movements</li>
    <li> product does exactly what it says and exactly what it promises.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these strips for coffee or tea-stained teeth. The result is noticeable after one or two applications. One thing of note: they&#x27;re INTENSE. If you have sensitive teeth, you&#x27;re going to experience discomfort. My teeth were a bit sore, even the next morning. I used the strips every other day for two weeks and was very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It just saves me the professional teeth cleaning at the dentist! After four strips my teeth were more than white!</li>
    <li> Work great and totally didn&#x27;t need to use the full regimen.  Plus they are much wider than my teeth so I can cut them in half and they last twice as long.</li>
    <li> It will remove the yellow stain but not so white as mention so I order  crest whitestrip supreme professional to test it out ,I will review again  once I try crest whitestrip supreme professional .</li>
    <li> Works amazingly. I re-apply every six months.</li>
    <li> Well if you have sensitive teeth this product is not for you! After the first time I used it my teeth were bothering me for a whole day because my teeth are way too sensitive for this extreme product.</li>
    <li> Great Product; great fit; great price, item came as expected; will recommend to a friend. My family memeber loved it!</li>
    <li> Very rough on your gums. I used many other dental stripes before and I have fairly high tolerance for pain/discomfort. These stripes burn your gums and make them red/sore for days, aside from increasing tooth sensitivity. I used about 1/2 a pack and gave up. They do get the job done, but are EXTREMELY painful and mess up your gums for days.</li>
    <li> i drink a lot of tea. by a lot, i mean more than 10 cups a day. so my teeth are generally tinted. and these strips did bring back some of the whiteness they have lost only few weeks after my regular dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only problem is that i have to keep doing it over and over. or quit drinking tea, which isn&#x27;t happening anytime soon.</li>
    <li> The ones with the &amp;#34;flex strips&amp;#34; in my opinion worked better for me.  Strips were more comfortable and my teeth looked whiter!</li>
    <li> Loved these. They made my teeth so much whiter in the promised amount of time. Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> They work amazing. Your teeth will be whiter no doubt but be prepared. Your teeth will get very sensitive after this.</li>
    <li> I didnt know i have to use it for 2 hours at a time. and after 3 uses it turned my teeth very sensitive, but then when i stopped for one day it was ok</li>
    <li> I think it works for me and I&#x27;ve returned to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I wore these strips as directed, 2 hours a day for 7 days (not straight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt; - Serious whitening power (since they only whiten the front 6 or 8 teeth, it&#x27;s easy to compare with your molars to see the original shade)&lt;br /&gt; - Can still easily talk&lt;br /&gt; - Can drink water&lt;br /&gt; - Can easily be worn at work with only a minimal number of invasive questions :)&lt;br /&gt; - Quick to apply and remove&lt;br /&gt;MUCH cheaper than the dentist since it only whitens the teeth you see anyhow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt; - Can be slightly annoying if you don&#x27;t get a good seal&lt;br /&gt; - Slight/moderate tooth sensitivity (never even lasted overnight and didn&#x27;t happen with every strip for some reason)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get these folks who had burning gums... not calling them liars, but even when I&#x27;m sure I had the strip on my gums I felt no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - if you want to save a few hundred bucks and don&#x27;t mind that only the teeth people actually see get whitened, I recommend this product very highly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive teeth by any means; I can bite into ice cream and other cold things that make others cringe. I brush regularly and have good overall oral hygiene, but after just one 2-hour treatment of the Crest Intensive Pro Effects Whitening Strips, the bottom row of my teeth were in a great deal of pain. This product may whiten well, but I will unfortunately never know since the intense pain caused by it is not worth the effects. Too bad.</li>
    <li> My teeth hurt for two days after putting them in.  It was a terrible idea.  I highly recommend getting the medium version.  They work and don&#x27;t hurt like these do.</li>
    <li> THESE STRIPS WORK BETTER THAN ANY OTHERS I&#x27;VE TRIED BEFORE.THE PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS COST A LITTLE MORE ,BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN WHITENING IS SUPERIOR.DON&#x27;T BUY A LESS EXPENSIVE PRODUCT AND EXPECT TO GET THE BEST RESULTS.</li>
    <li> THE PACKAGE I RECEIVED MUST HAVE BEEN OLD.  THE STRIPS WERE HARD AND WERE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM THE PLASTIC HOLDER.  I BELIEVE THE PRODUCT WORKS BUT AFTER USING 2 STRIPS OUT OF 7, I AM NOT SOLD.</li>
    <li> Came Fast..Very Good product. These work..teeth very very very very very very very very very very very very very white</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Walmart and used them for 2 hours. I had to stop using them because my teeth hurt so bad. They hurt for one day after I stopped too. They did nothing to whiten my teeth either. I used a different formula many years ago and loved them. I think I left them on for 20 minutes a day, they did not hurt and I noticed whiter teeth with each removal. I assumed the Intensive Professional ones would work even better. I would like to try the old formula again, but after the pain, I am afraid to try. I will read some reviews and see what others are saying, I am worried that they changed an ingredient and this is what is causing the pain.</li>
    <li> I did not like these at all.  They did cause me major sensitivity.  I remedied that by taking some advil 30 mins before and I didnt have any &#x27;lasting&#x27; sensitivity to cold or hot stuff, but I did get sharp JOLTS that happens once or twice after using each strip in one particular tooth.  I had to space using them 1-2 days apart to keep the sensitivity away.  I have decently white teeth as I whiten every 9-12 months, and I didn&#x27;t see any difference after I used these.</li>
    <li> Oh vanity - how painful you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been happy with my teeth - I&#x27;m a coffee addict, and it shows. My old roommate had these gorgeous white, dazzling teeth and I was always jealous and so I decided that - before Christmas - I&#x27;d try a box of Crest Whitestrips (Advanced). They worked - but it took a while, and I didn&#x27;t end up using the whole box because I&#x27;m impatient. So a few months passed and my smile was looking a little sorry, so I saw these were on sale and there was a $7 coupon, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I had no sensitivity with the other product so I only sortof heeded the warnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal: They work. Really well. My teeth - after 2 hours last night - are noticeably different today. I&#x27;m actually very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: I am absolutely paying for it with sensitivity. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with their other products, so didn&#x27;t think anything of it. My teeth didn&#x27;t hurt while the gel was on them, and they didn&#x27;t hurt after I took them off until about 5 or 6 hours later when I awoke at 4am with my teeth in mild pain. It&#x27;s grown over the day so far, but from what I read, it should be gone tonight or tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Pay attention to the sensitivity issues. Brush with toothpaste for sensitive teeth (the potassium nitrate in it calms nerves. I&#x27;m picking some up after work) and a soft toothbrush. Wash your mouth with some warm - not hot - saltwater afterwards. And some flouride rinse - that has had pretty good results in helping with sensitivity. And very seriously, take breaks in days between applications. I won&#x27;t be doing it again until my teeth feel a bit better, and even then, I&#x27;ll likely only leave the strips on for an hour. If you&#x27;re patient, just do the 2 week kit, and you&#x27;ll be fine. But...if you&#x27;re like me, just understand that with impatience comes a bit of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, as far as a time commitment goes, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s out of the question to do this for 2 hours: I put mine on after dinner, hopped in the shower, blew out my hair, and then watched half of a TV episode, and they were done. You definitely can fit it into your schedule without a problem.</li>
    <li> I was okay for the price It does the job and whiten teeth I am satisfied with the strips Thanks</li>
    <li> I had tried the original Crest Whitestrips a few years ago and saw no change in teeth whiteness, even in the before and after closeup pictures I had taken as a test. With the new Intensive Professional Effects strips claiming to be as good as a professional treatment, I thought I would give these stronger whiteners a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before starting, I took a close-up digital picture of my teeth, making sure the tooth color in the picture looked the same as my actual teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and applied the strips to my teeth each evening for two hours. Opening the packet and getting the strips out was a bit of a hassle because the foil tears irregularly and the sides of the packet are hard to get apart. Once the packet was open, I had no problems applying the strips and they stayed in place. After the two-hour session, it took a firm pull to remove the strips from my teeth. Luckily, I did not experience any of the tooth or gum sensitivity issues reported by others. I did not brush my teeth until after wearing the strips, so maybe that helped because brushing can irritate gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three days, I noticed that my teeth looked whiter. I verified that by taking a digital picture, making sure to do so with the same camera settings and lighting. From day four through seven, I did not notice any dramatic change in whiteness. After the full seven days, I took a final picture of my teeth. I compared my before and after pictures and there definitely was an improvement in whiteness, though it was not a dramatic change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the results you get depends a lot on what color your teeth are without any stains, the amount of stains, and the nature of the stains. I&#x27;d recommend you give these whitestrips a try. They do come with a money-back guarantee so if you don&#x27;t like them you can get a refund. To save money, you might want to just use the first three since most of the whitening seems to come by then. Then, you could use the final fourwhen you notice you need a whitening treatment again.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes but these hurt my teeth so bad! Not for teeth that are sensitive in any way!</li>
    <li> It worked for me, but not for my husband. You could also purchase this at costco for so much cheaper. It injures your gum if you use it every night, which is what you&#x27;re supposed to. I definitely recommend trying another type of strip and maybe not the same brand.</li>
    <li> These work really well.  My teeth are much whiter than they were when I started the pack, and I&#x27;m only 4 strips in.  I always take at least a day off between using the strips though because they do make my teeth sensitive.  I think that&#x27;s the case with most whitening systems.  They seem to work &amp;#34;professionally&amp;#34; to really get my teeth white, however, one difference between these and professional whitening systems is that the strips go straight across on your gums, so if your gums are sensitive, be aware.  They will whiten, and they will likely hurt a bit.</li>
    <li> Three of the strips for the bottom teeth came with no whitening agent to stick to the teeth. Although I was very disappointed with the defective package as the product did work on my top teeth, I was pleased when I contacted Crest and they gave me a coupon for a free package.</li>
    <li> It was a lot of hassle and it didnt make my teeth white. A real waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> Love these things. I chew tobacco and still have whiter teeth than most people I know thanks to these. They make my teeth very sensitive though and I can&#x27;t use more than two in one week. But well worth it.  These are so much better than the old ones. They stay in place and seem kt work better.</li>
    <li> Love it super fast results better than anyother product</li>
    <li> I got this product to try out before my Christmas party and it worked well. All my friends noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitestrips before, but not the \\&quot;Intensive Professional Effects\\&quot; version. I&#x27;ve always felt that Crest made a product that did show results, but I sometimes wondered if most of it was in my mind rather than actual whitening. So, I thought it would be interesting to take a series of photos to see if these really did make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the photo above, titled \\&quot;Test Results\\&quot;. Without a professional studio to shoot photos under controlled conditions, I tried to keep things as equal as possible by taking the pictures at the same time every day (before sunrise), in the same room, with the same lighting and camera settings. I also used a piece of regular white copy paper as my white balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a strip that stays on for 2 hours a day means you really want to get a comfortable fit during installation. The first day I had some issues with the bottom strip over my molars, and discovered on the second day if I dried off my teeth with a kleenex prior to installing the strip I got a much better seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have some issues with tooth sensitivity when using the product, and have felt a dull ache in my teeth ever since Day 2. I&#x27;m using toothpaste for sensitive teeth (Tom&#x27;s) which does seem to make it better. Crest states this may happen, and that it is not harmful. This isn&#x27;t really a huge issue for me, but I felt I should mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after 7 days, am I blinding my co-workers with my brilliant choppers? Nope. My teeth are whiter, but they&#x27;re nowhere near the brilliance you see in the ads. I didn&#x27;t have horribly stained teeth prior to using the White Strips, but I am nearly 50 years old, so my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they were when I was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am decently satisfied with the results, I really can&#x27;t say there is a radical difference between these \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; strips and the regular white strips. The photo progression does show a difference, but not night and day by any measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to try the same test with the regular WhiteStrips in 6 months and compare those results to this more expensive and time consuming product.iteStrips in 6 months and compare those results to this more expensive and time consuming product.</li>
    <li> Strips were stiffer than usual, and didn&#x27;t adhere well. Still worked.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last - must use it too frequently to work.</li>
    <li> The hypersensitivity that this product induced made me put it down after only two days. I couldn&#x27;t bear to eat or talk, and touching anything made my skin crawl.</li>
    <li> First must say that I knew &amp; expected the pain that accompanies this product, as I have sensitive teeth. For those of you like me, please make sure you are fully prepared to suffer a bit! It is effective, and in my opinion, worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with 2 of these 2 days in a row. After the first two days noticed whitening around the edges where teeth tend to yellow first. I did also experience a little of the &#x27;blotchy&#x27; whitening effect that evened out after the full 7 strips. After the first two days, it hurt to open my mouth and talk for too long. Drinking was a challenge as well. I highly suggest lukewarm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 2 days, I did these intermittently (one every 2-3 days) until finished. The whitening effect was great - I feel like it could be more effective, but perhaps two boxes would give me the results I desire. I like SUPER white teeth. I have gotten a lot of compliments since using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, highly recommend, even with sensitivity. If you are a total pansy (ha) though, move on to the next step down offered by Crest. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> You have to keep them in for some hours but well worth the effects you get from them.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Whitened my teeth really well! Only problem was that it made my teeth ache and very sensitive after the first couple uses. Eventually the pain faded away and I was left with white teeth!</li>
    <li> Did a great job whitening my teeth and easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought these because I heard they work well. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference while using them. I don&#x27;t really have sensitive teeth but omg these bothered me!</li>
    <li> Great product and would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Good product would buy again</li>
    <li> Does the job for the price,</li>
    <li> I like the 15-minute ones better than these, that must be worn for at least an hour. I&#x27;ll shop for the others next time.</li>
    <li> These really work! I bought them before I had to go to a wedding and it completely brightened my smile! The stayed on clean and didn&#x27;t fall off like other whitening products. I can&#x27;t wait to buy these again :)</li>
    <li> No problem. I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening system out there! Love Crest products!</li>
    <li> For me i had minimal sensitivity during the 2 hours, after i took them of my teeth hurt...not a lot but often so how you can&#x27;t really forget about the pain or ignore because it does hurt quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest doing this in the afternoon so when you sleep you don&#x27;t have trouble with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works it really does the actual white on your teeth after using the whole 7 days only last 3-4 months (which is more than enough if you are just doing this for an event) and it slowly dulls out. But my teeth were very very yellow so at a certain point it just stayed a certain shade (very very noticeable change from my old teeth shade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders for the first couple of months and even when it dims it does have a permanent effect on your teeth</li>
    <li> sorry i got the product in great shape but i did not try it due to my traveling , one of my best friend try it and i can see the changing  from the first day</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness if you have sensitive teeth, prepare to be in pain. You&#x27;re supposed to do these for 2 hours a day, for 7 days...but there is no way I could keep to that schedule. I would wait a day or two in between treatments. HOWEVER, they work wonders. I would say my teeth were already fairly white, but I can hold up a blank piece of copy paper and the shade difference between that and my teeth is not much at all...I guess it just depends on how badly you want white teeth. :P and hey, they do say INTENSIVE on the box...</li>
    <li> to start off...i naturally have SOME WHAT sensitive teeth...nothing severe. I used this product and for the 2 hours I had it on my teeth I experienced no pain. (I did it close to bedtime) I removed them, brushed my teeth, mouth washed, rinsed with water and went to bed. the next morning i woke up to a horrible amount of pain in my mouth. My teeth hurt SOOOO bad!!! I couldnt even talk because it hurt when the air touched them. Thankfully it only lasted that whole day and not 2-3 days like i see some people had. I have not used another since. I was told by someone to brush with the sensidyne tooth paste a week or two prior to using these. i am too scared to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;results--i think they might be a little tiny bit whiter, but nothing drastic (keep in mind i only used ONE dose of the strips)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would steer clear of this if you have sensitive teeth! go with one that isnt as powerful that takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**oh, i wanted to say...i took aleeve to try and help the pain...did not help me**</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dental hygienist and worked great.  The 2 hour wait time is well worth  the accelerated results.  I have sensitive teeth but only noticed a slightly higher sensitivity to cold for the first couple of days.</li>
    <li> The results were noticibley better however ive also purchased the 3d white mouth rinse with better results.  This is a fast fix for a little whiter of teeth</li>
    <li> The product does what it says it does, it whitens your teeth, even on the first strip. For those that are worried about tooth sensitivity, you should use Sensodyne toothpaste before using it. You should probably brush with it for about 3 days before use, and during the application phase, then 3 or 4 days afterwards. At that point, you can switch back to your normal toothpaste. The very basic strips used to cause severe sensitivity for me, but when I thought about trying this, I have never had any sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product for my daughter and it turned out the result is amazing. I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> for starter, this is the strongest among the crest 3d white series: you are supposed to wear it for 2 hours, for seven days, to reach 5 shades whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Then there are those reviews (on amazon and elsewhere) talking about pain associated with using the strips... still, there are reviews praising the product, and the results it achieves with this price and in such a short time, without any mention of any sort of pain.&lt;br /&gt;torn between the yay-ers and nay-ers, I decided eventually to take the plunge and try it any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here is the deal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is there pain? short answer yes. but please wait for the long answer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-first time, I wore the stripes for two hours, during which I had a pulse of pain midway, then nothing.&lt;br /&gt;-took them off at the end of the two hours, every thing seems ok, so far.&lt;br /&gt;-significant whitening effect, mainly on the open edges of the teeth. I did not eat for a few hours afterward, so I have noticed that the whitening action continues to work even after taking the strips off.&lt;br /&gt;-two hours later, the pain started. it was not unbearable, but it was annoying enough. so it will help to do somthing to take your mind off it&lt;br /&gt;-the pain lasted for exactly 12 hour. the pain it self feels as if someone or something gave you a blow on the face directly on the mouth causing the teeth to become sensitive for a while.&lt;br /&gt;-some of the reviews advise waiting a few days if the strips caused pain, I waited a week.&lt;br /&gt;-the second time I used the stripes, the pain was less.&lt;br /&gt;-I waited two days afterwords, third time there was no pain.&lt;br /&gt;-I waited one day, just to be on the safe side, then used the fourth one, still no pain.&lt;br /&gt;-I then used the three remaining stripes for the three consecutive days, as it supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in a way, I feel that the  amount of pain has something to do with how yellow your teeth are. the yellower your teeth are, the more pain you will experience....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in general, the product worth the bother experienced for the result I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only mishaps are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the advancedseal tech works better on the upper teeth than the lower . making the lower strip wider will help&lt;br /&gt;-whiting of the upper teeth was better than the lower one, again , making the lower strip wider and longer will help&lt;br /&gt;-the active substance in the product does not penetrate between the teeth, which may leave yellow edges compared to the better exposed area. for that, take the time to press the strips between the teeth while applying it. I also recommend using 3d white vivid toothpaste with a good brush (preferably mechanical) , it will take care of these areas and maintain the results you got from the strips...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in all, i recommend  this product...l, the product worth the bother experienced for the result I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only mishaps are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the advancedseal tech works better on the upper teeth than the lower . making the lower strip wider will help&lt;br /&gt;-whiting of the upper teeth was better than the lower one, again , making the lower strip wider and longer will help&lt;br /&gt;-the active substance in the product does not penetrate between the teeth, which may leave yellow edges compared to the better exposed area. for that, take the time to press the strips between the teeth while applying it.

    <li> The top strips worked great in terms of adhering to  top set of teeth.  The bottom strips would not adhere to my bottom teeth.  I ended up sending them back and got a full return of my money.  Amazon has been great about returns.</li>
    <li> I used the Crest Whitestrips for the first time today. They stayed on fine and I noticed some whitening after removing them. Several hours later, my entire bottom row of teeth feel like someone is hammering them with ice picks. This simply isn&#x27;t worth it! Oracle is not helping. It&#x27;s not a sensitivity to cold or hot foods that&#x27;s the worst part -- it&#x27;s the nonstop general nerve pain. I haven&#x27;t had this kind of pain since I needed a root canal.</li>
    <li> The product was easy to use and whiten effectively.  A little sensitivity after the fourth day but not bad.  Will use this product again.</li>
    <li> One of the few things you can buy that work.  People always say something about my teeth.  Keep it up</li>
    <li> I used these for my wedding, I smoke from time to time and drink diet coke and coffee. My teeth were super white on my wedding day. I experienced slight sensitivity for a day after using. Don&#x27;t use if you have experienced sensitivity. My husband smokes cigars and he used one in the morning before our wedding, and his teeth whitened right up. I will say the one hour whitening strips seems to be less effective than the old two hour whitening.</li>
    <li> Adheres better than all other white strips I&#x27;ve tried and the effects are dramatic.  I highly recommend it to people who can stand using the strips.</li>
    <li> It works very fast and teeth will be sensitive after (as they warn you). But the effects start to fade (not completely) after a few days. The box comes with coupons for all their other prodcuts. :-) And you should definitely supplement the strips (I&#x27;ve only been using the toothpaste, shame on me). But even with the toothbrush and mouth rinse, I doubt it would maintain the level of whiteness achieved from the end of day 7... Soooo ordering another box. 1 more week will satisfy me. But, of course, it depends on how stained/ yellow your teeth are to begin with. My teeth are healthy but stained because of a lot of medications in my childhood.</li>
    <li> it works, really whitening effect, but i had a lot of sensibility on my teeth, thanks a lot. bye bye</li>
    <li> Wonderful results. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The Intensive Professional Effects  Teeth Whitening Strips worked very well for me.  They lightened my teeth about 9 shades.  I would recommend them to anyone.  They were easy to use and worked better than other whitening products that I have used.  They were shipped promptly and arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Expected much better results. Followed the process and I really think they improved slightly.  Not sure I would recommend to others</li>
    <li> i noticed the difference after the 1st use, which is good. but it makes my tooth sensitive &amp; painful. i will try whats written (cut the strip) &amp; hope the pain will gone..</li>
    <li> Noticeably whiter after just one use,</li>
    <li> When I put these on, I was afraid they&#x27;d be uncomfortable with tough-plastic or stuff that makes my teeth really sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t find that at all.  In all, it was surprisingly comfortable and fairly easy to take off, too.  There was a sort of gummy reside when I took them off, but a simple rinse with water helped that.  Although I did see some increased brightness, it wasn&#x27;t quite as dramatic as I hoped for.  Overall, though, this was a pain-free, comfortable way to get my teeth a little brighter.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Teeth can get a little sensitive but worth it.  Will give another go for the 7 days.  Great product.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work at all very disappointing. But that&#x27;s not the worst part my teeth are now very very sensitive.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it claims!  Cannot believe how white my teeth have become.  Would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> The first time using white strips, wich was approximetly two years ago, I saw massive results. It completley changed my facial appearence. Your smile makes a massive difference in the way you look.&lt;br /&gt;That was two years ago, when I used the advanced vivid strips.&lt;br /&gt;I eagerly tried these strips expecting the same results. But my teeth look almost exactly the same. The box came with 5 strips. I did not notice much of a difference at all. Maybe I didnt use it right? I placed the sticky part that was attached to the platic on my teeth. I was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get results for whitening it hurts my teeth&lt;br /&gt;and bleeding gums and because of that became very sensitive l want my money back :(</li>
    <li> Tried strips several years ago, was not satisfied, but these strips really do work. Wake up at 6 am put them on and go back to bed until 8am, snoozing lightly, so they are not inconvenient at all. They even got rid of stains that I thought were permanent since cleaning at the dentist did not get rid of them. No gum irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Whitestrips for about 7 years, and I have to say - this is by FAR the most effective product they have come out with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to share a helpful tip for all of you out there with sensitive teeth like myself. I thought for a long time that the pain I endured from whitening my teeth was something that I just had to put up with. I used to have very intense pain for up to 24 hours after using the strips - enough to keep me awake at night or distracted during my day at work or school. But all that has changed - now I am able to use these Intensive Professional Effects up to twice a day if I really want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is (or at least for myself) I figured out that there were certain points on my teeth that were actually the point of pain, and if the strips did not touch that part of my teeth, then I would not have any pain at all. For me, because I tend to grind my teeth when I sleep, the very top part of my teeth, (where you fold the strip over) was my sensitive point. I started to cut my strips so that they cover the whole front surface of my teeth, but do not fold over the back... and voila! No more sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even ask your dentist where you have worn away enamel on your teeth and that will be the part where you shouldn&#x27;t touch the whitestrips. I&#x27;m unsure if this will help everyone, but it is worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much being able to comfortably whiten my teeth has improved my self confidence! I was teased the whole time growing up and in highschool for the discoloration of my adult teeth. I even had dentists tell me that they were unsure if I would be able to whiten my teeth because they had come in that color. Lucky for me, I found Crest Whitestrips and figured out how to use them comfortably! Now I get compliments on my teeth all the time! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to drastically improved the beauty of their teeth. :)</li>
    <li> I deal with the public everyday and have to make presentations a couple of times a month so I try to be very conscious about how I present myself.  I&#x27;ve tried several whitening products in the past and this is the first one where people have actually noticed. After using this product, several people have commented on how white my teeth look.This usually happens when I&#x27;m having a conversation without someone about some unrelated topic and then they pause for a second and just totally go off topic and ask &amp;#34;How do get your teeth so white?&amp;#34; I have to laugh since I though it was just a fluke the first time it happened. I don&#x27;t hesitate telling them that I used these strips since I think everyone should get complimented on their smile at least once in their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I also tell them that I use Crest 3D White Luxe toothpaste and Listerine Total Care w/ Whitening mouthwash along with cutting back on  coffee, hot tea, red wines, and Coca-Cola (which I replaced with regular club soda). However, it wasn&#x27;t until I went through a set of the white strips that the compliments really started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say you to have the strips in place for at least two hours so I would usually put them on a few hours before going to bed. Once you put them on and the strips get moist, they really stick to your teeth and do not want to come off easily which is why I guess they work so well. When I first started using the strips I did experience a little tooth sensitivity, but fortunately it was not severe like some reviewers experienced. I also took some advise from other users and only used the strips every other day. In addition, my gums felt a little sore when I brushed my teeth due to the high concentration of peroxide in the strips so I switched to a soft bristled brush to avoid further discomfort.  It went away after I finished using the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any real results until after the fourth time I used the strips and I would estimate that my teeth got about two to three shades whiter which apparently can make a big difference to those around you. I would not call it &amp;#34;super star&amp;#34; white, but at least I know I didn&#x27;t crossover into the extreme &amp;#34;blue tooth&amp;#34; smile. I can tell the difference in whiteness between the area of my teeth that was covered by the strips and the area that was not.  However, the difference is very subtle and not easily apparent. I will not go so far as to say that this product is as good as getting your teeth &amp;#34;professionally&amp;#34; whitened by a dentist, but I think its a relatively inexpensive temporary fix. I think the instructions also recommend that you not use a set of strips more than once every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this product has been a relatively positive one. While this product is not a magic bullet for everyone, it can make a difference if combined with other steps. I think my results are largely due to the fact I used a combination of whitening products and made some changes in the choices of drink consumption (I still drink coffee and soda since I don&#x27;t mind a little caffeine boost now and then, but just not on a regular basis). However, I do feel these white strips really made the difference in bringing out my brightest smile possible.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the seven days, two  hours per day. I could not see any difference what so ever at the end of the seven days. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> OK, so after my research on teeth whitening and looking up different recommended products, I decided to go with Crest because of the reviews which were good. So, let me tell you my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the first teeth whitening treatment I have ever used and I love the results. But let me also add that I use the Crest White 3D Toothpaste, 3D White Toothrush, and Arm&amp;Hammer whitening booster. My first three treatments I did three nights in a row until my teeth started to feel achy then I finished the rest of the treatments every other night or until the pain went away. I also started brushing my teeth 3 times a day or after each meal(if possible). I just finished the box the other night, the results, a huge difference! I did have teeth with noticeable yellow stains, now those stains are almost completely gone. Did it Whiten them? No and yes. They got rid of the yellow stains but didn&#x27;t give me the shining bright white color, my teeth look cleaner if you want to put it that way.  I feel like if I were to get another treatment box it would really \\&quot;Whiten\\&quot; my teeth and I&#x27;m leaning on doing that. This transition only took 13 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended items to get for Awesome results:&lt;br /&gt;Crest 3D White Intensive White strips&lt;br /&gt;Crest 3D White Toothpaste &amp; Toothbrush(Med and Soft)&lt;br /&gt;also:&lt;br /&gt;Sensondyne Extra Whitening toothpaste(for when your gums and teeth start to hurt, use with the soft toothbrush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my experience with this product. I really like the results, a lot better than having yellow teeth. I RECOMMEND this product! Also, don&#x27;t forget to follow instructions! I&#x27;m purchasing another box as I speak. HAPPY TEETH WHITENING!</li>
    <li> is the worst product that i bought on amazon. i spend a lot of money for what? if you want white teeth brush your teeh every day, simple is that!</li>
    <li> very very nice and i realy liked it it is one of the best products which i has parchsed .</li>
    <li> These things are great. My dental hygienist told me to just do it myself and save money and get results as good as they could do. Granted it is a small rural clinic, but she was right.  Don&#x27;t waste money on the cheaper ones, they are not the same.  These things stay put better and just work. Wish I had done this long ago. I&#x27;ll refresh as needed.</li>
    <li> As described. Whitens fast. Irritates gums a little.</li>
    <li> I think I noticed a small difference in the whiteness of my teeth after using the product two times in two weeks. However, it made my teeth hurt so much that I couldn&#x27;t stand to use more. I followed the directions and I have a high pain tolerance, but this was too much.</li>
    <li> Really did not improve the whiteness of my teeth noticeably.  Did not recieve one comment about whiter teeth and could not really tell myself.  Made gums sensitive and would suggest doing it professionally versus wasting your money on this.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery- Awesome Product!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!!! I HAD A LITTLE SENSITIVITY BUT NOT MUCH. TEETH LOOK GREAT AND I SMOKE CIGARS. FOR AN OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCT IT WORKS  IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
    <li> I have always used crest 3d whitening strips anytime I whiten my teeth. I normally buy the professional effects and have had great results with that one however with this one I used it three of the 7 days and by the third day I couldn&#x27;t even talk. My mouth, teeth, gums...everything hurt to the point it kept me up at night and after all the pain I couldn&#x27;t even notice a difference. I keep trying to talk myself in to using the final four but I haven&#x27;t worked myself up to it. I will probably continue to buy the professional effects since I had such great luck with that one.</li>
    <li> These strips really work great. The difference was noticeable, and I had pretty good teeth to begin with. My only complaint would be the sensitivity that is sometimes caused; I decided to save the last two strips for a later time because my teeth are sensitive and it was hard to finish the fifth strip before they started hurting.</li>
    <li> I opted for these strips after having a terribly painful XOOM whitening experience.  I got those awful, deep shooting pains that some people suffer from during the process, and figured that it&#x27;d be in my best interest to do any whitening with something that I perceived to be more gentle -- like these strips.  I&#x27;ve used the basic strength strips before, as well as bleaching trays that I got from my dentist.  These are slower methods but both get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you this:  The first time I used these, I did get a single shooting pain in one of my teeth in the bottom row when I was using these, after wearing them for about 45 minutes of the recommended hour.  I IMMEDIATELY ripped them off and thoroughly washed my mouth, scrubbing my teeth violently with my tooth brush.  If you&#x27;ve ever experienced these pains, you&#x27;ll understand the reaction.  I just wanted to post this as a warning that if you are sensitive to teeth whitening products, beware!  You may want to use a weaker product over a longer period of time instead of this one.  I&#x27;m sincerely so afraid to use them again that I only used one set of whitening strips out of the box, and the rest are just sitting in my medicine cabinet, hurtling toward the expiration date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results of these Whitening Strips&lt;br /&gt;The 2 hours can be a slog but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews before trying them out and some people said to cut the strips shorter so they don&#x27;t fold over your teeth. I did this and experienced no sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried them without cutting them shorter and let them fold over my teeth and for the next 24 hours I had aches and pains in my teeth that were quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend cutting them down to avoid them folding over your teeth. If you do this you&#x27;ll be a much happier customer.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth look whiter and brighter and are not feeling sensitive at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, straight forward and easy to use and they did not slide around at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on day 5 of 7 and I am already blown away by the results. I had braces for a long time which made my teeth look not all that hot when they were removed. Even after the first application I noticed a significant difference. Well worth the cost. The strips can make your teeth sensitive but it helped that I rinsed with a fluoride mouthwash after. 2 hours for 7 days is so much better than having to spend 20 days using the strips, or getting a professional whitening which is a ridiculous cost. Amazing product and will buy it in the future should I need it again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product. Did not get my teeth that white like I wanted it to. I ended up going to my dentist to get my teeth whitened.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  I didn&#x27;t know my teeth could get so white, almost too white.  Literally, after the first application, which lasts for two hours, my teeth were much whither than before.  Worked from the very first application!!  And, you only have to use the product once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> There are different strenghts of this product. This review is for the strongest one, #5. It works as well as a $400-$500 dentist office whitening. You can actually see a difference after only one treatment. It costs $68.00 in stores, so at $44.00 it&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon. Be aware that since it is so strong, it can make your teeth very sensitive if overused. I get prescription-strength fluoride gel from my dentist, which helps with the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This is the highest level of whitening that Crest offers.  I can tell by the fact that after day 4 I did start to notice some sensitivity in my gums.  However, don&#x27;t let this dissuade you, it is very minor and went away after the end of the treatment series.  While I did notice that my teeth are whiter, it wasn&#x27;t the stark change I had envisioned and seen on a co-worker&#x27;s teeth.  Still I would recommend this with the caveat that depending on how your teeth start out, it may take a few more series of treatments.</li>
    <li> I have used this product a few weeks ago, after the first use I was happy because I got a change in my teeth they were noticeable whiter, BUT after the second use, ooopps! it was SO PAINFUL, the sensitivity was TERRIBLE, I wasn&#x27;t able to continue my day, i tried to use tylenol advil but they didn&#x27;t help,(and don&#x27;t think I never had any sensitivity problems before) then I called P&amp;G and they told me to use sensidyn toothpaste (a toothpaste for sensitive teeth) but it DID NOT HELP,(it is a good toothpaste for sensitivity but it&#x27;s not supposed to help before 2 weeks of using it) well the pain goes away after 3-4 days but on this 3-4 days it&#x27;s REALY PAINFULL. the BOTTEM LINE is, IT DOES WHITHEN YOUR TEETH BUT YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO SUFFER</li>
    <li> I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product.  Previously, I&#x27;ve used a professional whitener from my dentist without side effects.  For me the pain started about one hour after I removed the Crest whitening strips.  It&#x27;s now been 2.5 hours since removing the strips from my teeth and I am in SO MUCH PAIN...pain like I&#x27;ve never had before.  I took 3-200mg Advil gel caps with no relief.  I can hardly wait for 4 hours to pass so I can take more Advil.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND buying this product.  In fact, I&#x27;m returning the unused portion of this product because the pain is that bad.</li>
    <li> used it for a while but no results because the strips were old and wrinkly oh well have to be alert next time</li>
    <li> My teeth got as white as they did 12 months ago when I whitened them then. There really wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of whitening to do, but what needed to be whitened, did. My teeth do look as white as if I went to my Dentist. He even said the strips did a great job on my teeth. That was good to here since I only have to whiten once a year, it&#x27;s simple to use and the end result is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;  When I whitened last year, I never really noticed how much whitening I needed until the process started to work. What a difference. Now I can go into a room with fluorescent lighting because my teeth are white and they look great. I&#x27;m really happy about the whole experience. Thank you, Crest, you saved me a lot of money by not having to go to the Dentist.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;  M. Elias&lt;br /&gt;  Clinton Twp., Mi</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a large portion of the Crest Whitening Strip Line as well as their toothpastes and mouthwashes. This particular product is by far the most effective, but after 1.5 hours my teeth really start to hurt and I have to take them off. My teeth continue to ache for the following 2 days but they are a lot whiter. I&#x27;ve found using them every few months keeps and maintains a white smile, despite my coffee/tea addiction. I would imagine if you could tolerate frequent use these could easily get your teeth bright white.</li>
    <li> Because I am an avid tea drinker, I have to use something to whiten my teeth, or they stain quickly.  I had used Crest White Strips many times before, but this was the first time I had used the 7-day version.  I was unexpectedly asked to go on a business trip at the last minute, and wanted to make a good impression, so I didn&#x27;t have time to wait for the longer treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They worked beautifully.  My teeth are white (though not scary white) and my smile looks great.  I used them over the recommended 7 days (I saw many reviewers spread them out longer so as to avoid pain), and though they did cause a bit of achiness, it wasn&#x27;t bad at all and passed very quickly.  I&#x27;d say my teeth are of about average sensitivity.  I can certainly imagine they would cause a lot more pain for people with sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people complained about the two hours needed each day to leave them on, but I didn&#x27;t find this to be a problem.  I just put them in after supper each evening, and then removed them before going to bed.  They&#x27;re not terribly intrusive if you&#x27;re just hanging around the house - didn&#x27;t prevent me from reading bedtime stories to the kids or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is an excellent product, and a wonderful value as compared to professional whitening by your dentist.  My only complaint, and the reason I did not give five stars, is that the lower strips seem too narrow to me, so that only my very front teeth get whitened, and the ones on the sides stay brown, making them a noticeably different color.  This isn&#x27;t too big a deal, as those teeth are harder to see anyhow, but I would still rather that they get whitened as well.</li>
    <li> I use this brand every year. Decided to try these from Amazon and they didn&#x27;t give me the shine like Crest strips from walmart. Weird but it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> I like Crest 3d White Intensive Professional&lt;br /&gt;This is really Great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much .&lt;br /&gt; I like Crest 3d White Intensive Professional&lt;br /&gt;This is really Great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much .</li>
    <li> Dear .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please i would like to order 15 of this product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please advice me ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regrds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayman</li>
    <li> I have tried several over the counter teeth whitening products, and this is by far the best one.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay for whitening in a dental office, and the prior products (including other Crest Whitestrips) that I tried did whiten my teeth, but not significantly.  These Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects strips made a big difference in the shade of my teeth.  Although my teeth are not &amp;#34;Hollywood white&amp;#34;, I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;These strips whitened my teeth significantly, and were not nearly as expensive as a whitening treatment in the dentist&#x27;s office.  The strips also adhered well to my teeth, and did not slip during wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You have to wear these strips for 2 hours a day, for 7 days.  You can&#x27;t eat or drink during this time, so finding the time can be difficult.  They also made my teeth very sensitive, although the sensitivity peaked around the third day, and was tolerable after that.  I used sensitive teeth toothpaste while I was waiting for these to arrive and for a week or so after, and that seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I really like these strips, and have signed up for the Subscribe and Save option to keep my teeth looking nice.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find it as helpful as I thought I would. Box says whitening level 5 (highest) but I didn&#x27;t notice a sparkling change in my teeth. Plus I feel my teeth are more sensitive now than before its use.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! USED IT JUST LIKE THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID AND AMAZING WHITENS JUST GREAT.  WILL RECOMMEND TO ALL WHO LIKE WHITE TEETH</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product for my husband.  After years of coffee drinking, his teeth were stained.  There was a definite improvement after just a couple of days.  Being a coffee drinker myself, I will probably purchase the product for myself.</li>
    <li> Well congrats to those who have had success using these whitestrips. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t fall into that same group of people. I tried my luck and didn&#x27;t see result or difference on my teeth before and after.. A commitment of 2 hours per day was a walk in the park for me since I just got off my orthodontic braces earlier this year. I followed other reviewers&#x27; suggestion to place the whitestrips with caution, not letting them touch the gum. As a result, I didn&#x27;t really experience intense pain or sensitivity while using the whitestrips. I would use them after dinner and when I wake up in the morning during the first 2 days I did experience pretty strong sensitivity on my lower teeth, but the sensitivity would subside in a matter of hours (just before lunchtime). Let&#x27;s just say that the teeth sensitivity and the 2-hr commitment would be something that I would gladly tolerate/put up with if only these whitestrips actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t remember reading this on Crest whitestrip&#x27;s box or the instruction sheet.. but I&#x27;ve heard some people recommending to not brush your teeth before applying whitestrips.. specially not with toothpaste. Not sure if this actually affects anything at all or not, but if so then maybe that might be the reason it didn&#x27;t work for me because I always brushed my teeth before using whitestrips. And if this is actually the case, then this piece of information SHOULD be included somewhere on the box or the instruction sheet.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who wants to give it a try, I would strongly suggest to get them online which is sold cheaper compared at the grocery stores etc, or at least get them when they&#x27;re on a big sale or something similar..</li>
    <li> I have had grayish teeth since childhood due to tetracycline staining. I tried Whitestrips when they first came out 20 years, and they had no effect. I just learned to deal with my embarrassing teeth.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I saw the 3D Crest Whitening toothpaste on sale, and thought I&#x27;d try it. To my surprise in a few days I found my teeth were a bit brighter. So I came online to research the latest in whitening strips, and found this intensive 2 hour/ 7 day program. I ordered here and with my prime membership got it the next day, and started right away. After the first treatment I noticed a difference. A big difference. I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my teeth because it was the nicest they have ever looked!  I did four days in a row, and started to notice a very slight sensitivity in my teeth. I took a break for a few days, and have started to finish the last three days.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even tell you how happy I am with these white strips. They have brought my teeth from a dingy gray (google tetracycline  stained teeth images to get an idea) to a reasonably normal shade of white. They will never be bright white unless I use a pretty serious and expensive new bleaching technique for $600-$1000. But they now look normal! I keep looking in the mirror because I can&#x27;t even believe it, and can&#x27;t get used to the new look. I am SO happy with these strips and would highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as comfort, the strips are not uncomfortable, but just mildly annoying. I have had no real teeth sensitivity except for the very minor amount after day 4. It says you can drink water while wearing them, but when I did I did notice a bit of an upset stomach. So I refrained from drinking anything for those two hours. They are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it for me - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use Crest WhiteStrips three times with no issues but this was my first try with the Professional version, 2hours.  Well, as expected and along with every other review after one 2 hour application, my teeth started to hurt about 4 hours after that and now I&#x27;m going on 30 hours and still in a bit of pain.  I called and sent in for my refund.  My recommendation, spend the $200 for your dentist to do it and use something less painful for the in between times.  I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt whitening trays and my teeth were not sensitive from that but I think that is similar to your basic white strips which are not terribly bad.  Hope this review helps you.</li>
    <li> I tried it. and I think, it&#x27;s working. maybe, your teeths can ache sometimes. white teeth as soon as possible ;)</li>
    <li> I feel like my teeth are whiter but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say &amp;#34;as good as a $500 whitening treatment&amp;#34; as they claim.</li>
    <li> these strips did a really good job whitening in just 3 days.  The only drawback is that it made my teeth sensitive (somehting that didnt happen with the 30 day set.</li>
    <li> Used the product, followed the directions, and NO RESULTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used &amp;#34;Crest 3D WHITESTRIPS W/ Advanced Seal Advanced Vivid&amp;#34;, and although it is a level 3 whitening power, it sure works better than the &amp;#34;Crest 3d White Intensive Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 7 Count.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Crest 3D WHITESTRIPS W/ Advanced Seal Advanced Vivid&amp;#34; provides 14 pouches that you only wear for 30 min vs. the &amp;#34;Crest 3d White Intensive Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 7 Count&amp;#34; with only 7 that you have to wear for 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the pain, because there are no results!!!</li>
    <li> Love these and noticed a difference with just the first strip!  These noticeably whiten your teeth without having to go to a dentist and spend hundreds on expensive whitening treatments.  Try them and you&#x27;ll be sold.</li>
    <li> I smoke, drink coffee and had antibiotics when i was a kid. my teeth are the color of dishrags. nothing is going to make them perfect, except maybe a veneer, which i&#x27;m not doing. these have made a noticeable difference and are better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and will use again</li>
    <li> saw results in 2 days, awesome product, not for people who are sensitive to pain or with crooked teeth. buy it</li>
    <li> These may whiten your teeth, but after just ONE use, my teeth hurt really bad!  Though Crest was excellent about replacing the product when I contacted them.</li>
    <li> I have done several professional treatments and I have used crest white strips many times. I usually buy the Vivid strips that you wear for 30 minutes max, but this time I bought these and I was in soooo much pain! I have never had tooth sensitivity problems from whitening so I&#x27;m not quite sure why it was different this time than the others! I would rather use the Vivid strips (also made by crest) because I got results with no pain at all and they are a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I expected a huge difference, I think it may have lightened 1 to 2 shades. I used them as directed. 2hrs daily. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> PRO: The whitestrips are much cheaper on Amazon than they are anywhere else; however, my package was a little damaged when it came, but it was worth saving an extra 20 dollars.  You can instantly tell a difference in how white your teeth get, but after the 3rd day or so it becomes less dramatic and almost seems to stop completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: They burned like acid! I accidently placed the strips too close to my gum line and they burned for a solid hour! I almost took them off, but I suffered for beauty.  They caused some tolerable insensitivity before that incident, but after it got so unbearable that I had to chew a cough drop with a mild numbing agent to reduce my pain. The sensitivity lasted for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to recommend this product or tell you not to buy it, but if you do:&lt;br /&gt;  1. DO NOT place the strips too close to the gums.  You will suffer and feel as though a thousand miniature men are waging war on  your gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2. Pre-brush with a sensitive toothpaste for at least a week before you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3.  You may find it easier to apply the strips but cutting them in half vertically.  I have an awkward front tooth angle so I found it easier to apply it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  4.  Dry your teeth first with a tissue or cloth.  It makes the strips easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Does not work!! Very painful on sensitive teeth!!</li>
    <li> After a third of the strips I had to stop because of the painful sensitivity it created. I had to buy some orajel and sensodyne did not offer any relief. I recommend the regular strips. I did not even notice any difference in the color of my teeth after using half of the strips.</li>
    <li> Have used the no:3 in the 3D whitening strips but must say that the No;5 are slightly better. Used in conjunction with the toothpaste gave awesome results. Use it and you wont be disappointed, I have no cons about this product. (maybe the bottom strips cud be longer).</li>
    <li> I saw a huge difference after I used this product.  I did find if I used it twice a day, I had a lot of sensitivity, so I only used it once a day and that seemed to help a lot.  Sensitivity didn&#x27;t last long at all, but was very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product again for sure!</li>
    <li> Work fairly well but the whiteness doesn&#x27;t last very long.  This is second purchase and just didn&#x27;t see the amount of change I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I was unsure after the first few days but at the end of the 7 days the difference was remarkable. I feel so much better about my teeth.</li>
    <li> It worked. Did what it was suppose to do. Somewhat uncomfortable but tolerable and to be expected. Advice: spit, don&#x27;t swallow, nasty aftertaste. I&#x27;m no expert but I know my teeth are noticeably whiter</li>
    <li> I had previously tried the &#x27;thirty minute&#x27; Whitestrips, and one definite improvement in this product is that the strips both cover and stick to the teeth far more effectively than did the former. They still do tend to slip, especially near the edges, and to rise up from the gums - near which most of my worst stains do appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product is a bit of a nuisance. Two hours at a clip is difficult, and the strips begin slipping long before that time has elapsed. (They certainly cannot be worn in public - it would appear one was seeking to hold one&#x27;s false teeth in with wrapping tape.) It has some whitening effect, but not on darker stains (such as are common for me, a cigar smoker.) I doubt many of us would find it convenient to wear one of these for two hours, for seven days in a row.</li>
    <li> When I start to get paranoid about the whiteness of my teeth, I use one of these every two or three days until the package runs out. I can&#x27;t use them seven days in a row as they make my teeth too sensitive. But my teeth are noticeably whiter after a few uses. As I understand the pain is not indicative of long-term damage, and generally subsides after a day. Advil, I have found, does not generally help.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I have sensitive teeth until I try the strips. I had to give them away because the pain was excruciating as I had the strips on, believe I have a high pain threshold and this was not pleasant.</li>
    <li> People are right about the sensitivity it can be intense but overall it really works.  Noticeable results after first usage!</li>
    <li> I had ordered the Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects on Thursday March 1st. Amazons estimate for the product to arrive was the next Friday the 9th to Wednesday the 14th. The package arrived Monday 5th ( 4 days earlier than what Amazon had estimated as the least amount of time for the product to arrive. I started using it that Monday the 5th and am now writing this review on Sunday March 11th(the seventh and final day of the process). After the first use I wasn&#x27;t sure the product would work. It took until the third use for the results to really show, and after that my teeth have been becoming whiter after each application. I am highly satisfied with the results. I started out with kind of yellowish teeth to almost paper white. I had actually held a white peace of paper to my teeth while taking a picture each day for documentation. I was impressed with the seal of the white strips. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to swallow my on saliva without tasting the white strips, this was not the case thankfully. Irritation can occur on your gums if the strips are applied over the gum line. Be sure not to go over the gum line and you should not have a problem with the whitening and irritation of the gums. My teeth did become sensitive some days but passed and didn&#x27;t cause much discomfort. Be sure only to use this product once a year as it states in its little instruction Manuel. My box also came unexpectedly with coupons up to $9.75 of savings like: $7.00 off One crest 3D white Intensive Professional Effects kit, $1.00 off One Oral-B 3D White Vivid or Advanced Vivid Brush, $1.00 off One crest Mouthwash Rinse 458mL or Larger( It can be 3D white if you want but is not limited to it), and $.75 off One crest 3D white Vivid or Advanced Vivid paste 4.1 oz or larger. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a brighter smile in just one week. Be sure not to judge the product based on your first use as I have noticed that it takes a few days for the results to really show, and that this is supposed to take 7 Days to complete hence the 7 count strips. I hope this review is helpful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have uploaded a picture of the results from beginning to end. Sorry about the size of the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edit](5/6/2012) - My teeth are still white and everyone at school is jealous of my white smile. I&#x27;m keeping this product my little secret :).</li>
    <li> Absolutely not for people who hate having sensitive teeth. I felt a couple sharp jabs of pain while wearing them for the 2 hours but no big deal, the real problem was the 24 hours AFTER. It was constant ache and pain that lasted way too long, I had a hard time falling asleep- and nothing including water, milk, food, brushing teeth, would weaken the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for whitening, great results. Because of this I continued to use them, but only used them once every other day- making it 14 days instead of 7 consecutive days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend, but strongly warn people with sensitive gums that this may be a bit painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
    <li> These really work. They&#x27;re much better than the regular white strips. There is a little sensitivity issue because how much peroxide is in them and how long you have to wear them, but I&#x27;m willing to put up with that for these incredible and fast results. I saw great results after just 1 use of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular coffee drinker, so I get some minor staining on my teeth. I&#x27;ve used some of the lower strength strips before and was pretty happy with the results, so I decided to try these. They&#x27;ve definitely left my teeth a couple shades brighter; the difference is clear. My teeth aren&#x27;t normally sensitive, so I wasn&#x27;t terribly worried about the sensitivity and gum discomfort mentioned on the packaging and in some of the reviews I had read. These whitestrips did make my teeth and gums feel somewhat sore after the first two or three uses, but after that I experienced very little discomfort. The strips stick pretty well and if you don&#x27;t have a busy schedule, wearing them for two hours isn&#x27;t an issue. While these strips don&#x27;t provide the quite same quality you&#x27;d get out of a professional dental whitening procedure, it&#x27;s still a great, inexpensive alternative to achieve a brighter smile. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my experience and would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had my teeth professionally whitened, so not sure how that compares. I love about these, that they actually stay on your teeth the entire time. They are thin and comfortable. On the downside, they left my teeth very very sensitive for days. And the white wasn&#x27;t as white as I had hoped. However, I have been drinking coffee my whole life and I DEFINITELY see a difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d notice my teeth had become quite yellow, and I was getting self-conscious about it. I bought these white strips, and OMG. I loved the result. The strips made them the perfect shade of white, and I got many compliments on them(my teeth). I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, I never did, but these strips did cause a lot of discomfort for me. At first it&#x27;s just little spots in your teeth that get pangs everyone once in a while during use, but as you continue to use the strips, it gets more painful and lasts longer. I personally think the results are worth it though. I&#x27;d only recommend these strips for people with non-sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> It might be my fault, since I haven&#x27;t been using them as regularly as I should, but I feel like the whitening wasn&#x27;t that drastic.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I&#x27;ve never used any sort of whitening strips before. I bought the highest power ones available thinking they&#x27;d give me the best results. So far, I&#x27;m 5 days into the treatment and while I do see some improvement, it&#x27;s not as much as I anticipated. 2 hours is a long time to wear them, but I&#x27;ve managed to find the time. I did notice a bit of sensitivity after the 2nd strip, but I haven&#x27;t had any since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did run into issues with 2 of my strips though where the plastic backing was separating from the gel on the bottom strip. This has been occurring within 15-20 mins of putting them on. I called Crest and they&#x27;re sending me replacements and have said this isn&#x27;t a common issue. Don&#x27;t know why this is occurring, but hopefully it&#x27;s just an isolated instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product does seem to be working. I may have just had unrealistic expectations for how well they&#x27;d work.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It seriously works! I will be purchasing this regularly for touchups (from Amazon, they have the best prices on this stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Makes teeth WHITE after one use, as described.&lt;br /&gt;-Two hours a day for one week for long lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Hurts my teeth, they became extremely sensitive but you can&#x27;t get a rainbow without a little rain, right?</li>
    <li> To start with.....WAY LESS EXPENSIVE at Amazon tha any place I shopped (including sales).&lt;br /&gt;I recently quit smoking cigarettes and had some nasty tobacco stains. The strips did not turn my teeth into some pearly whites, which I&#x27;ve never had, but I now have nice white teeth instead of teeth wearing hat grayish/yellow mask! Boosts your self esteem too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the strips would be good, but be careful when using these. I couldn&#x27;t go beyond one strip because I accidentally had it touch parts of my gums as well, which result in extreme irritation (gums burned and started bleeding later on) and I couldn&#x27;t gather the courage to try the second one. Having these on for 2 hours is not a joke. So either be careful by having it cover only your teeth or work your way up gradually on these products by going with the half hour one first and seeing how your teeth and gums react to it. Once you&#x27;re used to that one, then try to work your way up. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Good product, but pricey.</li>
    <li> Best strips on the market.  2 hours and your teeth are super white and it lasts for months.</li>
    <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments on these. only thing i hate is the 2 hr thing cause it can be a pain</li>
    <li> Man these strips do the trick.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the sensitivity, but I guess all peoples teeth are different.  Definitely got stunning effects and will buy this line again in a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally one that&#x27;s wary of negative reviews, but I probably should have listened to some of the negative ones on here. My teeth are killing me so bad that they woke me up in the middle of the night. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to be able to continue the whitening treatment. The only reason I gave it two stars is that one usage did whiten my teeth noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Tried using it again, this time my teeth were a little less sensitive, but they still hurt. It&#x27;s a shame this product is so painful to use, but it does work. Upgraded my rating from 2 to 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I used these strip for the first time last night for 2 hours. I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity at all and my teeth felt good after use. This morning I woke up with severe pain in every tooth that the strips came into contact with that worsened as the day went on. This pain wasn&#x27;t a sensitivity to breathing in air or cold things, it was a deep aching pain. I read that you could use an oral analgesic with Benzocaine (get it at CVS)to help relive this pain...it worked for a few minutes and then no matter how much I put on the pain wouldn&#x27;t go away. I am going to discontinue use until the pain stops and restart after I&#x27;ve used a Sensodyne toothpaste not only to brush my teeth but also put a layer of the paste on my teeth for 30mins a day to see if that helps with the next time I apply them. I&#x27;ll update with my results.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips will noticeably whiten your teeth.  The biggest down side is how long you have to wear the strips.  I personally found 2-hours to be too long of a period of time.  Although this product sticks well to your teeth (actually EXTREMELY well - they are sometimes difficult to peel off) you cannot eat or drink while wearing them and speaking, without sounding like you have a lisp, is a bit difficult.  I found myself dreading putting them on my teeth because I knew that I was really limited on what I was able to constructively do.  What I eventually did was put them on before going to bed and then I&#x27;d set the alarm clock to wake up 2-hrs later so I could remove them - again, not very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding whitening ability - they definitely work well but there is some sensitivity with this product.  When this occurred, I would simply skip a day or two before resuming use.  Although I&#x27;m certain the longevity of the whitening power is dependent on a variety of factors - I personally found that my teeth have not needed any touch-up and it has been over 6-months since I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the time to dedicate to wear these whitening strips - I&#x27;d highly recommend them.  If you&#x27;re like me and every minute counts - I suspect you&#x27;ll prefer a product that doesn&#x27;t have to be worn for such a long duration.  The 30-minute products worked better for my schedule (even though it takes longer to get the same whitening impact).</li>
    <li> it does not work, so i do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Les résultats ne sont pas spectaculaire, je ne recommande pas l&#x27;achat de ce produit.</li>
    <li> I love crest. Their products are always quality and always work great. It was time consuming but it worked well.</li>
    <li> Amaaaaazing it&#x27;s work very good .. I have a white teeth after I used only 3 whitestrips .. i love it</li>
    <li> Did not notice a big difference with this although the other crest white strips work just great. I think you really need to use longer than a  few days</li>
    <li> My teeth were nearly brown from  smoking and drinking coffee daily. After using 4 strips daily the stain completely disappeared. My .teeth are completely white. Its been a month and the stains haven&#x27;t reappearing. If you want dramatic results for your teeth i recommend using 3D white intensive professional effects.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled! I had decades of coffee/tea/cola stains and took tetracycline as a child.  I&#x27;d been told by a dentist that my teeth couldn&#x27;t be whitened. I had tried other strengths of  Whitestrips with no results but I decided to give these a try since they appear to be the strongest OTC treatment available.  The difference in my teeth is stunning.  I did not go paperwhite but my teeth are now pale ivory instead of a strong brownish yellow.  I plan to do another treatment with these to see if i can get even whiter but I already have gone from an embarrassing smile to a pretty smile.  An important word about sensitivity DO NOT brush your teeth before using!!!! Do use a sensitivity tooth paste for a couple of weeks before use and do take Ibuprophen or Advil 15 minutes before use.  People are not playing when they complain about sensitivity issues!  This is a strong treatment and it will cause you pain if you don&#x27;t take preventative measures.  Based on the dramatic results its definitely worth the discomfort.</li>
    <li> These worked however that is as good a thing as I can say for them. These made my teeth ache. I had to get sesnodyne and use it for days before the pain went away. I literally could not breath through my mouth as the cool air made my teeth feel like sparks were burning a cross them. Obviously this version of the whitestrips was much too strong for me. It may work well for others but it was far too painful for me to ever use again.</li>
    <li> This worlked well and did get my teeth whiter, but I was expecting given the two hour legth that I was going to see exceptional results, I saw good results. Several shades lighter but after a two hour period of not being able to eat or drink and stabbing pains going through my teeth I was thinking pearly white, instead it was just pretty darn white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said they actually refunded me my money for the product relativly easily and I plan to buy another kit with it because I believe two will get me to the point I want. But my teeth are whiter than ever right now. Only 4 stars cause I have to do It again, the pain is managable.</li>
    <li> I used this 7-day treatment in the week leading up to my wedding, and the results were phenomenal. I have rather white teeth anyway, but they just *popped* after using this product! I&#x27;ve used the Crest whitening strips before, but I think it was a 20-day treatment. That one also worked well, but when you need it done fast, this one is better. The whiteness of my teeth improved my whole appearance, and looked so great in our wedding pictures. I have a great dentist who always offers whitening services, but why would I? This does the same thing, faster, and WAY cheaper. I will always stick with Crest whitening products.</li>
    <li> When you first take these off after the 2 hours, you can definitely tell there is a difference in the shade of your teeth, however this difference seems to fade fairly quickly and becomes a bit less noticeable within a few hours.  Still would recommend it as it does work and these strips seem to be getting better and better.  Really sticks to your teeth which is nice, although wearing for 2 hours is difficult partially just for finding the time where you won&#x27;t eat or be in public for those two hours and also because it becomes somewhat uncomfortable having these in your mouth for that long.  All in all I will use again though.</li>
    <li> you cant beat crest for and teeth whitning product, these seam to work well, helps keep your Ivorys looking good</li>
    <li> Use this product only as described orherwise you can hurt your gums. But, when you use these as said they work great. I love my teeth now. They look white but natural. I will use them again.</li>
    <li> If you keep it on for two hours prepare to not sleep for twenty four hours because the pain and sensitivity is so bad you won&#x27;t be able to do anything but focus on how uncomfortable you are.</li>
    <li> great product!!, working as expected!!asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd as dasda das asd asdasd asd asd asd</li>
    <li> I do not know what is going on!  7 white strips and 2 of them were already dry by the time I opened up to use (no I did not leave them out for a long time- like 10 seconds only)!  Plus, I wonder if I even need to use total 7 of them to get a significant result!  Bump!  My teeth are whiter ( a little bit) with only 3 strips!  Crest what happened? I am totally disappoint!</li>
    <li> The best whitening product Ive ever tried.  Including the one from the dentist. Need only one strip for weeks of whitening power.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because when I went for my 6 month cleaning my dental hygenist suggested I use this product.  She told me that this is just as good as what dentist offices have.  I went to Walmart to purchase this product and they wanted almost $60.00 for it.  So I decided to search for it on Amazon.com and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  The price I paid for it is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product 3 days ago and I instantly noticed the difference in my teeth.  Not only did I notice the difference, but other people noticed it too.  I have 4 more days to go and I am pleased already.  Just follow the instructions and you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensative gums, but this product did not bother my gums at all.  Just place the strips in  your mouth for 2 hours for 7 days and bam..you will see the results really quickly.  It also advise you not to brush your teeth right before you use this product.  You should only use this product once every 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me you will not be disappointed if you purchase this product.  I received it exactly when the seller said I would receive it.  Great Product with Great Results!</li>
    <li> Only lightened about 2 shades. Fortunately there was no pain or anything like other reviewers mentioned. The difference in price and the 2 hour time frame is not worth it. Had the same results with the lesser Crest whiteners</li>
    <li> After one use, my girlfriend asked me if I had been whitening my teeth (I didn&#x27;t tell her that I had started using these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 3 strips so far, and there is already a significant difference in my teeth.</li>
    <li> It really whitens teeth.  My son&#x27;s teeth were noticably whiter and now the whole family wants to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used crest whitening products before and have never had problems with them hurting my teeth until now. This product brings major pain to my teeth after using it.</li>
    <li> It helped to make my teethed whiter...but not as white I I thought they would be.  Everyone is different, so give it it a try</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for me, I could barely notice a difference after 7 days...</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips in the past but never the ones that are this effective (i.e. ones you wear an hour or 30 min and have to use more often for results).&lt;br /&gt;After one use I did indeed see results, truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 2 hours is a loooong time. If you are like me and most people who use these, you salivate uncontrollably throughout the duration of the treatment. Needless to say, the two hours were not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER experienced teeth sensitivity before in my life, even after using other white strips, but these are a different story. After removing them after 2 hours, I experienced shooting nerve type pain in a tooth. I wake up the next morning and many teeth are sore (decently uncomfortable small throbbing pain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the slobbering for 2 hours and teeth sensitivity worth it? Eh, I guess a little for the effects. Works, but side effects not enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Okay, to start off, I am a 21 year old college student with sensitive teeth and I am currently on the 3rd day of this treatment out of 7 but have gotten such good results, I am willing to review now! My teeth weren&#x27;t yellow, but they weren&#x27;t pearly whites either. I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds at a dentist office nor did I want to spend weeks whitening my teeth. My teeth are sensitive so I was a bit wary, but decided to go with it because I wanted intense whitening in the least time necessary. I&#x27;m currently on Spring Break so the 2 hour dedication is not an issue, hehe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the first time I did the treatment, I did not experience any pangs of pain much to my surprise and when those boring two hours ended, I was shocked: my teeth were noticeably whiter! I was excited! Now for a few hours after, my teeth were more sensitive to the cold and even air rattled my teeth&#x27;s nerves a bit. Second day, I experienced a little more sensitivity after the treatment but my teeth were once again whitened. Today is my third day and I just finished my third session. Now this time, I experienced one occurrence of shooting pain in my lower left canine tooth. Ouch. That was it though. My teeth are currently more sensitive but nothing extreme. My teeth are far whiter than when I started and I am loving it! I&#x27;m actually tempted to stop here, hehe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, as I stated, I have sensitive teeth but the sensitivity this treatment has accentuated on my teeth has not been major. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to teeth sensitivity, but it&#x27;s more of my method of dealing with sensitivity: I use FLUORIDE mouthwash (from Crest; it tastes delicious and has no burn) and let my sensitive teeth &#x27;soak&#x27; in the solution. Meaning I don&#x27;t &#x27;swish swish spit&#x27;, I just keep it in my mouth until my sensitivity goes away. I think this thoroughly kills whatever is ailing my teeth and allows my gums to heal. The thing about teeth sensitivity is that it&#x27;s due to the dentin tubules (whichlie under the enamel) being exposed. So your dentin nerves could be exposed due to receding gums or even worn down enamel. In my case, I think it&#x27;s receding gums so I do what I can to encourage my nerves to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I use fluoride mouthwash; fluoride makes the dentin less permeable, hardens the enamel, and allows the gums to regenerate. Teeth whitening can soften your enamel a bit so harden it back up with some fluoride. Don&#x27;t brush your teeth immediately after whitening, but a mouthwash should do your mouth some good without any mechanical abrasion on your teeth. Basically, before and after whitening, do what you can to put your teeth in prime condition and the sensitivity should be lessened. You could use sensodyne and maybe even some pain relievers, but personally, I prefer to rid the source of the pain rather than suppress the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure you do not get these strips on your gums! Hydrogen peroxide is cytotoxic meaning it&#x27;s toxic to cells and you&#x27;re wearing this for two hours! Protect those gums otherwise you&#x27;re going to give your teeth a reason to give you more hell when you&#x27;re whitening along with aching gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be updating this review in four days. :D</li>
    <li> This product seems to work on my teeth. I will purchase this product again in about 4 to 6 months unless something better is out by then.</li>
    <li> It was my first time trying Whitening Strips. After a research of all Crest Whitening strips on their official site, choose to use Intensive Professional Effects, read few reviews they said it works but hurts so much. I thought my teeth are not sensitive, and i was willing to see \\&quot;big results\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, they do nit stick that well to ur teeth!!! After first application, i thought they do not hurt, but after 3 hours they started to hurt so bad!!! OMG, felt so much pain. I didnt want to waste 56USD + shipment fee, so i applied it the day after next and next! From 7 strips, i used 5 and I stopped it! It kind of work, but not that well and most importantly the result lasts not so long as well.</li>
    <li> Crest Whitestrips noticeably whitened my teeth just in time for my wedding. My husband has always used these whitening trays that he got from the dentist. I think these work much better, are easier to put in and are definitely cheaper. They&#x27;ve come a long way since the first \\&quot;strip\\&quot; teeth whiteners. These actually adhere to your teeth. When I took them off it was like pulling tape off of them or something. This made it (a little) easier to talk and less annoying to wear. However, the wear time on these was a little ridiculous. 2 hours. Which doesn&#x27;t seem that bad, but it&#x27;s a little annoying not being able to snack on anything, talk properly, smile or smoke for 2 hours. Also, they made my teeth really,really sensitive. And, I&#x27;ve had regular sensitivity before, but this was much worse. It was like a shock of pain through the tooth and up your gums. Almost like a mini lightening bolt. And it wasn&#x27;t just after the strip. It would hurt just randomly throughout the day. Ultimately a good product and great for use for a special event. But, beware the hyper sensitive teeth and having to set aside 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I just buy these once a year and they keep all the deep stains away. I am a heavy tea drinker. My mother even has me ship these to her in England as you cant get these over there. My husband has also used them and he was very impressed. My teeth do get a little sensative after using them so I generally use them when I need a boost. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Efficient from the first application. Went from a dark yellow to white.&lt;br /&gt;It does cause extreme sensitivity. I used only 4 on a row and then every other day.</li>
    <li> I used this strips for two times i got a good result  but its painfull. I dont know if it happend to all or just because i have sensetive teeth. I will never try to put these again</li>
    <li> Works great!  Very impressed with the results.  Works as advertised.  I could tell a difference after the first use and with each successive use.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Crest White Strips, dentist supplied trays and just about anything else you can do at home to whiten teeth, and none of they have come close to being as effective. These strips really do stay on better than any of their other brands. In fact it takes a little more effort to get them off than I expected. Like all strips it can be a bit tricky to get them lined up, but once they are, they are there for the duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues are two fold:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, It is amazing to me that an information sheet can have as little information as this one does. They cheaped out and have what appears to be a single sheet for all of their products, and that&#x27;s far from ideal. Nothing, for example, discusses whether they should be worn 7 days in a row or spaced out. Under the circumstances that&#x27;s useful information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is that they really did make my teeth a bit uncomfortable the next day. They weren&#x27;t so uncomfortable that I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink, but I did notice the sensation. As a result there was no way I was going to use them 7 days in a row. That&#x27;s not something that was unexpected, having read reviews, but considering it&#x27;s a 7 day product that is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked them, and I&#x27;d use them again, but it would be nice if they&#x27;d address the instruction issue at a minimum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the amount of whitening accomplished, as well as the lack of side effects. My teeth went from deep yellow to a pleasing, natural looking off-white. The only issue I had was that 2 of the 7 bottom strips didn&#x27;t adhere properly.  Crest could solve this problem (and get 5 stars from me) by including a spare strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit smoking a few months ago, so I figured now would be a good time to remove over a decade&#x27;s worth of tar stains from my teeth. I picked up a box (not from Amazon, though I should have checked here first, Amazon&#x27;s price is much lower) and applied all 7 strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first few treatments I was concerned, because the whitening initially seemed uneven. The tips of my teeth were getting much whiter than the bases, and I was getting the bright white spots other reviewers complain about. Fortunately, by the 5th treatment the unevenness went away, and the white spots seem to fade about 12 hours after each treatment. I also noticed that my teeth continued to grow lighter even after the strips were removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced minor gum pain and very minor tooth sensitivity after the 6th and 7th treatments. Neither was a problem, in fact the tooth sensitivity I wouldn&#x27;t even describe as painful, just an odd feeling. I would occasionally experience some mild nausea due to the chemical taste of the strips, but it was fleeting and easily ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/7 of the bottom strips didn&#x27;t adhere to my teeth properly. During my 1st treatment, the bottom strip fell off after about an hour. During my 7th treatment the bottom strip only adhered to my lower bicuspids, sliding around on my front teeth. I had to hold it in place with my tong. This problem could be solved by Crest including an extra envelope of strips in the package, or maybe an envelope of two extra lower strips as they seem to be subject to more saliva and stress, and therefor more likely to fail.</li>
    <li> I dont know so many people could dealt this pain. I have used other crest white strips in the past with no problem, so i thought I would be able to handle these ones. but in this case it has been about 3 hours of extreme pain. Ive taken advil and used plently of orajel solution with no help. I cant even imagine using the other white strips in the box. if you are considering buying these just make you are ready.</li>
    <li> I thought for the price that it would whiten more than it did.  I was a little disappointed with this product.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It whitens.  But, I don&#x27;t think it works as well as I thought it would.  Followed all directions and saw minimal results.</li>
    <li> The product arrived okay  except there were small squares cut out of both ends  of the packaging... very strange.  At first I thought it was the UPC codes that were cut out,  as there&#x27;s a rebate on right now... but the UPC code was intact on the back...&lt;br /&gt;Despite the package issues,  the strips were included and fine... haven&#x27;t used them yet...</li>
    <li> I had to stop using them at the third packet since i started to get some tooth sensitivity.  But I could see a fair amount of whitening in the few days i did use them. I will finish the pack, but maybe do it once a month from now on.</li>
    <li> AGONY. PAIN. PAIN. Agony! Never ending agony! It feels like 20 drills to the teeth and at the same time the sensation of someone taking their nails across a chalkboard. Sensodyne doesn&#x27;t help much. NSAIDs don&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to suffer unlike you have ever suffered before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are my teeth whiter? I don&#x27;t know...I can&#x27;t see colors anymore it hurts so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You were warned.</li>
    <li> Great outcome and well worth the price. I have used Crest white strips before and will continue to use them. I feel this is the most white my teeth have ever been and i am very happy with the outcome.  I did notice some sensitivity but used sesodyne tooth paste and was fine the whole time. my mouth was a little comfortable but not bad enough to even come close to causing me to stop. I have a co worker who did the first strip and waited to use sensodyne. she noticed a huge difference as soon as she brushed her teeth. MAKE SURE TO GET SENSODYNE. A small tube will suffice.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my teeth were yellowish, I neglected them when I was younger and wish I wouldn&#x27;t have. But anyway first day I seen a great difference. I did have sensitivity but it was minor pain for a couple hours after I took it off. But some people I know have had horrible pain, I guess its different for everyone. Some tips I have is to dry your teeth before you apply it, and it will stick way better. My first time it did slide a little bit and my saliva seemed to attack it. So once you dry your teeth it stays on WAY better. You&#x27;re allowed to drink water but no food. After you take the peels off there will be residue stuck on your teeth, I just took my toothbrush and brushed it off with some water. And dont brush your teeth before you put these on. The fluoride blocks some of it from working.</li>
    <li> For ppl who have had trouble whitening there teeth using other whitening products this is the one for you, Its so much cheaper here on amazon too! You might feel a little tooth sensitivity the first two times you use em but you get over it. This results are amazing my teeth have never been whiter!</li>
    <li> It was good, but I really wanted more whitening.  I take very good care of my teeth and feel my teeth were not that yellow to begin with.</li>
    <li> [This is only my first day with them so I might update this later.]&lt;br /&gt;What it says on the box is true-I really did notice results within the first use! However, about 30 minutes into the 2 hours I started experiencing short, stabbing pains every once in a while on random teeth. It&#x27;s been 3 hours and they are finally gone, but they were definitely painful! So far, this is an okay product, and I can&#x27;t wait to see the final result.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these kits to use for a family member and myself.  One treatment cause intense tooth pain. This pain began towards the end of treatment and we removed the strips immediately.  Even after using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth it took about 24 hours for the pain to subside. One package was returned.  If I could return the open box I would.  Won&#x27;t use again.  Not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had level 3 and level four and was surprised how ineffective these were considering the cost.  Not sure if I would purchase again</li>
    <li> These worked really well for me. After the first strip I noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used four strips so far and my teeth are now the colour I want them to be.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never been sensitive before but after the first application I noticed a dull ache where I had the strips. The pain went away about 20 hours later. Also, I would sometimes get a short sharp pain on random teeth during the treatments but it was bearable for me.&lt;br /&gt;A little tip before putting the strips on is to dry your teeth and make sure there is no saliva when applying. Doing this made them stick on my teeth more securely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend these for an easy way to whiten teeth at home.</li>
    <li> It worked as it said, in only one week you can have, as they said &amp;#34;professional effects&amp;#34;, would buy it again</li>
    <li> I have tried this product several times. It really works my teeth look worth a million dollars. Now my mom and sister uses the product</li>
    <li> Key Items:&lt;br /&gt;-This specific product was highly recommended to me by my dentist, who is highly regarded in the dental/academic field. Otherwise I would not have tried it (or teeth whitening).&lt;br /&gt;-Even if you experience great results after three or four applications, make sure to follow through or the results will reverse sooner than usual.&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of people in reviews complain of the discomfort this causes while also mentioning they whiten every couple months. Yikes! Box clearly states it should be used only once a year, so be careful if you go for more!&lt;br /&gt;-Box says to do this in seven days straight. From my experience, if you experience some discomfort after one session, just wait a couple days between and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story: I was initially hesitant to try whitening strips again, as my experience with early OTC versions were quite painful. After discussing with my dentist, he clarified that much of the discomfort could have been because I was still in my teens and my enamel was not fully developed and that the products. Since I used smoke and was getting implants he said I should do one course to get my teeth less yellow and I should be set with a nicer tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a few days of the treatment my teeth were significantly less yellow so I didn&#x27;t complete the full set. Mistake, as the effects started reversing. After going through the entire pack the results are much more permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in a great and much, much better than my previous experiences with whitening strips. Would recommend; as with all products, reasonable use should provide reasonable results!</li>
    <li> I have tried all KINDS of bleachers - even professional services &amp; these work the BEST! you can rarely find them in the stores, because they are always sold out - so just get them here!</li>
    <li> The effects temporary.  Your teeth will appear white during its application, but it will rapidly fad after use.</li>
    <li> My teeth became noticeably whiter after the full treatment, but only by a shade or two. The 3D toothpaste seems to work well in preserving the whiteness gained.</li>
    <li> These work great.  People have to realize that your teeth may not be bright white the first time, depending on how discolored your teeth are.  You may have to do it again to get the results you want and maintain oral hygiene, especially if you eat, drink or smoke stuff that discolors you teeth.  They are maintenance, not a miracle.</li>
    <li> I really like these white strips, and thought they whitened pretty good, but had trouble getting them to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; for the required amount of time.  I tried to dry my teeth with a tissue but still had trouble making them stick.</li>
    <li> I use this product about once every 6 months to keep my teeth white.  I have not experienced the sensitivity that many people have been describing.  I guess we are all different, so I would suggest you still try the product first.  It definitely whitens your teeth.  I&#x27;ve always had a terrible yellow tinge to my teeth and this really helps lighten them.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you might not have dazzling white teeth after using the product, but you will definitely notice an improvement.  At least I do.</li>
    <li> Did as expected Noticed deference after first strip application.</li>
    <li> When used as directed, these strips truly work.  I take great pride and care of my teeth and gums and desire VERY white teeth.  By comparison, they work better than bleach trays and are more convenient.  Great for touching up too, but do not wear longer than suggested as this is highly likely to cause sensitivity and discomfort.  However, no pain, no gain: when using peroxide/bleach on your teeth, it will not be effective unless it penetrates the enamel and comes into contact with the nerves within your teeth.  As with any nerve or muscle you exercise, it will be sore until you&#x27;ve adjusted to the treatment side effects but be well worth your effort.  Smile &amp; thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I NEVER write reviews. As I sit here, content as ever, ready to purchase my second box just to have for the future, I thought, well shoot, I really should tell people how freaking amazing these strips are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: My entire family noticed the difference. My teeth were stained, past off-white and more on the yellowish-white scale, front not as bad, worse on the sides. My teeth now are just about perfect, close to being a solid white in the front and hardly any trace of yellow on the sides. Overall, my smile looks effing fabulous. Everytime I look in the mirror, I&#x27;m amazed. And I still can&#x27;t believe how ridiculously quick, easy and cheap it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it: This was my first time using any kind of teeth strips. It was extremely easy to apply. Just peel and stick. I was afraid of my saliva getting in the way, so as reinforcement, I wiped my teeth with tissue to make sure the surface was completely dry before I stuck them on. It goes on like tape, and stays that way for the entire 2 hours. No discomfort AT ALL. I had it on while I exercised and did chores around the house. Drank water, talked on the phone, even went to Trader Joe&#x27;s with them on. They&#x27;re hardly noticeable. As for sensitivity, my gums felt slightly tender but that went away by next morning. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth issues so this obviously might differ for those who do, in which case, I would suggest apply every other day, or perhaps cut the strips thinner so you don&#x27;t get so much of it on your gums. Easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 of 5: If only these strips came in sizes. I&#x27;d order extra long to cover more teeth. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2\\&quot; with a pretty normal mouth and they cover up to my first premolars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second box is on its way, weeeee :)</li>
    <li> What are the pros and cons of using a white strip that you wear for two hours instead of 30 minutes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, supposedly it makes your teeth whiter faster, I don&#x27;t know if it worked faster for me, because I couldn&#x27;t use them every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day one was okay, but after the second usage my teeth had such extreme sensitivity, I skipped a couple days so they could recover, then I did more, and so on until I did the whole bunch. I never got that problem with the 30 minute ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can drink water while wearing them, so that is good, but it is still sometimes hard to find a two hour block where you&#x27;re not going out, going to eat, or want to have a conversation where you don&#x27;t want to talk with a slur. I think the 30 minute variety will be more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they will whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> This really works. I thought about it for a while since I thought it was too expensive, but finally figured that if it worked, it was worth it. It does work and it is great. Proctor and Gamble score again.</li>
    <li> WOW, these work great !!!!</li>
    <li> The product was not sensitive on my teeth! How you ask? Make sure u dont fold it under your teeth ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had my teeth professionally whitened, but this product did wonders for me. I used them twice a day instead of once a day for a week to shorten the time since I had a 3 day weekend (the instructions say you can do this.) Four hours a day is a looooong time though. A couple of times I had to take them off early because they hurt so bad and it was uncomfortable. I actually only used 6 out of 7 because after the 6th one my gums were hurting too bad to do another one. So if you have sensitive gums this may not be your best option. I couldn&#x27;t brush the front of my teeth during the duration of applying or for a couple of days after I stopped (I only brushed the back teeth, the toothpaste and the toothbrush touching my front gums hurt. The pain wasn&#x27;t unbearable for me though, so I probably would do it again later because I saw results after the first application. Much cheaper than going to a dentist.</li>
    <li> This is pretty easy to apply and wear.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me unless I have a meeting or something where I need to talk a lot.  It didn&#x27;t bother my gums.  It did make my teeth a bit whiter but not a lot.  Maybe if I repeated it for a while with several boxes and applications it would be noticeable to others as well.</li>
    <li> Left giant white spots on my teeth! Worried they won&#x27;t go away! I read on the package that the white spots would dissappear in a matter of hours, but it&#x27;s a week later and they&#x27;re still here! I was trying to whiten them for an event in a week or so, now I&#x27;m scared to open my mouth!</li>
    <li> bought this teeth whitening for my middle daughter as she was complaining that her teeth were a bit yellowish.&lt;br /&gt;Its now a month and she says that she can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth incredibly white. probably good as the dentist office whitening. But the downfall was that the whiteness only lasted for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a teeth whitening fanatic.  I had personal trays made from my dentist, and spent some hefty money for them.  I&#x27;ve used both Crest and Opalescence (15%), and in my opinion these work just as well, if not better. Any brand of whitening is going to make your teeth sensitive, that is normal.  Typically you leave trays/ strips on for an hour, and I didn&#x27;t realize that you have to leave these for 2 hours! That is the only reason I don&#x27;t like these as much as the other Crest Whitestrips---they make your teeth extra sensitive after that amount of time.  However, I have found that by using Sensodyne toothpaste (recommended by my dentist) that the sensitivity is certainly dulled.</li>
    <li> Ok, I know it&#x27;s very tempting to read the GOOD reviews, because we all want to have a good experience, hence why we avoid reading the bad reviews. That is what i did, and I want to save you from wasting your hard earned money. 1. 5 percent peroxide will not give you very white teeth, it may just make a slight difference, if you want actuall teeth whitenning, you HAVE to try the products amazon sells that contain over 10% hydrogen peroxide. 2. There IS NO money back gurantee! I called the company and the only thing they MAY do is send you another box of this worthless product or a card which you can ONLY use to purchase other products from the same company! 3. My experience was totally dissapointing...now i have to actually buy a product that actually works, something which contains at least 10% peroxide or more.</li>
    <li> Stick with the regular professional effects.</li>
    <li> I purchased these white strips to use before my wedding. I figured if I was going to whiten my teeth, I might as well get the best and most expensive and effective ones. Bad idea. While these worked on my top teeth, they hardly did anything for my bottom teeth, and I couldn&#x27;t get them to adhere to my teeth very well. Anotehr issue was that I couldn&#x27;t get the gel inbetween my teeth, so they look much yellower on the sides. My biggest complaint about these was that, not only does it take 2 hours of your day to wear these suckers (I just put them on on my way to the gym, worked out, and took them off when I got home), but it is so horribly painful several hours later and it lasts days. The first night I used these I couldn&#x27;t sleep and ibuprofen wasn&#x27;t touching it, and for some reason, my skin was incredibly hypersensitive every time I used these. But I will say that the first day is the worst and it continues to get better. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anybody. The cons certainly outweigh the pros.</li>
    <li> This newest version of Crest Whitestrips is awesome! I have used the Crest Professional Effects in the past with really good results, but the Intensive Professional Effects exceeded my expectations. I noticed results the very first day, and by the last treatment my teeth were very white. These truely do have the most whitening power. I also like the fact that the whole process only takes 7 days instead of 14 like the others. The strips have to stay on for 2 hours, which can feel a little long, but its a small price to pay for the great results!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !!! IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY CENT. Had sensitivity as it stated I would....but it dissipated within a couple of days. I have already ordered another 7 days....then will just go to ocasional touch ups.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product.  I&#x27;ve used this product before and get compliments all the time on how white my teeth are. I always order from Amazon.com because the price is good and delivery fast.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my teeth after using them. They may have lightened my teeth 2 shades max but it&#x27;s not noticeable enough to make much difference.</li>
    <li> This product really works. It does hurt your teeth but the results are well worth the pain. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and the product is amazing</li>
    <li> To give a little context, I&#x27;m late 20&#x27;s and an avid coffee drinker. -- This product definitely works! I knew I&#x27;d see results but I didn&#x27;t anticipate seeing them so quickly. I just finished up day two and my teeth are already as white as I&#x27;d hoped they would be at the end! I&#x27;m really impressed and pleased with these whitening strips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They DO make my teeth hurt a bit. It&#x27;s not unbearable but it&#x27;s definitely unpleasant. Ultimately, the results I&#x27;m seeing are worth it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy this product again and I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Crest 3D White Strips Advanced Vivid before and found that it didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth as much as I liked, so I tried this one. It&#x27;s only been a day but I already see a noticeable difference in the shade of my teeth, so I&#x27;m excited to see how the results are after finishing a week&#x27;s worth of whitening. The setback is the fact that you have to wear it for 2 hours, but I found that it&#x27;s really not that bothersome compared to the Advanced Vivid white strips, which are thicker and feel heavier in your mouth. It kind of made my teeth sensitive after but it&#x27;s not that bad as I thought. I recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative to a professional whitening at the dentist.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 3D white strips intensive pro effects so that my teeth could be a bit whiter for my upcoming wedding.  I had been procrastinating doing it, so I chose the intensive strips instead of the 14-day, 30 min strips so that it could be done by the time my wedding came, despite the many reviews that said this product was bad if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I want to say that I am SO glad I bought it on Amazon...my local grocery-type store was selling the same thing for $60.  As for the sensitivity, for me it was VERY mild.  I felt some sensitivity to cold, and a couple of my teeth felt a little sensitive when I&#x27;d wake up in the morning (I used the strips at night before bed), but to call it excruciating, as other have, would be a gross exaggeration. I guess others have more sensitive teeth than I do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely started seeing results after the 2nd day of use, and my teeth look much whiter after having done all 7 days.  Any sensitivity I felt was definitely worth it, because I&#x27;m very happy with my results.  I took photos each day after taking the strips off, and I can really see the transition from yellowish to white. Any sensitivity that the strips caused is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the worst part of using the strips (which no one else seems to be bothered by), was just wearing the strips. Having them on my teeth just got uncomfortable after awhile, and I started to go a little crazy every night with 45 minutes to go. There was no pain or anything, it just felt really annoying to have them on my teeth.  When the 2-hour timer I set each night went off, I&#x27;d run to get them off of me! The discomfort really is worth it, though, because my teeth look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary for TLDR: Works well, a little sensitivity to cold things, uncomfortable, can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price, totally worth it.</li>
    <li> So this stuff REALLY whitens your teeth. After 1 use, I saw a difference, and after 3 I saw a HUGE difference. It didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth while they were on my teeth, it was the next day that I&#x27;d be in a ton of pain. Ibuprophen or Tylenol seemed to help, and if you use Sensodyne toothpaste for a few weeks prior to using the strips, that helps too. I also had to start spacing it out, so I would only whiten once a week or so.</li>
    <li> ehh.. not to noticable</li>
    <li> Just what i expected, i quit smoking And already did 2 times The whitening teeth and Was  expensive.  With The crest stripes my simple its just perfect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of whitening products over time and never got the results I was looking for. I am a regular coffee drinker, so my teeth were pretty yellow, even with regular care. Although these strips will make your teeth temporarily sensitive (goes away within a day after using them), they are well worth your time, as I went from yellow to almost paper white in the 7 days it takes. Make the investment and use them- you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I also switched over to the crest pro-health toothpaste to maintain the effect and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> It made my teether VERY sensitive to the point that I could no longer finish using all of the strips.</li>
    <li> Best ever. That&#x27;s the type of product which u get its benefits, exactly as written on their advertisements. Thank you</li>
    <li> works well but slightly underwhelmed with the results....considering the price..I was expectiong alot more. But still less than a visit to the dentist</li>
    <li> I am on day 6 of these and there is a very noticeable difference. As for the pain, seriously I didn&#x27;t experience anything. A little twinge here and there but that&#x27;s it. Nothing worse than the 2 years with braces I went through.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth you have to cut the strips in half horizontally so that the strip doesn&#x27;t touch the ends of your teeth. They def work but after 6 months I feel like I could benefit from another round even though it says results last a year</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t review products, but I thought it would be worth it to review these. I have always had good oral hygiene, but honestly I don&#x27;t go to the dentist like I should for regular cleanings. I drink a few cups of coffee every day and could see the effect on my teeth. After using the crest white strips I have seen a huge improvement. My teeth are incredibly whiter and I am very happy with the results. I also use the crest whitening mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the strips for 7 days straight. In fact, I still have 2 or 3 treatments left to go, but I am very happy with the results thus far. I read a lot of reviews that people complained of sensitivity and I was afraid of this. I followed some of the other reviews and did not experience the sensitivity. I cut the strips to fit my teeth exactly (didn&#x27;t let them overlap and didn&#x27;t have to fold them under my teeth). When I was done the two hour treatment and took the strips off, I rinsed with hot super salty water and then brushed with sensodine toothpaste 1 or 2 times after. I would definitely recommend these if you are looking to whiten your teeth for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive to teeth whitening. Before trying the intensive professional effects strips, I have tried the regular, 30 minute strips and accidentally fell asleep for a few hours... BIG mistake. My teeth KILLED just from inhaling air and every little noise gave me that nails on a chalk board feeling. But, I figured out how to avoid this entirely: compare the size of the strip to your teeth and cut the strip so it&#x27;s just a little bigger (to go over a little bit of gums) and when you apply the strip, make sure it is placed just to the end of your teeth, and do not fold over! Trust me, this will work!</li>
    <li> Before I say anything else: These work. The whitening results are real, fast, and quite astonishing actually.&lt;br /&gt;The problem, for me, began on day three. The sensitivity which accompanied the 2-hour white strip application stopped going away after a few hours. My teeth began hurting so bad, that I began having headaches. In fact, on day 5 I had to stop the system just to try to sleep. Even then, the pain continued for several more days.&lt;br /&gt;It is an interesting trade-off, though. The results are amazing, so just like many other things in beauty, it really is up to you to decide whether you can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 5 stars because it does what it says and warns you of the sensitivity issue. Anyone who would like such aggressive whitening in so little time should expect some pain.&lt;br /&gt;If you have more time, though, a less intense system may be for you. Crest does a great job with these products and there are a myriad other options for you.</li>
    <li> Used them and followed directions and kept them in for 2 hours.  Cannot tell any difference in color of teeth.  Expensive for no results.</li>
    <li> it didnt work for me, maybe because i could&#x27;t use them 7 days on a row because my teeth hurt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m laying here on my bed almost in tears. It&#x27;s 5.30am and I haven&#x27;t had a wink of sleep. This is not worth the pain. I&#x27;ve taken panadol and nope, not working at all. This is by far the most painful, irritating product. Yeah, you&#x27;re teeth may look a tad whiter but it&#x27;s definitely not worth this tortue. And trust me I&#x27;m all about whiter teeth. I had to write a review cause I just could not imagine anyone else going through what I am now. So upset and angry.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.  They stick wonderfully to the teeth and don&#x27;t froth or slip and slide like most other white strips.  They&#x27;re comfortable enough to wear for two hours.  They DID make my teeth sensitive, but used in conjunction with sensodyne rapid relief it was manageable.  I found that the sensitivity acted up a few hours after I used the strips, not during.  I also used them every other day (instead of every day) to help with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue I had with the strips is that the bottom one is so narrow and doesn&#x27;t cover all the teeth that are exposed when I smile.  Funny, because it says they have widened the strip - I&#x27;d hate to see how little it covered before!  To deal with this problem I only used 6 days worth of strips and cut one up to cover the bottom teeth that would have otherwise been left untouched on the other days.  Kind of annoying, but I really didn&#x27;t need all 7 days anyway.  This product works very well to whiten - as well as the professional treatments I&#x27;ve had done - and with less hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried their express whitening about a year ago and was in excruciating pain from it - and I don&#x27;t normally have sensitivity issues with my teeth.  This product is much better.</li>
    <li> Works great but WOW my teeth hurt while I use them. I get compliments all the time though on how white my teeth are. Pain goes away after a week but while I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s incredibly painful.</li>
    <li> they work  not as much as i would of liked but they are good they do hurts your teeth a bit</li>
    <li> Most highly recommend these strips! Instant white after the first application! Does make your teeth a bit sensitive, but such a small price to pay (literally and figuratively). Will be recommending and ordering from this seller again. Thanks so much~</li>
    <li> Lets be honest, Crest makes great stuff, but I expected this to be above and beyond as far as white strips go...the truth is, they worked great, I just expected they&#x27;d work just a tiny bit better, that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those familiar with how the strips work, there isn&#x27;t much more to add...they DO work--but in my honest opinion, they don&#x27;t work any better than the cheap version a family member had originally purchased at Walmart a few months back--at at MUCH more discounted price. It pains me to say and admit this, but if I&#x27;m being honest, then yes, its true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Crest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Whitestrips for several years and have found these to be the quickest and most effective of them all. My teeth have a tendency to be somewhat sensitive however using this product made them only slightly more sensitive. I found the 2 hour commitment to be challenging but kept reminding myself it was only for 7 days. The end results were amazing! Friends and family can&#x27;t help but notice my bright, white smile. I use these once a year to keep my teeth looking brilliant and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> My teeth were significantly less yellow after the seven treatments.  Only time will tell how long the effects last.  Happy so far after three weeks.</li>
    <li> It is a really great product. In order to see results, use as directed and not haphazardly. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Pros: only a week, works really well&lt;br /&gt;Cons: makes teeth super sensitive, have to use 2 hrs/day so takes up quite a bit of time</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m a believer! This product works hands down for a whiter, brighter smile that&#x27;ll make anyone want to smile just for the hell of it.</li>
    <li> I paid Hundreds of dollars for professional whitening and could have saved a lot of money if I would have chosen Crest 3D White Strips FIRST!  The results were fabulous and the price was great!</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of the Crest whitestrips, but have always used the 30 min twice a day product. This is the first time using the Intensive 2 hour ones. I dont have problem using them for 2 hours first thing in the morning, after a shower. The issue is SEVERE sensitivity! I do not otherwise have sensitive teeth, but Oh EM GEE, after using it for 2 hours, 2 days in a row, my teeth were SOO sensitive it literally hurt when air touched them!  I had to skip 2 days to let my teeth stop hurting, and I am back to using them for an hour to 90 mins each day, hoping I can build back up to get a 2 hour use out of some of them before they are gone. I definatey will not buy these again. I will stick with the 30 mins jobbies.</li>
    <li> I did two consecutive rounds of these, and I&#x27;m honestly not sure how well they worked, as I didn&#x27;t take &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With two rounds I was hoping for that insanely white look you sometimes see on people -- so white it&#x27;s blue.  I didn&#x27;t get that effect at all.  I notice a marginal difference.  I pressed the strips on pretty firmly, so I&#x27;m wondering if that perhaps pushed the gel out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started a round of the 20 count Crest strips and I&#x27;m going to be more careful not to push the gel away from the surface of the teeth.  Hopefully by the end of those I&#x27;ll have the &amp;#34;Ross Geller&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> These work very well even from the first use.  The only downside is they made my lower teeth hurt like crazy afterwards on the first day, but not the top.  So now I am just sticking with whitening my top teeth...</li>
    <li> I could see results after one use- super white. I will definitely be buying and using these again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great item and fantastic results. I used according to the directions and saw results very quickly. Awesome teeth cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard crest is the best for whitening teeth. So I bought this kind. I had a coupon and I can get a rebate so why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and noticed a difference. My teeth do look whiter.&lt;br /&gt;However, my teeth became very sensitive. At random periods throughout the day, I would get a zing of pain in some of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to that, I am noticed white spots all over my teeth. They are super white spots around less white enamel. Definitely noticeable in a good light.&lt;br /&gt;The fit was okay. It kept sliding on my bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is very difficult to peel the strip off your teeth. Its like peeling duct tape off something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid to try the second round because of the pain and I don&#x27;t know if the spots will be more noticeable.</li>
    <li> Pretty much said it in the title. Really is painful. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with whiteners before, but this hurt. Also, the results are not as exclaimed. I should have known better than to spend this money.</li>
    <li> Please do urself a favor and do not use crest 3d whitestrips. I was ready for a teeth sensitivity, because i used crest 3d before, but i thought i can get thro this... Do it for a whiter smile. But OMG, i was so wrooong! After first use i did not saw any difference and its&#x27;s almost 1am i can&#x27;t sleep because of this pain. HORRIBLE PAIN! Never again.</li>
    <li> I am a bit skeptical by nature, but wanted to give this a try since I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are getting a bit yellow (I&#x27;m a coffee drinker, age 35).  I figured with the good reviews and decent price here on Amazon, it&#x27;s worth a try.  I was a bit scared with the severe sensitivity some people have experienced because I have super sensitive teeth. The day I ordered (two days before it arrived) I started using Colgate sensitive pro-relief toothpaste that my dentist gave me.  I&#x27;m on day 6 right now and have had very minimal discomfort and have noticed quite a difference in my teeth color.  There is some slight marbling on my front two teeth, but I expect it to go away (it&#x27;s not that bad).  My teeth aren&#x27;t glowing white, but I don&#x27;t like the fake white teeth look anyway.  I&#x27;m very happy with my results so far and would gladly recommend this to people - just use a desensitizing toothpaste at least twice a day!</li>
    <li> I use this product once per year and find that provided I also care for my teeth in the meantime the whiteness is retained</li>
    <li> These whitening strips whiten VERY well, even after using just the first strip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Dry your teeth and gums off very well beforehand so that the strips will easily stick to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel some tooth sensitivity, but it was bearable because I didn&#x27;t use them every single day.  I did feel a very sharp pain the first day I used them, but it quickly went away and didn&#x27;t return, thank goodness.  I would recommend using one every two or three days.  Just be patient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY pleased with the overall results, and I cannot see how my teeth can be any whiter than they are now!</li>
    <li> The good part is that these strips are excellent at whitening teeth and stay on quite well.  Also, they don&#x27;t leak all over you mouth or taste too bad as some other strips do.  After one use I notice much whiter teeth, which is why I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars instead of 1.  The problem with them, though, is that after using just one strip for 2 hours, I feel like I had major dental work done.  My teeth HURT!  Not the dull ache I&#x27;ve had before with other whitening strips that was tolerable, but a very intense tooth ache.  I can&#x27;t even open my mouth because air hitting my teeth is so painful.  I read other reviews about the pain but I didn&#x27;t realize they meant pain like this, the kind of pain that Vicodin does not take away.  I will not be using the rest of the box and will be taking Crest up on their money back guarantee.  Sometimes beauty is worth the pain, but definitely not this kind of pain!  Ouch!</li>
    <li> This product helped to remove SOME of the staining on my teeth which was most notably seen on my canines. Don&#x27;t expect to get blinding white teeth with this product but if you use as directed you should see some improvement. I&#x27;ve never been able to see a noticable difference with the strips I&#x27;ve tried in the past to if you&#x27;re in the same boat, then this may provide some results for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only CAUTION would be to make sure that you pre-medicate yourself with ibuprofen and then continue to take every 4-6 hours as needed when using this product. My teeth weren&#x27;t sensitive while the strips were on my teeth but within an hour or so of removing the strips I was aching like crazy.</li>
    <li> They made my teeth about 1 shade (maybe 2) lighter..... But the sensitive teeth that followed after each application was horrible at times.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. The result is indeed visible, but doesn&#x27;t really last long.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to use with other whitening product, like toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good buy for an inexpensive way to brighten your smile. Very easy to apply strips that do not feel intrusive. It is a 7 day treatment but it took me about 12 days to complete the process. Skipped a day here and there due to not having 2 hours available for each treatment. My teeth still came out noticeably whiter. Not sure how long results will last Burt will probably buy again if I need to whiten my teeth again.</li>
    <li> I have just received my package, and although I am not going to use the strips until July when I go to New York, I am stoked to have them here already. My mom ordered these exact Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 7 Count last year, and they work PERFECTLY. I usually use these strips when I have a big event coming up, like last year I had my graduation and I wanted my teeth to be at their prettiest. And they were! The effects of these white strips lasts years. Back in 2009, I had also used Crest whitening strips, back then they were the ones that you have to put on for 30 minutes and my teeth stayed white, and the whiteness didn&#x27;t fade at all. Even though my teeth are still white, I like to keep them up to date, especially if I will be having an important event in my life, or just to feel more self-confident. I get a lot of compliments on my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these white strips February 28th, 2014, it has been shipped to my US address March 7th, 2014, and then has been shipped again to the Post Office on my island on March 10th, 2014. March 12th, 2014 I got an email from my Post Office saying I could pick it up a day later, and so I did today on March 13th, 2014. The teeth whitening box was sealed with special, thick plastic to ensure it&#x27;s safety and it arrived 100% safely to my island. I am very happy and cannot wait to whiten my teeth again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Crest!</li>
    <li> Seriously though, these whitening strips are amazing. Yes, two hours was a long amount of time to wear them. However, they stuck to my teeth very well while I did other things.  It was totally worth it. If I had to guess how many shades my teeth whitened, I would say 3-4. They are shining now! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. One tiny tiny flaw is that it does make your teeth a bit sensitive. But I&#x27;d rather do 2 hours for 7 days then go to a dentist or do half an hour for two or more weeks.  Quick results, 100% satisfaction! :D</li>
    <li> I have pretty severely stained teeth, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. However, these did remove a brown spot on a tooth that I&#x27;ve had for years. They also whitened my front 4 or so teeth to the point that I&#x27;m much more confident about my smile. The only issue was I experienced severe sensitivity and had to stop use after 4 treatments; I plan to use the rest of the strips in 6 ms. Still, if your teeth ate not severely stained and/or if you were able to use all the strips, I would expect very good results. Overall, I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product once, for 2 hours.  It left white spots on my teeth.  Afraid to use it again.</li>
    <li> My teeth were stained by my love for coffee and they were beginning to turn a lovely shade of yellow.  I ordered the 7 day two hour treatment with Crest 3d and it did the job.  I could see a significant difference after only three days.  I did not feel any significant  discomfort using the strips for 7 consecutive nights and leaving them in place for at least the two hour limit.  Crest recommends not brushing your teeth before applying the strips, but i would suggest using hot water and your tooth brush and scrub your teeth (no tooth paste) just to remove any junk.  Also, I suggest putting the bottom strip on first before any saliva begins flowing to the bottom of your mouth.  Now I&#x27;m using the 20 day 1/2 hour strips just for maintenance.  You get your money&#x27;s worth, especially through Amazon.</li>
    <li> These white strips do not work, I used the entire box , brushed with sensodyne toothpaste to stop the pain during the bleaching, called proctor and gamble for a refund</li>
    <li> Two hours &amp; two days of tooth pain. What the heck is that!?! It&#x27;s a whitening strip not major teeth surgery!  The longest I will where them is one hour to avoid tooth pain. As for the whitening it&#x27;s average but perhaps because I can&#x27;t handle wearing them for too long. Not certain I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is  by far the best thing I ever used for hygiene and beauty for my teeth. I saw clear results from the first use. For the sake of honesty, during usage after the first hour my teeth becam a bit sensitive and I felt some electric shocks in my teeth, but with a small dosage of pain killers the pain will stop and flash your glamour.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for - if you want to bleach your teeth go to a dentist or just get veneers or something</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m only day two and so far I notice my teeth are whiter. I was worried about the sensitivity and so far, it&#x27;s not bad.  I&#x27;m hoping there is a big difference when I am done</li>
    <li> I have whitened my teeth over the last 20 years here and there and was very surprised that these did not give me the look that was promised.  They are worth $50 or so, but if you really want the white look they promise you will be disappointed.  The look does not compare to a one hour ZOOM treatment.  On the plus side, they are very easy to use, and I even slept in them overnight hoping for a whiter look.  No discomfort at all</li>
    <li> You can not beat the price for what it compares to in the store. I noticed that it did whiten quite well and had others tell me that my teeth looked great, without telling them that I had whitened them. I do not know if it is equivalent to a $500 professional treatment as I don&#x27;t have the money to spend on that kind of service but I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This worked well with my teeth. Made my teeth really white.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, excellent item</li>
    <li> My teeth are not very straight but with a little work I got all the teeth and edges covered. After the two hours on the first application,  I was surprised that there was a noticeable difference. The strips stayed in place even on crooked teeth and did not hurt my gums or teeth after. Adding the 3 D toothpaste I have had several compliments on my smile. My teeth were very stained with coffee. I don&#x27;t smoke but I do love my coffee. I only used two treatments at first. I did another treatment to keep the white a month later. I chose this product because it sounded like I might be able to get good results and I am pleased I have. My daughter uses the strips to keep her dentists treatment white before her wedding in a month. I have suggested this product to other people. I have ordered more for my daughter and future touch ups.</li>
    <li> I will admit it was hard to find 2 hours a day to do it.Probably would buy the professional effects next time i purchase it.It did whiten my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars because it did whiten my teeth better than any other over the counter product. Really I would give this 3.5 stars but that isn&#x27;t an option. I have never gotten a professional teeth whitening but from what I see and hear the pro treatment makes your teeth super white. These did make them whiter, and maybe if I bought another pack and whitened again it would whiten even more idk. Also it did hurt my lower teeth really bad, and I had a lot of dental work\braces as a kid so I&#x27;m used to mouth pain, and this hurt really bad when I whitened twice a day. So only use once a day.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth got maybe a shade or two whiter, nothing magical. But I didn&#x27;t follow directions to a tee either.  After 3 consecutive days, I couldn&#x27;t do another strip, I needed a day of no whitening. I had to take breaks between strips, I couldn&#x27;t do 7 days in a row. I did 6 of the 7 strips over a 2 week period, and after the 6th set my teeth were so sensitive that now I am a little afraid to put the 7th set on.</li>
    <li> And were definitely cheaper online than they were even at the local Walmart.  Also, they didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth the way the lower intensity ones end up doing, which I found surprising.</li>
    <li> Its a great product, It should be a little better by making your teeth clear white and staying like that for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but these strips really were very effective and I was able to see a whitening effect in a few days.  They are comfortable to wear.  I buy a box to use immediately after going for my 6-month dental check-up.  To me, these strips are more effective after a professional cleaning than before.  I plan to buy another set for my next check-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once for seven days and it seems to work well.  I&#x27;m not fond of having to sit with it for two hours a day but if it works for six months or more I&#x27;d try it again.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t Finish then only went three days because teeth became way too sensitive towards everything even when simply breathing... This is ridiculous</li>
    <li> I CAN ALWAYS KNOW I HAVE A BACKUP PLAN IF I NEED MY TEETH WHITENED, EVERYONE WILL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE AND COMPLIMENT ON YOUR NEW BEAUTIFUL WHITE TEETH. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT 100% !!</li>
    <li> I was depressed about my teeth. Not that they were horrible, but I still noticed their yellowing. I drink a LOT of coffee, and although I brush often 3 times a day, they were still stained. I was saving up my pennies to get my teeth professionally done. Because I didn&#x27;t want them white as in healthy, I wanted them white as in what you see in magazines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a conference coming up where I&#x27;d meet a bunch of new people, ran out of time to deal with a bleaching appt. and these were brand-spanking new last Spring. They got my attention because I like 3D toothpaste... AND they were miss-marked then (the stock boy confused it with a cheaper version, so I had to go to Customer Service to get it at the promised price. They&#x27;d since then fixed it), so they were 20 dollars cheaper than you see here. (They&#x27;re worth $50, but that&#x27;s a lot of money to spend if you&#x27;re not positive about it like I am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just hoping to whiten them a shade or two. I didn&#x27;t expect that after two hours they&#x27;d make THAT good of difference! I&#x27;m talking they were WHITE. And that was just the first time. It was insane how well these worked, and because you can drink with them on--I&#x27;ve tested that claim--they&#x27;re not so bad to give 2 hours to. My husband never even realizes when I&#x27;m wearing them because unlike trays, I can talk on the phone with it on, drink, smile, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I didn&#x27;t use them more than four days in a row and then I just staggered it out, touching up once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only peice of MUST HAVE advice is this: Before you use this for a 2+ days in a row, stop using 3d white toothpaste and use sensodyne or some other toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth and use that for 1+ week before using this product. Because it starts to hurt. A lot. That means it&#x27;s really getting those deep-down stains, but you&#x27;re going to want to quit early. So, keep Sensitive-tooth toothpaste on hand, it will save you a lot of toothache. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, don&#x27;t think of it as \\&quot;Wow. It costs $50!?\\&quot; Think of it as, \\&quot;Wow, it ONLY costs $50, because I will not actually have to go in and get them bleached professionally now! Huzzah!\\&quot;on&#x27;t think of it as \\&quot;Wow. It costs $50!?\\&quot; Think of it as, \\&quot;Wow, it ONLY costs $50, because I will not actually have to go in and get them bleached professionally now! Huzzah!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I saw the instant effect on my teeth after one use. My teeth obviously whitened 2-3 shades in just a span of 2 hours. I could imagine how white my teeth would be if I continue using the whole box for 7 consecutive days. However, it made my teeth sensitive for the next 24 hours that&#x27;s why I have to use the product every 2 days or sometimes I use the Crest 3D White professional Effects 20 Count, the next day, then switching back to the Crest 3D Intensive professional effects, the next...A little &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; there but really tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regularly use the Crest 3D White Vivid Toothpaste and the Crest 3D White Mouthrinse as well. Maybe that&#x27;s why the whitening effect is really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I&#x27;d recommend this to those who want to brighten their smile for just a reasonable amount of dollars. Just be ready for the teeth sensitivity part....</li>
    <li> These work great and will whiten your smile, however if you have sensitive teeth i highly recommend using a toothpaste like sensodyne for two weeks before trying these or you will be in pain.</li>
    <li> Well it is quite painful and the teeth look whiter for about a week.. So that maybe for some people it works but again just another good sales pitch</li>
    <li> These strips work great for whitening but just be careful not to leave them on for longer than an hour and a half or so as they made my teeth extremely sensitive to the cold, actually just air in general.  If you are looking for a quick teeth whitening fix though these strips work.</li>
    <li> I received my crest white stips and opened the box only to find the upper strips and none of the lower strips!! How could you sell something that you say is new and then only have half of thr items in the box! Very dissapointed!</li>
    <li> It was okay. I used the strips for 3 days but my gums became agitated and began to bleed. So I stopped using them. It had some effect, but only lasted for  small period of time. This is just a temporary fix. Go to the dentist to get who&#x27;re teeth</li>
    <li> I thought a first these worked well but the whitening did not last long even if you use the recommended toothpaste. Oh well I am disapointed in this product. Very expensive also.</li>
    <li> Great to be able to buy them and have them sent to Australia</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t detect visible results, and caused my teeth to feel sore after directed use.</li>
    <li> these work good, zing on your teeth for a day and then sensitivity goes away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 of the strips in the past 3 days and can see a big difference.  I have not experienced any sensitivity.  Product arrived SUPER FAST!!!</li>
    <li> Noticed a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth. However I prefer the 20 day Professional Effects treatment that I used before cuz my teeth got a bit sensitive.</li>
    <li> Best results after one use.</li>
    <li> After my first use I noticed a huge difference. I took pictures of my teeth every day and cant believe the diiference this has made.</li>
    <li> I used these whitestrips for 7 days, 2 hours as stated, and they did not provide the whitening I was expecting for 60 dollars.  Luckily, they offer a guarantee and I took advantage of the money back offer by sending in the UPC and receipt.  My teeth were so sensitive on the 3rd day of use, I could not even eat without excruciating pain.  Don&#x27;t buy these, stick with the 30 minute versions.  They whiten better anyways.</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job. I have used it only two days and I can see a difference. Only after two times my teeth became noticeably whiter. However, after one hour of using these strips I have strong toothache that lasts for 20 hours. I want to continue to use these strips but I am afraid of a toothache which I already experienced.</li>
    <li> Instructions say to leave on for TOO LONG. (I think it&#x27;s two hours!).  Not realistic.&lt;br /&gt;Better to get the 1/2 hour ones, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on effectiveness - we never use it!  Takes too long :)</li>
    <li> This is the best teeth whitening product I have used. Now I keep my next one ready to use in a few months. Why spend more at the fdentist when this gives the whitest teeth.</li>
    <li> I got these earlier today and after one 2 hour treatment, I see a noticeable difference. These definitely work. Like a few people said however, it does greatly increase tooth sensitivity during use and for an hour or so afterwards, but totally worth it in my opinion. Make sure to use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth while you use this product, it should help :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just finished my fourth treatment and my teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive. I had sensitivity after my first three treatments, but it&#x27;s way worse today. These still get 5 stars, because they do dramatically whiten your teeth, however if you have sensitive teeth BE VERY MINDFUL while using this product. It is recommended that you do not brush your teeth or use mouthwash a couple hours before using these because it will increase irritation. My advice would be to brush with a desensitizing toothpaste (toothpaste for sensitive teeth, like sensodyne) after you finish a treatment to help reduce sensitivity. I also read that it is okay to use them every other day if the sensitivity and/or irritation becomes too much to bare. I&#x27;m thinking I will spread out my last three treatments over the next 6 days. Still overall very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Let me do this wery easy and fast for you.  1 it hurts. 2 dont work.  3 lost money .  Dont belive evrything that u see on youtube , this dont work for evrybody so use the money in somthing els. I shold had used the money one itunes And spotify  not this.</li>
    <li> It might look like quite a steal, being a $60, 7-day teeth whitener, but it is DEFINITELY not worth it. I used it just as directed for the first night I was on these strips. I put them on for the 2 hours right before I went to bed. Took them off, brushed my teeth, teeth felt a little sensitive, but didn&#x27;t think anything of it and went to sleep. About 2 1/2 hours into my sleep, I woke up due to EXTREME teeth sensitivity and pain. I&#x27;ve never had teeth sensitivity problems before. The pain was so bad I couldn&#x27;t even go back to sleep because it hurt so much. I even had to take a Tylenol (and I&#x27;m not one to take medication easily either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care for your teeth, I suggest to try the 30-min interval white strips if you&#x27;re going to use these. I don&#x27;t care what they say about these 2-hour strips not damaging your enamel. That tooth sensitivity is excruciating and will most likely cause some kind of enamel damage in the LONG run. Nothing that is beneficial for your teeth, should feel like it&#x27;s wearing down your enamel and cause you a lot of pain. That&#x27;s just not natural. It&#x27;s been about 12 hours since the pain started and I&#x27;m still in uncomfortable pain. Even though other customers may say 1-2 days of pain is normal, I just don&#x27;t think that is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever use white strips again, I&#x27;m going for the 30-min interval ones that you go through at a slower pace. I have used those before and they worked fine for me then. But I HIGHLY suggest you don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> These strips do whiten effectively, but they are not more effective than Crest&#x27;s Level 4 Professional Effects strips, which I&#x27;ve used in the past. I definitely recommend those instead, as they are cheaper and only need to be worn for 30 minutes per day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t drink a lot of dark sodas or coffee, but still at 20 years old natural staining is normal. I wanted to whiten my teeth but wasn&#x27;t looking forward to the bill that would come with getting them done professionally. I did a bit of research online to find out what brands worked best and decided on Crest. I have only used 3 strips so far, and the results are incredible! They have removed any stains that were there and whitened on top of that. The only issue I have had with them is that even though I don&#x27;t believe I have sensitive teeth, I find that the day after using them I have trouble drinking extremely cold beverages as it is slightly painful. Because of that I have been using them every few days so far but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be negatively effecting the results in the slightest. One thing to note is that I have been using them in conjunction with Crest 3D White toothpaste and Crest 3D White Glamorous White mouthwash, so that may be adding to the effect. Also once a week I brush with baking soda to remove surface stains when they spring up. All together it seems to be doing wonders for my teeth, and my self esteem. Absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a whiter smile!</li>
    <li> I had tried these a few years ago and i had sensitivity in my teeth to the point of stopping use. However they have definitely improved their formula! I use sensitive toothpaste on a daily basis since my teeth are naturally sensitive, however, these actually caused to extra problem. i was very pleased with the results. They didnt come with their own color chart, however i had a chart from another product i had tried in the past. They definitely whitened my teeth six, almost seven shades! Thank you CREST</li>
    <li> My dentist tells me my teeth are already white, but I can clearly see yellowing, particularly near my gums.  This product did lighten my teeth a little, but not like others I have seen who look super white--maybe they are going to the dentist rather than trying at home.  So, it may be that my teeth just didn&#x27;t have enough yellow or dark areas for this to have made a significant difference.  For the price, I would have expected more.  I gave it a 3 because it was easy to use and I did see a little result.</li>
    <li> BEST TEETH WHITENING STRIPS THAT EXIST!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I saw noticeable results after two days. I wore them while I slept and they stayed in tact with my teeth.</li>
    <li> I used the product for the required time and saw slight whitening.  I expected a more dramatic result based on the Crest promises.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Intensive Professional strips.  I have had an expensive treatment from my dentist and these Crest strips are much better. The results were 2X-3X for a fraction of the cost.  As others have noted, it will make your teeth more sensitive but the results are definitely worth it.  I will be using these strips every 6 months as the results were amazing for me.</li>
    <li> easy to work with.  i would def order form this shipper again.  The item came as specified in description ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if its my teeth but this is probably the most expensive and the least effective whitener I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> It works but it really bothered me while I had them in my mouth. I would recommend the longer period treatments if your time allows for it.</li>
    <li> It made my teeth so sensitive that I couldnt put it on every day as I was suppose to so that may have had an affect on the outcome. I have never had a problem with sensitivity before. It whitened my teeth some (by that I mean very little) but just was not what I expected.  I do have to say they were easy to wear as long as you had them on correctly. They covered my entire smile. I had used a product by crest several years ago, it was a brush on overnight gel that worked extremely well, so that&#x27;s what I am comparing the strips too. One would think for a MUCH more expensive product it would have worked better. The reason I am giving it only 2 stars is based on the outcome. Comfort, fit, and how well they stayed on were all a pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Crest 3D Strips after reading a handful of reviews.  I have previously used the weaker versions and was fairly happy with the results.  I wanted to intensify the results and therefore purchased the &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; strength version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one application, my teeth are definitely whiter.  Also, it was a day before my teeth became sensitive and a bit achy.  I have resolved to use the strips every-other-day and continue brushing with an anti-sensitivity toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are a little tougher than the original product I&#x27;ve been accustomed to purchasing--which is wonderful! They stay on very well, especially for the two hour duration (I slept).  This also makes it easier to apply the strips right below the gum line so your gums are not affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product; definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It get my teeth cleaned really good, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that its really a lot of money for just 7 strips. Also if you have just a LITTLE saliva in your mouth the strips like to slid off when your trying to put them on. Other than that, its still good. :)</li>
    <li> I too myself had crazy thoughts of yanking my teeth out of my mouth after the first application, due to the intensity of the after wards pain, BUT I have discovered a way to completely avoid it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*cut the strips so that they do not fold over the edges of your teeth, because this is where the pain will be coming from due to the thin enamel.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*while using this product, I highly recommend purchasing \\&quot;Thera Dent\\&quot; teeth desensitizing oral wash and use it through out the entire week you whiten your teeth with these strong Whitestrips. This mouthwash will put minerals back into your teeth that the strips may weaken.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Brush your teeth with a toothpaste created for sensitive teeth during the days you whiten. Toothpaste must contain 5% potassium nitrate and fluoride.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*try holding a warm concentrated table salt and water solution in your mouth right after removing the strips.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did all of this today and I did not experience ANY discomfort or sensitivity on my teeth. So this method WORKS!!!! &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 5 stars after finding a way around the problems is can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!!</li>
    <li> THIS REVIEW IS FOR: INTENSIVE PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS TEETH WHITENING STRIPS, 7 COUNT (rated as the strongest Crest strip available over the counter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am posting my experience with the Intensive Professional Effects White strips as it is extreme, but may help others. First off my teeth were very neglected: 25 years of smoking (up to 2 packs a day), with no polishing or whitening before this experience. I stopped smoking 3 years ago and have been using the Crest 3-D (also with peroxide) mouth wash, and the Crest 3-D toothpaste. My teeth were a decent light yellow, though not too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USED 6 (SIX) BOXES of the Intensive Professional Effects White strips over 10 days, 42 strips in total. i did as many as 5 strips in one day. I left them all on for 2 hours as directed, which is very easy. They really stay put, even allowing you to drink and talk normally I even wore them out into public--no one can tell if you don&#x27;t smile. The most dramatic whitening was after the first two boxes, but my teeth did get whiter and whiter, though more slowly, with each strip. By the last 6th box, the effect was getting less and less. My teeth have come out very, very pale light yellow tinted ivory with white highlights in sunlight, but often look much whiter under artificial light. Under warmer (non full spectrum) fluorescent lights, or under incandescent light, or overcast sunlight in the shade, my teeth can look almost white-white. I feel MUCH more better--worlds better!--about smiling now and showing my teeth. These strips do make a difference, even if you only use one box rather than going for white-white broke like I did...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience a little bit of tooth and gum sensitivity, but VERY minor indeed. Usually with very hot (soup) and very cold foods (ice cream). Also on the days I did 4-5 strips, my gums would be indeed upset after the 3rd strip (particularly if they were right in a row), but they calmed down immediately after the strip was removed. It&#x27;s been a few days since the last strip, and the negative sensitivity is almost completely gone. For a few days my Crest 3-D Mouth wash (also with hydrogen peroxide) would make my gums slightly speak up unhappily, but now even that is gone. I do seem to have a \\&quot;harder\\&quot; mouth, stronger enamel, than most, and am much less sensitive. But for sure--doing much more (6 boxes in 10 days!) than the recommend one box per year -did not increase my sensitivity issues at all. Even at doing 5 strips per day I kept expecting a little more pain or sensitivity issues, but they just never materialized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I can safely say that these strips are SAFE, even with heavy doses, much higher usage than Crest recommends. Again, I used 6 boxes (42 strips total) over 10 days. I am happy with the outcome, but again my teeth were moderately yellow, and while much better, they are not typing paper white even with this much strip usage. But they can look almost white at times and make me much more confident with my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. I got mine on sale, and with a coupon, for under $40 per box!)ed.

    <li> I don&#x27;t smoke, drink coffee or tea but have had nice yellow teeth for a long, long time.  As you can imagine it made me very self conscious about speaking, let alone smiling.  I was skeptical about this product but decided to try it since its cheaper than the dentist.  I am starting day 6 of the program and I&#x27;m beyond pleased at how white my teeth are now!! I am not a vain person but I have not been able to start staring at my teeth!!  I&#x27;m truly amazed with this product and definitely recommend those of you who are curious to give it a try.  I know there is a lot of talk about teeth sensitivity but I have not experienced any.  Two hours is pretty long but definitely for the results I got, I would do it again and again!!</li>
    <li> I really loved the Professional Effects level 5. I noticed a dramatic difference by the second day. I recommend buying sensitive toothpaste as your teeth will get very sensitive.</li>
    <li> So I read the other reviews on here talking about the pain caused my these strips and thought people were perhaps over exaggerating a bit.  THEY WERE NOT.  The first day there were a few zings here and there.  But the went away about two hours after I took the strips off.  The second day the pain was so bad I seriously thought it would feel better to take a hammer to my teeth.  It was so severe I had to call my dentist because I have never experienced tooth pain like this before.  The only remedy is sensodyne and ibuprofen.  It went away after 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT have sensitive teeth typically.  I can chew on ice then immediately drink something hot.  No problems at all in my life with sensitivity pain.  This was ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even say if the whiting aspect works because I only used it for two days.  If you choose to risk it, good luck to you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with the good. The advance seal no slip technology works very well. These things will stick to your teeth like masking tape to a window. Unfortunately that&#x27;s the only good thing I can say about them. The claim that they will whiten your teeth as well as a $500 professional treatment is a complete misrepresentation - at least in my experience. After wearing these for 14 hours I would estimate that they whitened my teeth 1 or 2 shades. They also whitened unevenly. There are a few spots on my teeth that are quite white (if the strips had worked as well all over I would have been very pleased) and those white spots have not gone away several days now after completing the course. Overall I&#x27;m disappointed and I will be invoking the satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - many reviewers have reported serious tooth sensitivity. I only experienced very mild sensitivity. In fact it was so mild that I was able to eat an ice cream cone immediately after removing them with no problems. I did, however, experience some fairly serious gum irritation, to the point were it was painful to brush my teeth. Maybe if my teeth had been more sensitive the product would have worked better. ;)</li>
    <li> these definitely work but i&#x27;m not so sure they didn&#x27;t make my tummy a little upset.  i was using the whole line of 3D from the mouth wash to the tooth paste and i think it gave me an ulcer or something.  it definitely works though.</li>
    <li> Was I amazed with the results I got? (see my result on product image  page)&lt;br /&gt;No, but I was satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it \\&quot;whiten as well as a $500 professional treatment?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about $500, but over a year ago I got deal for a teeth whitening on &#x27;Groupon dot com&#x27; that cost $120, and yes, it did do as good of a job as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the whiting, what other PROS did this product have?&lt;br /&gt;-Does not slip or slide on your teeth (As a matter a fact, I was able to comfortably wear them on my teeth while I was working out in the gym).&lt;br /&gt;-No weird taste&lt;br /&gt;-No residue after taking them off (I thought my teeth would feel sticky afterward, but they felt nice and clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the CONS&lt;br /&gt;-Made my teeth a lot more sensitive than usual (during and after wearing the strips).&lt;br /&gt;-Some pain. (Although I didn&#x27;t have it as bad as some other Amazon reviewers, it did give me some very sharp and intensive pains within the teth at random moment, which lasted for about 2 to 3 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;-Price. I do not think this should cost more than $25. (I think they should pay me for some of the pain though - just kidding, but not really).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Would I use it again?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, but not anytime soon, maybe in a year from now. (Let&#x27;s hope that by then Crest comes up with a product that produces these result without the pain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to an image of my results: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2T4HF5ELZ5TQG/B005TI7EWK/ref&#x3D;cm_ciu_images_pl_link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Crest denied my $ 10 rebate request because I used the amazon $7 coupon off. I guess they are just another company that screws over customer with the fine print. I&#x27;m taking away a star.</li>
    <li> I have used just about every whitening product Crest makes, expressly in the professional/vivid line. I like this &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; whitening level, two hour wearing period aside. They work, and the results last. This is my second box in the past few months, and I use as needed to maintain a natural whiteness.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I never thought i&#x27;d have these bright white teeth! The only down side was my teeth got really sensitive and i didn&#x27;t use them for 7 days straight but i think that&#x27;s because my teeth weren&#x27;t that bad for this strong whitener. So make sure you choose the right level for your teeth. And these are the cheapest i&#x27;ve seen them around, the cheapest i&#x27;ve seen were at least $60. So these are a steal!!</li>
    <li> I am posting under my husband&#x27;s account. 28 yr old, healthy female. I have never written a review for any product before, but I felt it important to let others know my experience (aka fiasco) with Crest 3d White Professional Effects (Level 5). I&#x27;m writing this not only to caution others, but also to attempt to keep me distracted from the pain I&#x27;m in at 5:00 am. I used the strips for the first time today as directed from 2-4 pm.  While the prospect of wearing them for 2 hrs daily 7 days a week seemed lengthy, I figured it would be well worth it to obtain a bright,beautiful smile. I have a healthy mouth, with no dental work or problems, except for minor stain. Previous to applying the strips,  I read the instruction booklet and understood that there would be the chance for sensitivity and discomfort from using this product. No biggie....I can deal.... Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While wearing the strips, I went about my daily chores for the day, and took them off at the 2 hr mark. I experienced no discomfort during this time and saw a difference already, even after this first application. I was pretty stoked! Movie star smile, here I come. Had I written this review right after removing the strips, I would have certainly given it full stars. However,  a few hours after using these strips, I experienced the WORST pain of my life. The pain in my teeth was excruciating. It felt (and still feels to a slightly lesser extent) as though I had my roots and nerves fully exposed, and someone was scraping them with an ice pick. I was just in tears. I popped Advil, with no relief. After hours of pacing around and wondering how I would get through the night, I had my husband take me to the ER , in hopes of getting some stronger pain meds. We went, and though I felt silly .. \\&quot;Yeah....I&#x27;m here because of some white strips I used..:\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t see any other option. I needed something stronger to obtain some relief. They gave me some meds and sent me on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now 5:20am and I&#x27;m experiencing slight relief FINALLY, and pray it only continues.  Please note...I certainly could have dealt with some minor discomfort and sensitivity, but this is a whole other ballgame, and I don&#x27;t feel that this product adequately expresses the intensity of the pain you MAY experience. Will everyone experience it? Certainly not. I&#x27;m aware that we all have different sensitivities, and many may find this product to be great! And great for them! I, however, felt it my duty to share my experience. If you&#x27;re still interested, I would suggest starting at a lower level, particularly if you know you have sensitive teeth. After tonight&#x27;s experience, I will NEVER use these strips again. It&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> Great shipping time. Awesome price compared to what you can get in stores! Made my teeth SO white just after the first two hour session! Did make my teeth a little sensitive. But I just cut the excess off instead of wrapping it around my teeth. My teeth never hurt again!</li>
    <li> Overall bottom line was my teeth whitened barely.  As a result of the whitening my teeth have become extremely sensitive as a result of the strips.  For the time and money you spend on these it would be better to just get them done by a dentist.</li>
    <li> Quick, effective results.  Much better than older versions I have tried and, yes, you can see results the first day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s and unfortunately have been drinking soda (mostly Coke) since elementary school. So I&#x27;m not sure if my stains are too intense or what but after two days of using these stripes I experienced intense pain in my teeth. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement after the first use as they boost, and overall my teeth aren&#x27;t whiter. I got these random patches of white but that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s worth a try but if you feel sensitivity after the first day (persisting into the next day) then definitely stop using them right away (believe me it hurts).</li>
    <li> Could see a big difference after using these strips. Not too bad wearing them for 2 hours but you did have to schedule  wearing them.</li>
    <li> I am an avid whitestrip user and these have the best results out there. For use once a year you get your money&#x27;s worth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done teeth whitening before and I was quite skeptical when I started out. I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t make a big difference, or the strips wouldn&#x27;t stay on, or it would be uncomfortable.  I was very surprised that I experienced none of these issues. There was some sensitivity towards the end but it went away pretty quickly and was not too painful. I definitely noticed a difference in shade and I was very pleased with the results. Now the only test will be how long the effects last.</li>
    <li> BELOW THIS IS MY INITIAL REVIEW, I&#x27;M CHOOSING TO EDIT IT BECAUSE YESTERDAY MORNING I WAS ON MY SIXTH TREATMENT (STRIP NUMBER 6) AND THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST EXCRUCIATING TEETH PAIN EVER!!! IT WAS NOT JUST ONE TOOTH IT WAS ALL OF THEM, MY BOTTOM TEETH WERE THROBBING IN PAIN, FOR THREE WHOLE HOURS.  I TRIED ORAL GEL, AND IT WAS TO NO AVAIL.  I HAD TO TAKE THREE OVER THE COUNTER ASPIRINS AND PASTE ON A THICK LAYER OF SENSODYNE TOOTH PASTE AND USE A CLOTH TO KEEP THE PASTE THERE OVER NIGHT.  THAT HELPED SOME.  I JUST WANT TO WARN EVERYONE,  WHEN YOU ARE WHITENING YOUR TEETH WITH ANY PRODUCT YOU ARE TAKING OF THE TOP LAYER OF YOUR TEETH WHICH MAKES THE ENAMEL WEAKER, YOUR TEETH MORE POROUS, WHICH LEADS TO NERVES (YOU CAN&#x27;T SEE THEM) BEING EXTREMELY SENSITIVE.  SO BASICALLY YOUR TEETH AND GUMS HURT LIKE COMPLETE HELL AFTERWARDS.  USE ANTI SENSITIVITY TOOTH PASTE...AND TAKE BREAKS~!!!!!!  DO NOT USE THEM EVERYDAY, EVEN IF YOU FEEL FINE, THE PAIN WILL CREEP UP ON YOU.  DONT BELIEVE ME?  THAN GOOGLE CREST WHITE STRIPS PAIN TREATMENT!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!  AND GOOD LUCK!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Crest White Strips back in the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have used the Crest 3d line but I have to say that the first treatment I used was amazing!  I saw visible results in just one use!  Since they have the advance seal technology they really do stay in place.  I drank water and spoke to people while using them just fine.  The box does not recommend that you brush your teeth before using them, I still brush my teeth before I use them, but I do it at least three hours before whitening.  So if you are going to brush your teeth before whitening I suggest you do the same.  Well,  today was my third treatment, and my boyfriend sees a big difference...he has been calling me bugs bunny lately (my teeth are big, and now they are extremely white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now everything has got its con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The MAKE TEETH EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, obviouslyresults may vary among people, but through my experience, I have been dealing with sharp piercing pain in my tooth, it happens about four times a day at random and last for litteraly one second.  But it hurts.  So why am I whitening?  Because I&#x27;ve been dying to wear red lipstick (MAC&#x27;s Ruby Woo) at work and if your teeth are yellow, red lipstick makes them look yellower and really noticeable.  SO I SUGGEST THAT AFTER WHITENING, YOU BUY AN ANTI-SENSITIVITY TOOTH PASTE like Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  When you have these things on you sound like Miley Cyrus, but without the country accent,  you just sound like you have some invisalign braces on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush your teeth with anti-sensitivity tooth paste after whitening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not even think about eating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush after drinking coffee!!!!!!! Can&#x27;t stress this enough, coffee is strong and responsible for stains!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiten for consecutive days, do not miss a treatment, *UNLESS* you have major sensitivity, skip a couple of days, and if you can&#x27;t stand it anymore, don&#x27;t use them anymore, just give them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(People are probably thinking the reason I&#x27;m experiencing sensitivity because I brush three hours before I whiten, either way your going to experience sensitivity...it may be minor for some, and major for others, unfortunately I experienced the major :-(  ).</li>
    <li> Just what it claimed. Very effective!&lt;br /&gt;Good value.&lt;br /&gt;Better than the number4 level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Welcome further offers.&lt;br /&gt;Hhan75&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
    <li> I used one set of strips in the morning and one in the evening as mentioned in the instructions. After only 3 1/2 days I was done and the results were amazing. (I could see much of the effect after 2-3 uses already.) I don&#x27;t think I ever had whiter teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also experienced the tooth sensitivity mentioned by other reviewers. However, it goes away quickly. (I think I was back to normal after a day or so after the last application.) The strips hold well and are not difficult to remove after the 2 hours are over. Overall, very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I have only worn mine for two days now, and my teeth are noticeably whiter. But they have made my teeth ache to the point of me being unable to sleep, eat, or drink. It turned my gums white and made them bleed. And even now, my teeth are throbbing so badly that it&#x27;s making me wince with pain.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both did this program and we were soooo impressed! I noticed a difference after just 1 treatment and continued to see better and better results. We will definitely do this program once a year. I was always self conscious about my yellow teeth, but not anymore.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to whiten my teeth with this product but ended up being very disappointed in the end. There was literally no change to the shade of my teeth. I would not recommend this product to anyone. the only advise I have is save your money!</li>
    <li> 2 hr. Dentist said these were the best. Use sensodyne toothpaste before and after for sensitivity. Works the best out of the entire line of products. Newer</li>
    <li> Excellent product with all meanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything before, but this was incredible. I&#x27;ve been in a car accident with a head injury and even that didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as this. I&#x27;ve finished my second strip, and I was armed with pain-relief (after experiencing the first one), but needed 6 panadeine ( SIX PANADEINE!) and couldn&#x27;t sleep all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are my nerves being damaged??? Because it certainly feels like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m (stupidly) going to try once more using painkillers, sensitivity toothpaste and mouthwash a few other suggestions made on this blog, because I do see a gradual whitening - I damn well betta have pearly whites by the end of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this experience it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Being a coffee, tea and red wine drinker, these white strips really whitened my teeth in 7 days.  I like the way they stick to your teeth so well too.  Regular white strips seem very flimsy and hard to keep in place compared to these.  I will definitely use them again.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I have my million dollar smile now for a few dollars. Recomend it to all.</li>
    <li> This product was worth the money spent. The two hour per day was not a problem as I did it when I was home and it was easy. I did not experience any gum sensitivity and started to see the difference the first time. After I finished the 7 days I did get complements on my teeth. However, it did not whiten as well as I thought it would. I was trying to avoid the expense of going to my dentist for this but I guess with the kind of results I would like that may be what is best.</li>
    <li> Very good product and less expensive than having a dentist doing it.  The best it did not irritate my gums.</li>
    <li> I have tried whitestrips before and have always been pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was no different. I used to use the strips that took a few weeks to complete, but the sensitivity (OHHH THE HORROR) was awful. I remember just wanting to rip my teeth out for a little relief.&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about trying this kind as it is an &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; version for 7 days, but i was in a pinch, and also hoping that i would be able to bear it for just a week. The sensitivity i had with these was much less than i did with the older version! I was very happy with that, and also how well the stuff sticks to your teeth and my teeth where so much whiter at the end! (i had become quite the coffee drinker so this was a lifesaver)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can manage the two hours a night i highly recommend this. I have to say it wasn&#x27;t to bad putting them on after dinner and just reading or watching tv for that week.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the whitening power, but cannot use them on consecutive days as they worsen my sensitivity. Very effective on yellowing.</li>
    <li> I used the professional effects before and noticed a huge difference. The intensive strips were just okay to me, I wasn&#x27;t amazed by the whitening they were just ok. I don&#x27;t know if this is because they were already white, but my opinion is that they didn&#x27;t do anything amazing. I read a lot of reviews before I bought this product and a lot of ppl said they were painful, I used sensodyne toothpaste a few days prior to using the strips and during therefore I had little to no discomfort and. I used the strips everyday. But I would say just use the regular professional strips I had great results and everyone complimented and noticed them, these not so much</li>
    <li> You MUSTTTT MUST MUST cut the strip so it is ONLY touching the front outside face of the teeth. DON&#x27;T tuck the rest in the back of the teeth as it says so in the instructions, because it will make your teeth feel extremely painful afterwards. I use this for 2 hours a day and i see the results gradually. My teeth are pretty white already but I just want SUPER WHITE glowing teeth...so i had to whiten it a lot. Don&#x27;t expect to get like super white teeth with this. I think it does come close though. I bought mine for about $38 on amazon when it was cheap, but now the price shot up again :( But I think I probably will buy this product again for future touch ups.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my upper teeth but not as well on my bottom teeth. I suppose this is because there is more contact by my lower teeth with coffees and colas so they have heavier staining.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than I expected and I&#x27;m on my third day of whitening with good results. I have experienced some sensitivity but its not severe. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth really white. My teeth were sensitive for at most a full day and then the pain went away overnight. People say to make your way up with moderation, but don&#x27;t waste your money with low level ones when you can have amazing white teeth in 7 days. I highly recommend this product to anyone out there who is looking to have their teeth whitened.</li>
    <li> Im so disappointed on that product  because It is really made my teeth sensitive, and it does not worth that !!!</li>
    <li> This worked to an extent. It whitened my teeth somewhat but there were no &amp;#34;intense, professional results&amp;#34; I was a bit disappointed by this considering it was quite pricey</li>
    <li> I dont usually write reviews, however, I do realize that I should have listened to the other people who had reviewed this product. About half way through wearing these for the first treatment, my teeth started to get really sensitive, and after that, I needed to take an advil because they were so sensitive for the next day or two. Not fun at all. Please dont buy this product, it is a complete waste of 40 something bucks.</li>
    <li> I like these strips.  No mess and they stay in place until you are ready to take them off.  Whitens well, and easy to use.  I can whiten my teeth even while I am working around the house.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend because it works.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of having my teeth professionally whitened but tried these instead and I am glad I did. My teeth look great! I am very impressed with the value, especially since I used the strips with the Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Tooth paste. I think someone mentioned it in the comments for the White Strips. It was great advice; these are powerful strips and you will need to protect your teeth from sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this particular variety of Crest White Strips. I have used whitening strips many times over the last 10 years with great success. Yes, I have experienced the occasional sensitivity, but nothing unbearable and the results were always stunningly white teeth. These 7 day strips are a completely different story and this is, by far, the most unsatisfied I have ever been with any sort of whitening product results. First, the teeth sensitivity was excruciating! It was painful just to have my mouth open and have the air hit my teeth when talking! The pain didn&#x27;t subside after while... it was constant. I figured it must really be doing it&#x27;s whitening job, so I continued to use them for the next 6 days, as directed. This brings me to my second point -- I am so incredibly disappointed with the whitening results. They were not any noticeable shade whiter. I developed white calcium deposits on my teeth when I was a child and normally, whitening my teeth totally blends my tooth color so they aren&#x27;t so noticeable.  This box did the complete opposite. It appeared to have whitened the calcium spots and now my teeth are blatantly multicolored. I actually got a great deal on this box and only paid $29 after a coupon and MIR, but it, still wasn&#x27;t worth it at all. I definitely do NOT RECOMMEND this product!!!</li>
    <li> The first day I wore these, my teeth hurt so bad I could not open my mouth to talk to anyone! I had to skip a day.. And after using them for 7 days, yes there were results, but the same results that I had with all the other Crest white strips I have used. This was the first time I ever felt pain using the strips. I was not disappointed though, because it was a very good price for these, almost 1/2 less than drugstore prices so I cannot say they were a waste of money. I recommend going for the regular professional effects because you get the same results and it is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth sometimes and was worried that I&#x27;d be in tears after using these strips.  No tears, not even an inkling of sensitivity and my teeth feel sparkly white.  I&#x27;ll definitely use this product again for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I was flabbergasted when I compared Amazon&#x27;s price on this to what it would have cost at a nearby drug chain store.  The product works well.  Since you are supposed to wear it for two hours, I was glad the strips stayed in place.  I could go about my business while they did their thing.  I noticed a difference. I use them twice a year.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Crest White Strips to anyone who is looking for whiter teeth. However, if you have any caps, or fake teeth, DO NOT BUY, as these stripes will whiten every tooth EXCEPT for artificial ones, likely leading to a disconcerting appearance. I have been using Crest White Strips a couple of times a year for about 7 years, and get compliments on the whiteness of my teeth all the time, compliments I did not receive prior to using the product.</li>
    <li> nothing change for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;ve never had super sensitive teeth, but did have what feels like a forming cavity.  I have no cavities currently, but I can feel a very dull pain on occasion in my upper right molar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a teacher, so I&#x27;m off for the summer.  Carving out 2hrs once a day for a week wasn&#x27;t going to be the hardest thing I ever did, so what the heck.  I started using these without reading the instructions too diligently, or reading the Amazon reviews - and lo and behold, about 10 minutes into my first application, I was nearly knocked off my feet by a shot of pain in my tooth.  If I had to describe it, it is a sudden wave that last only a few seconds, but you never know when or where it is going to hit!  I spent the rest of the 2hrs in constant paranoia about when, if or how the pain would return.  Sure, you get a few waves of pain every now and then, but after the initial blast, I was fine.  The strips peeled off fine, and I could notice a difference almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I prepped for the second application the next day, I wandered over to Amazon to read some reviews, and found a lot of people experienced the same thing - so I kept going.  Again, I noticed that between the 5min mark and the 45min mark, I would get the occasional shot of pain in some random part of my mouth.  It was a fleeting pain, but really annoying nonetheless.  Worse yet, as I mentioned, is the anticipation of the pain...the knowing that at some point, you&#x27;re going to get this rather uncomfortable pain in you mouth!  I noticed the pain bursts were less intense and less frequent than the first day...but that definitely goes against what I was reading online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 was the last day I&#x27;d use the strips in consecutive days; I went on the road to visit friends and family across the state, and used the strips during the 7 hour drive.  Almost no effect whatsoever!  Very little pain, very little discomfort, and I really could tell the difference.  I could have hot and cold foods/beverages without a problem.  Staying out of my house got me out of the daily routine, so I skipped a day, then put them back in for day 4.  No big deal.  I skipped a few days, and put in the 5th application...no big deal.  Skipped a few more days, and finally got around to putting in the 6th trip when I got back home today.  Figured I&#x27;d wear them on my run.  I made it about 5 minutes (still stretching for my run!) before I had to take them out.  It was a terrible pain, and maybe I felt like I&#x27;d had enough, but I said hell with it.  I got 5 days of 2hrs in, no more discomfort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth look good...I have a special toothpaste to remineralize the teeth and to hopefully add to the whitening process, while desensitizing them from the whitening process.  All in all, it does what it says.  It whitens for sure.  It hurts for sure.  However, their big selling point is time, whereas even as a teacher with the summer off, I found it difficult to stay on track and follow through with it for 7 days.  I never experienced pain when the strips were off, unlike many other reviewers, but be aware, the pain can really knock your socks off at times!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips many, many times before.  Occassionally, I&#x27;ll get sensitivity - usually by day 4 of the 30 minute strips.  But they also work well, so I&#x27;m okay with a few hours of tooth sensitivity and it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version is a whole other story.  I wanted dramatic and fast effects before family photos so I bought the 3D Professional Effects, 7 count. I&#x27;m in so much pain after only wearing one time!  I used them last night and had to take them off after an hour of wear due to pain in both upper and lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, about 16 hours after removing them, my teeth still hurt so badly I can&#x27;t bite into food.  Even reading a story to my child made them ache and they are hurting as I sit here and type. I&#x27;m most frustrated because I didn&#x27;t even have noticeable whitening, and now I&#x27;m afraid to wear anything else.  If you have teeth that get sensitive at all, these are NOT for you!  You WILL regret it.  Go with something that takes longer to work and is much more mild than these.</li>
    <li> These work... but they hurt : (  I would put me in the \\&quot;normal teeth\\&quot; category (ie not overly sensitive). They are pretty easy to use, eg they stay stick on, but my entire head hurt-- never knew teeth could ache so much. However, I was using then 2x&#x27;s/day, so start off slowly to see for yourself!</li>
    <li> The product works well i did notice a difference from the second time i used the strip. It made my teeth brighter which was great. The strips stay on very well they don&#x27;t budge just make sure not to eat during your one/two hours of use depending on your sensitivity. The only downside that i had was that my teeth are unbearably sensitive that i could only use the strip once per week, and there were times were i would use them only once per two weeks because after using them constantly my sensitivity worsen, so be warn those who have sensitive teeth. But other than that the product worked well.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product. I could see a difference after just two days. It did make my teeth sensitive for first couple weeks after, but soo worth it!! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these whitening strips and they work as advertised. The only warning is that you need to be careful not to place the strips over your gum line. This could cause temporary pain. These strips are much better than the older ones that Crest marketed. The cost is very reasonable and there was a rebate available through Crest, too. This makes using these strips a very good option to going to the dentist for expensive treatments. They are not for everybody so research all products carefully before buying and using these.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I do not recommend this because it does make them quite sore after use, but it goes away within a couple of hours. They really make your teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> Dear Crest, If you want 4 or 5 stars you will need to get my teeth whiter and whiter faster.</li>
    <li> Really works!  I was so happy with this product.  My friend also used this product and saw amazing results with it.  He had stained brown teeth from smoking and the results were dramatic.</li>
    <li> I was looking to quickly whiten my teeth before my wedding, and this seemed to be the best option available because it could be completed in a number of days instead of weeks.  They do require some dedication to wear for so long, and you almost have to plan them into your day, but they do provide at least some whitening and are easier and cheaper than going to the dentist.  If you have super sensitive teeth, watch out because these can cause some weird feelings after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My teeth look amazing. Only downfall is that it does make your teeth a little sensitive for a day or so...</li>
    <li> Lives up to the advertising! My teeth really are significantly whiter! Much cheaper than getting it some at the dentist!</li>
    <li> A few uncomfortable effects, little teeth pain and gum irritation but product works as it says. My teeth got whiter it really shows</li>
    <li> Could not believe, it actually has worked. My teeth look better. My only complaint is the burning on the inside of my mouth and tongue. I could not do more than 5 days in a row as it bothered me too much. Not my gums just surrounding tissue. The good result was worth the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
    <li> These strips are awesome and work better than any of the other over the counter strips I&#x27;ve tried. They whiten teeth a lot and in the advertised short amount of time! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Works well. Must keep up at least once a month</li>
    <li> This is the second teeth whitening solution I have tried. I feel that its excessive packaging for 7 little strips but regardless it seems to be  great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after the first time. These take two hours so its quite a hassle but I think well worth it in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that my teeth hurt somewhat bad the time after treatment. It goes away and I guess its normal.</li>
    <li> The good news is these \\&quot;level 5\\&quot; whitening strips work very well. The bad news is they hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat--but not overly--sensitive teeth. My teeth hurt for at least 24 hours after using these strips. There is no way I could use them every day as directed. I have to skip at least one day, and I usually skip two days between applications. I had braces a long time ago, and the pain these strips cause reminds me of the pain after having my braces tightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not unbearable. It&#x27;s just annoying and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the results are worth it. Skip a couple of days between applications and you&#x27;ll get excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated these four stars because five stars would mean they are perfect. They do give five star whitening results, but \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; whitening strips would not cause pain. By that definition, I don&#x27;t think perfect whitening strips exist. These are as close as you can get.</li>
    <li> Its amazing i cant believe it shipping super fast and the product its insane i use it and look really nice just a little sensitive</li>
    <li> After 2 days it was very rough on my teeth and my teeth were hurting didnt see any improvement after 2 sessions so i dont know how these people say after the first time.</li>
    <li> Only used these one time, but they made my teeth so sensitive i could barely sleep! It was terrible and I wish I could return them, but I waited to start using them and not its after the return deadline - waste of money!</li>
    <li> Too bad it shouldn&#x27;t be used more than once per year.  This is the best whitening product on the market!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!These thigs are great.You can really mold them to get between your teeth and they will fit anyone with normal size teeth.I did 7 days,then 2 on the new box and am not a spring chicken.These are fabulous.I&#x27;m getting my boyfriend on them.</li>
    <li> I am on day 3 of whitening and the results are already noticeable!  I have to do a quick whitening between dental visits before they put anterior fillings on my front teeth for cosmetic purposes.  The price was right for that purpose alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, though, I am experiencing the sensitivity issues that people have mentioned.  I have extremely non-sensitive teeth otherwise, so I was very surprised at the chilling sensations in my mouth.  For the most part it&#x27;s very mild - I can feel it slightly when I breathe.  But at 3 different times on one tooth, I&#x27;ve experienced quick, severe pains akin to biting on a piece of foil or 9V battery or receiving a minor electric shock to my gums.  While those have not been pleasant, the sensitivity wears off in a few hours and the results are worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not inconvenient at all.  Because the strips are so sticky, I can wear them at work and talk just fine without keeping a pool of spit in my mouth like I do wearing the other Crest strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have only used 2 strips so far for upper and lower. they work great, well worth the $$ and there&#x27;s a rebate for $10 on the crest site. The only thing I noticed (it may be me and no one else) after using 2 days straight i had a spot or two on my gum that was a little sore. I stopped using the strips and it went away... For me i&#x27;ll probably use one or two sets a week instead of each day....</li>
    <li> t&#x27;s probably not as strong as a professional treatment, but it worked for me. I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity and they stick to your teeth very well - you can even drink water. I drink coffee frequently so I&#x27;m planning to buy another box for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee and tea every single day and I typically have used teeth whitening tray and whitener from the dentist; compared to the dentist this gives twice as much as whitening and it stays :-)</li>
