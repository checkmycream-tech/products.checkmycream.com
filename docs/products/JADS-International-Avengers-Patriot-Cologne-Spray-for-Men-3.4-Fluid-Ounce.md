      <li>One of my top favorite colognes is voyage by Nautica.</li>
      <li>Being that Captain America is my favorite of the Avengers, i had to get this cologne.</li>

      <li>The other two weren&#x27;t so great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>If you are not looking for the above mentioned and prefer a dank, musky scent, might I suggest a cologne more fitting for</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of The First Avenger and this is an innovative and pleasant avenue that every die hard Cap fan should have.</li>
      <li>in conclusion if you are looking for a clean smelling, long lasting, inexpensive, cologne that is worthy of the first and greatest avenger, procure it.</li>
      <li>This smells cheap and almost flowery/girly like a cheap Bonnie Bell set you&#x27;d buy for a 5 year old.</li>
      <li>But Patriot smells more masculine and not in an overpowering way.</li>
      <li>I like fresh scents.</li>
      <li>Nice big bottle too</li>
      <li>Overall it wasn&#x27;t too noticable but had a nice scent at first, it came in a nice big bottle and is worth the money if you are looking for a nice present</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many of the higher quality colognes shall we say but I have smelled probably close to a hundred different types</li>
      <li>and I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
      <li>He wore it and it smells exactly like Adidas moves(which</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas after we tried it at Comic Con.</li>
      <li>Good scent, not too heavy, not too light, masculine but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>If you have no idea which comic to buy the nerd in your life or if you feel like giving them yet another droll t shirt with a clever nerdy quip on it is a bit overplayed... get this!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly be buying it again when I run out.</li>
      <li>You can definitely smell it through the day, but not so much that it&#x27;s choking or too strong.</li>
      <li>well a i like the whole smell of it</li>
      <li>The box is not the same as described here, but the smell is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I like to smell apart from the crowd and I am very picky about my scents.</li>
      <li>At first I was really only a fan of the Patriot one, but over time Worthy grew on me as well.</li>
      <li>Like most of the other reviewers, I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>Second, if the above is not reason enough then you should also know the scent is quite pleasant.</li>
      <li>So I mainly use voyage on my more debonair excursions and not for my everyday wear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really a toy, so the questions for this review weren&#x27;t accurate.</li>
      <li>For the price you more than get your green stuff out of</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different and fun.</li>
      <li>The scent is very soft but fresh and I like it for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But Cap cologne is pretty durable especially for the price you pay.</li>
      <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this cologne, the first time was in the Avengers set.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t exactly make me think of Captain America--more like that week I spent in Mexico after graduating high school</li>
      <li>it smell lite  unless you go up to it and really smell you would second guess</li>
      <li>I am afraid that I do not know what scent to relate it to other than excellent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this and didn&#x27;t tell me about it... He wore it and it smells exactly like Adidas moves(which I love)... It was a pleasent surprise that it smelled so good!</li>
    <li> I am a huge captain america fan and really love the fragrance of this. Its perfect for me. If I could I would get the rest of them.</li>
    <li> Though the descriptors on the back on the box (tequila? lime? white pepper?) don&#x27;t exactly make me think of Captain America--more like that week I spent in Mexico after graduating high school--they all smell great together. Good scent, not too heavy, not too light, masculine but not overpowering. One can only hope this is what Cap actually smells like.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas after we tried it at Comic Con. It&#x27;s amazing. Not too overwhelming or spicy. I actually wear it a lot as well. I will be ordering more from this line.</li>
    <li> It makes me think of the woods. So there you go. American scented Captain America cologne. Not much to say, besides it smells great and the bottle looks good too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a joke not expecting it to smell good at all.... but it smells very good. . Reminds me of the ad did as cologne</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful (was able to see how they smelled at nycc but didn&#x27;t buy) and I was very happy to find cheaper prices online to buy it</li>
    <li> I love the bottle, nice design. Simple and sturdy. Very nice scent, not overly strong, but very pleasant. Definitely would consider buying the rest of the set.</li>
    <li> The box is not the same as described here, but the smell is fantastic. The Cologne lasts a long time and has a great smell. Its a fantastic gift for christmas and I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> delicious cologne for delicious men who wish they were as cool as steve rogers. yum yum yum yum yum yum.</li>
    <li> This smells cheap and almost flowery/girly like a cheap Bonnie Bell set you&#x27;d buy for a 5 year old. This is not a manly cologne.</li>
    <li> I got this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend, and had to test it on myself before I gave it to him. I loved the smell! It&#x27;s fresh and clean, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Like most of the other reviewers, I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Loved it! It&#x27;s a very classy,  manly, attractive smell, and the bottle is very pretty!! Definitely a great gift. Do it. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I was so relieved when we got this. All of the other reviews were spot on. It&#x27;s a subtle, fresh smell. My husband said it&#x27;s flowery but for males so you could call it awesome blossoms. We&#x27;ll definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of colognes. I like to smell apart from the crowd and I am very picky about my scents. I don&#x27;t like to smell in anyway feminine nor girly. At the same time I hate how most guy colognes are musky and drab smelling. I like fresh scents. So finding a cologne that both smells manly and fresh is difficult. This cologne I believe has the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now besides being a big fan of Cap, I also am very critical of colognes. The smell of this one is quite unique.  I haven&#x27;t tried many of the higher quality colognes shall we say but I have smelled probably close to a hundred different types and I find myself more drawn to this one than any of the more costly colognes. The scent is very soft but fresh and I like it for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, its Captain America cologne. I am a huge fan of The First Avenger and this is an innovative and pleasant avenue that every die hard Cap fan should have. Second, if the above is not reason enough then you should also know the scent is quite pleasant. It has a slight fruit scent to it that is neither too strong nor too weak. One might be able to find a comparison to another more popular brand of cologne. I am afraid that I do not know what scent to relate it to other than excellent. Everywhere I go I am asked what it is I am wearing for it smells so good. Third, it is long lasting. One of my top favorite colognes is voyage by Nautica. That has the best scent of any I have ever used or smelled. The problem I find with it is that the scent of it, however pleasant, is brief. So I mainly use voyage on my more debonair excursions and not for my everyday wear. But Cap cologne is pretty durable especially for the price you pay. And finally, the size is quite substantial. For the price you more than get your green stuff out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion if you are looking for a clean smelling, long lasting, inexpensive, cologne that is worthy of the first and greatest avenger, procure it. If you are not looking for the above mentioned and prefer a dank, musky scent, might I suggest a cologne more fitting for shall we say, red skull?</li>
    <li> I love this cologne! I bought for my father, and he loves the smells of cologne so much he wears it everyday.</li>
    <li> well a i like the whole smell of it i don&#x27;t no what laura was tlking about smell&#x27;s cheap and rated a 1.something must dont no it does not matter to the cologne copany they still no there cologn and it smell lite  unless you go up to it and really smell you would second guess were the smell is coming from and tht&#x27;s how like my cologn&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The cologne had a nice fresh scent for about the first two hours then it faded to a more feminine scent that wasn&#x27;t very strong. Overall it wasn&#x27;t too noticable but had a nice scent at first, it came in a nice big bottle and is worth the money if you are looking for a nice present</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this cologne, the first time was in the Avengers set. At first I was really only a fan of the Patriot one, but over time Worthy grew on me as well. The other two weren&#x27;t so great. But Patriot smells more masculine and not in an overpowering way. You can definitely smell it through the day, but not so much that it&#x27;s choking or too strong. I had put it on one day before work, stopped through a drive through and I thought the girl at the window was going to jump me. Everyone around me seems to like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly be buying it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Has an awesome smell to it. It is mild, but a great cologne! I&#x27;d highly recommend to those who want to smell great but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas Gift to a good buddy of mine - he died laughing when he opened it. More importantly though, his girlfriend loved the smell. A great gag gift that actually isnt such a gag gift as it is a rather good one. I would buy and give again to other folks. If you have no idea which comic to buy the nerd in your life or if you feel like giving them yet another droll t shirt with a clever nerdy quip on it is a bit overplayed... get this! It&#x27;s different and fun. The smell is close to Tommy so its a good scent for day or night. Not overpowering like ax, and fades well.</li>
    <li> Being that Captain America is my favorite of the Avengers, i had to get this cologne. I love it. Nice citrus smell and it does smell like the outdoors. The one chic must have got a bad batch because my gf and i love the scent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a supreme Captain America fan, and they absolutely loved it. The smell of freedom.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot I can say. It&#x27;s not really a toy, so the questions for this review weren&#x27;t accurate. But this stuff smells amazing. Nice big bottle too</li>
