      <li>and it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>So far so good on the strength.</li>
      <li>It really makes my nails smooth and it also gives them a more pronounced C curve.</li>
      <li>For the first time I have strong, smooth nails.</li>
      <li>Super quick drying.</li>
      <li>This product applies pretty smooth and dries rather quickly to a semi matte finish.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product that I have used that seems to work, and I will buy it again.  </li>
      <li>That is a first.</li>
      <li>It really did fill my ridges!</li>
      <li>Still on the first bottle, but I have already repurchased since I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t remove the first 2 coats for 6 days, and didn&#x27;t really need to take it off at that time.  </li>
      <li>I currently use this under all of my manicure bases and it provides a smooth finish.  </li>
      <li>My nails peel and crack, and this is the only thing that keeps them together and smooth.</li>

      <li>My nails are not very ridged, but it requires two coats of this product rather than one to achieve the desired smooth finish.</li>
      <li>, I have to apply 2 coats for it to actually fill in the ridges, I love the pink tint as well!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands and since using this I&#x27;ve noticed my polish applies much smoother</li>
      <li>use all bliss kiss products (oil, lotion stick, latex barrier) and this is my least favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m young</li>
      <li>So, I am pleased and only subtracted one star because it requires two coats; it does not take long to dry (on the plus side).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several base coats, this one is becoming a fast favorite.  </li>
      <li>Really lasts for a long time!  </li>
      <li>Simply the best ridge filler and base coat out there.  </li>
      <li>I love this base coat, it dries SUPER fast, BUT</li>
      <li>Definitely smooths nails out and has just a hint of cover, to keep nails looking natural, if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
      <li>The Ridge Filling Base applies easily and smoothly and dries quickly ... can&#x27;t say much for the wear since I change my Polish at least every other day.</li>
      <li>I love this base coat and often wear it alone if I don&#x27;t have time to do a full polish.  </li>

<li> but I have had ridges on my nails for my entire life, which makes applying nail polish difficult and un-slightly.</li>
<li> Sometimes hardly any chipping at all...</li>
<li> I am 66 years old and started getting very bad ridges in my nails due to my age.  </li>
<li> I am horrible about my nails, but during the first week, I was picking weeds out of rock landscaping, and the nails just took it without a chip.  </li>
<li> Forget any other strengthening base coat (I have tried them all).</li>
<li> I found this as a base coat makes my polish chip faster than my OPI base coat.</li>

    <li> It really did fill my ridges! I only used one coat and it did the trick! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old and started getting very bad ridges in my nails due to my age.  This product is a miracle.  I do need to use several coats but my ridges really are bad.  The nail polish goes on smoothly over it and my manicure looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands and since using this I&#x27;ve noticed my polish applies much smoother and I have less chipping... Sometimes hardly any chipping at all...</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!! Forget any other strengthening base coat (I have tried them all). This actually WORKS! I&#x27;m young but I have had ridges on my nails for my entire life, which makes applying nail polish difficult and un-slightly. For the first time I have strong, smooth nails. AND the nail polish did not come off in the shower! That is a first. Happy customer right here</li>
    <li> I love this base coat, it dries SUPER fast, BUT, I have to apply 2 coats for it to actually fill in the ridges, I love the pink tint as well! Will be buying once I RUN OUT!</li>
    <li> Simply the best ridge filler and base coat out there.  Hands down.  My nails peel and crack, and this is the only thing that keeps them together and smooth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good for the price. My nails are not very ridged, but it requires two coats of this product rather than one to achieve the desired smooth finish. I have used it for two manicures, and I do think that this has helped my manicures to last longer. It dries with a somewhat matte finish. So, I am pleased and only subtracted one star because it requires two coats; it does not take long to dry (on the plus side).</li>
    <li> I love this base coat and often wear it alone if I don&#x27;t have time to do a full polish.  It really makes my nails smooth and it also gives them a more pronounced C curve.</li>

    <li> This stuff makes my nailpolish last almost 2 weeks, and I&#x27;m a dentist. I wash my hands constantly.</li>
    <li> Definitely smooths nails out and has just a hint of cover, to keep nails looking natural, if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>

    <li> My nails have extreme ridges.  They also peel, split, and break off really easily, but I don&#x27;t want artificial nails.  I have now been using this product for two weeks and it is fantastic.  I didn&#x27;t remove the first 2 coats for 6 days, and didn&#x27;t really need to take it off at that time.  Really lasts for a long time!  I am horrible about my nails, but during the first week, I was picking weeds out of rock landscaping, and the nails just took it without a chip.  This is the first product that I have used that seems to work, and I will buy it again.  June Update:  I have now been using this for 3 1/2 months.  Love the product.  I have nice long nails on my left hand, and until this morning when I broke a nail while scrubbing the kitchen, had long nails on all of my right hand.  Still on the first bottle, but I have already repurchased since I don&#x27;t want to run out.  Love it!</li>
