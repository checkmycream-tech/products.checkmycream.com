### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was really impressed with the selection of blades included in this pack, and it will be a while before i&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
      <li>At the time this was about the best value on Amazon or elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The Astra blades were the best for me</li>
      <li>Great value in this pack!</li>
      <li>After going through all of them I decided the Derbys were best and ordered a 100 pack of those.  </li>
      <li>Great variety!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, upon going through all the razors (great selection of blades BTW), I noticed that one box had been opened and a razor had been opened!</li>
      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent sampler pack.  </li>
      <li>This is a perfect way to try differnet blades to find out which one will work best for me.  </li>
      <li>The selection of blades is very good, but don&#x27;t expect them to be as shown in the picture.  </li>
      <li>Great razor sampler for a beginner.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great deal</li>
      <li>Great sampler pack.  </li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>This is also a great bargain compared to the cartridge or disposable</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great way to find something you&#x27;ll like.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice assortment of safety razor blades with 5 of each type.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for beginners like myself who are trying to see what kinds of blades are out there and which ones I like the most.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Youll be able to find what cuts best and what cuts you.</li>
      <li>So they will be able to determine what works best for their face.  </li>
      <li>With a minimum of 5 blades per pack it appears that he is also able to fairly rate which blades do work the best for his beard.</li>
      <li>found both good for me blades and not so good for me blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to test out a good variety of razors I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this package.</li>
      <li>Maybe they realized it&#x27;s too good</li>
      <li>If you get something that works well, shave with that until your technique is good, then move on.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was prompt, packaging was adequate and the selection of razors here is awesome!</li>
      <li>It is great because you can really find the blades that work the best for you.</li>
      <li>Definitely a great product and one that I will look for again when it comes time to buy more blades.</li>
      <li>there are sooo many choices!</li>
      <li>So far it has given me a good idea on the the type of blades that work best for my face (and the ones that don&#x27;t) and I will continue to explore the varieties of those brands.</li>
      <li>I am really looking forward to finding the blade that works best for me.  </li>
      <li>and I can repurchase those I liked</li>
      <li>/&gt;These blades came bundled up in a ziploc bag that was taped all over to make it nice and sturdy.</li>
      <li>Using the YMMV paradigm, I found that Gillette Silver Blues, Bic Chrome, Nacet SS and Astra SS worked well for me, with Feathers being the absolute best.</li>
      <li>They come in their own packaging all together in a box.</li>
      <li>The variety in here is sure to result in a brand or two (or three or four) that you will absolutely love!</li>
      <li>Great for finding out which brand you like, but may be too many brands at once for a first time</li>
      <li>Wish it had more companies.  </li>
      <li>I shave more often than most people since my beard comes in faster than on</li>
      <li>I believe these were from either Israel, India, and Russia with most being from Egypt.  </li>
      <li>When I started using a double edge razor I wanted to learn which blades would work best for me.  </li>
      <li>As most have stated already, the blades do come wrapped in a ziplock bag.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect all, or even most, of the blades to work well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be able to try different ones to see which ones I like best.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of buying 100 blades</li>
      <li>Never buy cheap blades for your face or a friends !</li>
      <li>Most likely I will follow up with an update once I find out which ones are best for me.</li>
      <li>So many people will say stick with one brand and then branch out.  </li>
      <li>I would say which ones I like the most</li>
      <li>(Interestingly, the price went up $2 on this pack since I ordered mine a week ago.  </li>
      <li>most guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>might be a better value).</li>
      <li>It is hoped this review will add value and be beneficial to to the people who buy this product as I am assuming they are buying it primarily to determine what blade they want to ultimately own.</li>
      <li>It was another quantum leap better yet.</li>
      <li>is hoped this review will add value and be beneficial to to the people who buy this product as I am assuming they are buying it primarily to determine what blade they want to ultimately own.</li>
      <li>There are lots of different brands and styles so that you can keep trying them until you find what works best for you.  </li>
      <li>whether I&#x27;ll pick up another big sampler like this, or choose the brand that I like best out of the sampler and go with that one.    </li>
      <li>The price for this pack has gone up $2 since i&#x27;ve ordered, but it is still available from these sellers on ebay for $20 shipped!  </li>
      <li>Because, when you use a safety razor, you go through blades much slower than with cartridges, this is absolutely the best deal out there.  </li>
      <li>I really like that the large selection and many choices available in this collection is giving the recipient of this gift ample opportunity to find blades that work best for him.</li>
      <li>Great assortment so far.</li>
      <li>Some absolutely tore up my face, while others have become my new best blades.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to be able to try them out without committing to a huge number of one particular blade.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what was advertised and I&#x27;m excited about trying all the different razors to find the one that works best for me.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them all, but all appear to be originals in genuine packaging.</li>
      <li>And free shipping sealed the deal for me.  </li>
      <li>Very economical.</li>
      <li>However, they are all in their original, separate, unopened boxes.</li>
      <li>but the KAI blades are sealed in original packaging.  </li>
      <li>I still haven&#x27;t made it through them all, but I&#x27;ve definitely found some awesome blades thus far.  </li>
      <li>I believe this is a good collection for someone just starting to explore the benefits of using a safety razor.</li>
      <li>My husband was interested in the old school shaving system and I bought him a good quality razor, shaving soap and brush and some starter blades.</li>
      <li>If your new to Wet Shaving you might want to try getting a sampler pack like this just so you can see what blade you might like best</li>
      <li>Item shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and it was packed well.</li>
      <li>Five stars for selection, price, and quick service.  </li>
      <li>The packaging and delivery were all adequate.  </li>
      <li>A quick email to the supplier and</li>
      <li>Nice large variety of different razor blades to try, much more economical than modern cartridge systems, and a better shave with the DE blades.  </li>
      <li>Excellent sampler if you are new wet shaving and looking for the right blades</li>
      <li>Great way to sample many different brands without buying them individually.</li>
      <li>The quality of the blades was very consistent...</li>
      <li>not much packaging, which is nice!  </li>
      <li>With this I had a very wide selection of blades and was able to experiment with different razor and blade combinations to see what was the most cost effective and comfortable combination.</li>
      <li>I suppose if you were looking for a new brand, this is a good way to go (though I suspect better samplers are available and--after accounting for the waste--</li>
      <li>Well worth the price</li>
      <li>I think this is well worth my money.</li>
      <li>I trust this seller &amp; had a very positive experience with him.</li>
      <li>It was as I expected, a very good variety of blades from all of the major manufacturers.</li>
      <li>But with all the blades in this sampler I shouldn&#x27;t have a problem finding the right one.</li>
      <li>so u can actually perform better with the &amp;#34;surgical grade blades&amp;#34; some shark blades worked gread while some didnt</li>
      <li>That gave me the chance to use the blade that came with the razor for a while, first.</li>
      <li>Yep, many different brands.      </li>
      <li>Getting back into DE razor shaving after 25 years, there is no way I would have tried out so many razor blades, but for this pack.  </li>
      <li>Nice wide selection of razors.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t fee any pull at all and had to check to make sure I actually had a blade in there.    </li>
      <li>started my first week with the Merkur blade that came with my Merkur HD</li>
      <li>Of the ones I threw out, the first two or three of each brand tore my face up so much that I threw out the remaining blades (and that was using a fresh blade every day).  </li>
      <li>I bought this pack over two years ago and still have many razors left.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was as I expected, a very good variety of blades from all of the major manufacturers. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> there are sooo many choices! each name brand blade is definitely different so it&#x27;s nice to be able to try them out without committing to a huge number of one particular blade.</li>
    <li> Lots of variety. Some of them I don&#x27;t like (which is expected) and some which I thought would be bad turned out to be really good - like the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice assortment of safety razor blades with 5 of each type. If you are just starting using a safety razor, I highly recommend this sampler. It is great because you can really find the blades that work the best for you. Most of these blades are common and easy to find if you find the right blades for you.  I believe these were from either Israel, India, and Russia with most being from Egypt.  Was delivered in plastic ziplock bag taped shut contained in a small Amazon box, so not much packaging, which is nice!  UPDATE: The Astra blades were the best for me</li>
    <li> Shipping was prompt, packaging was adequate and the selection of razors here is awesome! I haven&#x27;t started using them yet so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the included razors (which is why I rated 4 stars instead of 5), but this was a cheap sampler pack that should last me for quite some time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve made it through about half of the blades now. Some absolutely tore up my face, while others have become my new best blades. The variety in here is sure to result in a brand or two (or three or four) that you will absolutely love! If it weren&#x27;t for the handful of REALLY awful blades in here, I&#x27;d easily give this set 5 stars. I with there was an option of 4.5 stars...</li>
    <li> I was looking to try differnet blades for my double edge razor that I have had and been using intermittently for 30 years.  This is a perfect way to try differnet blades to find out which one will work best for me.  The product was just as advertised and I have been using the differnet blades for about 6 weeks now and am very satified.</li>
    <li> Yep, many different brands.      All but the KAI blades are sealed in original packaging.  The KAI blades are in a plastic envelope like they broke a brick of blades down.  The wrapper has a logo mark that resembles the letters KAI, and the blades are unmarked.  The only downside is the envelope was not labeled, and the logo on the blade wrapper is not obvious.    Any further review is on how my shaves went, so it may not be helpful for others.  I have found most of the blades to perform reasonable to very well for me, but some were not good for my face and I will give those to other people who like those brands.</li>
    <li> Great razor sampler for a beginner.  I was really impressed with the selection of blades included in this pack, and it will be a while before i&#x27;ve tried them all.  The price for this pack has gone up $2 since i&#x27;ve ordered, but it is still available from these sellers on ebay for $20 shipped!  Shipping did not take as long as I expected from Canada, and I will definitely order from this seller again once I pick out a couple favorites.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short. Great purchase. They come in their own packaging all together in a box. I won&#x27;t have to buy blades for a long time. I like that I&#x27;ll be able to try different ones to see which ones I like best.</li>
    <li> I threw away half the blades in the sampler.  The quality of the blades was very consistent...they were either very good, or very bad (for me).  Of the ones I threw out, the first two or three of each brand tore my face up so much that I threw out the remaining blades (and that was using a fresh blade every day).  I suppose if you were looking for a new brand, this is a good way to go (though I suspect better samplers are available and--after accounting for the waste--might be a better value).</li>
    <li> Nice wide selection of razors. Checked the blades when I got them and was missing a pack of them. A quick email to the supplier and they sent me the one that I was missing plus a couple of bonus packs!    There&#x27;s a ton of blades here adn it&#x27;s a great way to find something you&#x27;ll like.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable assortment of blades all new and sealed.  I am really looking forward to finding the blade that works best for me.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Man, this sampler has a lot of blades!  I still haven&#x27;t made it through them all, but I&#x27;ve definitely found some awesome blades thus far.  Great value in this pack!</li>
    <li> This product gets an A+.  Because, when you use a safety razor, you go through blades much slower than with cartridges, this is absolutely the best deal out there.  Definitely a great product and one that I will look for again when it comes time to buy more blades.</li>
    <li> I only got 23 different blades but there were 125 total. Great variety and cheaper than trying to just buy a few from different places or buying a box of one brand only to find they cut your face. Some of these are hard to find at reasonable prices, so this may be the only way you get to try them. At the time this was about the best value on Amazon or elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them all, but all appear to be originals in genuine packaging.</li>
    <li> I just bought my first safety razor and needed some blades to use in it. These arrived a day or two later than my razor. That gave me the chance to use the blade that came with the razor for a while, first. After the initial fear of removing a large portion of my face with a blade that appeared far too exposed, I was getting far better shaves than I had ever gotten before. Then, I changed to one of the blades from this set. I happened to choose the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; blades. It was another quantum leap better yet. I didn&#x27;t fee any pull at all and had to check to make sure I actually had a blade in there.    I&#x27;m not sure yet whether I&#x27;ll pick up another big sampler like this, or choose the brand that I like best out of the sampler and go with that one.    Well worth the price (110 blades for the price of maybe 8 cartridge blade?). Received in a timely manner, although I might have preferred some method of keeping them a little tidier than all of them in a zip-loc bag.</li>
    <li> Five stars for selection, price, and quick service.  It&#x27;s going to take me two years to get through all 100 of these blades, so I can&#x27;t really speak about their quality.  (Interestingly, the price went up $2 on this pack since I ordered mine a week ago.  Maybe they realized it&#x27;s too good a deal!)&lt;br /&gt;They shipped the same day I ordered, and I had them in hand in under a week.  (Yes, customs slowed them a bit, but they arrived three days before the USPS estimated delivery date.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen a sampler pack this extensive or inexpensive anywhere else.  And free shipping sealed the deal for me.  Looking forward to trying out all these  blades from around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE --&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two years.  I still have about a dozen of these blades left.  After going through all of them I decided the Derbys were best and ordered a 100 pack of those.  I use all the others for odds-n-ends around the house.</li>
    <li> So since this isn&#x27;t sold by amazon, I&#x27;m mainly reviewing the seller (Wish4Star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this order in a \\&quot;timely\\&quot; fashion (it&#x27;s shipped standard USPS and so took a few days... maybe 5 or so). All the items in the pic showed up and the packaging was compact and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon going through all the razors (great selection of blades BTW), I noticed that one box had been opened and a razor had been opened! Yuck!! So I contacted the seller and he assured me this had never happened before (I have a feeling he&#x27;s telling the truth) and that he would send me a new box asap. Well I just received my replacements (yeah he sent an extra pack!), which showed up quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all I trust this seller &amp; had a very positive experience with him. I will most likely be purchasing in bulk from him once I settle on a single brand of razor.</li>
    <li> The purpose of this blade package is variety sampling, and that&#x27;s what it gives.  There are lots of different brands and styles so that you can keep trying them until you find what works best for you.  My husband is making his way through, about one brand per week or so.  He won&#x27;t like them all, of course, but he won&#x27;t know what works for him until he tries them.  Great variety!</li>
    <li> Great way to sample many different brands without buying them individually. I bought this pack over two years ago and still have many razors left. Very economical.</li>
    <li> This is the largest sampler pack I could find on Amazon.  Getting back into DE razor shaving after 25 years, there is no way I would have tried out so many razor blades, but for this pack.  The packaging and delivery were all adequate.  I ended up trying all the razor blades in the package.  None of them were bad.  Any nicks that I got were a result of my faulty technique or inadequate preparation.  Using the YMMV paradigm, I found that Gillette Silver Blues, Bic Chrome, Nacet SS and Astra SS worked well for me, with Feathers being the absolute best.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail today, and man is there a lot of blades here.  it would take me 3 and a half months to try every single brand each week I change out my razor blade.  You have every type of blade here, low to high.  I bought a couple DE razors as gifts for xmas, so I am going to pull a blade from each brand and package inside the box.  So they will be able to determine what works best for their face.  All in all it&#x27;s a great deal and you get to try a lot of brands out.  If I was just using them myself, I would have enough for an entire year.</li>
    <li> The selection of blades is very good, but don&#x27;t expect them to be as shown in the picture.  They will come in a zip lock bag.  All high quality blades.  Never buy cheap blades for your face or a friends !</li>
    <li> Great assortment so far.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about it. I got exactly what was advertised and I&#x27;m excited about trying all the different razors to find the one that works best for me. Shipping was quick and it was packed well. If you&#x27;re looking to test out a good variety of razors I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this package.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sampler pack.  When I started using a double edge razor I wanted to learn which blades would work best for me.  With this I had a very wide selection of blades and was able to experiment with different razor and blade combinations to see what was the most cost effective and comfortable combination.</li>
    <li> As most have stated already, the blades do come wrapped in a ziplock bag. However, they are all in their original, separate, unopened boxes. Just want to be clear about that.&lt;br /&gt;This pack offers a pretty decent variety to be found all at once. The thing I didn&#x27;t like is they did seem to include too many lords razors (thus only 4 stars). If those work well for your face then it&#x27;s a boon for you, unfortunately these were not too conducive for my skin quality thus a waste for me.  So far it has given me a good idea on the the type of blades that work best for my face (and the ones that don&#x27;t) and I will continue to explore the varieties of those brands. For starters in the world of wet shaving (like myself) this is definitely a must and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to rave about the selection as many other reviewers have done that. I am instead going to let you know how I&#x27;m going about rating each of the blades. I will be using one blade each week and I&#x27;ve set up an spreadsheet with columns labeled \\&quot;brand name\\&quot;, \\&quot;relative rating\\&quot; (from 0 - 10), \\&quot;cost per blade\\&quot; (including shipping if applicable) and \\&quot;comments\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my first week with the Merkur blade that came with my Merkur HD long handle razor [[ASIN:B001KS685W Merkur HD Long Handle Safety Razor with Blue Handle - #38B - Made in Germany]] which today, November 21, 2010 is selling for $63.99 + $3.99 shipping although when I bought mine just two weeks ago on November 6 I paid $45.95 including shipping. All I can say about that is WOW, I&#x27;m really smart. LOL! Actually I was really lucky but hey, I&#x27;ll take luck over skill any day. . :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it is likely that the primary purpose for buying an assortment such as this is to evaluate which blade is for you. I am new to double edge wet shaving and I will account for that in my analysis as I anticipate my shaving technique will improve over the next few weeks. However, I don&#x27;t think the learning curve is that steep so probably four or five weeks is sufficient. So, after going through 4 blades I&#x27;ll start over with the Merkur Stainless Steel Platinum Coated Blade and then with the Big Ben Super Stainless which I&#x27;ve just started with today. (BTW, the Big Ben cost per blade is $[...] versus $[...] for the Merkur. Though I&#x27;m still a rookie, if I had to choose between the two I&#x27;d go with the Big Ben and not just because it&#x27;s so much less expensive but because I did not get a noticeably different shave AND it is 1/4th the cost of the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they [[ASIN:1450582974 Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving, Fourth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]] and many wet shaving Web sites say the blade is the single most important tool of the trade so if you&#x27;re going to evaluate 20 different blades (this product gives you twenty different makes and models of blades), unless all of your brain cells are not only intact but functioning at an incredible capacity you&#x27;ll need a tool to help you evaluate what you want to ultimately call \\&quot;your favorite blade\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hoped this review will add value and be beneficial to to the people who buy this product as I am assuming they are buying it primarily to determine what blade they want to ultimately own. Although if you find you like the majority of the blades in this sampler then you may just want to continue to buy the sampler. At its current price of $[...] it works out to $[...] per blade; a pretty decent price considering you do get some of the spendy Merkur and Feather blades in this assortment.u twenty different makes and models of blades), unless all of your brain cells are not only intact but functioning at an incredible capacity you&#x27;ll need a tool to help you evaluate what you want to ultimately call \\&quot;your favorite blade\\&quot;.

    <li> A large assortment of blades, just as advertised.  Great for finding out which brand you like, but may be too many brands at once for a first time user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with one type, shave for a week or two, make a few notes on how you liked it, then move on.  If you get something that works well, shave with that until your technique is good, then move on.  At the end, revisit all the ones that you had positive notes for, and find your favourite.</li>
    <li> Just recently got into the double blade razor routine and I must say I like it.  This sampler package can save you, literally, over a hundred dollars over the conventional 3-5 blade shaving systems out there.  I get the same results if not better when used with a shaving brush.  I have even recruited several friend into this regime and they vow to remain loyal to this shaving system.  Old fashion but still works.</li>
    <li> Im a newbie to wet shaving.  What attracted me to this one was the selection.  I wanted to try Bic, feather and the various Gillette razors.  So far tried the big ben and I was pleasantly surprised with them. So many people will say stick with one brand and then branch out.  Try the razor and if it it&#x27;s no good for you stop using it. For the cost of the blades it&#x27;s not a big loss. I can&#x27;t wait for my supply to be done and I can repurchase those I liked</li>
    <li> Nice large variety of different razor blades to try, much more economical than modern cartridge systems, and a better shave with the DE blades.  Item shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This thing can last me for a long time. I shave more often than most people since my beard comes in faster than on most guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one of these samplers have five blades that you can try. It is perfect for beginners like myself who are trying to see what kinds of blades are out there and which ones I like the most. I would say which ones I like the most but I did not try all of them. Most likely I will follow up with an update once I find out which ones are best for me. However, this probably would not help you much since every skin tone is different. What works for me might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades came bundled up in a ziploc bag that was taped all over to make it nice and sturdy. I think this is well worth my money. I was debating whether to try it, but now that I did, I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> My husband was interested in the old school shaving system and I bought him a good quality razor, shaving soap and brush and some starter blades. I followed up with this selection and he has had a ball trying the different types. I think he has a lifetime supply of blades now but he really likes the featherlite titanium ones in the collection. He really enjoys his daily shaving ritual and will never go back to the overpriced multiple blade nonsense propogated by Shick and Gillette among others.</li>
    <li> Over a year later still havent used all the blades...no shave november helped.&lt;br /&gt;Youll be able to find what cuts best and what cuts you. Id recommend starting with &amp;#34;duller&amp;#34; blades first so u can actually perform better with the &amp;#34;surgical grade blades&amp;#34; some shark blades worked gread while some didnt and my friend liked other stuff, all depends on how u shave(patience is key) and ur hair type.</li>
    <li> to early , have a ton of blades to sample yet</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Merkur blades, but I wanted a less expensive option and I picked this variety pack because they didn&#x27;t say that the product could vary according to availability like [[ASIN:B001QXXIJK Double Edge Razor Blade Mega Sample Pack #6 - 80 Blades]]. At under $40, it came to 30 cents/blade.  The blades came packed in a Ziploc sandwich bag and some of the containers were squished on the outside, but there were 130 blades in the sampler which made up for the outside packaging.  I don&#x27;t expect all, or even most, of the blades to work well but this is an inexpensive way to try a bunch and see what works.</li>
    <li> I really like that the large selection and many choices available in this collection is giving the recipient of this gift ample opportunity to find blades that work best for him. With a minimum of 5 blades per pack it appears that he is also able to fairly rate which blades do work the best for his beard. I believe this is a good collection for someone just starting to explore the benefits of using a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Great variety still going through it will probably take a year at least to actually use/try all of them</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this price!</li>
    <li> plenty of blades. i feel like i&#x27;ve wasted a few trying to find my &amp;#34;prefered&amp;#34; blades but still, rather than buying a bunch of horrible blades, this allows you to buy a bunch and try them all with possibilities of finding multiple blades that work. i&#x27;ve found at least 5 that i keep in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Excellent sampler if you are new wet shaving and looking for the right blades</li>
    <li> If your new to Wet Shaving you might want to try getting a sampler pack like this just so you can see what blade you might like best</li>
    <li> Great sampler pack.  I have not used them all yet but I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of buying 100 blades I don&#x27;t like.  Wish it had more companies.  Lord and Gillette are the main blades.</li>
    <li> Great starter blade sampler, it allows newbies to wet shaving with a double edge safety razor to find blades that work well with an individuals beard and facial charateristic. This is also a great bargain compared to the cartridge or disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found both good for me blades and not so good for me blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for some wet shaver who wishes to find different blades available.</li>
    <li> My sampler came up ten blades short.i noticed they doubled up Astra and Shark instead of the two different types of blades they make. A little disappointed in that regard. But with all the blades in this sampler I shouldn&#x27;t have a problem finding the right one.</li>
