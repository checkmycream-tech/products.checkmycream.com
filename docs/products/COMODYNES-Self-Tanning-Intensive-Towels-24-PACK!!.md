### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so well, they give me the perfect glow.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>:) I wouldn&#x27;t expect to look like you just came from the Caribbean; however, they give you a tint of color, perfect for winter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived in good shape and everything was as desribed</li>
      <li>Good to start tanning , use in a.m. After shower.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and really liked it so decided to order it again for this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also this particular seller has the best prices I have found.  </li>
      <li>I use one sheet every three days and that seems to be a good fit for my skin.</li>
      <li>I have used many self tanners and this is by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Better than some towels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Perfect for taking on vacation to keep up your \\&quot;tan\\&quot; while actually avoiding the sun.</li>
      <li>The Comodynes towels are an affordable, safe alternative to tanning beds.</li>
      <li>Very important: your tanned look is so natural, not the orange hue you have experienced.</li>
      <li>these work great easy to apply and a nice bronze - not orange - color&lt;br /&gt;dries very fast - much faster than the self-tanner lotions and no sent&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>Need some more right now!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I will definitely be buying from this seller again!</li>
      <li>I discovered COMODYNES like two years ago and they are really fantastic.</li>
      <li>Actually not enough to get a good tan all over.</li>
      <li>are the full sized towels.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, no smudges, it really works and you can wear your clothes after 5 minutes without any problem.</li>
      <li>No streaks, nice dark golden brown color, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so I started right off with those.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite beauty product ever, which speaks volumes since I routinely spend more than half of my discretionary income on makeup, hair and beauty items.</li>
      <li>The only downside - I have very healthy, zitfree skin normally -  after two weeks of using these every 2 days</li>
      <li>great natural color with absolutely no streaking.  </li>
      <li>They are odorless and easy to use, no mess, no streaks.</li>
      <li>pretty well</li>
      <li>I have tried tons of other tanning products but none are as effective or convenient as the Comodynes towels.</li>
      <li>Again, can&#x27;t stress enough how important the odorless component is.</li>
      <li>It works even better if you previously exfoliate your skin.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; tanning towels are actually quite mild</li>
      <li>Very natural color (not orange) and a lot of coverage for a very affordable price.</li>
      <li>I love them I have used them for a few years now</li>
      <li>so the darker wipes will be less apt to leave streaks or look dramatically different in case</li>
      <li>After I have used the Comodynes Natural towelettes (we just call them tan wipes at my house! :) for a few days, I switch over to the Intensive.</li>
      <li>Love these little towelettes!</li>
      <li>It fades very naturally too, no blotchiness at all.</li>
      <li>If I use 3 Naturals and 2 Intensives, that color will last a full week even after the last day I applied it.</li>
      <li>My skin is naturally medium toned &amp; with two applications of these on my face</li>
      <li>If you are tanning your entire body, you will need the whole towel.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend lotioning up your hands REALLY well before starting the tan application so that the color won&#x27;t absorb into your hands from the towelette as you wipe.</li>

    <li> Love these little towelettes! Perfect for taking on vacation to keep up your \\&quot;tan\\&quot; while actually avoiding the sun. They dry almost instantly as you apply. I would recommend lotioning up your hands REALLY well before starting the tan application so that the color won&#x27;t absorb into your hands from the towelette as you wipe. Also, I have such a hard time getting my hands to look normal with any self tanner and this is no exception. I would rather have paler hands than orange ones though! After I have used the Comodynes Natural towelettes (we just call them tan wipes at my house! :) for a few days, I switch over to the Intensive. That way I have sort of a tan base so the darker wipes will be less apt to leave streaks or look dramatically different in case I miss a place. If I use 3 Naturals and 2 Intensives, that color will last a full week even after the last day I applied it. It fades very naturally too, no blotchiness at all.</li>
    <li> I discovered COMODYNES like two years ago and they are really fantastic. Easy to apply, no smudges, it really works and you can wear your clothes after 5 minutes without any problem. Very important: your tanned look is so natural, not the orange hue you have experienced. It works even better if you previously exfoliate your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite beauty product ever, which speaks volumes since I routinely spend more than half of my discretionary income on makeup, hair and beauty items. The Comodynes towels are an affordable, safe alternative to tanning beds. They are odorless and easy to use, no mess, no streaks. Color builds gradually, but it&#x27;s noticeable within an hour or two. Again, can&#x27;t stress enough how important the odorless component is. Those of you who have been Mystic&#x27;d or airbrushed can relate. I have tried tons of other tanning products but none are as effective or convenient as the Comodynes towels. You&#x27;re doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t try them.</li>
    <li> these work great easy to apply and a nice bronze - not orange - color&lt;br /&gt;dries very fast - much faster than the self-tanner lotions and no sent&lt;br /&gt;and never stains hands - so I dont have to wear gloves.</li>
    <li> these towel are very thin and small.  need one for both arms and one face and chest. color lasts for about 3 days will not buy again</li>
    <li> This product is terrific! Very natural color (not orange) and a lot of coverage for a very affordable price. The &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; tanning towels are actually quite mild so I started right off with those. I use one sheet every three days and that seems to be a good fit for my skin. Boy do I wish they&#x27;d had these when I was a sun-worshiper in my 20s! Would have saved me a lot of wrinkles now that I&#x27;m in my 50s.</li>
    <li> These wipes work so well, they give me the perfect glow. :) I wouldn&#x27;t expect to look like you just came from the Caribbean; however, they give you a tint of color, perfect for winter.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn me orange like other tanning products. The smell is bearable unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried, that I&#x27;ve smelled all day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and really liked it so decided to order it again for this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in good shape and everything was as desribed</li>
    <li> Better than some towels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Good to start tanning , use in a.m. After shower. Use every other day.  One towelettesme does  your legs .thighs. Arms back. Works great</li>
    <li> I love them I have used them for a few years now</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised</li>
    <li> My legs are hard to tan, so I use this as a kick-start! Need some more right now! About time to go to Amazon again!</li>
    <li> I have used many self tanners and this is by far the best I have ever used.  No streaks, nice dark golden brown color, easy to use.  I cut my towels into 4ths and seal them in plastic bags so each towel lasts longer.  If you are tanning your entire body, you will need the whole towel.  Also this particular seller has the best prices I have found.  I researched everywhere, including Amazon and these are the full sized towels.  Beware that some sellers are selling the smaller towels.  This is a great product and I will definitely be buying from this seller again!</li>
    <li> The tanning sheets tan pretty well but the sheets are smaller than what I have been using.  There is barely enough moisture on it to wipe your legs, arms and face.  Actually not enough to get a good tan all over.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like when you never take shower&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it never ever</li>
    <li> great natural color with absolutely no streaking.  I wear this instead of makeup, and it stays on!  I have to reapply after about 4 days.</li>
    <li> These work. My skin is naturally medium toned &amp; with two applications of these on my face I was bronze.  The only downside - I have very healthy, zitfree skin normally -  after two weeks of using these every 2 days or so I ended up with several zits.  No whiteheads, but big, pores are clogged, zits. So I stopped using them, am cleaning my pores and will try again once I have that under control.</li>
