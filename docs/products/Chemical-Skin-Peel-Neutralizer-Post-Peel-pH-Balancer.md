      <li>and I am pleased with the results</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I then put it on top of my hands, without any burning noted.  </li>
      <li>So glad I bought this after my peel didn&#x27;t neutralize on</li>
      <li>; that has bothered me for many years has lessened by more than 75% in appearance with 5-week&#x27;s usage.</li>
      <li>but my face burns easily.</li>
      <li>Fine and dandy and all</li>

      <li>IF YOU HAVE FAIR SKIN, START AT THE LOW DOSAGE OF 10MG AND USE IT SPARINGLY WITH BAKING SODA AND WATER OR WITH A NEUTALIZER!</li>

      <li>Overall, my forehead now has a nice smooth appearance</li>
      <li>Works quickly to neutralize chemical peel solutions.</li>
      <li>Helped neutralize my skin nicely after a peel, but I dropped it and it broke instantly.</li>
      <li>I did notice a decent reduction in fine lines and pore size in that area.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what is says.</li>
      <li>I applied it to my forehead area first.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This is a must have for anyone using the higher percentage TCA.</li>
      <li>I actually got better relief from baking soda and water.</li>
      <li>I also have mild rosacea right near my cheek area.  </li>
      <li>But I ended up using the whole bottle with the first time.</li>
      <li>Worked very well</li>
      <li>Very thankful I ordered it.</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
      <li>Again, I felt intense burning and noticed that this area frosted as well.  </li>
      <li>Really helped to soothe the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; after my at home peel.</li>
      <li>10% was not strong enough for me, I tried the 20% and I am happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I have minimal freckles and very light, somewhat sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The third area I tried was my nasolabial folds (laugh lines).  </li>
      <li>Even with the neutralizer you need to be super careful with any TCA.</li>
      <li>It did burn, however not nearly as bad as other areas of my face.  </li>
      <li>This should not be sold on line, this seems to be grade A professional stuff for peels.  </li>
      <li>However, just today I applied the solution to my eye area, directly near my crows feet and under neath the outer portion of my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll still keep and use it, but for quicker action I&#x27;ll still use water with baking soda.</li>
      <li>but had I known the TCA peel from the same company comes with the exact same neutralizer</li>
      <li>I do tan slightly after some mild redness</li>
      <li>I am 37, with very mild wrinkles, moderate hyper pigmentation and fortunately no problems with acne.  </li>
      <li>But it will help calm things down.</li>

<li> im not sure how well this product actually works, because the chemical peel I used before it didn&#x27;t really do anything either.</li>
<li> At first I was worried that it was making it worse.</li>
<li> and I actually followed the directions and used less than recommended</li>
<li> When reviewing this product, my number one suggestion is to BE CAREFUL.</li>
<li> Within two days, my skin looked like dried out leather and the peeling followed shortly after.  </li>
<li> I decided to do small portions one at a time, starting with my forehead.  </li>
<li> I apply the neutralizer with a cotton pad, let it cool down my skin a bit, and then wash my face with cold water.  </li>
<li> Not worth trying this at home.</li>
<li> 2 stars for 10%, it helped some but 4 stars for the 20%, it helped a lot but it required about 10 days down time.</li>
<li> I am slightly worried because the peel migrated down to my cheekbone area where I have rosacea.  </li>
<li> Within three days, I noticed slight peeling.  </li>
<li> so some slight tingling and itchiness ( I would rate</li>
<li> I typically avoid any sun exposure there.</li>
<li> and while I&#x27;m at it I&#x27;ll do a swipe across my face ( because why not right!)</li>
<li> Burns a little.  </li>
<li> I read that you should use a a tip to ally but thought it would be too small to cover the area I was doing.</li>
<li> Just not a effective as baking soda and water.</li>
<li> The glass is very thin so be careful.</li>
<li> DO NOT GO OVERBOARD WHEN USING THIS!</li>
<li> I usually use baking soda!</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t mean for the peel to reach those areas</li>
<li> After approximately one minute, the peel started to burn REALLY bad.  </li>
<li> Although some manufacturers say you can just use cold water after an acid peel, I prefer something gentler.  </li>
<li> I immediately washed the area with cold water and applied a neutralizing solution, also purchased on Amazon.  </li>
<li> Bad idea.</li>
<li> It was so bad that my eyes were watering.  </li>

    <li> This works really great at neutralizing the peel...instantly!!</li>
    <li> This definitely did the trick for me! Took the burn away, instantly! So glad I tried it! I usually use baking soda! That was agony! And the sizzling noise from b/s scared me! This is a must!</li>
    <li> Great peel neutralizer. Easier then trying to make it yourself</li>
    <li> Works good but you don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this after my peel didn&#x27;t neutralize on it&#x27;s own as it&#x27;s box said it would.  The only issue is that I have to put a lot on my cotton ball to feel it working when I rub it on my skin.  I&#x27;ll still keep and use it, but for quicker action I&#x27;ll still use water with baking soda.</li>
    <li> Follow the instruction and this does work well</li>
    <li> This was a big relief using this post peel. But I ended up using the whole bottle with the first time. Think I will just use baking soda and water next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 with some sun damage on my lower legs. I bought it to see if it would help correct/ minimize it. I read that you should use a a tip to ally but thought it would be too small to cover the area I was doing. I used a cotton circle pad. Bad idea. So I applied it to my lower legs, then thought hmmmmmm maybe I&#x27;ll do the tops of my hands too....and while I&#x27;m at it I&#x27;ll do a swipe across my face ( because why not right!) so some slight tingling and itchiness ( I would rate</li>
    <li> Bought this to accompany a TCA peel from same company. Worked very well and I am pleased with the results</li>
    <li> Great product I though it would have a smell but nothing at all</li>
    <li> Boy, it definitely does what it says!</li>
    <li> im not sure how well this product actually works, because the chemical peel I used before it didn&#x27;t really do anything either.</li>
    <li> great price and sturdy</li>
    <li> I actually got better relief from baking soda and water. I used this [after] the burning had stopped. It seemed to be ok. Just not a effective as baking soda and water.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what is says. Follow the directions and you will have excellent results.</li>
    <li> Helped neutralize my skin nicely after a peel, but I dropped it and it broke instantly. The glass is very thin so be careful. Otherwise, great product</li>
    <li> I apply this neutralizer after facial peels and it works well. I use a 50% lactic acid gel peel which is pretty strong.  Although some manufacturers say you can just use cold water after an acid peel, I prefer something gentler.  I apply the neutralizer with a cotton pad, let it cool down my skin a bit, and then wash my face with cold water.  If you want to save money, a baking soda/water mixture will also do the trick.  But this product makes things easier.  Note: You won&#x27;t feel immediate relief from the burning, tingling, and heat with this product.  But it will help calm things down.</li>
    <li> I used this once because I needed to stop the peel quickly. Although my skin is used to peels somehow I got it on an area it should not have been.  Thank God I had this. It stopped the burning immediately. If you are considering a peel ad even if you are a pro at it, always have the neutralizer handy.  Like me,  I never thought I would need it. Well. I did and boy was happy I did.  I highly recommend you have it handy.</li>
    <li> Great product worked perfect with tca chemical peel</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE FAIR SKIN, START AT THE LOW DOSAGE OF 10MG AND USE IT SPARINGLY WITH BAKING SODA AND WATER OR WITH A NEUTALIZER! DO NOT GO OVERBOARD WHEN USING THIS! USE THE LOW DOSE AND WORK UP TO THE 15% OR TIME!!! THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT FOR A SKIN PEEL THAT WOULD COST YOU PLENTY AT A SPA OR BY A DERMATOLOGIST!</li>
    <li> Really helped to soothe the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; after my at home peel. At first I was worried that it was making it worse. It just takes a second for it to kick in. Love it. Very thankful I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This is misleading, I bought this to get rid of skin tags, this was recommended.  This should not be sold on line, this seems to be grade A professional stuff for peels.  It burns the bejeezus out of you and I actually followed the directions and used less than recommended and I still couldn&#x27;t stand the burn.  Not worth trying this at home.</li>
    <li> Bothered my wife&#x27;s eyes.</li>
    <li> This product was very effective! A &amp;#34;dark spot&amp;#34; that has bothered me for many years has lessened by more than 75% in appearance with 5-week&#x27;s usage. I&#x27;m impressed and highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve bought some for my sister, too!!</li>
    <li> does what is suppose to do... stop the burn!</li>
    <li> Works quickly to neutralize chemical peel solutions.</li>
    <li> So far so good, this item works, but stings  a lit bit when added to TCA.</li>
    <li> Neutralizes almost immediately. This is a must have for anyone using the higher percentage TCA. Even with the neutralizer you need to be super careful with any TCA.</li>
    <li> Good service? Good product.</li>
    <li> Burns a little.  Ha! Just do your research before you go applying acid to your face. ;)</li>
    <li> This product worked great.</li>
    <li> Just a description of my skin &amp;#34;type&amp;#34;  I am 37, with very mild wrinkles, moderate hyper pigmentation and fortunately no problems with acne.  I have minimal freckles and very light, somewhat sensitive skin.  I do tan slightly after some mild redness but my face burns easily. I typically avoid any sun exposure there. I also have mild rosacea right near my cheek area.  When reviewing this product, my number one suggestion is to BE CAREFUL. This product definitely works.  Please read the instructions and do a &amp;#34;test patch&amp;#34; before using anywhere on your face.  I decided to do small portions one at a time, starting with my forehead.  I applied it to my forehead area first.  It did burn, however not nearly as bad as other areas of my face.  Within three days, I noticed slight peeling.  Overall, my forehead now has a nice smooth appearance (post peel one week).  I then put it on top of my hands, without any burning noted.  My hands did peel much more than my forehead did.  They also look very smooth in appearance now. The third area I tried was my nasolabial folds (laugh lines).  After approximately one minute, the peel started to burn REALLY bad.  It was so bad that my eyes were watering.  I also noticed the &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; everyone talks about.  I immediately washed the area with cold water and applied a neutralizing solution, also purchased on Amazon.  Within two days, my skin looked like dried out leather and the peeling followed shortly after.  I did notice a decent reduction in fine lines and pore size in that area.  I am very happy with the results.  However, just today I applied the solution to my eye area, directly near my crows feet and under neath the outer portion of my eyes.  Again, I felt intense burning and noticed that this area frosted as well.  I am slightly worried because the peel migrated down to my cheekbone area where I have rosacea.  That area specifically is now a purplish red. I may be making a bigger deal of it than needed but I think I may have &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; that area, resulting in hyperpigmentation.  Its only been about 5 hours since i did the peel in that area, so I guess I will have to wait and see.  If it is now hyper pigmented, I will have to use a skin lightener, hydroquinone, and/or a steroid cream ( researched this all online).  I am not going to panic yet, however I suggest anyone with rosacea take extra precautions to avoid those areas at all costs.  I didn&#x27;t mean for the peel to reach those areas but it obviously did.  I will update my review at a later with final results.</li>
