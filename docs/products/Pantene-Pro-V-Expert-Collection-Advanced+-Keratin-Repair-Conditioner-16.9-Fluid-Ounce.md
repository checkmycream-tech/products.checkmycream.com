    <li> One of my favorite conditioners.  This really does restore your hair.  Makes your hair shiny and easy to manage.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference after using this conditioner but my hair stylist did. She said my scalp looked a lot healthier, less dry. It&#x27;s definitely more moisturizing than some other conditioners I&#x27;ve used but when I bought this along with the shampoo, I spent nearly $20. I&#x27;m still undecided about whether or not to repurchase.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feels smooth</li>
    <li> I use this after I shampoo as a leave in conditioner. When My hair is almost dry I pump a little into my hand and work through my hair. It give lots of volume and shine. Love the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair mostly straight with waves underneath. It is color-treated with a slightly coarse texture as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair so soft and touchable.  I can&#x27;t believe that Pantene is discontinuing their 16.9 oz pump bottle.  WHY????</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Its better than the ones you get from the store!</li>
    <li> it is a great conditioner and works so good for my hair,I just love the way my hair feels after using it.I mean Pantene keratin products are great specially for us who&#x27;s hair is thinning or lossing more than we have to,these are the perfect products,so I do recommend them highly.</li>

    <li> I love Pantene, you can&#x27;t beat it quality for the price and I have natural curly hair!</li>
    <li> This is very nice conditioner but not a miracle worker.  It helps with the dryness of my hair, but I was hoping that it would work miracles.</li>
    <li> Do you want shiny and beautiful hair? I&#x27;ve tried everything out there. High to lower price points and this is the line that is the best ever.</li>

    <li> Excellent conditioner. I read about it on http://www.paulaschoice.com/ (Paula Begoun, The Cosmetics Cop). I also use the shampoo. My hair is in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> This is a very good conditioner for dry and naturally curly hair.  My hair is grey and still curly.  I wear it long and like the way this advanced conditioning product makes my hair feel and look.  I get complements on my hair and am asked what products I use!</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;little orphan annie&amp;#34; hair from taking prednisone, and this is the only product that has made my hair soft again.
