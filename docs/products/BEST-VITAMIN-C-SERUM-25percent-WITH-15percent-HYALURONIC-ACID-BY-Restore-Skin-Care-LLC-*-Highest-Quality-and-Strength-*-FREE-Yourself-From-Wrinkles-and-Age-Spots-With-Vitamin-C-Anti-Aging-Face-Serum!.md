      <li>I have been trying more and various products in an endeavor to find the perfect combination for my skin to age &#x27;gracefully&#x27; in the Arizona sun.</li>
      <li>A fantastic Vitamin C Serum 25% and Hyaluronic Acid 15%!</li>
      <li>It is also brighter, more supple and smoother.</li>
      <li>She uses it every morning and evening and her skin looks more even toned and glows.  </li>

      <li>I wanted to start taking better care of my skin</li>
      <li>I love the way it absorbs immediately -</li>
      <li>My skin feels so much better after using this product.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to find this serum because it has 25% vitamin C and 15% Hyaluronic acid and that it much stronger than others that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>just received this serum 2 days ago: so far so good!</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and packaged nicely.  </li>
      <li>Pleased with results, and most definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>My skin looks smooth and more even toned.</li>
      <li>This Serum packs a Big amount of good quality cream!</li>
      <li>All the ingredients are there and they maintain their silkiness, making it easy to apply makeup or a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>The serum doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance to it, so its nice for those people that are sensitive to that kind of thing.</li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x60;s so gentle that its even ideal for sensitive</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet.</li>
      <li>I have always been a user of Vitamin C serums but to have 15% Hyaluric Acid is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>It goes on light and when it dries I can feel how my skin tightens which lifts the skin and fades the wrinkles.</li>
      <li>My skin looks smooth and polished after application.</li>
      <li>My face feels so fresh and my pores look better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>So far so good though.</li>
      <li>Thanks for coming out with such a great product!</li>
      <li>Also, they are far superior to the $200+</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I felt tightening and tingling( which is good and expected with a vitamin c product)</li>
      <li>The product feels very light and moisturizing on the skin, but I would like a higher hyaluronic percentage for aging skin.</li>
      <li>That was my main detemining factor for purchasing this product because it was called a serum... along with the combination of vitamin C and hyaluronic acid (nice combo).</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m sure you seasoned vitamin C users will agree with me...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not seen any significant improvements with my skin, but I intend to use the container.</li>
      <li>By the end, if there is a significant difference, I will continue with another bottle.</li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this a try as it has more vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid than most serums out there (I&#x27;ve tried several), and it comes with an airless pump bottle (gotta love that).</li>
      <li>The cream goes on smooth and dries quickly</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, dries quick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not as thick as I expected, but after the first application, I immediately felt my skin tightening.  It actually does contain the hightest percentage of Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acide that I have researched, and I plan on re-purchasing this product as needed.  Pleased with results, and most definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> i am new to using products for my face. i am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I havent used it much this serum is great leaves my skin super soft,really radiant. I like the bottle but i find the serumkind of watery. Other than that is doing its job hey thats what count.:) still i recommend this product. It doeant leave my skin red like other antiaging products which is great because i have really sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this serum. I have been trying more and various products in an endeavor to find the perfect combination for my skin to age &#x27;gracefully&#x27; in the Arizona sun. This serum works great with my other rituals, such as toner, moisturizer, and cleansers. The first application I pumped out seemed very &#x27;thin&#x27; in comparison to other serums I have used, but the quality is definitely in this product, and it isn&#x27;t oily. The results on my skin were felt immediately. My skin feels smoother, firmer, and brighter- all without any issues of breakouts from my sensitive skin. This is definitely a must for people of all skins types and goals.</li>
    <li> Just use 2 days and I can feel a fighting&lt;br /&gt;effect on my face  will keep using.  I like how it make my pores less noticeable too.</li>
    <li> I like this serum and believe it works well. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the consistency of it. it is very watery which makes it hard to control. The last vitamin C serum I used had a little more creamy feel which gave me better control</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference...</li>
    <li> Seems to tighten skin on face and has lightened some of my dark spots.</li>
    <li> Thin like water. This product is not a serum.</li>
    <li> nicely packaged and i just started using it with no problems.</li>
    <li> Really nice, smooth serum that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m happy with the portion size as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My skin looks smooth and polished after application. I love the tightening and plumping effect, and am hoping that I will see lasting improvement. I have been using for about 1 week, and can already tell there is improvement! I will reorder this product. Like the protective container, and prefer pump over dropper. Came quickly in protected wrapping.</li>
    <li> This serum really does make my skin look smoother and my pores smaller.  My only complaint is that it has the texture of water so it is difficult to apply.  Otherwise, I recommend it and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks now and I just love it!  I love the way it absorbs immediately - I do not like a greasy feeling left on my skin and this does not do that.  My skin feels very hydrated from this serum too.  I will definitely continue using this serum.</li>
    <li> I have try many face products ,but this one is by far the best of all. I love this product , it made a big difference in my skin , my face feels softer, firmer,and the puffy eyes omg ..it help to reduced that problem ,I have to say that I have found something that works and I intend to keep buying, I have only been using it for one month or so ,and I notice a dramatic change , do I recommend this products ...yes I do ,ladies it works at least for me ..... Its a must try product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see the really long term effects but I can say without a doubt my face is tighter and smoother. My foundation goes on much nicer after using this serum daily.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so much better after using this product. I started using it every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to bed. I use toner first, then the vitamin C serum and then I put a moisturizer on after I use it. I love the way it is making my skin look.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone. I&#x27;ll probably be the only one or just a few to say this and loose out on my &amp;#34;freebie&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t care because how can you write an honest review for people if it&#x27;s based on only getting something for FREE??? First of all I have to start of by saying they named this a serum and in my eyes and head a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; has at least a bit of substance and isn&#x27;t runny. Well this is like water and drips through your fingers when dispensing it! That was my main detemining factor for purchasing this product because it was called a serum... along with the combination of vitamin C and hyaluronic acid (nice combo). I do have to say though that I &amp;#34;lovve&amp;#34; the pump dispenser — easier to control than the dropper ones. Great design!! Also, I&#x27;m sure you seasoned vitamin C users will agree with me... all vitamin C products have an odd smell after they&#x27;re on your face. I don&#x27;t think this will ever change. Perhaps that&#x27;s a good thing being indicative of their performance? So far so good though. I&#x27;m in my fifth decade and I always get compliments on my skin. This is something that I&#x27;ve added to my repetoire for now until it&#x27;s finished so I&#x27;ll give it a three star for it&#x27;s work and price but not a 5 star for it&#x27; water-like substance and odor. Still looking for that one that is a true &amp;#34;SERUM&amp;#34; though — haven&#x27;t found it yet and I don&#x27;t know if it exists???</li>
    <li> I have used the lift and restore anti aging eye cream for almost a year and wow has it ever made a difference. Now I have added the Lift and Restore vitamin C serum and wow has it ever helped with my crows feet and aging spots I use it everyday simply awesome. Thanks for coming out with such a great product!</li>
    <li> watery, could not tell I even applied it. No difference</li>
    <li> just received this serum 2 days ago: so far so good! watery consistency but when you apply it on wet face-as recommended-become more like a very light oil but penetrate very quickly(and no oily feels) -it seems to work: already gave me a brighter-more even complexion.  -will put an update in few weeks (as 2 days are not enough!)  -update: a week later: i already see a difference in my complexion!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into the skin; instead it rubs off in little balls.</li>
    <li> A fantastic Vitamin C Serum 25% and Hyaluronic Acid 15%! It has ORGANIC AND NATURAL INGREDIENTS. I love it! My face feels so fresh and my pores look better than ever. Although the formula is oil-and-water-based, it is created to have an oil-free texture. In fact, serums are described as having a velvety finish. It can irritate sensitive skin. People with sensitive skin should look for vitamin C serums that are specifically designed for their skin type. The added collagen might reduce and prevent the signs of aging, such as wrinkles. Choose vitamin C serums with either ascorbic or L-ascorbic acid as the active ingredient. The hyaluronic acid serum actually helps the cells in your skin absorb and retain moisture. This gives your skin the soft and supple glow of youth that it&#x60;s been missing, it&#x60;s so gentle that its even ideal for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a great discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the vitamin C serum! I&#x27;ve had a few spots on my face for a few years, not sure how they came along. I&#x27;ve used I&#x27;ve been using this cream and I can really notice the difference. No crazy reaction on my face and I like the natural products in it. Definitely would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days, and I am really pleased!  My skin is noticeably softer and clearer.  I also use other Restore products and really like them as well.  Thank you Restore!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but I think this is a super product. I wanted to start taking better care of my skin so I looked into vitamin C serums. I tried a different brand first and it was okay. I thought I&#x27;d keep looking, well after I tried this one I know my search is over. My skin feels great!</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve only used it twice. My face is tighter and smoother.  Fine lines are less visible. It don&#x27;t have a smell so that&#x27;s great too. I may try more of the restore products!</li>
    <li> I think this product would be ideal for anyone with oily skin. I personally found it a bit too drying on my skin - even when I left my skin quite damp as instructed. That said, it is an excellent price and the air-tight packaging is fantastic. I&#x27;m sure it does a better job of preserving the Vitamin C than the &amp;#34;eye dropper&amp;#34; type of bottle that most Vitamin C serums seem to be packaged in.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I felt tightening and tingling( which is good and expected with a vitamin c product) the first night I used it! Its a little runnier than I expected but spreads well and little goes a long way.so far so good hope for good results since I just got it</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try as it has more vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid than most serums out there (I&#x27;ve tried several), and it comes with an airless pump bottle (gotta love that). However, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well, it&#x27;s too watery, didn&#x27;t feel like it absorbed into my skin, didn&#x27;t see the brightness on my face like I did with the others, my bottle is leaking and leaving a crusty white film around the seams and pump area. Finally after 3 weeks, the pump quit on me and is now dispensing tiny frustrating squirts of serum.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks so I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet. However, it definitely makes my skin feel tighter. I have to use a moisturizer afterward because it works so well. I use the serum at night.</li>
    <li> Only used it a week and I can already tell the difference. My face is clearer. It is also brighter, more supple and smoother. Hope it gets even better!</li>
    <li> Very good. Love that it is all natural.  Does make skin dry.  You need moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This Serum packs a Big amount of good quality cream!</li>
    <li> Was surprised to love this product so much. Initially, I wasn&#x27;t used to the watery consistency that seemed to just spill through my fingers. The last two ascorbyl serums I used (also purchased on Amazon) were just a tad more viscous and therefore easier to apply. But I&#x27;ve gotten used to that and it covers my whole face easily. It&#x27;s the highest percentage of ascorbyl that I could find on Amazon so that&#x27;s basically why I bought it. And I am very pleased with the affordable price. I shelled out over $100 for the SkinCeuticals Vit C serum which burned and stung (different form of Vit C) and was in no way superior to these other Vit C serums I&#x27;ve tried. Ascorbyl is a more stable form of Vit C and does NOT burn. This serum also has no fragrance, so there&#x27;s no clashing with other products. The other thing I love is the pump dispenser, which seems so much more sanitary, plus reduces oxidation of product. As long as this is the highest percentage of Vit C and remains affordable, I will buy it again and again. And again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see the really long term effects but I can say without a doubt my face is tighter and smoother. My foundation goes on much nicer after using this serum daily.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter and she loves it! She uses it every morning and evening and her skin looks more even toned and glows.  Shipped quickly and packaged nicely.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> A fantastic Vitamin C Serum 25% and Hyaluronic Acid 15%! It has ORGANIC AND NATURAL INGREDIENTS. I love it! My face feels so fresh and my pores look better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serums are specialists designed to deliver a high concentration of vitamin C. Although the formula is oil-and-water-based, it is created to have an oil-free texture. In fact, serums are described as having a velvety finish. Although the formulas do not leave an oily finish, the intensive formula can irritate sensitive skin. People with sensitive skin should look for vitamin C serums that are specifically designed for their skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Production&lt;br /&gt;Collagen is naturally present in the body. It is responsible for the plumpness of our skin. With age, however, collagen production begins to slow. Topical vitamin C serums can stimulate collagen production. The added collagen might reduce and prevent the signs of aging, such as wrinkles. Choose vitamin C serums with either ascorbic or L-ascorbic acid as the active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How Hyaluronic Acid Serum Improves Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid (also known as sodium hyaluronate) naturally occurs in our skin and joints. As we age, our body produces less hyaluronic acid, which encourages fine lines on your face and creaky joints in your knees. The secret of hyaluronic acid serum is that it deeply penetrates the skin with moisture. When applied to your skin, hyaluronic acid serum actually helps the cells in your skin absorb and retain moisture. This gives your skin the soft and supple glow of youth that it&#x60;s been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Although its name may imply that hyaluronic acid is a harsh exfoliant (such as an alpha hydroxy acid), this could not be further from the truth. Hyaluronic acid is actually extremely gentle and nourishing to the skin. In fact, it&#x60;s so gentle that its even ideal for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Great skin serum, item exactly as described, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find this serum because it has 25% vitamin C and 15% Hyaluronic acid and that it much stronger than others that I have tried.  I am having faster results and my skin is softer because of this serum.  I put it on after cleansing my face and then I add moisturizer on top of the serum.  The serum helps your skin to absorbe the moisturizer.  So happy to find this great product at a discount.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! It really restores your skin. My complexion is more even and sunspots are faded. I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Just one pump is enough.  I have been using for 2 weeks and can see a huge difference in my skin (especially my pores...amazing!!)  the wrinkles around my eyes are drastically reduced.  I love this and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the produce the back aging wax wet and smushed. The container included would not work. I&#x27;m not sure it it exploaded all over the package and is empty or if the pump nozel on the bottle is broke. Mot reall happy with what I recieved.</li>
    <li> Have not been using this long enough to tell the true results (hence the 4 stars), but it does make my skin feel great:  soft, smooth, tight. It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on easily.  I&#x27;m using it on my neck too.  I had a problem with my first bottle and was sent a replacement immediately.  Great service!</li>
    <li> This serum works wonders on sun damaged skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days only and I can already notice a difference in diminishing dark spots on my face. My skin looks smooth and more even toned. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is seeming to be a very fine product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product really boosts my skin texture and tone - it leaves my skin feeling nourished and healthy</li>
    <li> This serum really works.  I am so happy Restore is offering a serum that works with its Restore All-in-One Moisturizer.  After using the serum the skin on my face feels and looks so taught.  With these two products (having used the moisturizer for about 4 months and the serum for one month) I can hardly leave the house without someone complimenting my  appearance or asking if I have had some type of laser treatment on my face.  I love these products and highly recommend them.  Also, they are far superior to the $200+ products I tried before using Restore.</li>
    <li> This product shipped quickly. This product made my face feel very soft. I have only used this product a few times, so it is to early to tell if it is making my winkles go away. My only concern about the product is that it is very watery.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Please unsubscribe me,</li>
    <li> I am truly amazed at how wonderful this is.My skin feels so good it glows ! I love it :)</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days now, but I have been satisfied so far. The serum doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance to it, so its nice for those people that are sensitive to that kind of thing. Also a little goes a long way. I also haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product breaking me out.</li>
    <li> Great serum! It absorbs fast and does not leave a sticky residue on the skin. It does not roll off my skin when I apply a cream afterwards either. So far my skin seems brighter than before, enjoying this! *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> Love all of Restores products!!Makes my face feel soft but not greasy and makes wrinkles and bags less noticable.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seam any better then the 20% vitamin c.that was twice the ounces, but still good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this serum. It makes my skin feel so smooth and soft. The wrinkles around my mouth have definitely  faded. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in an intact box and works very well and leaves the skin feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  for two weeks now and can tell my skin seems firmer across the top of my cheek bones and my pores seem less noticeable!  Will definitely order this product again!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Been using a few days and so far, so good... Goes on smooth, dries quick. 8/7 update... Ordered my second bottle. Will keep using to are what kind of results I will get. So far, I do like the product. It is very light weight and non pore clogging.</li>
    <li> My skin is smoother in just 3 days!</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for a week.  It feels good I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet. I always use skin care products.  My problem is with towels.  And deep creases around my bottom lip.  Hopefully this product will help. I will post another update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great!  It smells good, not perfume-like, and not at all overpowering. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and makes my face smooth and my make up go on evenly and doesn&#x27;t feel dry. This is my second bottle and I&#x27;ve tried many others which were more expensive, and have only really liked this one! Thanks for a great product!!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It goes on light and when it dries I can feel how my skin tightens which lifts the skin and fades the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> After only using the product 3 or 4 times, it seems to really help with the lines &amp; smoothing them out. I&#x27;m sure with continued use, it will even get better!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this with my other facial products and its improving my skin</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lift &amp; Restore Anti-Aging cream for about a month and have just added Vitamin C Serum to my routine.  I&#x27;m 50 years old and was starting to feel the effects of gravity on my face.  I already see a difference in the tiny wrinkle lines that used to be around my eyes and seem to be disappearing.  The cream goes on smooth and dries quickly so I can apply my make-up right over it.  My face feels more hydrated and smoother than it did before.  Am anxious to see what adding the Vitamin C serum does for me!  So far I am a big fan of Restore Skin Care products!</li>
    <li> This serum is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a Vitamin C serum. It is 99%Natural and contains Hyaluronic acid so moisture stays on your skin. This serum is different because you apply it while your face is still damp from washing, It feels silky out of the bottle and retains the silkiness on your face. After the serum, I applied my Lift and Restore cream All in One. The two together pack a vitamin and wrinkle repair punch.  All the ingredients are there and they maintain their silkiness, making it easy to apply makeup or a sunscreen.  There is no stickiness. It arrived promptly and in good condition.  The first thing I do with a new product is to put a drop or two on the palm of my hand. I liked the feel of it immediately and knew right away that this was my new Vitamin C serum. I had tried others but they seemed sticky so I used them only at night</li>
    <li> I have always been a user of Vitamin C serums but to have 15% Hyaluric Acid is a huge plus. Have used it for 5 days and can already see results!!!!! Love that it such a clean natural product as well! Thank you</li>
    <li> Useful for me...I  love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum since I received it and it does have a tightening effect when applied. I&#x27;ve not seen any significant improvements with my skin, but I intend to use the container. By the end, if there is a significant difference, I will continue with another bottle.</li>
    <li> Best product and best brand</li>
    <li> The product feels very light and moisturizing on the skin, but I would like a higher hyaluronic percentage for aging skin.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and am very impressed with it. When applying as directed it leaves my skin feeling smooth with a slight tightening tingly effect. It is full of ingredients suggested by my dermatologist for good skin care such as vitamin C, vitamin E and hyaluronic acid.  All of the ingredients are organic and natural. I apply it before my Restore anti aging cream and love the way my skin feels!</li>
