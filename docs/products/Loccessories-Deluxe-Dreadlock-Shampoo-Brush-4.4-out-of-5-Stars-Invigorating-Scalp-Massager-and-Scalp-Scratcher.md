      <li>but this does feel really nice against my scalp</li>

      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Love using this product</li>
      <li>Love the feel of the brush on my scalp.</li>
      <li>so I still need to use my hands to move them around and make sure I got shampoo where I needed it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also able to get a pretty good lather going with it once I start it with my fingers.</li>
      <li>I was fine without it.</li>
      <li>It is good for getting down to the scalp to thoroughly massage while shampooing and for itchy scalp without injury from nails, etc.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it would tangle my locks, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>A I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how fast u arrived!</li>

      <li>I never quite feel like I really get as much massage/contact with my scalp as I would like now that I have dreads, so I decided to give this gadget a try.</li>
      <li>Now that my hair is in dreadlocks I have it out and ready to use.  </li>
      <li>The problem I have with it is, is it really needed?</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>Soft,  short,  &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; massage your scalp.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time when I last retwisted my hair, and the scalp massage I received was head and shoulders above what I could achieve with my fingers minus the danger of scratching my scalp with my nails.</li>
      <li>It really gets down in between the dreads and massages and exfoliates the scalp.</li>
      <li>It REALLY helps me get down to my scalp with my shampoo.</li>
      <li>I gave one to my sister who wears a loose natural.  </li>
      <li>Works very well, I wash my hair ( probably more than I am supposed to) being that I have locs , this keeps the scalp clean and dandruff free, I hate dirty locs or dreads</li>

<li> My daughter is 8 with hair down to her butt...</li>
<li> I had never encountered a grooming tool just for locs, much less a scalp massager.  </li>

    <li> I have not used mine yet but my friend said she loves hers.  i  forgot about using it since it&#x27;s a habit to use my fingers.  Now that my hair is in dreadlocks I have it out and ready to use.  The construction is good ESP for the price.  Thanks again</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever ordered for my hair.</li>
    <li> Soft,  short,  &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; massage your scalp. The handle is ergonomically correct. Bright, happy colors. Works great!</li>
    <li> It is good for getting down to the scalp to thoroughly massage while shampooing and for itchy scalp without injury from nails, etc.</li>
    <li> If you have dreads this is a MUST HAVE! I have needed something to get to my roots and give me a good clean washing! My fingernails seems to losen my roots while this brush knots them up while shampooing! This can be used for regular hair without dreads as well. My daughter is 8 with hair down to her butt... She&#x27;s using this brush as well and raves over it. So happy to have bought this! Awesome seller, fast shipping!</li>

    <li> This thing is awesome.  I had never encountered a grooming tool just for locs, much less a scalp massager.  I got a great wash without having to use my nails.  It will not tangle or mat your hair, but it also won&#x27;t comb it, which is great if you have locs.  (:  The massage feels amazing, too.  I promise it feels better than your fingers.  I gave one to my sister who wears a loose natural.  She gave it the same glowing review.  Folks, we&#x27;ve got a winner.</li>
