    <li> Nice product. Well shipped.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> A great shampoo for my tinted hair.  It conditions and rinses out very well.  I enjoy using it very much.</li>
    <li> If you have colored your hair and want the color to last, then you must get this shampoo!  I was able to go almost three months before my next coloring. Great product used in conjunction with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo based on recommendations on Amazon.com. I have thick, somewhat coarse,short, blond-colored hair. I wash only 2 times/wk. After 2 weeks of using this shampoo, even with follow-up with an excellent conditioner, my hair was dry and scalp itchy. I went back to a left-over bottle of KMS California color vitality, a good product but I had discontinued it  because I didn&#x27;t  like the color tone (too ashy)  it left. Immediately, my hair is healthier and scalp not itching. I will donate the Matrix to a homeless shelter but with the warning that it should be used by women without dry-type hair.&lt;br /&gt;Susan E</li>
    <li> This is the cheaper line from Biolage &amp; my hairdresser suggested it. Love it. My color is very light blonde &amp; this definately maintains a great color. Smells wonderful &amp; excellent price from amazon :)</li>
    <li> Very large container&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is wonderful fir my blond colored hair&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit difficult to handle the larger size bottle</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff!  Great price</li>
    <li> Product was yellowed as though old or exposed to heat for a length of time.  I really did not have the time to return it for a replacement.  I&#x27;m using the product, but leary of the quality.</li>
    <li> This gives a great shine and body. Works great with the companion conditioner which adds a nice texture to my hair.</li>
