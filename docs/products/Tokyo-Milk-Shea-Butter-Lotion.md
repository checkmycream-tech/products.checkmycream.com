      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love their products.</li>
      <li>I love the scent because it&#x27;s not flowery or overly feminine.</li>
      <li>and I am really glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I ordered this scent because I love it in the perfume version.</li>
      <li>and I love the moisturizing feel and smell.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, the feel, and the packaging.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and feel.  </li>
      <li>I really love</li>
      <li>Love this hand cream.</li>
      <li>Aveeno hand cream with the oat ingredient is a million times better.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the way this lotion feels, non greasy.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, great product.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought the accompanying parfum.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a special treat...go ahead and get you some Tokyo Milk!</li>
      <li>Very clean and light smell.  </li>
      <li>I like my scents annoyingly strong, yep I&#x27;m that person...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long on me as others have noted, nor do I think this one is especially strong.</li>
      <li>It is also light weight.</li>
      <li>Lux, smooth, pleasure.</li>
      <li>Fun!</li>
      <li>Love this product, scent is very feminine but also unique.</li>
      <li>This hand creme looks cool and smells good, but if you want an actual moisturizer then you can find better ones much cheaper.</li>
      <li>The cool name, the even cooler packaging, how can you resist?</li>
      <li>I adore that scent, and its pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Shipment was quick as well</li>
      <li>Always ships quickly</li>
      <li>Packaging is funky and fun.  </li>
      <li>Love the name since I&#x27;m old</li>
      <li>I love it and save it for only special days when I want to feel....</li>
      <li>The smell is heavenly, very unusual.</li>
      <li>absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>I have used other scents by Tokyo Milk that I also liked, but decided to try this one</li>
      <li>well, dead sexy!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
      <li>This lotion soaks right in, and keeps smelling sweet all day long.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using Dead Sexy</li>
      <li>Dead sexy really suits the smell; it&#x27;s not your average sexy-girl smell, there&#x27;s more depth to it than that.</li>
      <li>I also ordered No.62 Tainted Love (in the black tubes)  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall its a decent scent and a decent lotion.</li>
      <li>I tried the Dead Sexy perfume in a boutique one day and the scent just lingered so much,</li>
      <li>I like to layer with the parfum spray of Dead Sexy.  </li>
      <li>Arrived undamaged by seller and early.</li>
      <li>The perfume looked like it had been opened and the smell was intense enough to agree with that assessment.</li>
      <li>The only thing Im really not thrilled with is the cap, sure its cute and &amp;#34;fits&amp;#34; the styling but its a little tough to get back on the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:  I ordered Dead Sexy No. 6 (labeled as Deep Vanilla, Exotic Wood, White Orchid and Ebony)</li>
      <li>While the shea butter came in the original box, the accompanying perfume was wrapped in torn, brownish paper that had been put in a small bubble wrap baggie.</li>
      <li>It takes very little to work its magic, so despite the price, it should last a long time.</li>
      <li>I sure wouldn&#x27;t make it my everyday lotion since I like those to be thicker and less pricey.</li>
      <li>It is not strong like perfume but the lightness remains and is powerful.</li>
      <li>Hard to describe - worth checking out for yourself!</li>
      <li>but it sure isn&#x27;t moisturizing these tired dry winter</li>

<li> For a hand cream it does not really moisturize my dry hands.</li>
<li> Lets break it down, then its up to you.&lt;br</li>
<li> A boon for ultra sensitive skin, especially in the cold months.  </li>
<li> It is definitely thick and creamy vs. having a lotion feel.</li>
<li> Its not as thick as I was expecting coming from a tube but not greasy at all.</li>
<li> This is a luxurious lotion and the scent is subtle, but just noticeable.</li>
<li> This lotion is a tad thin</li>
<li> You will not be sorry if you purchase it.</li>
<li> I use it all over my body, not just my hands and the scent drives my guy crazy!</li>
<li> /&gt;Although I was a bit disappointed with the size of the tube at the price, it is still the coolest packaging Ive seen in a while!</li>
<li> this is hysterical to tell peeps what the name of my scent is</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started out with the perfume and then ordered the cream in order to layer. I love it. It softens without leaving a greasy feeling to the skin. The smell is heavenly, very unusual. I just wish it came in a larger container!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a lotion to double as a perfume, this is the stuff for you! This lotion soaks right in, and keeps smelling sweet all day long. It takes very little to work its magic, so despite the price, it should last a long time. I love the scent because it&#x27;s not flowery or overly feminine. Dead sexy really suits the smell; it&#x27;s not your average sexy-girl smell, there&#x27;s more depth to it than that. Hard to describe - worth checking out for yourself! I love it and save it for only special days when I want to feel....well, dead sexy!</li>
    <li> the wife loved it. life is good</li>
    <li> A boon for ultra sensitive skin, especially in the cold months.  Beautfiully scented luxury in a tube.  Lux, smooth, pleasure.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Dead Sexy and I love it. I have used other scents by Tokyo Milk that I also liked, but decided to try this one and I am really glad I did.  I put it on my hands last night and the scent is still there this morning.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the spray</li>
    <li> I love tokyo milk, i wish more stores carried this line, the smell is amazing!!!!!! Shipment was quick as well</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hand creme!! I use it all over my body, not just my hands and the scent drives my guy crazy!</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of hand lotion in Harrod&#x27;s about a year ago, and didn&#x27;t by it but started looking for it, and finally found it here. Great lotion and a scent I really love</li>
    <li> Love this product, scent is very feminine but also unique.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> One of the milder scents. Very nice. Arrived undamaged by seller and early.</li>
    <li> I will continue to order Tokyo Milk products.  The lotions and body washes are great - not too overpowering.  Packaging is funky and fun.  Love their products.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and metal tubing gives a feel for a quality product. Was a gift and the receiver absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is wonderful. It smells great and is soothing. It is definitely thick and creamy vs. having a lotion feel.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Always ships quickly</li>
    <li> This is a great hand creme.  It smells divine.  It makes a great gift as its packaged so beautifully and every girl needs hand creme now and then!</li>
    <li> Smells Devoon! Love the name since I&#x27;m old this is hysterical to tell peeps what the name of my scent is and they do ask!</li>
    <li> This is a luxurious lotion and the scent is subtle, but just noticeable. It doesn&#x27;t overpower my perfume. There are lots to choose from along  with matching perfumes</li>
    <li> The cool name, the even cooler packaging, how can you resist? Lets break it down, then its up to you.&lt;br /&gt;Although I was a bit disappointed with the size of the tube at the price, it is still the coolest packaging Ive seen in a while!

It just melts into your skin but it sure isn&#x27;t moisturizing these tired dry winter hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a decent scent and a decent lotion. I sure wouldn&#x27;t make it my everyday lotion since I like those to be thicker and less pricey. But if you&#x27;re looking for a special treat...go ahead and get you some Tokyo Milk!</li>
    <li> I tried the Dead Sexy perfume in a boutique one day and the scent just lingered so much, I *had* to buy it. As I&#x27;ve bought their hand creme before, it&#x27;s great to combine the two. This hand creme absorbs easily and does a good job of keeping your skin moisturized, while the lotion does have a wonderful scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm yet lingers a bit. Don&#x27;t let the skulls fool you, this is indeed sexy!</li>
    <li> So the scent of passion!!! I use it like perfume and it stays with me for all of the day. It is not strong like perfume but the lightness remains and is powerful.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way this lotion feels, non greasy. My friends are always asking where I got my perfume, I tell them &amp;#34; it is my lotion&amp;#34;. I just bought 3 more boxes for my daughter-in-laws, so they will stop using mine when they come over!</li>
    <li> My step-daughter buys this for me quite often, but not often enough....lol.  I like the scent because it&#x27;s not over-powering but has a musky scent.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly from the seller and smells delicious. It is creamy and rich and feels great on the skin. I loved it so much I bought the accompanying parfum.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a tad thin but it&#x27;s very hydrating. The packaging and the tube are so cute and I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream. Love the smell, the feel, and the packaging.</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars because the cream has no smell to it what so ever. I ordered this scent because I love it in the perfume version.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I have used it before.  It smells wonderful, goes on great, and it has an attractive old-fashioned metal tube. Fun!</li>
    <li> While the shea butter came in the original box, the accompanying perfume was wrapped in torn, brownish paper that had been put in a small bubble wrap baggie. The perfume looked like it had been opened and the smell was intense enough to agree with that assessment. What happened to the box it was supposed to come in? I have purchased these two items from a boutique before and know how they should look. I will not buy from this vender again.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion. Quick delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Deja las manos muy suaves y el olor es delicioso. Muy contenta con esta compra, recomiendo esta crema sin ninguna duda</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell, very light, however. It is also light weight.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel.  I like to layer with the parfum spray of Dead Sexy.  Very clean and light smell.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I saw the product when we went wine tasting in the Solvang area, but they only had the tester.  I found it online and I love the moisturizing feel and smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this TOKYOMILK/Bon Bon Shea Butter Lotion song in D Minor and I. Have to say its to die for. Not greasy and the scent. Will just let you drift away. It is the best I have ever ever found. You will not be sorry if you purchase it.</li>
    <li> This ended up in my drawer and I no longer use it. I love the way it smells but that&#x27;s it. For a hand cream it does not really moisturize my dry hands. even if i apply it before bed and wake up, my hands are still dry. Aveeno hand cream with the oat ingredient is a million times better. This hand creme looks cool and smells good, but if you want an actual moisturizer then you can find better ones much cheaper.</li>
