      <li>I advice ppl to exfoliate before using it for best results, as flaky areas are accentuated with use.  </li>
      <li>It works perfectly for me and my skin type and tone.  </li>

      <li>sometimes you have to apply more in areas that need more coverage, but still a great product.  </li>
      <li>It feels really nice, glides on like water.</li>
      <li>as I would a face lotion and the color kind of just blends itself.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you use the right moisturiser, for me it works best with Eucerin Dermo Purifier Creme-Gel.</li>

      <li>It smells extremely nice and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product!</li>
      <li>then it looks ok on my face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like or need a lot of coverage, mostly to even my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than the foundation cream I have been using</li>
      <li>Can be applied heavier for more coverage.</li>
      <li>and I am ordering a darker tone for summer :))</li>
      <li>It does have a strong perfume-y fragrance, which I don&#x27;t mind, but many might.  </li>
      <li>Or it&#x27;s a great compliment to more dramatic styles because it just brightens your face and makes everything look flawless.</li>
      <li>I read the other reviews here at Amazon and decided to give MISSHA M Perfect a try.</li>
      <li>Blush went easily over it, as well as concealer.  </li>
      <li>Easy to blend with finger.</li>
      <li>It makes your sking look fine.</li>
      <li>- The product goes on grey-ish and light but blends in after a while  </li>
      <li>box said #23 is light beige and</li>
      <li>It goes on a tad light but within minutes it conforms to your color.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and so far so good.</li>
      <li>This was my first BB cream, so I didn&#x27;t know better.  </li>
      <li>I also have a smaller size of the bright beige</li>
      <li>The colors are true to their description.</li>
      <li>Feels a bit cool on the face.</li>
      <li>Unlike foundation, you don&#x27;t have to work at rubbing it in or blending around the edges to make sure you don&#x27;t have that line around your face that makes it look like you have a mask on--I put about as much effort into rubbing it in</li>
      <li>You might think \\&quot;wow that is alot to put on\\&quot; but honestly you dont feel it.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, love it but just wish they have more different colors to choose from.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who likes to look good with the least efforts and discomfort.</li>
      <li>The quality of this product is better than the high end dept store products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t want a lot of makeup, but you want a little something.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely worth it</li>
      <li>was right as well.</li>
      <li>if I got the right</li>
      <li>(a full pump is way too much), and I just use it around my T-zone and under my eyes to brighten everything up.  </li>
      <li>I do love bare minerals but after a while my oily skin causes the make up to look clumpy and rubs off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not pale, but I burn easily.  </li>
      <li>It lasted really well, and other than a dab of translucent powder in the t-zone, it looked pretty darn good all day.  </li>
      <li>It also brightens my face and made my already pretty face, prettier.;)</li>
      <li>I tried it myself, and the product doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I first had (#21).</li>
      <li>Overall, I love the convenience of having a primer, foundation and SPF in one, which is what led me to buy this product.  </li>
      <li>I had compliments the first days I wore this.  </li>
      <li>It covers pretty well</li>
      <li>when I open the bb cream, i wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
      <li>I think anyone who purchases this should be aware that this product in any shade that it is pretty water resistant.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used BB cream.  </li>
      <li>later, I think it might match my skin tone better  -</li>
      <li>I looove this bb cream, it was my first bb cream trail</li>
      <li>make sure you USE ONLY A PINCH!</li>
      <li>and I love it, it even covers and adjusts to my medium dark skin tone, its fantastic</li>
      <li>I was very worried at first when I first purchased this product without testing it.  </li>
      <li>I might put it on directly like using a liquid foundation then add some powder matching my skin tone for special occasions.</li>
      <li>overall, I am quite satisfied  - highly recommended seller/product  -</li>
      <li>And to be honest I&#x27;m quite disappointed and don&#x27;t understand why everyone is so happy with it.</li>
      <li>, I use it is certain areas.</li>
      <li>- arrived super fast, packaged well, was surprised how fast it was  - bought the 30ml but a 50ml version arrived  </li>
      <li>if you use too much youre going to end up looking like a ghost.   </li>
      <li>I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
      <li>This product really works for me.</li>
      <li>doubt about this product and stop using it, is that really Missha?</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This BB Cream had lessen my need for concealer, I just placed a little concealer on my HUGE pimples and to my very dark eye circles and set it with my finishing powder and i&#x27;m good to go. It also lasts and it did not make my oily face, oilier. It also brightens my face and made my already pretty face, prettier.;)</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth it and I am ordering a darker tone for summer :)) Just make sure you use the right moisturiser, for me it works best with Eucerin Dermo Purifier Creme-Gel.</li>
    <li> This product really works for me. I am Asian (tan skin) this color is perfect to. I also have a smaller size of the bright beige, I use it is certain areas. Missha is awesome, it blend well. It makes your sking look fine. Makes me prettier!! Yehey!</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream. It feels really nice, glides on like water. Easy to blend with finger. Feels a bit cool on the face. It definitely helps hide my blemishes and acne scars.</li>
    <li> Great product, perfect amount of light coverage if applied lightly.  Can be applied heavier for more coverage. I don&#x27;t like or need a lot of coverage, mostly to even my skin tone.  This works perfectly!</li>
    <li> best BB cream that suit me well, perfectly cover all my freckles on my face and hands.  with SPF42, i only wear it alone as a sun screen and foundation.  love it!</li>
    <li> I was also leery to try a new face product without testing it first. I read the other reviews here at Amazon and decided to give MISSHA M Perfect a try. I&#x27;ve literally spent hundreds of dollars on foundation and I have to say, this is   a WELL KEPT SECRET. My skin looks flawless. The colors are true to their description. I highly recommend this foundation. It is excellent.</li>
    <li> This bb cream has an SPF of 42!!! That is pretty awesome in itself! But you also get amazing coverage! Will defently repurchase this item again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews before purchasing this item. And to be honest I&#x27;m quite disappointed and don&#x27;t understand why everyone is so happy with it. The first and main issue, that the coverage is not perfect and the face looks like plastic and also it is visible that you have foundation on the face, even my husband noticed that I have foundation while usually I&#x27;m wearing clinique perfectly real foundation every day and he never noticed that. Also the instructions said to not apply anything under the bb cream and my skin feels tight. Overall, I think that probably bb cream is a good solution for photosessions, but not for everyday.</li>
    <li> I was very worried at first when I first purchased this product without testing it.  However, I am one of those shoppers that research everything before I buy; needless to say, I finally purchased this product and I must say it is an amazing product.  It smells extremely nice and easy to apply.  Unlike liquid foundation this is a cream so it won&#x27;t go on blotchy or leave makeup marks.  It covers pretty well sometimes you have to apply more in areas that need more coverage, but still a great product.  I have extremely oily skin so I usually wear Shiseido&#x27;s matte primer(which is a wonderful product in itself)over my primer before adding the BB cream to keep it from getting oily. You might think \\&quot;wow that is alot to put on\\&quot; but honestly you dont feel it.  My skin has never looked better and flawless.  I&#x27;ve tried bare minerals, over the counter makeups, este lauder, clinque, and all types of makeup this seems to work for me.  I do love bare minerals but after a while my oily skin causes the make up to look clumpy and rubs off.  For those debating about this product with very dry skin, I got this for my friend with dry skin and it helps keep her face moist and radiant. She loves this product. Unfortunately the two different colors that they offer is still very light.  So if you have a tan this might not be for you.  I am medium to medium light and it works great so hopefully it will work for you too.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It&#x27;s a foundation, concealer and a sunblock too. It&#x27;s long lasting but you don&#x27;t even feel it after putting it on. I&#x27;m the kind of person who likes to look good with the least efforts and discomfort. The heavy makeup and cakey powder is just not for me. My face looks brighter after putting on the BB cream and you won&#x27;t even know I have anything on my face. I also dab a bit more on my dark circle and blemish then I look flawless - naturally. You would think I have very good skin. The only drawback is the color of the BB cream is a bit too light for my skin tone. I&#x27;m an Asian female with medium skin tone. Now I mix it with my lotion then it looks ok on my face. I might put it on directly like using a liquid foundation then add some powder matching my skin tone for special occasions. Anyway, love it but just wish they have more different colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> I am going to make this review short and sweet.  This is the first time I have used BB cream.  I had compliments the first days I wore this.  It goes on a tad light but within minutes it conforms to your color.  Covers up every up every imperfection and it feels like I am wearing nothing.  No rubbing off on clothes, phone, etc.  Stays put until I take it off.  I will never go back to using a foundation again.  The quality of this product is better than the high end dept store products.  I have used them all unfortunately.  FINALLY found my base.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This color is a good match for me.  I am fair/light complexion wise.  I wear an N4 in MAC Studio Fix (for reference) and No. 23 was a good match.  I think anyone who purchases this should be aware that this product in any shade that it is pretty water resistant.  It does not come off easily, which is a good thing, but can also be a bad thing if you&#x27;re not using a thorough enough cleanser. Seriously, plain ole Cetaphil probably isn&#x27;t going to get it off. I had a little bit of a breakout because of this. It has medium coverage, with a sort of airbrushed finish.  It lasted really well, and other than a dab of translucent powder in the t-zone, it looked pretty darn good all day.  I applied with my fingers and then blended it with a foundation brush.  Blush went easily over it, as well as concealer.  It does have a strong perfume-y fragrance, which I don&#x27;t mind, but many might.  Overall, I love the convenience of having a primer, foundation and SPF in one, which is what led me to buy this product.  If you&#x27;re looking for the same, I say try it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product! I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and so far so good. I am Indian and therefore have tanner skin. However, I use this product as a base for my foundation. It keeps my make up set all day and has a good deal of SPF to keep my skin looking youthful. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The BB cream I received caused major skin irritation for me and my sister.  We both broke out after using it for one day.  The fragrance was very strong, and the consistency was very thick and greasy.  This was my first BB cream, so I didn&#x27;t know better.  I went to a local Korean mall that sold the product and tested it.  The Missha BB cream at the mall smelled different and was not as greasy.  Definitely not the same one I received from Amazon.  I may have received an expired product or an imitation.  Either way, I&#x27;m tossing it out.</li>
    <li> - arrived super fast, packaged well, was surprised how fast it was  - bought the 30ml but a 50ml version arrived  - the bb cream is excellent  - I advice ppl to exfoliate before using it for best results, as flaky areas are accentuated with use.  - The product goes on grey-ish and light but blends in after a while  - I might buy the No. 27 later, I think it might match my skin tone better  - overall, I am quite satisfied  - highly recommended seller/product  - btw, I am a guy, but I heard that Korean male actors also use this product</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon market place which is much cheaper compare to the official Missha website, I saw one review saying this product was fake after I ordered the item and was worried.  I then decided to also order the same product directly from Missha for my sister, I then did a product compare with the one I received from Amazon, they look/smell/feel exactly the same!  So I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase with Amazon that was cheaper and shipped faster than Missha.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin type. It is medium coverage, but what I don&#x27;t like is it makes my skin oily.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these BB Cream. Shipping was great.  But the product itself I think is expired.  But one of the girls in the forum said it may be manufacturing date and not expiration date so I went ahead and gave it to my friend. Unfortunately, the first day she tried it, her face broke out.  I tried it myself, and the product doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I first had (#21). This one is more oily and not much coverage. I also get slight reaction to this version as oppose to #21.  Either the ingredients on these products are different OR I got a really expired item OR I got a fake.  I really can&#x27;t tell.  Returning them to seller.  I feel bad for giving this product 2 stars if this is an expired or fake product. I still want to try #23. But I am hoping to get an unexpired/authentic  BB cream.</li>
    <li> love this product!!! this will always be my favorite bb cream!</li>
    <li> I went through a phase of trying to find foundation/concealer/sunblock (or something that encompasses it all) and after a couple different combinations, i&#x27;ve got a winner! It is a pretty natural consistent cover and I like it a lot. Even though it whitens my skin a teeny bit, overall it stays on the natural side. I don&#x27;t usually use heavy makeup but was just looking for something natural and wearable for everyday purposes and this does a nice job of covering up blemishes/redness. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again~</li>
    <li> not as white as i expected. goes on white but after a minute it blends to match your skin.  it also makes your pore and skin look smooth although coverage is nothing to go crazy about.  i used this after my toner and lotion, and finish it off with powder to cover my red spots and hold the bb cream in place.  make sure you USE ONLY A PINCH! small amount covers  a lot more than you would expect. if you use too much youre going to end up looking like a ghost.   i will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> when I open the bb cream, i wasn&#x27;t sure if I got the right item.&lt;br /&gt;The box said #23 is light beige and when i look at the cream itself, it said #23 is natural beige.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not sure which one is right.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt about this product and stop using it, is that really Missha?</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cream.  Covers well and has a very pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;Price was right as well. I like it better than the foundation cream I have been using&lt;br /&gt;from Clinique....</li>
    <li> I bought this after doing some research on what the &#x27;best&#x27; BB creams were (it seems like the highest rated ones were all from Korea). When it came out of the tube I thought, &amp;#34;WHOA, this is way too dark, and way too gray&amp;#34;, but I had read similar first impressions from other people and gave it a try. It is AWESOME. It gives you the coverage of a foundation without the heavy look or feel, and the color ended up matching perfectly (apparently all the shades look gray at first but the product oxidizes once it&#x27;s on your skin. Unlike foundation, you don&#x27;t have to work at rubbing it in or blending around the edges to make sure you don&#x27;t have that line around your face that makes it look like you have a mask on--I put about as much effort into rubbing it in as I would a face lotion and the color kind of just blends itself. It also smells really good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sometimes-sensitive skin. I have some problem areas so I still use a spot concealer but the two together give great results--someone with better skin could probably use just this and look great. I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I looove this bb cream, it was my first bb cream trail and I love it, it even covers and adjusts to my medium dark skin tone, its fantastic</li>
    <li> After reading all the great review, I purchased if.  And when I received the product it was expired.  And it made my skin grayish.  Maybe this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works perfectly for me and my skin type and tone.  I have oily, sensitive skin.  The moisture and the SPF work wonderfully with my skin.  If it helps anyone, I am mestisa (White American-Filipino), with, I would say, a cool-olive skin tone.  I&#x27;m not pale, but I burn easily.  I generally wear a natural beige, or medium beige.  I don&#x27;t use this product every day, so this bottle has lasted a very long time for me.  I generally use a quarter pump to a half pump (a full pump is way too much), and I just use it around my T-zone and under my eyes to brighten everything up.  It makes my skin look flawless with a natural, dew-like finish.  It&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t want a lot of makeup, but you want a little something.  Or it&#x27;s a great compliment to more dramatic styles because it just brightens your face and makes everything look flawless.</li>
