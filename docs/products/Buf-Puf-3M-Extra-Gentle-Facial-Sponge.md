      <li>Perfect for exfoliating my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I found these @ 6 for $23 and change which is the best price so far.  </li>
      <li>After purchasing these and using them for a month or so, I can honestly say they are ok, I guess.</li>
      <li>Still way more cost effective than a $30 tube of exfoliating cleanser.</li>
      <li>Excellent for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>it is very good for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>and it is quick to try making it a good add-on in my travelling kit.</li>
      <li>feel many exfoliating devices or creams.  </li>
      <li>I had spent a great deal of time researching the cost as the price of buf-pufs varies greatly -</li>
      <li>I can remember you were able to get these everywhere</li>
      <li>Love them.  </li>
      <li>I just had my dermatological screening and my doctor said it is the reason my skin is so smooth!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them for years and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care to use a wash cloth and a Buf Puf exfoliates better.  </li>
      <li>I have been using these for more decades than I care to admit.</li>
      <li>I love buff puffs.  </li>
      <li>I love bufpuf</li>

      <li>So glad Amazon carries it cause</li>
      <li>I love love love these.</li>
      <li>Said the pricing was awesome even compared to the big box discount stores.</li>
      <li>I have used these for years and love them.</li>
      <li>I use it once a day in place of a washcloth and maintain a nice, smooth complexion without injury or irritation</li>
      <li>So findIng them here in a multipack makes them much more affordable.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, easy sale, great product.</li>
      <li>I have been really happy with the results so far!</li>
      <li>This is great for people who don&#x27;t want to shell out money for something like the Clarisonic but also want something gentle to exfoliate and clean their face.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re gentle yet do a great job of getting my skin clean.</li>
      <li>My skin is easily irritated, so these extra gentle Pufs are perfect for my needs.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using these facial sponges they are great for exfoliating the skin.</li>
      <li>and it is a nice, gentle exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>They sort of &#x27;pricey&#x27; but cheap compared to those rubs/creams/exfoliants....</li>
      <li>They work great on his teen skin</li>
      <li>Oh my goodness, my skin texture is so smooth AND the pores are finer in just 3 days.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone who needs a great daily cleansing pad.</li>
      <li>They are definitly EXTRA gentle, which is perfect, but the material tends to ball up like a wool sweater after a couple weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>These extra gentle pufs are just the best ever............</li>
      <li>The extra gentle Pufs are perfect.</li>
      <li>Found these originally on drugstore.com, and will now purchase them in bulk on Amazon.com for the better deal because they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
      <li>Always use this product to keep face clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>, they need to be rinsed squeeze the water out of them and then for good measure you can shake them out and make sure they dry out.  </li>
      <li>I am willing to spend more for them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Just be sure to rub really gently when using them!  </li>
      <li>When I don&#x27;t have them my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
      <li>and although I&#x27;m in the \\&quot;wrinkle years\\&quot; I don&#x27;t really have many.  </li>
      <li>I will keep buying my Buf Puf and staying with my simple regimen until the day I die: It is that good.</li>
      <li>The Puf kind of squishes down with use, so at some point you will want to replace it with a fresh one to exfoliate effectively.</li>
      <li>If you apply pressure, you can scrub the skin off your face but if you use a gentle touch, it removes the outer layer of dead skin beautifully!</li>
      <li>It dries out quickly, is easy to store in the shower and is gentle.  </li>
      <li>gentle to keep skin smooth</li>
      <li>I decided to pick these up from Amazon since I had read in a skincare book that I really like ( [[ASIN:0553383302 The Skin Type Solution]]) that they would be good to use on sensitive skin to gently get rid of the flakey skin that Retin-A causes.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Love these puffs for keeping a clear complexion.</li>
      <li>Someone else with skin similar to mine suggested using these to exfoliate and make sure that my skin is clean.</li>
      <li>Even the Extra Gentle ones are still pretty potent!  </li>
      <li>Love the Gentle Buf-Pufs as I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle indeed.  </li>
      <li>also have sensitive skin which makes finding a good overall facial exfoliant quite challenging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth, brush more gently but a little longer to bring better results.  </li>
      <li>I first started using these when they were a buck apiece.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with seborrheic dermatitis for many years, and have tried numerous creams (prescription and OTC) to get rid of flaky patches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used to use Buf-Pufs back when I was a teenager in the 80&#x27;s, and used to love them.  </li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t be wihout my buf-puf, use them every day.  will order again when I get low on them.  Nancy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with seborrheic dermatitis for many years, and have tried numerous creams (prescription and OTC) to get rid of flaky patches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin which makes finding a good overall facial exfoliant quite challenging. Oftentimes, I&#x27;ve found something that seemed to work but would cause irritation after 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a Buff Puff once a day for about 10 days (with Noble soap, which was recommended elsewhere for the seborrheic dermatitis) and am very pleased the results.</li>
    <li> My skin is easily irritated, so these extra gentle Pufs are perfect for my needs. They are pretty soft when they are new and will soften some more with use. The Puf kind of squishes down with use, so at some point you will want to replace it with a fresh one to exfoliate effectively. But, I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy and leave me with a red face. Since I started using these Pufs, my skin is markedly improved. I&#x27;ve tried the regular and gentle version, but they are too rough. The extra gentle Pufs are perfect.</li>
    <li> Even though this sponge is extra gentle, it still bothers my skin. I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Buf Puf Extra Gentle scrubbing pads are great for everyday use. Get the scrubbing sponge wet, apply your facial cleanser and gently exfoliate your face. The extra gentle are hard to find and Amazon has them in stock and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I used to use Buf-Pufs back when I was a teenager in the 80&#x27;s, and used to love them.  I decided to pick these up from Amazon since I had read in a skincare book that I really like ( [[ASIN:0553383302 The Skin Type Solution]]) that they would be good to use on sensitive skin to gently get rid of the flakey skin that Retin-A causes. I originally purchased a regular Buf-Puf but it was too harsh on my skin, so I&#x27;m so glad that I found these here since I couldn&#x27;t find them in any of my local stores.  They are gentle and really do get rid of the dry skin patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to rub really gently when using them!  Even the Extra Gentle ones are still pretty potent!  Because of this, I&#x27;ve only been using one once a day to clean my skin since I think that twice a day would be too harsh.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for years and they are the BEST!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very gentle on my sensitive skin.  Could not find them in stores anymore. Good to have them in muti- packs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for decades, and always get comments on my great looking skin. If I travel and forget to bring one I feel lost. lol!</li>
    <li> I first started using these when they were a buck apiece.  I look at it as daily exfoliation.  It must work, because people are always guessing my age to be much lower than it is and although I&#x27;m in the \\&quot;wrinkle years\\&quot; I don&#x27;t really have many.  A combo of good genes and 40 years or thereabouts of buf-puf use....too bad they&#x27;re so hard to find.</li>
    <li> These are so extra gentle that they roll up in your hands when you use them, defeating the purpose. I wish I would have bought a single pack to try out first. Now I can either give them away as party favors or figure out another way to use them around the house.</li>
    <li> Perfect for exfoliating my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> gentle to keep skin smooth</li>
    <li> I just went to look at reordering this item and discovered that Amazon has put a hold on this item due to customers commenting on packaging or something to that effect. I have ordered these in the past and there is absolutely nothing wrong with packaging etc. I live in Canada and these are non existent! I have a skin condition on my face and these are my lifesavers and must be the extra gentle type.  For those individuals who claim that these \\&quot;roll\\&quot; perhaps they are applying too much pressure when wetting them, you need to wet them apply your cleansing agent moisten your face with water and gently use circular motions on your face, they need to be rinsed squeeze the water out of them and then for good measure you can shake them out and make sure they dry out.  Once they become \\&quot;thinner\\&quot; with use you discard them and use a new sponge.  Please please continue to stock these!</li>
    <li> I think the Buf Puf is great for the shower.  It&#x27;s textured enough to take care of gently exfoliating without the sandpaper feel many exfoliating devices or creams.  I like that is works well with my shower gel and it is quick to try making it a good add-on in my travelling kit.</li>
    <li> These extra gentle pufs are just the best ever............have used for years - can&#x27;t find anymore - Great Shipper.</li>
    <li> I tend to have rosacea and this is Buf-Pur is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red and irritated.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try these Extra Gentle Buf Pufs but they are just too &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; I guess.  They fall apart way too fast.  I will go back to using the regular Gentle ones or the standard originals.</li>
    <li> I used to just wash my face using my cleanser and hands, but my skin was flaky, dull and acne-prone. Someone else with skin similar to mine suggested using these to exfoliate and make sure that my skin is clean. I have been really happy with the results so far! I only use it at night (because I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t want to irritate it) and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is clearer and has a nicer texture. This is great for people who don&#x27;t want to shell out money for something like the Clarisonic but also want something gentle to exfoliate and clean their face.</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge.  So glad Amazon carries it cause no one else in town has this product anymore.  Extra gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Always use this product to keep face clean and smooth. Gentle on face.  I purchase this product for myself as well as my daughter and teenage grandchildren  unable to find in stores</li>
    <li> I really, really like Buf-Pufs. All the other fancy new devices don&#x27;t work half as good. I usually buy the gentle one, but this time I got Extra Gentle. It&#x27;s a little too gentle! I like a slightly abrasive sponge, so I will go back to the less gentle one with my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried others less expensive but Buf-Puf is the best!  I am willing to spend more for them.</li>
    <li> Very gentle indeed.  They aren&#x27;t scratchy at all.</li>
    <li> Best sponges ever! We&#x27;ve used similar sponges and they don&#x27;t compare. My granddaughter and I use them every night! Our skin is smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these pads for removing her makeup. Says they are very soft and gentle on her skin. Said the pricing was awesome even compared to the big box discount stores.</li>
    <li> I love love love these. They clearly get the job done but are not harsh at all. At will be awhile before I have to buy again as I bought the six pack but will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I love bufpuf I hope that I can keep finding them</li>
    <li> I think the Buf-Puf Facial Sponges really help to get deeper in your skin to clean out your pores.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find a gentle exfoliating natural sponge that lasted. I&#x27;ve tried sea sponges of all kinds and they&#x27;re always too rough or too mushy. The Buf-Puf does a decent job of exfoliating. But the material balls up and smashes down pretty quickly, so it has to be replaced often.</li>
    <li> I used these little sponges all the time when I was a teenager.  I was trying to find them again for my teen son and I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere and no one seemed to know what I was talking about.  I was so happy to find them on amazon.  They work great on his teen skin and I also started using one of my own and it is a nice, gentle exfoliation.  The price was great, too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and these sponges do not feel like sand paper on my face like most other products I have tried. Also  I have a hard time finding them in stores, so ordering them on Amazon has been a plus. I would definitely recommend Buf-Puf extra gentle sponges to anyone looking for a product that won&#x27;t scratch sensitive facial skin.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering the extra gentle pads for years. They clean off makeup and do a fantastic job exfoliating but are gentle enough not to irritate my very sensitive skin. I need to replace about every month. Still way more cost effective than a $30 tube of exfoliating cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands and the cheaper stuff was too course and irritating.  I&#x27;ve even given these to my sister and friends to try out!  All were impressed.</li>
    <li> I have used these gentle facial sponges for several years, and can&#x27;t imagine life without them.  They are an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have tried other type facial scrubbers and none of them compare to the buf puf brand.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years as my facial cleansing routine...I think they are much better than a wash rag on your face!</li>
    <li> Very good value for a name brand.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these little gems.  Can&#x27;t find them anywhere they&#x27;re supposed to be sold except for Amazon.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> My favorite! it is very good for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I can remember you were able to get these everywhere I have always used these they clean the face excellent</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using these facial sponges they are great for exfoliating the skin. They are soft and gentle and works up a good lather while cleansing and exfoliating at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for more decades than I care to admit. They work great and are relatively cheap.  I can&#x27;t find them locally, so I am happy that they are still available here.  I also now use a Clairsonic, but this works great in the shower.  It also works for getting dirt, paint, etc off of my arms, but that is another story.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, and they are perfect for daily exfoliating.  I would recommend to anyone who needs a great daily cleansing pad.</li>
    <li> Well, these can get expensive and dont last very long. Determined to continue using buff  puffs for daily usage I wound up in of all places Walmart. They have 2 buff puffs for 1 dollar and they work as effectively and last just as long as these name brand buff puffs work. In regards to their effectiveness buff puffs work keeping my skin looking young and glowing it reduces bumps from shaving. Shop around!</li>
    <li> Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and love that its very gentle (compared to any other microdermabrasion products).  I use it once a day in place of a washcloth and maintain a nice, smooth complexion without injury or irritation</li>
    <li> Actually wanted Regular, my fault or a non-intuitive website?</li>
    <li> Love these puffs for keeping a clear complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. For some reason you can not get the extra gentle in drug stores and they are the only ones gentle enough for face skin. They are great!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended the microdermabrasion system on an infomercial. Seriously was going to buy it and I remembered, hey wonder if Buf Pufs still exist and of course (used them 20-30 years ago, checked on Amazon and voila!  Great reviews and now more choices. Been using for the last 3 days with my Loreal Cream face wash. Oh my goodness, my skin texture is so smooth AND the pores are finer in just 3 days.  Very very very happy with this, again!</li>
    <li> They are definitly EXTRA gentle, which is perfect, but the material tends to ball up like a wool sweater after a couple weeks of use.  Overall what I expected, just not holding up as well as I think it should.</li>
    <li> Love Extra Gentle Buf Puf.</li>
    <li> My wife uses the gentle Buf-Pufs. I prefer the larger ones. Both products are good. We use them for two or three months. Amazon delivery and prices are great.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST! I&#x27;ve used them for years and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon. Well worth the money. After I wear one out using it for my face, I keep the used one around for other bathroom scrubbing chores. Seriously, &amp;#34;use, reuse&amp;#34; is a good idea with these.</li>
    <li> Great product...just what I needed! Fast delivery 😀👍</li>
    <li> My daughter, who has extra-sensitive skin, typically uses the regular buf-pufs.  The last time I ordered, she asked for a 6-pack of these, too, for those days where she needs something even gentler.  I had spent a great deal of time researching the cost as the price of buf-pufs varies greatly - some stores really charge a premium.  I found these @ 6 for $23 and change which is the best price so far.  Note that these are disposable and each lasts approximately 2 weeks, so costs add up quickly.  That said, the product works great for her acne prone skin,  ensuring that her face is clean but not irritated.</li>
    <li> When I wash my face I like to exfoliate. I wish I could still find these in the stores but I&#x27;m glad I can still get them through Amazon!</li>
    <li> After purchasing these and using them for a month or so, I can honestly say they are ok, I guess. I recently purchased a battery operated face brush, which I adore. I have no idea what I will do with the pack that I purchased. However, I will not use them on my face. Perhaps, I can use them for dishwashing, or scrubbing the bathroom sinks. This is only my opinion, and others may differ.</li>
    <li> I use the Buf-Puf Extra Gentle every day with my facial cleanser.  My skin is soft and clear. I noticed a difference after using the puf daily for a week or so.  I&#x27;ve now been using it for years.  I like this so much better than using an exfoliating cleanser or lotion that leaves grit all over and is harsh on the skin. I get complements all the time about my skin (I am 55)</li>
    <li> I have used Buf Pufs for over 25 years. Love them.  They are so gentle and work well with my facial cleanser.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore so I have to order them online. When I don&#x27;t have them my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean. Great product.</li>
    <li> Why pay for all those rubs/exfoliants/creams etc. when you can use these?  They sort of &#x27;pricey&#x27; but cheap compared to those rubs/creams/exfoliants....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, but found them getting harder and harder to find in the stores, so have relied on Amazon to provide them for me.  They&#x27;re gentle yet do a great job of getting my skin clean.</li>
    <li> These things arrived quickly, and there was nothing wrong with them.  Not sure how else to fill up the space, here, really . . .</li>
    <li> Love extra gentle versions but these are hard to find in stores. Helps to keep my teens skin clear without irritating the way the regular ones can especially if you have sensitive skin and want to use them every day. We usually replace them every couple weeks. So findIng them here in a multipack makes them much more affordable.</li>
    <li> Literally. I have combination skin and I&#x27;ve spent so much money on different cleansers and exfoliants and nothing worked liked advertised. Found these originally on drugstore.com, and will now purchase them in bulk on Amazon.com for the better deal because they&#x27;re worth it. I use cold water (no more warm water because it made my skin red and horrid) with my Buf Puf (and really this pink one is the only one that qualifies as &#x27;Gentle&#x27;) and mild cleanser, at night. On dry, cold days a bit of moisturizer at night. In the morning, no cleansing, just rinse off with cold water whatever is on there and pat dry. My skin literally GLOWS and I will keep buying my Buf Puf and staying with my simple regimen until the day I die: It is that good.</li>
    <li> This scrubber takes a gentle hand.  It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth, brush more gently but a little longer to bring better results.  This scrubber for your face requires the same technique.  If you apply pressure, you can scrub the skin off your face but if you use a gentle touch, it removes the outer layer of dead skin beautifully! You&#x27;ll be amazed with the results even if you only use it two or three times a week alternating with your wash cloth!</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and love them. I&#x27;ve tried the competitors and drugstore brands,  but nothing compares.&lt;br /&gt;They keep my skin exfoliated.</li>
    <li> This is great for exfoliating your face. It is not too ruff or abrasive but just right to remove dead and dry skin from your face.</li>
    <li> I love buff puffs.  I have used them for years.  also, double-sided body buff puffs are great. i give them to my two daughters at Christmas.  (a years supply).</li>
    <li> And why should it?  Great to exfoliate face.  Keeps pores open and unclogged. Saves you money by not having to buy expensive scrubs</li>
    <li> These are something I used to use in my teenage years (the 60&#x27;s) that I could not find in local drugstores.  I don&#x27;t care to use a wash cloth and a Buf Puf exfoliates better.  It dries out quickly, is easy to store in the shower and is gentle.  I just had my dermatological screening and my doctor said it is the reason my skin is so smooth!</li>
    <li> I love these extra gentle pufs, and they&#x27;re inexpensive enough to toss after using awhile.  They offer a very mild exfoliation without being harsh on my sensitive, mature skin.  Too bad they&#x27;re not available in stores anymore, but thank goodness Amazon has them.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to washcloths for cleansing your face.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, easy sale, great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores for years. This had kept my skin soft all my adult life</li>
    <li> Excellent for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Love the Gentle Buf-Pufs as I have sensitive skin.  Have used for years but can no longer find them or comparable facial sponges in local drug stores.  Will continue to order as I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I can only hope 3M never stops making them.</li>
