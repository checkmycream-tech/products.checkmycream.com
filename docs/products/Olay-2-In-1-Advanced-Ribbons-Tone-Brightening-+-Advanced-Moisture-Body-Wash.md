      <li>The container is attractive and dispenses easily.  </li>
      <li>a fragrance free version.&lt;br /&gt;allergies differ so greatly.</li>
      <li>I liked the creaminess and the fragrance, which is a nice change from bar soap, but wasn&#x27;t knocked out by the effect I got from it.  </li>
      <li>But it turned out to be some kind of waxy build-up that you had to literally scrape off with an edged tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Olay Body wash, I  love ❤ all of Olay&#x27;s product especially the body wash the choices of sent are great and I love ❤ how it addresses your skin problems as I grow older my skin have become dry using Olay keeps it looking healthy.</li>
    <li> Not too bad at all, but it doesn&#x27;t quite leave my skin as soft as their bar soap. Doesn&#x27;t quite smell as good either. But, you do get a quick lather and it is smooth on your skin, not too drying.    The best \\&quot;soft skin\\&quot; soaps are Dove and &#x27;Oil of Olay&#x27; bar soaps. They are the best, bar none. No pun intended.</li>
    <li> When I opened the upside-down bottle (made that way so that the contents can be emptied to the last drop), out came a thick foam, the first ball of which was sufficient to lather up almost my whole body. There is a moderately light, coconut-ty scent, which is fine by me. This product is luxurious and all-business at the same time. There is a good balance between soap and moisturizer so that it cleans well without drying.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Olay products, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Definitely creamy, with good sudsing.  It helped my elbows and knees, which flake and actually crack in the winter, so that&#x27;s my best recommendation.</li>
    <li> I found this bodywash to be very thick and luxurious feeling.  It left a faint lingering of a nice scent on my skin after use.    It also contains minerals which make your skin sparkle in certain light.  (Don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t look like Edward in the movie Twilight, lol!)  It is more of hint of glitter and I think it&#x27;s only noticeable if you are looking for it.    If you are one who uses their bodywash as a shave gel, I would not recommend this one for that purpose.  I usually don&#x27;t, but I tried it once with this bodywash and found it was so thick it clogged my razor almost immediately.    But overall a nice bodywash.</li>
    <li> I love this. It has the tropical smell and the tone enhancers. Lathers nicely, leaves my skin soft. I have noticed a slight evening of my skin tone, esp where no sun touches.  great product</li>
    <li> This is actually my least favorite of the Olay body washes. I say that mainly because I have tried and absolutely adored the pink one (Olay Ribbons Body Wash plus Creme Ribbons with Almond Oil)  and looooved the blue one which I&#x27;m currently using every day (Olay Bodywash Plus Spa Exfoliating Ribbons) but this one pales in comparison. The moisturizing properties are not impressive, the others really made my skin silky and were very frothy, this stuff has mica minerals which are simply tiny pieces of a mineral sheet that optically create a glow, the skin isn&#x27;t becoming more spectacular, but merely decorated with sparkles. Also this smells faintly like glue, not a favorite scent when it comes to cosmetics. This creates an illusion of smooth skin, but I really am not impressed. I mean it&#x27;s not a bad body wash but with all the variety out there I would not spend money on this particular one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried practically all of the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; soaps, searching for that silky feeling, without luck, until now.  I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents, and this bodywash does have a smell but not overwhelming like others.  It definitely has that cocoa butter/shea butter smell, but others on the market are too strong for my sensitive nose, and this one didn&#x27;t even come close, which is huge in my book.  No other bodywash has ever given me that \\&quot;ooh that feels nice\\&quot; when washing (I use one of those scrunchie poofs).  I previously used one of the other Olay Ribbons, the pink bottle I believe, and it didn&#x27;t feel silky at all.  I&#x27;m unsure of what the difference between the two is, but this one is a winner for me.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding this particular item in my local area and finding it online was great..I love the product and received it so quickly..will order again..</li>
    <li> My wife tried this body wash and it immediately became her favorite. She has been using it for three weeks. This bodywash smells very nice; it has a hint of a citrus smell that is light and not overwhelming. She likes how well it cleans how the moisturizer does a great job on dry skin. the bodywash has a creamy consistency that makes it feel like a lotion. She highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty indiscriminate about soap -- as long as it works and doesn&#x27;t smell too funky, I&#x27;ll buy whatever is on sale.     But what I like about this line of Olay bodywash, and why I&#x27;ve switched to is, is that the soap has a fairly thick consistency. As a result, half the bottle doesn&#x27;t gush out when you squeeze. It makes it easy to control how much soap comes out of the bottle, and thus, extends the amount of time it takes to go through a bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  It leaves the tiniest amount of golden shimmer on your skin.  For those that don&#x27;t like this, don&#x27;t worry, it wears off quickly.  Just wearing clothes seems to make it wear off.  I love how it lathers and the scent is nice.  Your skin feels well-moisturized.  I buy this for the shimmer.  I adore shimmer.  Too bad this stuff isn&#x27;t being sold in stores anymore.  I miss it and having to buy it online gets expensive. :(</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s expensive, the wash is highly concentrated: about a teaspoon on a washcloth is more than enough for tons of foamy goodness. It has a pleasant, light coconut scent that dissipates quickly and isn&#x27;t cloying like many body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I don&#x27;t see any enhanced tone (whatever that means? firmer skin?) or youthful radiance or luminosity, if that&#x27;s supposed to be happening (and according to the bottle, it is). It is less drying than soap, but with the moisturizing body washes you do always feel a bit like a greased pig after your shower. If you like the squeaky clean feel, stick with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is totally inane to mention (but that won&#x27;t stop me, apparently), because all beauty product packaging includes crimes against grammar, but as a word nerd, the bottle&#x27;s boast of \\&quot;an actual ribbon of moisturizer\\&quot; drives me up a fracking tree.</li>
    <li> This bodywash from Olay is great. Squeeze a little onto a shower pouf and it exfoliates and moisturizes your skin, all at the same time! It&#x27;s subtle fragrance has a hint of cocoa butter, and is thankfully not too overpowering.    The shimmer added so your skin glows! This is also very subtle. You can&#x27;t really tell in indoor light, but outside, you sparkle!     The best part about this bodywash is that even though it&#x27;s moisturizing, you don&#x27;t come out of the shower feeling greasy. Your skin feels clean.    Looking for a new bodywash? Give this one a try!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap of the three that I&#x27;ve reviewed lately. It&#x27;s easy to open (the last company&#x27;s soap bottle wasn&#x27;t) easy to pour out exactly the quantity that you want, a small amount is all you need for your entire body, and it has a subtle and pleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little soon to tell about the tone enriching and moisturizing elements but my gal says I feel great. Hoorah! What more do you want in a soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this one!</li>
    <li> PROS:  The body wash works nicely with sponges, washcloths and poufs.    The soap is rich, thick, creamy and very concentrate. This bottle goes a long way.  The cream soap leaves the skin moisturized like a light lotion with a hint of glimmer.  The skin texture improves slighly with repeated uses, like a mild exfoliant.  The container is attractive and dispenses easily.  The fragrance is pleasant, if you like coconut. Not perfumey.    CONS:  The price isn&#x27;t horrible, but it&#x27;s certainly more expensive than soap.  The glimmer is very subtle. If you want an obvious shimmer, buy a shimmer lotion that stays on your body. Most of this rinses off with the soap.  The ingredients are a huge list of chemicals including petroleum and mineral oil, which are known to be oxiding and ages the skin.  There are lots of \\&quot;other\\&quot; chemicals included here. Not necessarily stuff you want on your skin (modern science tells us that what goes on the skin eventually enters the blood stream through absorption).      Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent money on it. I liked the creaminess and the fragrance, which is a nice change from bar soap, but wasn&#x27;t knocked out by the effect I got from it.  If you&#x27;re looking for tone and shimmer that is pronounced, try Aveeno&#x27;s line of lotions for exfoliating and glow, or use a self tanner with bronzing effect.  What you get from this is minimal.</li>
    <li> This shower gel has a pleasant, tropical fruit type of scent. A scent which women are more likely to appreciate, but it didn&#x27;t linger too long, which was good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry patches of skin that felt much more moisturized after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One factor I don&#x27;t really care for is a very slick feel to the skin. I tried rinsing and scrubbing it off, but soon realized it was there to stay. Probably a good thing for dry skin, but a feeling I&#x27;m not used to.</li>
    <li> Very rich and smooth. It really does feel like soft ribbons on your skin. This makes for a great relaxing bath. I really enjoy this product and would recoommed it for anyone. It also has a soft fragrance that is very plesant.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this bodywash.  It definitely washes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  What I didn&#x27;t like is the smell.  It really is a strong scent.  I don&#x27;t have a good sense of smell normally, but I picked up this scent easily.  It was almost overpowering for me while in the shower.  However, after rinsing, the smell is much less noticeable.  Overall a decent product, just be sure you are ready for a strong smelling bodywash!</li>
    <li> These are one of the every day requirements. You can&#x27;t live without. The question is,  are these products worth paying up. I love olay brand soaps more than other brands. Especially with dry skin, nothing else worked for me. If you have dry skin and looking for a simple solution, olay is the way to go. They also release consistent products, I have seen some cheap knock offs where once in three months one bottle wont behave the same as the others. I have never had any issues with olay brand.</li>
    <li> This bodywash is really creamy and thick, not runny like so many out there.  This is good, for one, because you will be less likely to waste much of it from over-pouring.  It&#x27;s also good because the soap is really smooth and feels enriching.    The scene is very nice, with a not overpowering aroma of cocoa butter.  The soap also leaves the skin with a bit of sparkle (from the \\&quot;ribbons\\&quot; I imagine.)    All in all, it will come as close as soap can to making one feel they&#x27;ve showered after a relaxing day at the beach.      Nice.  It leaves skin feeling good and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Especially great for the winter time when the air is so dry. Very moisturizing for my skin, though a bit slippery on the shower floor! I love this stuff and am quite pleased with it. Leaves my skin moist through most of the day, even during the cold months.</li>
    <li> I lovethiswash  moisturizers my skin and gentle cleansing.</li>
    <li> I was glad to have gotten this soap for review; It&#x27;s my first time using the Olay body washes, and from what I&#x27;ve experienced thus far, it has a great scent, good size and for the size of it, it can last you some time if used carefully. One thing though, it does come out pretty thick; but once you use it, you do feel much better for the journey; Enriched with Mica Minerals that also bring a sparkle to your skin; Try it for your next bath.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. They stopped selling this in my local CVS for some reason, so I have to order it online. Which is fine with me. The price is probably better. This body does its job. I feel clean and moisturized. But what I really love about it is  how it leaves your skin after the shower. You have this slight shine to you. Is ever so slight, that no one will notice it.. but if you really look at your skin, it sparkles alittle. I promise its not noticeable. But I think it makes my skin look fresh and healthy. I love this body wash.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this body wash, it&#x27;s AMAZING, the skin is soft, it has a little glitter (nothing too noticeable, trust me). Sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to put on some moisturizer. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> There are a large number of products out there (Pert comes to mind) that have for years tried to clean and to condition/moisturize. Some are successes, some not so much.    This one is maybe someplace in the middle.     I liked the way it smells (though it is not a manly scent). It seemed to clean my skin fine. But I have body hair. Usual manly amounts.     That hair felt less than clean. A bit goopy.     If you have a fairly hair free body, and don&#x27;t mind the scent, this would be a great product for you. If you&#x27;re a hairy guy, probably not.     But I somehow doubt this product is aimed at those guys anyway.</li>
    <li> My husband got this product for me and I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &#x27;shimmer&#x27; it was supposed to have.  I thought it would be too glittery and come off on cloths and such but it actually was pretty subtle.  It has a nice cocoa butter like smell, and lathers well, but I did not find it very moisturizing for a product labeled &#x27;deep moisture&#x27;.</li>
    <li> this is what I wanted but I have to be careful as I have allergies to fragrances. this does not bother me, the fragrance reminds me of a cocoa butter sunscreen smell and it is light enough of a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes and cleans brilliantly!Cleans equally as well as the best soaps Dial, Dove,Ivory etc.It is thick, smooth and silky feeling, it just slides nicely as you wash .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets dry and I hate to moisturize after the shower as I get so cold so easily which in NY is at least 6 mos&lt;br /&gt;of the year. with this I do not need the extra moisturizer except for my hands which are always dry.I wash them so frequently. I have normal skin, not dry...dry skin may require extra moisture after.I am pretty sure&lt;br /&gt;but it is still the most moisturizing wash /soap I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does live up to expectations but I would suggest a fragrance free version.&lt;br /&gt;allergies differ so greatly. The fact that it smells much like a sunscreen hopefully will help those with allergies&lt;br /&gt;know if this will or will not bother them. As far as skin goes, it is soft and silky and leaves your skin that way as well.&lt;br /&gt; Worth a try, you may love the way it feels and works !!!</li>
    <li> I heard of Olay Ribbons Body Wash plus Creme Ribbons while watching The View a few months ago (I knew about Oil of Olay body wash products, but I had yet to try this product); it was recommended as one of 2009&#x27;s best products, and I couldn&#x27;t agree with this sentiment more! The body wash smells great and leaves my usually dry skin hydrated all day. I love this product, and I highly recommend it to body wash users interested in purchasing a quality body wash worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bodywash for over a year now and was starting to have trouble finding it.  Thank you Amazon!  It leaves my skin soft and supple, and I just ADORE the understated shimmer it leaves on my skin.  It has a very light, fresh scent that is not at all overpowering, and lathers really well.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it for a man... because of the hint of shimmer, but it&#x27;s a MUST HAVE for women everywhere!  :)</li>
    <li> Love most of Olay&#x27;s products... not this one. I had an allergic reaction to it. I have never had a reaction to any of their other products. Started itching like mad as soon as I was out of the shower. Had to reshower and take benadryl to stop the itching. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with an Olay shower cream and it has been heavenly.  It smells great, a little like coconut, but not overly sweet and is very thick, so you only need an amount about the size of a half dollar on the wash cloth.  Can&#x27;t speak to the tone-enriching properties;  on me it could only enhance paleness. However, I have been very pleased with the way it moisturizes my somewhat dry skin.  I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.  This product is so thick and rich that I haven&#x27;t run out of it yet and it&#x27;s been more than a month -- it&#x27;s a real value at a three pack for $20.97.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the Olay body washes with moisturizing ribbons. They all make a thick, rich foam and they make your skin feel SO good after showering. This one has a slightly different scent that reminds me of sweet coconut. It&#x27;s just the right amount of fragrance. It&#x27;s subtle and not too perfume-like. I love this stuff and highly recommend it.     CONS: Only one. I&#x27;ve only twice SUSPECTED that I could see any shimmer on my skin and that was in direct sunlight. Maybe I&#x27;m spending too much time in the shower enjoying my soft skin after bathing? Maybe I&#x27;m toweling it off? I&#x27;ll give Olay the benefit of the doubt on this one. 5 stars!    ***** EDIT: Only a day after posting this review I noticed sparkles on my legs. Each day as I&#x27;ve continued to use it, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin shimmering in different spots. It&#x27;s subdued but still enjoyable. I love this stuff. My skin feels great. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Olay Body Wash Plus Tone Enriching Ribbons promises to not only clean your body, but moisturize it as well. It adds an actual ribbon of moisturizer with glucosamine complex and luminous brighteners that promise to transform your skin from dull to radiant in just five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like using Olay Body Wash Plus Tone Enriching Ribbons. It comes in a nice sized 18 ounce bottle which lasts a long time. It has a yummy scent and is easy to use - you squeeze a small amount on a wet puff, lather, wash, and rinse. It cleans well and the moisturizing part seems to work - I was using it when I got a sun burn and my skin did not peel like it usually does after a sun burn. You can actually see the moisturizer while using it. As for lifting my skin&#x27;s tone to an incredibly rich level and actually making it shimmer - well, I&#x27;ve been using it for more than five weeks (over two weeks) and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference. Still, it does a good job of cleaning well and I can always use the extra moisturizer, especially as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin may not quite shimmer, but Olay Body Wash Plus Tone Enriching Ribbons does a good job.</li>
    <li> I did not like the feel of this new Olay Bodywash--however, possibly others will. For my skin type, it was too heavy and slick. I felt overwhelmed by it. And the smell! To me, it seemed like a very strong, chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;Olay has been branching out in all directions recently and I have been watching their appealing ads on TV, but this one example of their new line did not make me feel moisturized as I showered. It simply made me feel greasy. I was disappointed in this Olay Bodywash Plus Tone Enriching Ribbons, Deep Moisture product. It seemed a bit gimmicky, considering the ribbons don&#x27;t do anything in particular. Didn&#x27;t we go this route 30 years ago with Stripe toothpaste? Two stripes and you&#x27;re out!</li>
    <li> Like[[ASIN:B0019ZD61A Gillette&#x27;s 2-in-1 Dry Skin Hydrator &amp; Body Wash]], [[ASIN:B001JQLNJ6 Olay Bodywash Plus Tone Enriching Ribbons, Deep Moisture]] moisturizes dry skin. Just the body wash is designed for women.     If you have dry, Flaky, itchy Skin, and Lotion just isn&#x27;t enough, Try [[ASIN:B001JQLNJ6 Olay Bodywash Plus Tone Enriching Ribbons, Deep Moisture]]. It pretty much eliminated my need for lotion.</li>
    <li> It works!  Olay products are known for their quality, and this is no different, and my wife agrees.  A great product at a good price, and under Amazon Prime is an outstanding value I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting from this wash, my mother bought it for me in college and i had never tried it before. So, I hopped in the shower, lathered up, got out, and noticed that my skin actually had shimmer...embedded in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strange. Anyway, I sort of liked it so I kept using it. Turns out, the more you use this stuff the more shimmer stays for good and it really, makes an obvious difference. People asked me what lotion I was using or what I was doing to my skin and I told them about this stuff. It provides for an overall LUMINOUS appearance and I even ditched my Victoria&#x27;s Secret Supermodel lotion from usage of the tone wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bronze skin, so it shows exceptionally well on me. I blame my Caribbean genes. I can&#x27;t say whether the same visible shimmer effect works on fairer people so you&#x27;ll have to check out their reviews. I think they were actually some of the one&#x27;s who complained about this stuff.</li>
    <li> This body wash is my favorite. It leaves your skin with a ever so subtle glow throughout the entire day. It is not carried in most stores anymore. So glad I could find it online.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition :) and came out feeling soft and fresh!!</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash of all time! Has a nice mild fragrance and moisturizes well</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and live in the country so don&#x27;t have the best water. I have been shopping around for a good body wash for a while. I have the Olay Body Wash Plus Tone Enriching Ribbons. I was hesitant at first because of the cost but I am glad I bought it! I work a lot of hours and don&#x27;t always have the time to apply lotion after I get out of the shower. With this body wash I don&#x27;t have too. It is very moisturizing and keeps my skin smooth throughout the day. The size being 18 ounce is well worth the money if you do the subscribe and save as well! There is a slight shimmer with this lotion which gives you a nice little glow which is nice. I use several of Olay products and this is a forsure one to add to the list!</li>
    <li> This body wash is one of the best that Olay has on the market; We love it. It moisturizes your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong &#x27;after scent&#x27; so guys love it too.  I&#x27;ve used several different ones (all by Olay) and they are all pretty good, but this one so far is the best. You can tell after just one use, and if you use it for week, then 2 weeks etc... the more soft your skin gets; and you cannot beat the price!  Excellent product</li>
    <li> Okay first of all I want to say I&#x27;ve tried many many body washes in my life. I have used practically every brand, including Bath and Body Works, and most recently Dove. My sister has always been a big fan of Olay but I stayed clear of it because I always thought it was &amp;#34;too expensive&amp;#34;. WELL I was on Amazon shopping for my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; favorite body wash, the Dove Toning body wash, and noticed that the price had gone up by $2!!! It was then I decided to shop around for a different body wash as I felt I wasn&#x27;t getting my money&#x27;s worth anymore...Long story short I cam across Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Tone Body Wash and saw that it came in a 3-pack AND had an Amazon coupon so this was my chance to finally try an Olay body wash at a decent price... I&#x27;m so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash is AMAZING! I wish I would have tried Olay sooner because I&#x27;ve heard many wonderful things about this brand before. This specific body wash is a thick creme that actually can act as a shaving creme as well! This means I&#x27;m saving money by buying an all-in-one product. I was happy that I didn&#x27;t have to actually use too much of the product to get a nice lather. I had previous problems with my old body wash (the Dove Toning) because I had to use A LOT of it to really work a nice lather. This Olay body wash is just perfect and my skin is so smooth! It&#x27;s now the next day (I took a shower yesterday and used the Olay body wash) and I can still feel the smoothness and cleanliness on my skin that I felt when I got out of the shower yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product to anyone that is looking for an all-in-one product. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will smooth your skin and actually work a great lather (so you don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle to really get it going) you&#x27;ll love this! Because it&#x27;s sold in a 3-pack on here you get your money&#x27;s worth plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of it anytime soon. I wish I would have tried this sooner. If you see the other reviews you&#x27;ll see that a lot of people love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that &amp;#34;might&amp;#34; be a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; is that people keep mentioning a shimmer to the product?? I honestly do not see any shimmer whatsoever on my skin but that&#x27;s okay because I didn&#x27;t really want a shimmer on me anyway. I wanted something that would smooth my skin and something that I could use as a shaving creme and this is probably the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried for that!you see the other reviews you&#x27;ll see that a lot of people love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that &amp;#34;might&amp;#34; be a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; is that people keep mentioning a shimmer to the product??

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  Skin does seem bright.  Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash...it leaves a shimmer/faint sparkle on your skin!</li>
    <li> It is a great body wash. It smells wonderfrful. It makes my skin so soft. I love it.</li>
    <li> A good clean fragrance. A small amount goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Thinking I would be helpful today, I decided to try cleaning off what I thought was hard-water scale on our shower walls and glass doors.  But it turned out to be some kind of waxy build-up that you had to literally scrape off with an edged tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking around the shower, I found a contained of Olay Body Wash, which I believe my wife uses daily.  Thinking it might be the culprit, I Googled \\&quot;Olay Body Wash\\&quot; + \\&quot;waxy buildup\\&quot;.  And man did i get lots of hits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to be sealed up like some kind of wax fruit, this is the stuff to do it.  Otherwise, you might want to stick with moisturizer cream, and leave the shower for actually, you know, getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, back to scraping that darn wax off the shower walls ...</li>
    <li> Love everything about it.  It smells great and keeps my skin from being dry.  Plus getting the 3 pack on here is by far the best price I have found.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great Price.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash! Moisturizing and leaves a slight shimmer to your skin that in bright sunlight will show up and is very pretty (is NOT glittery or gaudy).</li>
    <li> The best olay soap I have used yet</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite body washes out there but they no longer sell this specific one in the stores, i love how it makes my body feel and i love the shimmer it leaves behind, no to much not to little</li>
    <li> Love the feel of the wash, very creamy and lathers well.</li>
    <li> This product works for me. Did not smell a whole lot of perfume, gave a bit of tone to skin. There was lot of lather made with just small amount of the bodywash. The skin was left moist and soft.     Overall good product, but I would prefer Dove bodywashes over it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly acceptable body wash, with an inoffensive coconut scent. The bottle says it provides a mineral shimmer, but I saw little to no shimmer on my skin after I got out of the shower. I would not expect a cleanser to be able to deposit shimmer on my skin anyway; you&#x27;d be much better off with a shimmery lotion or powder than with something that&#x27;s just going to go down the drain or wipe off on your towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this product did anything special for my skin. It&#x27;s a pretty standard moisturizing body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con is that the opening in the bottle is very wide, and it is easy to squeeze out too much product at a time. Squeeze gently.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. Its all i use now.</li>
    <li> There is a subtle gold glitter effect that comes with using this product.  I kinda like it!  It&#x27;s not messy and doesn&#x27;t come off on clothing, but the sparkle is lovely without being tacky.  I doubt anyone notices but me, although my husband did notice it once.  Also very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I like it! Arrived on time too.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel smooth and moisturized.  It provides so much moisture you can get away with not using lotion after your shower. It&#x27;s great that Amazon has it on the subscribe and save program, because I have a very hard time finding it in the store, that&#x27;s if I find it at all.  I hope Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
    <li> Ever since i started using this I have forgotten every other bodywash. And I dont wish to try out any other bodywash ever. Simply the  best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the little shine on my skin, make my skin look so healthy.</li>
    <li> I do like this product.  No strong smell and does leave a little sheen to the skin.</li>
    <li> Great body wash- another great Olay product!</li>
</ol>
