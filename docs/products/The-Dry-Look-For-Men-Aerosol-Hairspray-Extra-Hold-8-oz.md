      <li>Original Review</li>
      <li>Original Review</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try it again tomorrow right after I apply the gel, hopefully, it&#x27;ll work better this time because I did not apply the hairspray right away after the gel.</li>
      <li>For some reason it is no longer in stock at local CVS stores, so I was pleased to find I could order it on line without having to walk around to more drug stores to find out if they might have it.</li>
      <li>The only thing we don&#x27;t like is that it is not being sold locally any longer, but as far as the product it is the best!</li>
      <li>how good/bad a company is and that is exactly what I did.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to determine if it is still being produced, or if its current availability online is just remaining product??    </li>
      <li>(I have hair that would not stay in place with out it), and is pretty much odorless!</li>
      <li>I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider removing the negative  &gt;</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years - local stores quit handling it</li>
      <li>This one gives my hair a thicker fuller appearance, gentle control and shine.  </li>
      <li>I made a mistake with the shipping address and tried to contact the seller multiple times without success.</li>
      <li>It also does not have a pleasing smell, but I can live with it.</li>
      <li>Extra Hold better than any other hairspray I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.</li>
      <li>He loves how it holds but is not stiff.</li>
      <li>Hair still feels soft.</li>
      <li>I especially like that it does its job very well</li>
      <li>We live in a rural area and the stores who once carried it, Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart, don&#x27;t anymore.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for at least 30 years and it holds even in strong wind and drys without being sticky.  </li>
      <li>In recent years, the only place I could find it locally was at Walgreen&#x27;s, and now they&#x27;ve apparently dropped it.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years (since early 70s?), starting when it was \\&quot;Gillette Dry Look\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Very good product, very bad seller.</li>

    <li> Not much to review on this product. It&#x27;s the only spray my husband likes. We live in a rural area and the stores who once carried it, Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart, don&#x27;t anymore.  So, we order it.</li>
    <li> I have used Gilette Dry Look for a number of years and continue to like it.</li>
    <li> ***Original Review***  I made a mistake with the shipping address and tried to contact the seller multiple times without success. I will not use them again because of this. I only deal with companies with good customer service and this company has NONE! I have yet to get this product as it has shipped to the wrong place. Amazon would not help either.  ***End Original Review***    The seller was Deals Buzz and they do not answer their phone. They also tried make me feel bad about my vote and tried to get me to change even though they couldn&#x27;t solve the problem. I would rather eat the $32 then lie about how good/bad a company is and that is exactly what I did.  I did review the product in Sept of 09, which is pasted above, but for some reason this is asking me to review it again.    Here is an excert from one of the emails.   &gt;&gt; I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider removing the negative  &gt;&gt; feedback that you left for me. I and my family depend on my business of  &gt;&gt; the income.    Very good product, very bad seller.</li>

I especially like that it does its job very well (I have hair that would not stay in place with out it), and is pretty much odorless!</li>
    <li> We bought this item online as our local stores don&#x27;t carry it.  We have been using it--both my wife and I---for 10+ years and love it.  It works well for holding hair in place and has no obnoxious odor. One needs just a little to do the job and so a spray can lasts a long time.  We&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as we can find it in the stores or online.</li>
    <li> Since we can not find this product in the stores we have to buy on line.  My husband loves this product and is upset he can not find it in any stores in our area.</li>
    <li> buy it for my husband.  he&#x27;s been using it for years..</li>
    <li> Works well and does give you the dry look but doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I&#x27;d hoped. The smell is very strong when first applied.</li>
    <li> My husband will not use any other hairspray!!  He has used this product for 15 years.  He loves how it holds but is not stiff. He has tried others, but they are too heavy. The only thing we don&#x27;t like is that it is not being sold locally any longer, but as far as the product it is the best!</li>
    <li> I like this product and have been buying it for years.  For some reason it is no longer in stock at local CVS stores, so I was pleased to find I could order it on line without having to walk around to more drug stores to find out if they might have it.</li>

    <li> This stuff is a joke.  I gave it 3 tries and threw it away.  It smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t hold.  I&#x27;m honestly confused how anyone could recommend this product.  Anyone who likes this is weird and had bad judgement.</li>
    <li> GREAT HAIRSPRAY THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU NEED IF YOUR HAIR HAS A WAY OF GOING EVERYWHERE BUT WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Hard to find. It was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 30 years and it holds even in strong wind and drys without being sticky.  It is now becoming very difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has been discontinued or what, but as long as I can get it thru Amazon I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I wanted non-aerosol (my fault) and want to return them.  Took to the PO Saturday packed in the same box and packing and they wouldn&#x27;t take it.  Aerosol anything cannot be shipped in a &amp;#34;Priority Mail&amp;#34; box.  Had to bring it back home and rewrap in brow paper.  Their letter for return stated that it had to be in the original box, original packing material.  Most companies send a return label - not this one.  Not sure I&#x27;d reorder non-aerosol from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, my husband has used the pump in this brand for years and it&#x27;s hard to find.  I suggest he switch.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!  IT HAS NO STINKY HAIRSPRAY SMELL  HOLDS GREAT ALL DAY  IS NOT STICKY  ITS SIMPLY THE BEST HAIRSPRAY ON THE MARKET!</li>
    <li> The proctuct is great as ussual.I have used this brand for past 20yrs as far as I can remember.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 cans which arrived promptly.  The plastic caps on two of the cans were broken which was no big deal. I wish they still made this stuff. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years - local stores quit handling it I was happy that I could find it here</li>
    <li> I used it to spray on my hair for hold after applying Got2B hair gel (the black cover) and it did not hold. It also does not have a pleasing smell, but I can live with it. I&#x27;ll try it again tomorrow right after I apply the gel, hopefully, it&#x27;ll work better this time because I did not apply the hairspray right away after the gel.</li>
    <li> It has great hold, but smells like a womans product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for probably 30plus years. It works and affords me my dashing appearance always. Bruce[[ASIN:B000GCRAYG The Dry Look, For Men, Aerosol Hairspray, Extra Hold, 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> Firm hold with little spray. Hair still feels soft. I would recommend this product for short to medium hair with very little spray.</li>
    <li> So convenient to obtain this product since I cannot find it in any store.  Will order it again when it is time to do so.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my father. he got a case. He has used it since the 70&#x27;s and it did give him a fuller thicker style look than anything he tried. It was hard to find.......... Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Fantastic spray,  I have good hair as a man and make some pretty kickass hairstyles with it. From the Clark Kent to a fohawks.</li>
    <li> Good product, works quite well. 4 stars because there has to be better men&#x27;s hairspray out there. Nonetheless, I haven&#x27;t found them yet. Not the biggest fan of the smell.</li>
