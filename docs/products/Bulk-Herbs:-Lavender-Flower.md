    <li> Bought this to make soap. Had to remove the little twigs with a tweezer. Took me about 4 hours, maybe it&#x27;s the aromatherapy that calmed me down, allowing me to complete the tedious job. Not sure whether I want to do it again! Found a tiny yellow flower and a teeny snail as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time! Smells great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> not much lavendar scent</li>
    <li> wish it came in a resealable bag, but still great product.</li>
    <li> Fresh and very fragrant</li>
    <li> These worked great in an herb mix I made to discourage my cats from marking inside the house.</li>
    <li> Fresh, fragrant, and just the perfect moisture level for tea/smoking/cooking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad! Wanted this for soap but I can&#x27;t use it. It has a lot of little sticks in it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful lavender flowers. Promptly shipped &amp; very healthy! I am anxious to put together an a arthritis remedy which requires in part lavender flowers. I will buy again as they don&#x27;t grow well in my climate! Love them!  I will candy some of the flowers  to top my cakes &amp; cupcakes!</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely divine.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even bother opening the bag and just trashed it. Had more twigs and junk in it than actual flowers.</li>
    <li> Not for soap! little sticks  mixed in with the lavender flowers.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as expected. Used this for some bath bombs I made. Great smelling.</li>
    <li> My order contained quite a few twigs. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! Before I even opened the bag I could smell it. Comes in a ziplock, packaged great. Overall great stuff.</li>
    <li> It took forever to get to me. When what I thought was my lavender showed up....it ended up being some &amp;#34;as seen on t.v.&amp;#34; miracle socks and a miniature stylus.....very odd....very disappointed.  Will not be using this seller again.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. These smell so wonderful. I use them to make oil infusions for soap and they are perfect</li>
    <li> I really just want to say, I love these Lavender petals. The smell is amazing as soon as you open the bag and lasts. I use in most of my products for decoration and to infuse oils.

    <li> Got them in a timely manner and it smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised.  I used it on a dessert and it was divine</li>
    <li> fresh ad super fragrant, love mine</li>
    <li> Great service and wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Use lots of this in homemade products. Love the relaxing scent of lavender plus it is so pretty.  Also good mixed into potpourri mixes.</li>
    <li> the lavender was fresh and plenty of it.  excellent customer service !</li>
    <li> I am tired of chemical sprays that are supposed to bring a fresh scent into my place. So it&#x27;s time to get back to nature and try something basic I grew up with herbs and wildflowers and almost forgot how wonderful they are and the benefits they carry. This lavender flower is really more than I expected. I use it mainly for the aroma in my apartment. Just put a handful of the buds into a pot of boiling water and after a few minuted, the scent spreads throughout my whole place. It is clean, fresh and makes me feel like I&#x27;m again in a country garden. After a few minutes, I put it&lt;br /&gt;down to simmer. I like to  inhale some of the steam as it gives me a very relaxed feeling and also helps me sleep better. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for a more natural way of relaxing, especially  at the end of the day!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fragrant these buds are I smelled them before I even opened the box ! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Smelled great and worked well in my project.</li>
    <li> I gave a four star rating because the lavender was not as strong as I thought it would be, but I&#x27;ve mixed other essential oils with it to achieve the fragrance I want. Other than that I love it! Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The lavender is very fragrant.  It is easy to work with.  I have used it in bath salts. The bag seemed small, but it is workable</li>

    <li> Received item in a timely manner... used these to make lavender sachets, fits the bill.</li>
