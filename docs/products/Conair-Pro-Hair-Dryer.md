      <li>I love it....</li>
      <li>I love, love, love my Goldbird dryer.</li>
      <li>my wife love it, its not heavi and powerfull</li>
      <li>Its great for getting your hair straight.</li>
      <li>I had two before which gives me years of service and is still great except the heading seems worn out and will not hold the attachment which is the reason I bought this new one.</li>
      <li>I love this dryer, its easy on your hair and it came with attachments..</li>
      <li>The nozzzle doesn&#x27;t fit well and falls off too easily.  </li>
      <li>This dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more powerful than my 1875-watt dryer.  </li>
      <li>The old ones I have for about 18 years now and still in good use</li>
      <li>I would go with more popular version even even if it lacks that extra 150W.</li>
      <li>I like that this dryer provides greater heat than my 1800 dryer, however it doesn&#x27;t put out as much power.</li>

      <li>It gets SUPER hot and blows a lot of air.</li>
      <li>And it feels so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a month now, but I&#x27;m thinking that there isn&#x27;t a better blow dryer out there for the price.</li>
      <li>;D</li>
      <li>If you are natural and want to straighten your own hair before (or without) using a flat iron, this should do the trick.</li>
      <li>Fast, fast, fast, and</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This one is exactly the same</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for a new blow dryer because I don&#x27;t straighten my natural hair too often.</li>
      <li>My 19 year old had been sharing it -</li>
      <li>Last forever and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Very close to commercial heat.</li>
      <li>may have gotten a defective one, because mine is so hot I have to be careful sometimes.</li>
      <li>In my book that&#x27;s not bad after using it everyday almost.</li>
      <li>It only takes 4-6 passes from the scalp to the ends of each entire section to be completely dry and straight.</li>

<li> My daughter has really thick hair &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry her hair &amp; it leaves it straight &amp; soft.</li>
<li> I almost don&#x27;t need to flat iron afterwards.</li>
<li> 2000 WATTS TO DRY LONG HAIR IS THE ONLY WAY TO</li>
<li> because my dryer is now only working at half speed (same temp tho, that&#x27;s why I still use it).</li>
<li> It did not work as expected at all.</li>
<li> Not really an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I currently have a Conair Silverbird which I&#x27;ve had for a few years now.</li>
<li> There is really no difference.  </li>
<li> That extra 150W shortened the time to dry my long thick hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m thinking other who have reviewed this</li>
<li> Also, the nozzle that comes with it does fall off easier than other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
<li> I am a Black woman with very thick, curly/frizzy, coarse, mid-back length hair and it always takes a long time (~1-2 hours) and a lot of energy to blow dry my hair, even at the salon!</li>
<li> Product showed up on time and close to previous conair product I used.</li>
<li> Seriously!   </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sad</li>
<li> I am disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good my wife loves it</li>
    <li> It was good.  That extra 150W shortened the time to dry my long thick hair.  However, after 6 months, it stopped working for no reason.  One morning, it worked.  The next morning, it did not.  I tried plugging to different sockets and tested it; but, no luck.  I would go with more popular version even even if it lacks that extra 150W.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for a new blow dryer because I don&#x27;t straighten my natural hair too often. I read a lot of reviews before deciding to buy this Conair blow dryer. OMG!!!! &#x3D;D   I am a Black woman with very thick, curly/frizzy, coarse, mid-back length hair and it always takes a long time (~1-2 hours) and a lot of energy to blow dry my hair, even at the salon! But NOT with THIS DRYER!!! I cannot believe it. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month now, but I&#x27;m thinking that there isn&#x27;t a better blow dryer out there for the price. I parted my damp hair into 4 quadrants and used the comb attachment included. It only takes 4-6 passes from the scalp to the ends of each entire section to be completely dry and straight. And it feels so smooth and soft. Unheard of for me. I almost don&#x27;t need to flat iron afterwards. Seriously!   My daughters and nieces will be getting these as gifts from me this year.  ;D I am VERY happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Second one I have owned. They are great. Last forever and very sturdy.</li>
    <li> The dryer is cumbersome to hold when the nozzle is on.  The nozzzle doesn&#x27;t fit well and falls off too easily.  This dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more powerful than my 1875-watt dryer.  There is really no difference.  I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love it.... It works great!!!</li>
    <li> I like that this dryer provides greater heat than my 1800 dryer, however it doesn&#x27;t put out as much power.</li>
    <li> My daughter has this dryer and it worked so well I wanted one! Fast, fast, fast, and I have a lot of hair!</li>
    <li> my wife love it, its not heavi and powerfull</li>
    <li> I currently have a Conair Silverbird which I&#x27;ve had for a few years now. I felt like maybe it wasn&#x27;t working as good as it used to so I went ahead and bought the Goldbird. BIG MISTAKE. The Goldbird does not even compare to the Silverbird. I had to finish my blowout with the old dryer, which worked much better. The Goldbird is going back. It did not work as expected at all. I felt like I was using a cheapy hotel dryer which all it does it blow air and cause frizz.</li>
    <li> Love this produce !!! I had two before which gives me years of service and is still great except the heading seems worn out and will not hold the attachment which is the reason I bought this new one. The old ones I have for about 18 years now and still in good use so I decided to replace them with the same model.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 6 months, until it quit working one day for no reason.</li>
    <li> Product showed up on time and close to previous conair product I used. Met all expectations and was very happy.</li>
    <li> The dryer is working perfectly.  This has been a good buy!</li>
    <li> Very close to commercial heat. If you are natural and want to straighten your own hair before (or without) using a flat iron, this should do the trick.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice dryer.  I had one and when my daughter in law used it, she wanted one too.  We are both very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the straightening pic that came with the dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! My daughter has really thick hair &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry her hair &amp; it leaves it straight &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my Goldbird dryer. It gets SUPER hot and blows a lot of air. Its great for getting your hair straight. I&#x27;m thinking other who have reviewed this may have gotten a defective one, because mine is so hot I have to be careful sometimes. That&#x27;s just what I want though. Also, the nozzle that comes with it does fall off easier than other dryers I&#x27;ve owned. Not really an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad because my dryer is now only working at half speed (same temp tho, that&#x27;s why I still use it). It&#x27;s been about 2.5 years. In my book that&#x27;s not bad after using it everyday almost.</li>
    <li> This dryer is good. I&#x27;ve been looking for a dryer that produces a lot of heat for my hair. This works well.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair dryer.  I am so happy with the quality and how quickly it dries my hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer, its easy on your hair and it came with attachments.. It also arrived quickly and in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> 2000 WATTS TO DRY LONG HAIR IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO!&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL WONDER WHY YOU EVER USED ANYTHING ELSE.&lt;br /&gt;FAST DRYING!</li>
    <li> I had my last one of these for about 8-10 years. It finally went kaput.  My 19 year old had been sharing it - yeah that is a lot of blow drying.  This one is exactly the same and I hope to get another 8-10 years out of it.</li>
