      <li>Perfect for my use of inhaling essential oils if needed.  </li>
      <li>i thought I would love these</li>
      <li>The trick to making sure you can smell the oils is not to push the wick all the way inside of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>but the wick pushes against the metal grate at the top.  </li>
      <li>They have no air flow to let you pull the aromas out the top holes.</li>
      <li>You should see the top of the wick through the silver cap.</li>
      <li>but I found something better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving them as gifts with recipients favorite oil.</li>
      <li>I also think it would work better if the top had vents along the side for more air flow (like my quease ease has).</li>

      <li>and I think it&#x27;s fine now except for a lingering squeak.  </li>

      <li>Huge design flaw ...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say that they are still useful in our home .  </li>
      <li>Ok, so they are pretty, very pretty.  </li>
      <li>They work great, we love to use it, looking sharp and pretty.</li>
      <li>This means you may not be getting the full effect of the inhaler.  </li>
      <li>the aroma is just as strong as when first uncovered.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re lightweight, can fit in a pocket, and are really pretty.</li>
      <li>And they are pretty!</li>
      <li>In order to use as a true inhaler not only do you need air holes in the top (which it does)</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and packaged well.</li>
      <li>and I cannot use my wild orange and peppermint pick-me-up because the oils are too strong to get on her tender sking.  </li>
      <li>They are so pretty.</li>
      <li>I was sent the plastic disposable version at first.</li>
      <li>You can safely put all your essential oils in these.  </li>
      <li>Overall I would recommend as I have not seen anything better.</li>

      <li>(the name is copyrighted, and defended vigorously by the company)&amp;#34; blend (but am using the real thing, from that company, too), for immune support--I get upper respiratory infections easily.  </li>
      <li>These are nice little aromatherapy tubes.  </li>
      <li>Much classier than the plastic tubes.</li>
      <li>These really don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>These are so much nicer and classier looking than those plastic inhalers.</li>
      <li>They work really well.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company, they were very nice, and refunded me for the broken one.</li>
      <li>If it works well then I will fill the other two as well with my favorite blends for calming, and balancing.</li>
      <li>To fix this, I pushed some cotton down into the glass bottle then put the wick in so that it wouldn&#x27;t be able to go all the way into the bottle</li>
      <li>I pretty much have to stick it in my nose a little, which is fine,</li>
      <li>I love the case, I open it up all through the day and smell my germ fighter essential oil blend.</li>
      <li>I just replace the top between whiffs and when uncovered in a few seconds</li>
      <li>They are a really cute design, however, as others have posted, when you put the cotton wick into the glass bottle and put the top on, it pushes the wick down inside the bottle and you can hardly smell it.  </li>
      <li>Think of it more as a little vial of smelling salts, only you are choosing what smells to put in it.  </li>
      <li>The flu season hit hard; by keeping your inhaler handy with protective essential oils you may safeguard yourself from the flu.</li>
      <li>You do get a sight whiff of the essential oil ...but not the whole impact it.</li>
      <li>I will be using this for upcoming cross country air travel--that blend has been evaluated, and really does provide germ killing properties.   </li>
      <li>Nearly a week with no commericial antihistimines, and</li>
      <li>no regrets  thanks for such quality products</li>
      <li>Oddly, the blue one appeared to have been lightly glued - as in, the perforated lid was a bit sticky on the glass container.  </li>
      <li>It is true that the black screw on cap that is attched inside of the silver cap can come loose if too much oil is oozing around.</li>
      <li>I realized that the vile leaks a bit so now I saturate the wick and leave no other oil in the vile.  </li>
      <li>When I first received them I put a few drops of peppermint oil and eucalyptus to help with a stuffy nose is</li>
      <li>This causes the whole glass bottle to fall down inside of the tube.</li>
      <li>These work the way they are supposed to work but one of the 3 I received has an issue where the little glass bottle that holds the essential oils keeps slipping off of the silver inhaler piece at the top down into the bottom of the colored case.  </li>
      <li>yes the wick is tight; but tweezers OR a small (eyeglass type) screwdriver can also be used to pull the wick out easily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought one of these a few months ago. I love the case, I open it up all through the day and smell my germ fighter essential oil blend. Not sure that the other reviewer was talking about. I smell it just fine every time. Buying more to give as gifts!</li>
    <li> Much classier than the plastic tubes. And safer. These essential oils can eat away at plastics and glues. Use oil sparingly.  Amazing product.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE! Just what I needed</li>
    <li> Not what I was wanting. They do work as expected,  but I found something better</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even get it open in order to put the wick in it.</li>
    <li> These are very attractive.  I got them specifically to use with an essential oil blend for my daughter, who has occasional panic attacks, and one for myself for use with lavender to help with my insomnia.  They&#x27;re lightweight, can fit in a pocket, and are really pretty.</li>
    <li> Huge design flaw ... In order to use as a true inhaler not only do you need air holes in the top (which it does) but you need an air in the glass vial as well. You do get a sight whiff of the essential oil ...but not the whole impact it. I wasted my money on this😔</li>
    <li> Love the look, but the smell of the oils doesnt come out that great. I pretty much have to stick it in my nose a little, which is fine, no one else uses them - but I look nuts doing it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about these.  They are a really cute design, however, as others have posted, when you put the cotton wick into the glass bottle and put the top on, it pushes the wick down inside the bottle and you can hardly smell it.  To fix this, I pushed some cotton down into the glass bottle then put the wick in so that it wouldn&#x27;t be able to go all the way into the bottle but the wick pushes against the metal grate at the top.  I also think it would work better if the top had vents along the side for more air flow (like my quease ease has).</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These products are easy to fill and use  they are very attractive  no regrets  thanks for such quality products</li>
    <li> For some reason my review did not go through so although this was about a year ago that I ordered these I&#x27;m pleased to say that they are still useful in our home .  When I first received them I put a few drops of peppermint oil and eucalyptus to help with a stuffy nose is and I have replaced the drops a few times just to freshen them up but I still use this in fact I keep it under my pillow and my son has one that he keeps under his pillow for nights that we are stuffy or sick.  I would recommend these I think there are great buy and they&#x27;re very attractive and fashionable     If you feel like this review has been helpful to you in anyway please click the  button below:)</li>
    <li> Perfect for my use of inhaling essential oils if needed.  And they are pretty!</li>
    <li> These work the way they are supposed to work but one of the 3 I received has an issue where the little glass bottle that holds the essential oils keeps slipping off of the silver inhaler piece at the top down into the bottom of the colored case.  This means you may not be getting the full effect of the inhaler.  The other two do not have this issue.  Overall I would recommend as I have not seen anything better.</li>
    <li> I love these! These are so much nicer and classier looking than those plastic inhalers. I use them in my aromatherapy.  I use these all the time. In fact, these are all I use. I give them as gifts to friends and family. They work really well. I have not had any problems with them. 5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> These are really nice to have.  I&#x27;m giving them as gifts with recipients favorite oil.</li>
    <li> Update 3/4/17:  Because of these, I&#x27;ve stopped taking Zyrtec and Claritin D because I&#x27;ve discovered the Essential oil combinations can make that cough, and tickle and wheeze go away.        I am using Lemon, peppermint and Lavender (ingesting in water -- it helps ALOT!), and now I&#x27;m doing Lemon, Peppermint, White Thyme and Rosemary (inhaling 3x a day).  Nearly a week with no commericial antihistimines, and I am sleeping soundly with no cough, and no dry mouth in the morning.   These things are great.  I keep one in my bag and take it with me everywhere.  (especially my church, where something on Sunday morning makes me cough and sneeze).    You can safely put all your essential oils in these.  I am making my own version of  the &amp;#34;robber&#x27;s&amp;#34; (the name is copyrighted, and defended vigorously by the company)&amp;#34; blend (but am using the real thing, from that company, too), for immune support--I get upper respiratory infections easily.  I will be using this for upcoming cross country air travel--that blend has been evaluated, and really does provide germ killing properties.   Since I have ongoing sinus issues, I&#x27;ll be using another  inhaler to put in eucalyptus oil or ravintsara, as desired.  I was playing with these after they arrived--yes the wick is tight; but tweezers OR a small (eyeglass type) screwdriver can also be used to pull the wick out easily.  As another person indicated on the plastic inhalers, you can order premium filter tips and use those for wicks.  (wish I&#x27;d thought of that).</li>
    <li> They work great, we love to use it, looking sharp and pretty.</li>
    <li> Ok, so they are pretty, very pretty.  And they are much larger than I exected from reading other reviews. One review said the glass vile was &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; but it holds about 2.5ml which is half of a small bottle of DoTerra.  I was really grateful for the review that said to &amp;#34;prime the wick&amp;#34; because the wick itself sucks up about a ml of oil before it starts working. After using it for a while I realized that the vile leaks a bit so now I saturate the wick and leave no other oil in the vile.  I take care of my infant granddaughter and I cannot use my wild orange and peppermint pick-me-up because the oils are too strong to get on her tender sking.  So instead of putting a drop of each on my hands to breath in the invigorating fumes, I can now use this handy inhaler.  We will see how long it lasts.  The scent is not nearly as robust as it is when rubbed into the skin but I&#x27;m feeing encouraged.  If it works well then I will fill the other two as well with my favorite blends for calming, and balancing.</li>
    <li> Perfect , just what in was looking for</li>
    <li> These are nice little aromatherapy tubes.  The lavender one squeaks a little as you remove or replace the perforated lid that is on the glass container, but it&#x27;s not an issue.  Oddly, the blue one appeared to have been lightly glued - as in, the perforated lid was a bit sticky on the glass container.  I picked glue off and I think it&#x27;s fine now except for a lingering squeak.  If not for that, I would have given them five stars.  They otherwise appear to be very good quality inhalers for the price.  If you are not familiar with this type of &amp;#34;inhaler&amp;#34; ... once you have the wick in there, in order to use it you sort of wave it under your nose and inhale.  It&#x27;s not your typical inhaler, there are no vents at the bottom and it is not meant to be &amp;#34;stuck up your nose&amp;#34; and inhaled.  Think of it more as a little vial of smelling salts, only you are choosing what smells to put in it.  If you want another scent, you can also stuff part of a cotton ball into the bottle and use that to hold oil.  All you need is a tweezers to remove it if you again want to change out the scent.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed when 2 out of the 3 inhalers came apart after only a couple of weeks. I used them according to the directions and after only a couple uses the cap that screws the glass tube up into the the silver cap with the holes has come apart causing the glass tube to fall down into the aluminum tube and rendering the inhaler ineffective. I have contacted the company in hopes of a resolution and will update reveiw once I hear back.</li>
    <li> i thought I would love these but the metal rollers have an odd smell  it also seems to alter the smell of the oils</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Easy to use, they look great, and the scent remains strong. Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> **UPDATED** after I opened the inhaler sticks and put the wick in to use it! I found that these are indeed useless. They have no air flow to let you pull the aromas out the top holes. You can sniff as hard as you can and still nothing. They are so pretty. Super fast shipping and packaged well. I am so disappointed. I will be requesting my money back.</li>
    <li> These are really good! I use them for homemade essential oil blends for aromatherapy! Very nice!</li>
    <li> These really don&#x27;t work. They are beautiful but there are no vents at the lower part of tube to draw air over the wick inside. Also I requested a refund and have yet to hear anything except they would return instructions.</li>
    <li> To me these are just too fragile, I planned on carrying one in my purse, but I would be afraid to now. .. one arrived dented, and glass vial was shattered. I contacted the company, they were very nice, and refunded me for the broken one. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The company sent the wrong item but refunded me quickly once notified. Since then bought the item elsewhere. I don&#x27;t use wicks, just a tiny bit of cotton ball with a couple drops of birchhillhappenings anxiety stop and calming EO for panic attacks. Works great. Lasts a long time. I just replace the top between whiffs and when uncovered in a few seconds the aroma is just as strong as when first uncovered. Just leaving it uncovered while breathing in the aroma repeatedly doesn&#x27;t work as great. I was sent the plastic disposable version at first. Don&#x27;t waste your money on them unless you like the smell of plastic. The oils dissipate through the plastic in no time and you can&#x27;t refill them. This version is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I bought these despite some of the negative reviews. The trick to making sure you can smell the oils is not to push the wick all the way inside of the bottle. You should see the top of the wick through the silver cap. It is true that the black screw on cap that is attched inside of the silver cap can come loose if too much oil is oozing around. This causes the whole glass bottle to fall down inside of the tube. To resolve the problem, I took a 3&amp;#34; square piece of tissue, stuffed it in the bottom of the longer tube, and my bottle rests in the perfect position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really are beautiful inhalers. I use them for doTERRA Serenity and Peppermint oils. I took the peppermint inhaler on a whale watching boat tour to manage my motion sickness and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> A gift that keeps on giving using antibacterial, antiviral essential oils. The flu season hit hard; by keeping your inhaler handy with protective essential oils you may safeguard yourself from the flu.</li>
    <li> These are perfect. A good size, very well made and the colors are better than depicted in the picture.</li>
