      <li>This mask is awesome</li>
      <li>my skin has been in great condition and i am 76 yars old.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased these products in Vegas for quite a bit of money, and was happy to find them on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Liked the feel of the product, but not the $200 price tag!</li>
      <li>that is about it...still looking for something good.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t fair to the product.  </li>
      <li>I think it is that good.</li>
      <li>For me I am so good to degradeerde with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have been using these products since November, and my skin never looked so good, felt so good, or made the makeup I put on after look so good.  </li>
      <li>sure you try this product!</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product at this price.</li>
      <li>I like the warm sensation it has when you apply it</li>
      <li>It is supposed to get warm when it comes in contact with the skin...</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, and makes your skin so very soft.</li>
      <li>My skin has never been so smooth and healthy looking before!</li>
      <li>I am allergic to many creams and lotions but not this one.</li>
      <li>I started using these products 7 mos ago and have never been more satisfied with results from a skin care line.</li>
      <li>Also they need to package it with a better seal as it always arrives having leaked a bit.</li>
      <li>enough said, works great!</li>
      <li>I am in love..</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a product line that I like better.  </li>
      <li>1/2&amp;#34; oil laying on top of the product</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>After applying the mask the skin color aligned, whereby my skin looks healthier and more youthful.</li>
      <li>Works best with moisturizer and cleanser from the same line.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin smooth and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>so i have not been able to use it yet.&lt;br /&gt;the seller has advised me that they would be happy to give me a refund,&lt;br /&gt;i will try the product in the near future,  i use Gratiae products and i have been very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Paid about $25 for the mask, including free shipping.</li>
      <li>I received my cream and have been using it for a few days, it is absolutely wonderful!</li>
      <li>It warms up when you add water and your face will feel super clean!</li>
      <li>I will also send an updated review with full stars after using the product.</li>
      <li>By far hands down, this is a wonderful Product.</li>
      <li>and you can have products that work far better from a leading department store.</li>
      <li>Warms up initially, but doesn&#x27;t stay warm.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase</li>
      <li>but it just isn&#x27;t worth the money for the results you get.</li>
      <li>the first time I ever saw this product, there was a couple woman doing demos there.</li>
      <li>But, after applying the mask my skin becomes matt and this effect lasts the whole day!</li>
      <li>It warms up for a few minutes on the skin and feels really good when it&#x27;s washed off.</li>
      <li>I have used several face regimens in the past and this is by far the best, and for the price that AMAZON has it for makes it GOLDEN!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like more instructions for how long to leave it on before rinsing it off.  </li>
      <li>I first tried this mask after I was \\&quot;captured\\&quot; by a very animated sales person at the Gratiae kiosk in the mall.</li>
      <li>Made my skin feel warm and tight.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much of anything.</li>
      <li>It really does tighten up sagging areas around your face and lesson lines.</li>
      <li>I really like the way it cleanses the pores and seems to tighten the skin.</li>
      <li>I like the moisturizers and serums, but this mask does not do much.  </li>
      <li>guess is to purchase directly from Gratiae for $500 to get fresh product.</li>
      <li>I paid full price for this product and got totally ripped off ($600).</li>
      <li>I was a Mary Kay customer &amp; representative for over ten years, but noticed as the years get on -- you need more, because of the various marks that develop on one&#x27;s face.  </li>
      <li>If your looking to keep your face refreshed and new</li>
      <li>This product brought my skin to a new level...</li>
      <li>This mask is fabulous, especially if you follow it up with the Oro Gold Deep Peel.  </li>
      <li>This product is old and can&#x27;t stir it up to use.  </li>
      <li>old, no wrinkles or botox...</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s non-irritating.</li>
      <li>And it was only half filled inside, and clearly pre-opened, since smears of the content were oozing out everywhere.</li>
      <li>THE cover of the jard is not closed properly and cream by whole packaging leaked.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s made a big difference in my skin, but I will continue to use it monthly and report back.</li>
      <li>Is now only half full and the cream in the jard  is completely hardened</li>
      <li>It leaves skin soft and supple but I have used other products that were less than half that did an equivalent or better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have other products from this company and this would be my least favorite.</li>
      <li>It did not heat very much and did not last but a few seconds.</li>

<li> The website is a bit vague.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If your looking to keep your face refreshed and new make sure you try this product! It warms up when you add water and your face will feel super clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like more instructions for how long to leave it on before rinsing it off.  The website is a bit vague.  They should give an estimate of time like, about 3 minutes or something.  Also they need to package it with a better seal as it always arrives having leaked a bit.</li>
    <li> I paid full price for this product and got totally ripped off ($600). I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for a month along with other Gratiae products and see no improvement whatsover. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I started using these products 7 mos ago and have never been more satisfied with results from a skin care line. For those that don&#x27;t like them...perhaps you are not using correctly or regularly...you must be religious about use, morning/evening. I had a business meeting last night and was repeatedly complimented on my skin...46 yrs. old, no wrinkles or botox...just Gratiae...enough said, works great!</li>
    <li> I admit I am a Chanel snob, and used their beauty line for 10 years anyway.  I have tried others along the way, lancome, laura mercier, etc.  I haven&#x27;t found a product line that I like better.  This mask is fabulous, especially if you follow it up with the Oro Gold Deep Peel.  I purchased these products in Vegas for quite a bit of money, and was happy to find them on Amazon.  I have been using these products since November, and my skin never looked so good, felt so good, or made the makeup I put on after look so good.  My teenaged kids asked me what I was doing differently as my skin is glowing , at age 51.  Seriously.  The compliments just keep coming.  I have been getting microdermabrasion faithfully for years.  No more.  I feel sorry for the reviewer who paid full price but it isn&#x27;t fair to the product.  I think it is that good.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product YET, but I should be receiving it shortly. I will also send an updated review with full stars after using the product. The purpose of this post is to hopefully ease your minds when applying your beauty products regarding the PEG-8 ingredient. Please follow the link below.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! I received my cream and have been using it for a few days, it is absolutely wonderful! I have been using this with the eye serum and cream, and I just received the face lifting serum. My skin has never been so smooth and healthy looking before! I truly am amazed. I have used several face regimens in the past and this is by far the best, and for the price that AMAZON has it for makes it GOLDEN! I am in love..and so is my skin! I will update again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have other products from this company and this would be my least favorite. It did not heat very much and did not last but a few seconds. Did nothing for expression marks....</li>
    <li> For forty years, I have used a masking system for facial cleansing at least once a week. I was a Mary Kay customer &amp; representative for over ten years, but noticed as the years get on -- you need more, because of the various marks that develop on one&#x27;s face.  This product brought my skin to a new level...</li>
    <li> Vertalen.nu Vraagbaak Zoekmachine&lt;br /&gt;Inloggen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woordenboek&lt;br /&gt;Zinnen vertalen&lt;br /&gt;Zinnenboek&lt;br /&gt;Vervoegen&lt;br /&gt;Mijn Account&lt;br /&gt;Automatische vertaling van tekst in tientallen talen&lt;br /&gt;Welke tekst wil je vertalen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have got today this Cream  unfortunately received damaged. THE cover of the jard is not closed properly and cream by whole packaging leaked. Is now only half full and the cream in the jard  is completely hardened so you need a chisel to get iT out of the jard. For me I am so good to degradeerde with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I became so well fooled with this product</li>
    <li> Warms up initially, but doesn&#x27;t stay warm.  Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much of anything. Would not spend money to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I first tried this mask after I was \\&quot;captured\\&quot; by a very animated sales person at the Gratiae kiosk in the mall. Liked the feel of the product, but not the $200 price tag! Went home and searched the internet. On Amazon I found all the products I&#x27;d sampled at the mall for a fraction of the cost. Paid about $25 for the mask, including free shipping. I&#x27;ve used the mask once. Made my skin feel warm and tight. I am allergic to many creams and lotions but not this one. Can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s made a big difference in my skin, but I will continue to use it monthly and report back.</li>
    <li> It leaves skin soft and supple but I have used other products that were less than half that did an equivalent or better job.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it makes my skin feel but it just isn&#x27;t worth the money for the results you get. A couple of regiments and you could have a peel.  For about 40% of the cost and you can have products that work far better from a leading department store. I am not naming the leading cosmetic because I am not sure I am allowed to do that. I just can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product at this price.</li>
    <li> the item arrived damaged so i have not been able to use it yet.&lt;br /&gt;the seller has advised me that they would be happy to give me a refund,&lt;br /&gt;i will try the product in the near future,  i use Gratiae products and i have been very pleased with it. my skin has been in great condition and i am 76 yars old.&lt;br /&gt;Erica Ciesla</li>
    <li> Yuck! What an oily, dirty container this one came in! And it was only half filled inside, and clearly pre-opened, since smears of the content were oozing out everywhere. When I scooped out the content to feel for its texture, it was so pasty and dry that it could not be used. Whatever you do, do not trust this seller!</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome I love it and it definately firms the skin.  I like the warm sensation it has when you apply it</li>
    <li> It came to me opened and a gooey mess. I was not happy, but all is well now. It does heat, but not for very long. It should only be used twice a month, which the box did not say, and there is a review out there of it containing something it shouldn&#x27;t contain. I would wait until they perfect this one before I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it cleanses the pores and seems to tighten the skin. I have sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s non-irritating. It warms up for a few minutes on the skin and feels really good when it&#x27;s washed off. I use it once or twice weekly, along with the rest of the line.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy from the kiosk!!!  So happy to find this product line on amazon for a fraction of the cost!  I like the moisturizers and serums, but this mask does not do much.  Yes, it is warming but that is about it...still looking for something good.</li>
    <li> This product is old and can&#x27;t stir it up to use.  1/2&amp;#34; oil laying on top of the product and it smells as though it is not fresh.  This is my second jar of this and I am very disappointed.  It is supposed to get warm when it comes in contact with the skin...does not do this.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is to purchase directly from Gratiae for $500 to get fresh product.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth and healthy looking. Works best with moisturizer and cleanser from the same line.  Well worth the purchase</li>
    <li> This item was offered to me at $500 at the kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the item has PEG-8. When looking this up in EWG&#x27;s skin deep database: \\&quot;The term \\&quot;PEG\\&quot; (polyethylene glycol) is used for synthetic polymers of ethylene oxide; these polymers may be contamated with potentially toxic manufacturing impurities such as 1,4-dioxane.... Violation of industry recommendations - Restricted in cosmetics; use, concentration, or manufacturing restrictions - Not safe for use on injured or damaged skin \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I feel sorry for those who paid extremely high prices for this, but its really unfair to the product itself. By far hands down, this is a wonderful Product. It smells wonderful, and makes your skin so very soft. I worked at Sams Club the first time I ever saw this product, there was a couple woman doing demos there. I tried the product, and before I went home that day I bought the scrub and body butter.</li>
    <li> I have an oily skin. But, after applying the mask my skin becomes matt and this effect lasts the whole day! Moreover, I noticed a whitening effect. After applying the mask the skin color aligned, whereby my skin looks healthier and more youthful. Great product at Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> I use it  monthly and before vacations/holidays.  It really does tighten up sagging areas around your face and lesson lines.</li>
