    <li> I am grossed out by the thought of dirty little airborne droplets of unknown origins on my toothbrush. I thought these would protect the brush head. I only needed one, but I bought the packet of five for a ridiculous price, especially considering that they don&#x27;t fit my Braun Oral B electric toothbrush.  (They look like they will fit a regular toothbrush head.)  I see one review here that said the buyer had to cut the hole larger for their electric toothbrush to fit. I don&#x27;t think I should have to modify two little pieces of overpriced plastic to get the results promised in their pitch. I should send them back but it isn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
    <li> They do the job and at a reasonable price. The packaging wasn&#x27;t that great- would prefer a box as opposed to a small zip loc bag but they work great.</li>
    <li> I love these travel cases because they are so much less bulky than other toothbrush travel cases. They last a long time too.</li>
    <li> exactly what we needed</li>
    <li> In writing this, I&#x27;m noticing that the picture doesn&#x27;t look anything like the holders I got. but the ones that came work for what I need them too. It did come with five.</li>
    <li> Fits my Oral-B- Pro-Health toothbrush perfectly!! Keeps brush head fresh and clean! I recommend them to everyone. Inexpensive way to have a fresh toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great deal.</li>
    <li> received these thooth brush covers really fast. We are really pleased with them. I like them because you can see you when the brush is wore out. My son tends to not replace it always when needed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> received these in the mailbox yesterday along with a .75cent big tube of aquafresh. i was scared these would not fit my reach toothbrushes as some of the reviews stated these didn&#x27;t fit some toothbrushes and these are so tiny looking. well, i opened one and put in my biggest sized reach toothbrush and BAM it fit PERFECTLY and even snapped shut with no problem what so ever so i was excited to put my other 2 reach toothbrushes of 2 different sizes in these and find the same thing... fit perfectly and snapped shut with no problem.</li>
    <li> They cover the toothbrush for my toddler.  We live in Flordia where I am in constant fear of palmetto bugs getting on our toothbrushes.  These covers work great!</li>
    <li> Glad to have these for camping and packing use.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush covers are too small and flimsy.  Even by grandchildren&#x27;s toothbrushes wouldn&#x27;t fit in them.</li>
    <li> JUNK.. Not the covers pictured, just flimsy hinged covers.  Though charging over $1.00 each these are worth more like 5 cents.  One arrived broken at the cheap hinge side, another broke when I snapped it over my toothbrush.  Not worth the postage to return.  Avoid this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> They are way too small, I can&#x27;t fit any normal size toothbrush in it.</li>
    <li> It did come in a little zip lock bag and not packaged, no problem. They don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ll last long but ok for now.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush covers are great! Thank you for such prompt service</li>
    <li> The covers pop open on their own. If you have your toothbrush in them in a travel bag or your purse, they always pop open leaving your toothbrush exposed to the elements. There is no point.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling, but I use them everyday</li>
