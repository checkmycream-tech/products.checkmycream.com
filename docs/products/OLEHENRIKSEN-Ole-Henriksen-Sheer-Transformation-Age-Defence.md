      <li>i love</li>
      <li>I use many of the Ole Henriksen products and love them all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure by then</li>

      <li>Seems to magically evaporate over time.</li>
      <li>Skin feels nice and smooth..</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I found it to be very hydrating for a lotion, yet it absorbs pretty quickly (great if you want to put on makeup afterward).  </li>
      <li>It is light, has a very mild fragrant odor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal customer!</li>
      <li>I used it morning and night, and as a light moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It is really light and doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily.</li>
      <li>It works, it is light and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So light and moisturizing</li>
      <li>I was originally introduced to this product when I got a free sample from Sephora.  </li>
      <li>more about it here if you&#x27;re interested: http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skin-care-basics/_/jar-packaging#beneficial</li>
      <li>Its not the most moisturizing, you need to use a separate moisturizer, but as an SPF its the only one I&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>Its not the most moisturizing, you need to use a separate moisturizer, but as an SPF its the only one I&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>Light, non greasy and absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
      <li>Love it when products really show results on aging skin.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.</li>
      <li>I originally received a smaller size as a gift as part of a collection right before my wedding and it was so light but effective.</li>
      <li>but this leaves my skin calm and supple and silky and moist.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the ONLY thing in the kit that I liked and used.  </li>
      <li>but I think this cream is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well worth it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the price.  </li>
      <li>and she was right-</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t have much in the way of strong feelings for or against</li>
      <li>When applied to the face it &#x27;sinks in&#x27; pretty quickly but can leave a bit of a sheen and feels a bit greasy, kind of like a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>About myself: I am almost thirty and used to tan frequently, however my skin doesn&#x27;t show much sun damage and is fairly healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second 1.7 oz jar with three more to spare because I don&#x27;t want to run out of a good thing and the expiration date is 2013 - if I live that long.  </li>
      <li>Because of all of these issues I&#x27;m pretty picky about the products I use and expect a lot from my skin</li>
      <li>love Sheer Transformation, and have used it for about two years.</li>
      <li>however when I used retinoids alone my skin still looked pretty crummy</li>
      <li>I continue to buy this cream regardless simply because I love the texture.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Honestly the only thing that has worked to fade my acne scars has been peels from the dermatologist and even then it doesn&#x27;t fade them completely.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this cream because of the positive reviews - who reviewed this...sponsors????  </li>
      <li>That said, I figure using this as part of my regime certainly can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I missed it too much.</li>
      <li>Really smooths/clears up your skin, and does it gently.</li>
      <li>The lightweight cream/lotion is soothing, gentle, absorbs well, non-greasy and can be layered with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>For some reason, spending over $40 on a cream just feels like too much</li>
      <li>Olay Definity Intense Hydrating Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Ole Henriksen has very affordable skin care products.</li>
      <li>really like this product.  </li>
      <li>this cream really couldn&#x27;t help that flaw).  </li>
      <li>Very very sheer and light -</li>
      <li>This one and the Peptide wrinkle cream are the only ones I&#x27;ve liked enough to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>While I loved the pack, and it gave me a big skin boost at the moment, I soon noticed that after applying this cream the my nose got black clogged pores, which I did not like at all.</li>
      <li>I have been lucky enough not to have any acne or dark spots, but I still love using this cream every night before I go to bed.</li>
      <li>I particularly like this cream because it&#x27;s non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>also highly recommend their [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Love that it is so moisturizing without being heavy and dense.</li>
      <li>I am hispanic, have a fair to medium complexion, skin tends to be dry or combination, have a few freckles and spots.</li>
      <li>used to be a product junkie, and bought something new whenever I ran out.</li>
      <li>Kind of expensive, but very much worth the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to magically evaporate over time. Good product, but it shouldn&#x27;t disappear/disintegrate without using. It&#x27;s like flushing your money down the drain.</li>
    <li> I was originally introduced to this product when I got a free sample from Sephora.  After a week of use, I was completely hooked and completely convinced.  Like some of the other reviews listed, I too have oily skins with some dark marks/scars.  It lessened these completely, made my pores appear smaller, and simply made my skin feel moisturized yet not greasy.  I have even noticed that it lessens acne breakouts by helping with skin cell turnover and limits dead skin cells.  If you have similar skin issues, try it.  It is worth the cost and the 1.7 oz lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I first found this with the Three Little Wonders kit for about $30.  Well worth it.  It&#x27;s the ONLY thing in the kit that I liked and used.  It&#x27;s very light without clogging pores.  Even at 65 I still have oily skin.  Only in the past few months have I begun using ANY cream or lotion on my face and then only around the eyes, the mouth and the neck.  I&#x27;m on my second 1.7 oz jar with three more to spare because I don&#x27;t want to run out of a good thing and the expiration date is 2013 - if I live that long.  I&#x27;m sure by then I&#x27;ll ante up for more.  I particularly like this cream because it&#x27;s non-greasy.  The skin feels and looks great but does not feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;.  Does not burn eyes.  Use with confidence.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer but it was irritating to my rosacea prone skin.  I should have read ingredient list.  It does smell and feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a seasonal gift pack and have been using it for about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a morning moisturizer and I really don&#x27;t have much in the way of strong feelings for or against it.&lt;br /&gt;The product looks and feels iridescent whipped cream. When applied to the face it &#x27;sinks in&#x27; pretty quickly but can leave a bit of a sheen and feels a bit greasy, kind of like a sunscreen. I have oily combination skin and if I don&#x27;t use a powder, I notice the oil even in the dry winter months when my oily skin doesn&#x27;t &#x27;flare up&#x27; too much.&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my eyebrows extremely greasy if I accidentally get it on them. It does, however moisturize pretty well, especially my dry cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again. A big factor is because it is in a jar which causes the beneficial ingredients to degrade due to exposure to light and air. Not to mention it is somewhat unsanitary to stick your fingers in it repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;Read more about it here if you&#x27;re interested: http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skin-care-basics/_/jar-packaging#beneficial</li>
    <li> This cream completely transformed my skin!  I had tons of acne dark spots and after a week of application they were totally gone.  It&#x27;s a light cream that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and isn&#x27;t heavy under make up.  I used it morning and night, and as a light moisturizer.  A MUST FOR EVERY BATHROOM CABINET!</li>
    <li> Very very sheer and light - never feels heavy or oily - I have blemish prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t bothered it a bit. I use Retin-A so my skin can get all flaky and red and generally misbehave but this leaves my skin calm and supple and silky and moist.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I have been searching for months for something that won&#x27;t break out my oily skin.  The woman at Sephora recommended this and she was right- it is amazing.  It has a great texture and goes on smooth and feels refreshing, it moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t break me out.  LOVE!  It&#x27;s totally worth the price.  I&#x27;m not sure about the benefits of clearing past acne spots, but I think the overall texture of my skin is vastly improved.</li>
    <li> I tried this with 3 little wonders week pack. While I loved the pack, and it gave me a big skin boost at the moment, I soon noticed that after applying this cream the my nose got black clogged pores, which I did not like at all. While it hydrates enough (the skin does not feel stretchy), the clogged pores are a definite no for me. My skin is mixed/oily, but dehydrated.</li>
    <li> I feel so bad for having spent any money on this.  I have been using for a while and NOTHING happened, nothing at all!  No improvement of any sort.  I wonder if I can get my money back...</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with some acne scars, and this moisturizer has done wonders for my skin! I have been searching for the perfect moisturizer for my skin for quite some time, and this is it! It moisturizes without making me greasy and has faded the spots on my face. My skin just feels softer, too! A little goes a long way so I don&#x27;t mind the price! It&#x27;s the first thing I&#x27;ve used from Ole and plan on trying some of his other stuff, too!!</li>
    <li> Nothing works from Henriksen…Money back????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any expensive skin creams before, but after trying a sample of this product, I bought the full size. It greatly helps with my blotchiness and my skin feels much smoother. I can even get away with no makeup (except dark circle concealer - this cream really couldn&#x27;t help that flaw).  I wish the price was a little less.</li>
    <li> AWESOME, AWESOME!  Used it twice and can already see the different.  Thank God!!</li>
    <li> Great, light moisturizer--not greasy.</li>
    <li> I tried a nice sized sample of this and loved it. The lightweight cream/lotion is soothing, gentle, absorbs well, non-greasy and can be layered with sunscreen. Minimal scent to it. I noticed a change in my skin tone after using up the sample, that never happens. I wish this came in a pump or squeeze bottle and had sunscreen included, but this product is still a winner.</li>
    <li> Love this product, been using it for a year and a half and have no regrets. Just remember to only use a little bit and apply it with water, since it&#x27;s highly concentrated.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer without the chemicals</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely amazing! It is really light and doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily. I have been lucky enough not to have any acne or dark spots, but I still love using this cream every night before I go to bed. I tend to have dry skin and this product helps immensely. I will never stop using it!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Light, non greasy and absorbs quickly into your skin. Works great my skin looks brighter and clearer....i love ole products n use them for my skin care routine and it made a drastic change in the way my skin looks. Healthy and it glows!!!!!</li>
    <li> To lend context, I&#x27;m 30 years old and I have terribly problematic skin.  It&#x27;s sensitive, dry and acne prone which can be a frustrating combination and in the winter time when the air is at its driest, it has a tendency to look dull even with a humidifier.  Because of all of these issues I&#x27;m pretty picky about the products I use and expect a lot from my skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it in place of a typical moisturizer and it seems to work pretty well for that purpose for me, even in the winter time.  I found it to be very hydrating for a lotion, yet it absorbs pretty quickly (great if you want to put on makeup afterward).  I like that after it absorbs I can no longer feel it on my skin, unlike creams that sometimes just seem to sit on the surface and have an unpleasant feeling.  I also didn&#x27;t think it negatively interfered with applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will say is that I haven&#x27;t seen the dramatic fading of acne scars as others have mentioned.  I am prone to cystic acne so it is possible mine are more severe, but any fading seems to be subtle.  Honestly the only thing that has worked to fade my acne scars has been peels from the dermatologist and even then it doesn&#x27;t fade them completely.  That said, I figure using this as part of my regime certainly can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I am hispanic, have a fair to medium complexion, skin tends to be dry or combination, have a few freckles and spots. This didn&#x27;t help my spots but, then again, mine are from stubborn melasma and no one product alone has worked on them. I continue to buy this cream regardless simply because I love the texture. It feels perfect for me.  Its not oily or greasy, not too thick, not too thin and runny, not too rich, not  too....I don&#x27;t know what the opposite of that would be but, whatever it is, its not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I alternate use with this one...[[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]] which is a little bit cheaper, feels a little richer (which I like after a peel) and feels almost as good.  Its really not a big price difference, like $10, so its mainly psychological. For some reason, spending over $40 on a cream just feels like too much so I try to delay it but I think this cream is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other creams I&#x27;ve tried,&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RTPT8M Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion 4.2 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0012J30LY Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RN74AY Olay Definity Intense Hydrating Cream, 1.7 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00021KD2C derma e Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Wrinkle Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me, 4-Ounce Jar  - Packaging May Vary]][[ASIN:B000PKCSR8 Derma E - Retinol &amp; Green Tea Advanced Renewal Creme, 2 oz cream]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00008ZPG9 Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B006VJMM50 ANEW GENICS Night Treatment Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;and many more store brand names. They either didn&#x27;t wow me, made me break out, weren&#x27;t moisturizing enough, were too greasy or left a residue. This one and the Peptide wrinkle cream are the only ones I&#x27;ve liked enough to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend their [[ASIN:B004ZF75LS Ole Henriksen Protect the Truth Sunscreen SPF 50+-1.7 oz]] SPF cream.  Its hard to find high spf that doesn&#x27;t smell funky, burn your eyes or leave a haze. I tried 3-4 different brands until I found this one and it does neither of those things I mentioned. In fact, it smells quite delicious, cirtrusy.  Its not the most moisturizing, you need to use a separate moisturizer, but as an SPF its the only one I&#x27;ve liked.SPF 50+-1.7 oz]] SPF cream.

    <li> I ordered this cream because of the positive reviews - who reviewed this...sponsors????  I found that it did nothing to lighten skin pigmentation and dark spots...NOTHING!  This is a totally worthless product!</li>
    <li> Ole Henriksen has very affordable skin care products. This is one that I use at night.mi have a favorite moisturizer for day use, and this cream is perfect for restoration. It is light, has a very mild fragrant odor. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. The price is wonderful for the product that you get. Elsewhere you would pay a great deal for this cream. It works, it is light and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 07-08-14</li>
    <li> Love that it is so moisturizing without being heavy and dense.</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Light enough for me, i really dont like heavy moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;im prone to acne, but this didn&#x27;t give me any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;will buy again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion. I originally received a smaller size as a gift as part of a collection right before my wedding and it was so light but effective. I feel like it made my skin look better and my skin could actually breath. It is pricy but it last a long time. I probably have used less than half of my jar and I use it 2x a day for the last 2 months. Also note: I live in Chicago with HARSH winter weather and crazy hot summers.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent creme for sensitive skin.  I had a sample I received from a Christmas gift and loved it.  This will make you look younger and smoother.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I tried this recently and within a few days saw a difference in my skin.  I use Obaji blender too. Love it when products really show results on aging skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good, light weight, fragrance free moisturizer. I have been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t seen any amazing changes, but its a good moisturizer that isnt greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I wont go out of my way to buy it again.</li>
    <li> About myself: I am almost thirty and used to tan frequently, however my skin doesn&#x27;t show much sun damage and is fairly healthy. I do get patches of rough skin and the occasional blemish. When I get a blemish it tends to stay on my face as a red mark for quite sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Sheer Transformation, and have used it for about two years. I use this over Truth Serum (am) or Invigorating Night Gel (pm). I do use a variety of other Ole Henricksen products so it is hard to pinpoint exactly what has caused my skin to look so good. Since starting my skin looks radiant. My breakouts have calmed down (retnoids alone didn&#x27;t do this), pores look smaller, and makeup goes on smooth. I am in college at 30, and my classmates didn&#x27;t know I wasn&#x27;t their age until I told them. It&#x27;s a thing too, \\&quot;Did you know Michelle is 30!!\\&quot; It&#x27;s hard to comment on fine lines or wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have any and I don&#x27;t know if I would have any otherwise. I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer in addition to this (except in December), but I don&#x27;t think this is an actual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a product junkie, and bought something new whenever I ran out. I deviated once from Ole Henricksen but it was only because I was trying to use up old stuff/cut costs. After a month I went online and reordered. I missed it too much. Since that deviation I have not bought any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Ole Henricksen I also use: Truth Serum, Invigorating Night Gel, Sheer Transformation, and alternate between African Red Tea Foaming Cleanser and Truth to Go Wipes. I have used the power peel system (Ole Henricksen) three times and I do use retnoids, however when I used retinoids alone my skin still looked pretty crummy so I know that Ole Henricksen products are doing something!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I have ever bought.  It feels so soft and silky and I have a sheer look on my face.  I have told my friends about this product.  I was given this as a sample to begin with and loved it.  That is why I went to Amazon to buy it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I use many of the Ole Henriksen products and love them all. This is a very light, smooth cream that goes on great. Makes my skin feel very nice.  It is not heavy or greasy at all. Has a very light aroma. Kind of expensive, but very much worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne proned skin and I am in my late 30&#x27;s.  This moisturizer is perfect for me.  It is not heavy nor is it greasy.  It provides the perfect amount of moisture for my skin.  I do feel like it has improved the texture and appearance of my skin.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, works well on my skin.  I use it with the youth activating serum.  You can see a difference after a week of using.  Skin feels nice and smooth..</li>
    <li> Really smooths/clears up your skin, and does it gently. Plus a little goes a long way, so the price tag&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> So light and moisturizing</li>
