    <li> small amount but good product</li>
    <li> Everything came okay, glad I bought it</li>
    <li> Sorry but is not as good as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> It not good quality and when I got it the 3 one all same colors, all the clean.</li>
    <li> I was disapointed in the quality of this product. The acrylic was very gummy and did not set well (ive been doing nails for 5/6 years) and i bought this just to have travel sizes and i dont like them at all, and they only come with very little powder. I would keep looking or pay a little more for a better product.</li>
    <li> Normally I would not complain for the price of this item.  Besides how long it took to get her because it ships from China. This was just so wrong that I felt I had to let anyone thinking about buying this to seriously reconsider.  This is not a matter of skill or experience that makes this so wrong!  It is a matter of what I ordered and what I got.  It clearly stated acrylic POWDER that I was purchasing.  Even if they would have sent me all one color (in acrylic POWDER) I would have be content with that considering the price.  But to ship a customer something they clearly were not even looking for?!?  POWDER/GEL, those are 2 very different things as far as I know(powder/gel different no matter what language or country!</li>
    <li> I like it it works good</li>
    <li> I got them earlier then expected.&lt;br /&gt;The sizes are perfect now I can fill my orders. Thanks again for your product.</li>
    <li> OMG. This the most amazing acrylic powder ever. I love them I got a ton of them. Attention all nail artists and nail techs this I a super great buy. If you want quality nails use these powder great things comes in small packages and these are them. To the vendors send me some test products to use at my salon you will be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Going to try them but it looks good</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking it was a good deal i was wrong. The acrylic was aweful it didnt smell like acrylic powder and when you put it on the nail it had a sticky consistency. Dont buy it your better off going to a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> No me gustan solo el grandparents serve Para haser  convinasiones de acrilico de color En LA mitad de LA una En el cuerpo se  levanta production pobre lo siento</li>
    <li> this good size container has very little powder i had very little left after i did my nails just once i will not be recommending this to anyone</li>
    <li> Just starting to do my own nails at home and these are small but enough to last a while soooo much cheaper to buy everything for about 40 dollars and do them at home then spend 20+ dollars each time.</li>
    <li> These all came quite early and were packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have worked well so far and the price is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im glad I purchased these and from this seller.</li>
    <li> The jars came super fast! I ordered these on 5/29 and got them on 6/12! They are also all full to the top. They came stacked on one another and wrapped in a plastic wrap type of thing. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I will be doing an update on the acrylics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so update on the product. While the containers where filled to the top, the actual space where the product sits is only about 1/2in deep. So while you think you are getting a good amount of product you&#x27;re not. The product itself takes forever to set and has a sticky consistency. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time or money. The pink acrylic has a pink tint to it but when you apply it with the monomer it comes out just like the clear does (not pink at all). I haven&#x27;t even tried the white yet but I&#x27;m sure its the same as the pink and clear. I gave it two stars because the product did get here super fast and it was shipped wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. The clear has tons of air bubbles and little white grains in it. The pink is very light and the white ok I guess. Will be using only for practice.</li>
