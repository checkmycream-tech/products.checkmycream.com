<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be 65 on Dec. 26 so I definitely have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin issues. While I&#x27;ve tried to take very good care of my skin time is catching up to me swiftly. But this serum does exactly what it portends. I&#x27;ve noticed a freshness to my facial skin since using it twice a day for the last two weeks. In my experience that&#x27;s a quick turn a round</li>
    <li> This serum is great, my wife uses it every day, and I started using it as well. It minimizes fine lines, and does an excellent job firming skin. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I am a 40 years old woman and I have been using this serum for about 2 weeks now. I haven&#x27;t seen to much of a difference on my skin (maybe too soon to see an effect or just not efficacious on my skin type). However, while the product description details concentrations of most relevant ingredients (eg. 20% Argireline, ....), these concentrations are not reported in the actual bottle/box.  I will keep using it and will change my rating if a more protracted use will give me better results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this isn&#x27;t more buzzed about because I love it! I had overdeveloped my eyebrow/forehead corrugular muscles from frowning too much, and they would constantly be contracted and were even giving me tension headaches. I was considering Botox, it was that bad. I looked angry and I couldn&#x27;t stop them from contracting. I read about argireline, found this product and tried it, and it really works! My forehead muscles are relax and I don&#x27;t get headaches anymore and look less angry. Definitely try it!</li>
    <li> I have combo oily skin and it&#x27;s perfect. Moisturizing without being greasy and it feels so good on the skin. I have noticed a difference in my expression lines. I always notice them in pictures and lately I have been pleased to see they have softened a bit.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Very helpful for smoothing my skin, so far! I have not ever used a product like this before, and am impressed!  Also, shipped very fast. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in my skin using this product twice a day as instructed.  Save your money and apply it towards the real Botox!</li>
    <li> no magical results, but better than nothing</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to run out of this stuff!  I put it on my whole face after I wash and use a Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pad.  It is a tad bit sticky when you initially put it on, so do it fast and give it a minute to absorb and the stickiness is entirely gone!  This product with the Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads have given me AMAZING results with fine lines and has gotten rid of 90% of my hyper pigmentation in less than a month.  I was giving up...  I have bought so many skin care products and have never used anything over-the-counter in drug stores - always the higher end stuff.  Nothing ever worked like this product in combo with the other.  I ordered more to make sure I don&#x27;t run out and I&#x27;m maybe half way through the bottle.  I use it under my make-up and at night.</li>
    <li> This serum contains all proven ingredients without diluted efficacy from a lot of useless additives. I use it twice daily after cleansing and before applying my day and night creams. I would definitely recommend a hydrating cream over this product. I saw fairly good results under the eyes and forehead and my pores are less noticable. I expect to see greater improvements with continued use. This serum is well priced when compared to other products containing comparable combined ingredients. One in particular that I&#x27;ve used in the past was $99.00 for 1 ounce. I believe this serum is as potent if not more so than those high-end products that many of us cannot afford.  I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend without hesitation. I ordered this because of the 3 main ingredients, Matrixyl, HA and Argireline. All of these products have been shown to be effective in helping wrinkle/skin hydration or the production of collagen. Just a little bit goes a long way, It&#x27;s truly as if your skin drinks this in, the product disappears into the skin easily.  It&#x27;s great using this serum under my face cream, my skin is so dewy after I apply this that I need less of my face cream. I plan on stocking up on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 49yrs old but people always say that I look 10yrs younger, light complexion, dry skin, loosing fullness in my cheeks...some hyper pigemtation and sun damage visible, always looking to add moisture to plump up the few wrinkles I have...and trying to postpone the dynamic wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Drugstore brands have very little active ingredients in them and cost about the same as this. I have used many product lines intermittently for years, along with Strivectin and Retin A. I have done at home glycolic peels as well. All of these products have helped me maintain a younger than my age appearance, thankfully! However, as I get older, I realize that my skin needs more than just mild  drugstore brands and yet I hate to pay triple the price for high end products. So I did my research online, YouTube and and by visiting beauty or skincare forums. My best research has been learning from dermatologists by reading their opinions on current anti-aging treatments and asking my own Dermatologists for advice.&lt;br /&gt;My research over these last few months has led to me look for products containing Peptides like Matrixyl, Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic Acid, Topical anti-oxidants C,, Vitamin E oil and an at home Microdermabrasion system.... ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy products when I find the ingredients I am looking for and when it comes from a lesser known company, versus a high end product. It doesn&#x27;t take tons of money to look good, just good habits, good  common sense and a little research.h end products.

    <li> Perfect ! Price was right .</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I ended up being allergic to this product.  It was my fault, I forgot to check to see if it contained the substance that gives me problems. I wrote the company and they took the product back, no questions asked, refunded my money AND the postage!  I would definitely shop these guys again.</li>
    <li> Ok this did nothing for my skin but make it break out. I used this product fir 60 days and nothing. I am now using another product from Amazon and it works great. Dont waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> Item was just as described, and so far is doing great. Will buy again when my first bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> Great serum , only been using a few week and lines are much less noticeable and skin is firmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months after I was tired of spending $50+ dollars on Lancôme serum.  It worked great at first. I noticed dark spots fading around my mouth and wrinkles seemed to become finer.  No major changes though.  Now the product has slowed in its ability to further remove my dark spots.  I will order it again though because I had the same results with the Lancôme serum.  I have now combined a cleanser with glycolic acid to get rid of those stubborn dark spots.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it is the latest addition to my regimen. Many of my co-workers have noticed that my skin has been looking radiant despite my lack of sleep. I have been using Protoxyn –x5 for about a month and can&#x27;t believe the change in my skin. I have recently been playing around with the different sciences and have added the Advanced Skin Care Vitamin C serum. I am 41 years old and have moderate signs of aging including wrinkles ranging from fine to expression lines around mouth and between eyes. I generally use Citrus facial wash, cold plasma and formula 15 every day and have recently added the Vitamin C serum and have noticed a glow that I thought only was available with illuminating make-up. The serum has added hydration and softened fine lines. I think the combination of the Vitamin C products and the DMAE collection has transformed my skin and I am so glad I have played between the 2 sciences. My skin is even and radiant, love this serum!</li>
    <li> This product was cheap, so I didn&#x27;t expect much. I think it is going a little far to say it is a botox alternative. LOL....</li>
    <li> Not fantastic not bad. There is no cure for wrinkles outside of surgery but this hyaluronic acid helps a bit.</li>
    <li> CANT TELL IF IT IS WORKING BECAUSE I USE ITWITH OTHER SERUMS LIKE FEEL OF IT ON MY SKIN</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all the positives are coming from, but I haven&#x27;t seen any results. :( Wrinkles are all the same size. No change in skin texture.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 starts as it wasn&#x27;t what i expected. Didn&#x27;t know you had to have a lotions  to use with it. I wouldn&#x27;t tell my friends as they too won&#x27;t be happy about using some thing eles with it. how ever it come in fast &amp; sealed good . couldn&#x27;t get it open without cuting it frist. That is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for everyone because all skins is different, however, I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days and I can tell a difference in my skin. I do use it twice a day and I don&#x27;t wear makeup but I wear moisrerizer. I will purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work well.  Of course Botox would be better but this works.  Will probably buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> I ordered several of these and I thought that this was the best hyaluronic acid out there until I opened up one bottle and was just water inside I was</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Will re order</li>
    <li> The only one for you to get to no and use often.</li>
    <li> good product free of any fragrances and seems to keep face hydrated all day and looking more supple.</li>
    <li> Noted facial improvement as advertised</li>
    <li> When I woke up to the fact of wrinkles around my face, like most of us, it was unhappy experience. This product has decreased the depth of my wrinkles. Am getting lots of compliments on my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this but returned it as it had a really horrible smell. I couldn&#x27;t get past it. I did receive a full refund so thanks for that.</li>
    <li> This is a bluff.You do not see. It also comes in a bottle that costs 50 cents. And Russian. I do not think it worth throwing your money. Besides smelly. God knows where they and containing this !. Put your money in safe brands !!</li>
    <li> Been using it. Can&#x27;t see how this product will do anything - It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> What? It did not work as stated.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I have been using the Botox Alternative for about a week and I must say I can actually see a difference in my skin. I have brought so many products that just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. This product makes my skin feel tighter and smoother and I can see the difference. I will definitely be ordering it again. Also the first bottle I received the cap on it was loose and part of the product had spilled out on the box. I called and they had another box out to me. I received it within two days. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my skin. Now, my skin is much more smoother. Also, it has made a big improvement to the wrinkles I have. The wrinkles now are not as noticeable as before and I look younger. It did take some time but the results were worth it.</li>
    <li> Not strong or concentrated enough.</li>
    <li> Not to my expectation.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!!!  IMMEDIATELY RESULTS!! I WAS SHOCKED!! WILL BUY AGAIN &amp; STAY STOCKED UP ON IT, I LOVE IT! MUST HAVE LADIES!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product at a discounted price!  I highly recommend buying it! It is nonirritating to the skin and very easy to apply. It helps with the wrinkles on your face plus your neck and shows a difference with the bags under your eyes! A bonus is there are no needles!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype...no botox, it goes on smooth, and lasted a long time...but not botox or anywhere near.</li>
    <li> Ok product. You need a good moisturizer to help see a difference</li>
    <li> love it! i have been using it for 3 weeks and my skin is soft and the lines are gone.  excellent product will buy again.</li>
    <li> Giving it time to work.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know how people could say they love this unless they were getting paid to say it. I use this twice a day with a moisturizer &amp; I don&#x27;t see any difference at all. It&#x27;s been approximately 1 month. One plus is that it applies smooth &amp; a little goes a long way, but that&#x27;s about it...maybe long-term you might see a difference, but nothing yet for me.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and within one week I noticed a big difference in my wrinkles!! My face has a glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in years!! I love this and will continue using it forever!!</li>
    <li> no difference after using this product till it was gone, another waste of money! wont recommend it to anyone..have wasted alot of money on products that shouldnt even be on the market..</li>
    <li> Hi there. I am a massage therapist who specializes in cosmetic massage, and I have multiple advanced degrees- a highly informed consumer by default. Most of the time I don&#x27;t bother with reviews, but I thought that this could potentially change peoples lives so I decided to go ahead and write this. While I&#x27;m 28 and have pretty damn wrinkle-less/fine line-less skin, I have struggled and even suffered with other skin issues through out my life. I have extremely..ridiculously..oily skin and used to have annoying acne. Not like cystic acne or anything, but the clogged-pore type acne. In fact, there have been times where every pore in my face was clogged. Because I suffered from this for so long, I have a few places on my skin with acne scars (as well as melasma scars- when I was pregnant I had insane/upraised Hyperpigmentation, resulting in very uneven skin texture). I am of Mediterranean decent, and I&#x27;m actually VERY beautiful; the rest of my facial skin that doesn&#x27;t have little acne marks is quite nice. Now, my acne marks are pretty small and superficial, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few VI peels in my life, so they don&#x27;t look very noticeable, but they bother me every day and I focus on it a lot. I always think, man, I&#x27;m pretty, but if I could just get these few little acne marks to go away damn it.   SO! I decided to try this stuff after doing COPIOUS and tireless research. Let me tell you what...after 24 hours, my skin looked noticeably smoother, the oiliness had decreased, and yet my skin was still well hydrated (hyaluronic acid can hold up to 1000x it&#x27;s weight in water), my pores shrunk considerably, and most impressive of all: the acne marks ALREADY looked like they were healing and shrinking!! I just wish I&#x27;d taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photo so you could see the difference. My mom asked me what the hell I had done to my skin- after only 24 hrs- because it really did look that much better.   After a week, my acne marks were about 60% reduced, not to mention that my skin had become drastically less oily and yet radiant. Any trace of fine lines I have on my face (granted..this isn&#x27;t much of an issue for me anyway) were GONE.   It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now since I began using this stuff. The bottle claims that it takes about 4-6 weeks to have significant improvement, but MY GOD...I&#x27;ve had people ask my what I&#x27;ve done...my mom said it looks like I got laser treatments or some sort of drastic procedure!!   *honestly guys...I&#x27;ve paid thousands of dollars in my life for peels, products, and various skin care procedures. I&#x27;ve used la mer, la prairie, Sisley Paris, and some of the most high end/expensive things on this earth...and NOTHING comes close. This stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in platinum, and then some. While this stuff can be used alone, and results have occurred with this stuff alone, I use it with Isomers products for an extra boost.   I highly recommend Isomers products in conjunction with this. I am part of the Isomers sales team. PLEASE, please please, if you have questions about what you can do for your skin, and you want information about how to heal your specific skin type, I want you to email me. I want everyone in the world to have the satisfaction and success I&#x27;ve had with this product and with isomers line, and a few other things I could recommend. I even have a copy right for an 8-step manual massage that you can do to reduce scars/stretch marks!!       Please email me at: cassandradoll23@gmail.com   for information, support, vitamin/internal supplement recommendations, and any questions about skin care!! Wishing you the best of luck! BUY THIS PRODUCT you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> skin seems more even now since I started to us it. At age 73, anything that helps even a little is much appricated. LOL</li>
    <li> It is the best product I have used for wrinkles.  It doesn&#x27;t totally take the place of botox but is pretty close. .definitely prolongs the need for a tweek.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  My skin looks smoother and also the bags under my eyes which are hereditary (unfortunately)&lt;br /&gt;well they seem less pronounced than usual.I think I really Like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Yes,I Will buy more,...  :)</li>
    <li> I could see no good results or even an wisp of a change using this product.  Complete waste of money.  I guess all the 5 star reviews we see on web pages are written by the companies themselves because I have been fooled sooo many times!</li>
    <li> My face is littlle hard ,when I used but is good product and soft! I used ,because the serum is a good product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle, I wish I could buy in large bottle, this is a must have for everyone. My deep forehead wrinkle disappears before my eyes as soon as I put it on. Luv!!</li>
    <li> Have used product every night for a month with no results..proves &#x27;topical&#x27; creams/gels don&#x27;t work which really should come as no surprise.</li>
    <li> It works as I  spect  is a good product and isn&#x27;t expensive I recommend you to try you will like it too.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for a few months and I noticed a change in her skin so I decided to get some for myself. This is great for men as well because it does not smell like a women&#x27;s facial cream and the packaging definitely not feminine so I felt comfortable buying this. This is a clear serum and absorbs into the skin very quickly. This works good to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and also improves the texture of your skin . My wife likes my soft smooth less wrinkled face.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I am a young but start to appear a little wrinkles that I want prevent using this product that doesn&#x27;t work because my skin is the same or worst.</li>
    <li> I hoped for the best after seeing these other reviews, but this got my hopes up for nothing ... and I just wasted my money.  This did NOTHING for my wrinkles ... NOTHING.  And I tried it steadily for several weeks.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Might as well use K-Y.  Cheaper.  It won&#x27;t do anything for your wrinkles but neither does this.</li>
    <li> At first, i have to ADMIT,&lt;br /&gt;i was NOT impressed with it...&lt;br /&gt;So i kept using this for a month..&lt;br /&gt;Im happy with this..&lt;br /&gt;I use this first, then i Add my Night creme,&lt;br /&gt;This is not greasy at all,&lt;br /&gt;It really Absorbs  Really good..&lt;br /&gt;You really Need to give this stuff a whole month, before Judging it to fast..&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face Tingle With cheer !!  haa&lt;br /&gt;I dunno,&lt;br /&gt;At first i was Going to Throw it in the Garbage  LOL&lt;br /&gt;then i thought, I better Use it longer..&lt;br /&gt;I really think it Works better with a Creme to,&lt;br /&gt;Even if its Ponds,&lt;br /&gt;I wear make up every day &amp; i use Noxema to take it off,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; then i add this Stuff &amp; i let it  Dry a min  then i add my Cremes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes Ill use Ponds,&lt;br /&gt;Ponds seems to me, it works with it as a team....&lt;br /&gt; So,&lt;br /&gt;Thats my True Feelings !!!&lt;br /&gt;HEY ALL,&lt;br /&gt;IM ON MY THIRD BOTTLE  &amp; LOVE IT !!&lt;br /&gt;I DO USE  CREME OVER  IT,&lt;br /&gt;ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES JUST THIS !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Seems  to help minimize wrinkles on forehead I ordered it again. It helped.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! now my skin looks young !!</li>
    <li> I would not spend my money any farther with this useless product and I should have known better:&lt;br /&gt;When an advertisement for wrinkle-smoother is presented with a teenager girl - It says it all:&lt;br /&gt;Just an advertisement trick to catch the eye nothing more.</li>
    <li> I have been using now for approximately 3 weeks, not sure I notice anything. Maybe I need to give it more time but I feel my skin looks the same. I do get compliments on my skin even before purchasing this but I&#x27;m not perfect by any means I just feel I&#x27;m not noticing anything with using the product let&#x27;s face it we all want to look better......</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thinking that it would help erase my fine lines only to be disappointed.  The ingredients were what I was looking for, however it did not perform what I expected over a months time.</li>
    <li> honestly this is great just dont use it under your makeup.  its made a huge difference in my fine lines i feel not as self concious anymore! Thank god that was horrible and embarrassing because im only 23</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been a great addition to my facial regimen - I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have very little wrickles (thank goodness) and it&#x27;s due part to these products</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month, very religiously, and it did nothing for my lines.  Not even a little bit.  It was quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> Been using for 3 weeks under a Olay firming cream and very happy with it.  Was planning on getting Botox injections but think I will hold off for now.</li>
    <li> this product is o.k., but you will get better results with retin a or a retinoid. will not order again.</li>
    <li> WORTH EVERY EVERY PENNY! Gosh cant believe how effective this product is! I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and only a few have clearly seen-able results and lived up to their fancy descriptions. THIS IS A WONDER! I constantly work late facing computer so I suffered from dullness and enlarged pores. I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks now, my skin feels soooo much smoother, and healthier. More amazingly I saw my biggest pore shrunk to half the size!!! Not just the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; of pore but they actually shrunk! No other products were able give me these results.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this product again. I&#x27;m using it for over 3 weeks. Not even 1% changed in my face.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a replacement for botox, however I think it does a great job.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my forehead doesn&#x27;t move as much as it did before (I&#x27;m not very expressive to begin with) and the fine lines have faded quite a bit.  Of course, if you have deep creases in your forehead or heavy crows feet, you&#x27;ll need botox.  If you need botox... then you need botox.  There&#x27;s no such thing as a magic potion, and no serum or cream will give you 18 year old skin again.  I think some people&#x27;s expectations are entirely unreasonable.  For me this stuff really is great, and I&#x27;ll keep using it until the day I need injectables.</li>
    <li> I just like this stuff for some reason. It just seems to help control the llines but I have also been using it for over a year now. I guess maybe its habit to use now. But I feel like it works for me</li>
    <li> Works very good .I used it in combination with vitamin A cream my deep wrinkles are much softer and my face is lifted .I will definitely buy it again it works like no other products.</li>
    <li> The product seems to have made some slight improvement in my skin, but it is a VERY slow process. Not sure if I will purchase more. The Evening Primrose Oil seems to be more effective. I use it on my lips and see a noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  I have been using it religiously twice a day for a month.  No changes in my skin, no reduction in wrinkles at all.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing really. I followed the instructions and did notice any improvement. I then bought Kiehl&#x27;s Powerful Strength Line Reducing Concentrate 1.7 and got incredibly satisfied. Some wrinkles on my forehead disappeared after a week, Everybody notices a substantial improvement on my skin texture. It really rejuvenates you.</li>
    <li> Comes out of pump a lot at a time and is pretty runny. Absorbs well and is not sticky after.  Works well as a base serum under moisturizer and makeup. No fragrance which is kind of a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several months. I have had a lot of compliments lately that I look young.  One from my permanent makeup artist who sees me real up close and one from a cosmetician friend who hadn&#x27;t seen me in a year.  When I first started using it I watched in the mirror right after I applied as it plumped an lined area around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it evenings and a couple of drops goes does the trick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to moisturize immediately after so the skin hold the moisture.  I use a simple light coconut oil, avocado oil blend, lightly after using, now. When I first started using this product I use Olay and it worked too, but find the coconut/avocado oil is enough.  Love it getting ready to purchase again.</li>
    <li> There was no noticeable difference in my skin at all. I would not recommend this item! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Didn:t see any visible change after using for 2 week. Sent back.</li>
    <li> Use every day and night,great product 5+</li>
    <li> I really like this product. No, it&#x27;s not an injection. I agree the marketing is a bit confusing. You will NOT get the results of an injected product with a topical product. So you have to have realistic expectations. That said, Argireline can reduce motion and softens wrinkles. (Reduce, not completely freeze or eliminate.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve reordered this product and don&#x27;t want to be without it! I bought it because of the 20% Argireline. I can&#x27;t afford Botox and would rather skip the injections. It may take a while to \\&quot;build up\\&quot;. I think I noticed results after a couple weeks. I use the product only on my forehead and I layer applications. This product is a bit thick and feels sticky at first, but it soaks in quickly and very cleanly. So I put one layer on my freshly washed face and let it dry. I add another thin layer and let it dry. Sometimes I&#x27;ll add a third layer just focusing on the forehead \\&quot;11s\\&quot;. Then I can put moisturizer over. This is all for a.m. application, and keep in mind that I have very strong \\&quot;frown muscles\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t completely freeze my forehead, but it definitely softens the \\&quot;frownies\\&quot;!!! I honestly notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I do multiple applications, I do only focus on my forehead, so one bottle still lasts a couple months. I use Porcelain Skin&#x27;s Skin Firming Activating with DMAE, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid [[ASIN:B00A7LPEMG B00A7LPEMG]] on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these products, as well as alternating Tretinoin cream and a glyocolic cream at night, my skin is looking good!</li>
    <li> About my opinion this product works better than those expensive creams that promise miracles, I think I wasted my money on these expensive creams and never see a good result. I have a month using botoxxin and you can really see the difference as I got, smooth, toned and gives life to your face, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> From what I had read about this product I was looking for noticeable results in no time. Been using it now for about 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin tone, texture, or tautness or wrinkle size. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your hard-earned cash.</li>
    <li> I had juevederm injections about a year ago. I use this on the injection site and its as though I just had it done!</li>
    <li> Must have to help keep skin ageless.</li>
    <li> This product is a farce.  I used it methodically as instructed and it did NOTHING for my skin, absolutely no change whatsoever. Complete waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really leaves your skin feeling really smooth, but if you are sensitive to smells beware as it does smell a little funny upon application. I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I honestly wanted to use this product for a couple of weeks before I rated. However, after two uses (last night and this morning), I cannot believe the change in my trouble spots. I have recently lost a good bit of weight and have some more to go so I&#x27;ve really been concerned with finding a product that will keep up with my weight loss rather than letting my face slide off somewhere around my belly button. Wrinkles/cross-hatch pattern developing at the top of my cheeks: gone. Lines next to eyes: gone. It is reasonably priced  and the only thing I can say in the negative is you get a lot of product with just one pump - almost too much. One pump will cover face &amp; neck easy so a bottle should last quite some time.</li>
    <li> I have bought this a week ago and already see and feel a difference. Will be buying more! Thank you so much!! :)</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve never used Botox as the whole concept terrifies me but I don&#x27;t love my wrinkles either.  I thought this stuff might actually work and I have to say that for me it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s nice, and maybe the effects are cumulative but for right now I haven&#x27;t seen that huge a difference... sad to say</li>
    <li> Product is pure, effective, and is amazing.  I bought it thinking I would try it and probably return it...thinking it can&#x27;t be THAT good!&lt;br /&gt;Well, in my experience, it is over the top.  Amazing price.  Highly recommend for nagging tiny lines around the eyes and mouth, or even better, the entire face.  Just takes a couple of drops since it is a serum and apply to a clean face.  I have already bought more to share with friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be damned - it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wrinkles are not bad , I chose my ancestors well, but this certainly made them better.  I did not give it a 5 because I just don&#x27;t know how it is with deep wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I just love this serum as it soaks right into your skin and does not feel sticky whatsoever. My skin feel soft and smooth. Great product! Thank-you very much!</li>
    <li> This serum contains all the ingredients that are found in the most expensive anti aging creams at an unheard of low cost! I use it morning and evening under my daily moisturizer and nothing else is necessary. I just turned 50 and I have yet to meet anyone who thinks I am over 40, I give credit to this amazing serum. The 1oz bottle will last two months if used properly, less is best. Try it and you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very good for turkey neck;  I wish the bottle were larger.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the product, I hope they have moisturizer and will be reordering very soon.. THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> I received two bottles.But one was open already.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time this happens.I didn&#x27;t like it because give you the idea was already used.</li>
    <li> It really helps hold in moisture and helps your moisturizer stay on better too. I will reorder this product. Only takes a little product.</li>
    <li> Really like this serum, and it mixes well with my oils.</li>
    <li> No improvement whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I am not convinced this is a great product.  I believe you&#x27;d be better served by going with cell science products.</li>
    <li> You do not need much, dab will do it, goes on wet and drys fast. perfect formula, I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit overrated.  I could not find any improvement even with a second order.  It seems to be absorbed well enough but I don&#x27;t think the marketing (looking like a syringe) is anything other than pure hype.  (Pun intended!)  I probably would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> unhappily this product didnt do nothing in my skin ... absolutly nothing !! I used correctly like instructions but didnt see none result ... im very very upset for that and  would like refusing my money back ...</li>
    <li> There are other things for your skin that have much more research behind them, plus the clear packaging is unstable anyway. And nothing- NOTHING- is a botox alternative. Think about it- you wouldn&#x27;t be able to move your hands if it REALLY worked like botox.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s about it.  It&#x27;s okay.  It says there&#x27;s 15% Matrixyl 3000, but the ingredient is listed so far down the list on the label I had to wonder about that being a fact. 15% is required to get results.  I&#x27;m not seeing any results so I can&#x27;t see this product as any better than any other product out there.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this stuff!  i&#x27;m on my second bottle and i&#x27;m so glad i&#x27;m using this instead of Nerum!  get it use it and decide for yourself!  i&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  You can almost feel it working to reduce pores and to tighten fine lines.  I have had no problems with sensitivity to the product but for the first week of use, it did sting a little bit when first applied.  That has now settled.  I use it in conjunction with my day and night time moisturizers.  I notice that my &amp;#34;frown&amp;#34; lines on my forehead are not as visible.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it works. I do not see any difference.</li>
    <li> Nonirritating but seems to make the skin look tighter and brighter</li>
    <li> Since this is a gel, I apply it over my serums, and under moisturizer, but it just pills up making day makeup application impossible. The SkinScience line had much better serum</li>
    <li> never saw any difference at all  even my family members were watching to see if it worked and they didnt see a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dejuan neilson&lt;br /&gt;280 wheeler rd&lt;br /&gt;gray, ga 31032</li>
    <li> I have been using this since December. I have not noticed any changes at all. but i do like the fact that this product did not irritate my skin. I have very sensative skin and this product actually helps to moisturize it. I just wish it really worked for me.</li>
    <li> I was offered a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. I only have fine lines. I have been using a moisturizing cream for a long time that I like, so I substituted Protoxyn X5 for about a month. I used it all over my face and neck as well as around my eyes, and was impressed at how quickly and completely it is was absorbed by the skin without leaving my skin oily.. No scent, either, which is good for any guys wanting to try it. My skin feels very toned and looks great! My fine lines are less noticeable and my skin looks much better over all. Younger people might need less, so the you can easily control the amount being used. I&#x27;m very impressed with the product and will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> My very first time writing a review.... It&#x27;s a must with this product... I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years... That all ended up in my drawer grave! I&#x27;ve been using this product solid for a week...I&#x27;ve already have seen great results....I&#x27;m 46 just starting to see the sagging and mild wrinkles. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and price. please try it!!!</li>
    <li> is my first bottle that line we got we didn&#x27;t get them overnight therefore you are not going to get results overnightI love the fresh feeling and how is tight my skin on my forehead and under my eyes and on my laughing lines don&#x27;t get discouraged is not that expensive keep on using it at least 6 month religiously to one year I don&#x27;t even wear that much makeup anymore that&#x27;s how good it has done to my skin</li>
    <li> This product has a softening effect but works basically on very fine lines.  Still it goes on smoothly and is absorbed quite nicely without greasy residue.  I have seen results and will continue to purchase this product.  It arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> It arrived very fast and of course I had to try it right away.  Now I know that results wont be overnight, however, my skin feels really soft now.  I have applied it per the directions, twice a day, and have not noticed any tingling or burning.  It goes on very velvety and smooth.  I hope to have better results soon, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have used the entire bottle and noticed no difference.  Waist of MONEY and time on my part.  Do not purchase</li>
    <li> Application smooth but don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Protoxyn Anti-Aging Serum approximately 10 days ago and have used it every day morning and in the evening. I first heard about the benefits of argireline from a plastic surgeon that was a guest on the Dr. Oz Show. He recommended using a serum with at least a 10% argireline content. This plastic surgeon said the results would be similar to Botox. I was skeptical. After using it approximately 10 days, I really do see a difference. This serum also contains Vitamin C which is very beneficial to your skin and Matrixyl 3000 which promotes collagen growth. Make no mistake about it, it&#x27;s not surgery or botox, however, my lines are much less noticeable and what I noticed most is my eye area and forehead. I do get botox treatments but I feel with this product I can stretch my treatments further apart which will save me money. I do use and have tried a lot of products. However, it wasn&#x27;t until this argireline that I really could see a vast difference. If you try this product, you need to be diligent about using it every day. Use a good moisturizer after a few minutes. I use Lamer cream with this serum. You will start noticing a difference in a few weeks. I&#x27;m in my late forty&#x27;s  and frantically trying to stop the aging process. Anyway, it works for me and if you are up there in age,  it is worth a try. I&#x27;ve used several expensive products and this worked much better. I really like this product and I will continue to order this.</li>
    <li> Used in conjunction with Serumtologie C and VoilaVe as general skin maintence. My skin feels and looks better.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local spa and paid $34.00 for the 1.oz bottle. I have been using this for about 4 months now. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here for less than half of the retail price. There isn&#x27;t much I haven&#x27;t tried when it comes to skin care. This product is something I will continue to use. It tightens and gives your skin an overall healthy glow not in two weeks or six but that day. I do believe the longer you use this the more difference you see. I&#x27;m 53 and have some fine lines and a few wrinkles but not deep and they are definitely less noticeable. You&#x27;ll want to wear a good moisturizer over it b4 you apply your foundation or cream blusher because it&#x27;s not enough moisture to allow makeup to be applied smoothly. But it absolutely improves the overall look and feel of your skin. An added plus is the price point on this is reasonable. Any woman who has purchased skin care products knows in the world of skin care reasonable means you can use it and still buy groceries.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all...Just felt like gel drying on my face.  Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck with it than I did but I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It has ore than just hyaluronic acid in it so it&#x27;s very good. Great price.</li>
    <li> It absorbs really well.  I just haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> This works well with Their vitamin C serum 20% I am getting amazing results using the two together. I Highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> Over priced and I do not see any difference in my skin after 1 month of use. If you use it for more than three days in a row it starts to make your skin red and feel like it&#x27;s sunburnt. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Good product. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make full decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on writing reviews but I have to say this product is remarkable!  I&#x27;m only on day 3 and can see marked improvement in my skin overall.... wrinkles are smoothing out and my skin seems plumped up, like it&#x27;s retaining more moisture., I also notice a softer, more dewy appearance.  I&#x27;ve spent TOO much $ on different skin creams &amp; serums, but, like I said in my title, my face was starving for whatever&#x27;s in this serum!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens as I continue to use it!</li>
    <li> If there is a difference, I do not see it. It feels smooth, clear going on, non-greasy. Maybe it requires longer treatment?</li>
    <li> this product dose work for a wile only hours it like a Starch on your Wrinkles and fads as day go on.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that actually gives you the results that it promises then this product is for you.  I have found that if you apply it to moist skin it works even better. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> So this did arrive leaking and I was disappointed but they right away mailed me a new product. The serum feels like the expensive name brand ones ive had in the past. I&#x27;ll keep you posted in how it feels</li>
    <li> I love this product.  After two weeks of use (twice a day) I saw a noticeable difference. I ordered two more bottles and gave one to a friend that has been searching for a good product.  I noticed the biggest difference around my eyes and the overall texture of my face.  Still looking for a miracle for the lines around my mouth.  This product made the lines appear softer, but this is a problem area.  I use a good moisturizer or coconut oil on top of this serum.  I would recommend this product....in fact I have.  I don&#x27;t recommend products too often, but I didn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this one.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only three weeks into this product.  I&#x27;m not noticing wrinkle reduction, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin tone is evening out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using serums with these ingredients for sometime now, I can tell you this serum with the percentages of each ingredient is exactly perfect. You should try this serum to see if it works for you too. Really! Its excellent.</li>
    <li> BECAUSE THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY SKIN AS MANY DO. IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY AND MAKES MY SKIN LOOK GREAT.</li>
    <li> I see some improvement in my expression lines. Have only been using product for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is like my third order with this company.  This product is a great price and I does a great job on 50+ face. And trust me I&#x27;ve bought all the expensive stuff!  Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> Should not have purchased this product, just didn&#x27;t appear to be hygienically clean :::top was NOT sealed,  looked like it was  &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; label placed on a brown bottle as opposed to Face Whisperer Argireline &amp; Matrixyl.  Smell was not pleasant and after awhile color of inside product began to change and smell got worst...  could have been urine as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Was hesitant to USE it after a few times. But since it was inexpensive, just &#x27;chalk&#x27; it up to lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Maybe you need to refrigerate it or something. I don&#x27;t know.  I was happy to throw it away when it started reeking anyway. At the most it was a half decent primer to put under my serum and moisturizer to help it absorb more easily, but other than that I didn&#x27;t notice anything different about my skin. Because of the smell, I was only able to use it for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of vitamin C + Hyaluronic serum. I use this serum twice a day almost daily. I wait for couple minutes and then apply regular moisturizer on top of it. I noticed that Hyaluronic serums do help in reducing the uneven skin tone and will also take care of fine lines in future. This serum does not have any smell and is very light. It leaves the skin hydrated and toned. My face look good overall. I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
    <li> love this stuff it does seem to make a difference in my old face</li>
    <li> I purchased this product within days of buying a Vitamin C product on another site.  Yeah.  I&#x27;m just that desperate...or vain.  Whatever.  Both products were similarly priced and arrived at almost the same time.  I decided to try a little personal experiment.  I have been using this product on the left side of my face and the Vit C product on the right.  It has been just over 2 weeks.  I am absolutely amazed at the difference between the 2 products.  I bought these because I was running low on a Skin Medica hyaluronic product, so it&#x27;s not like I had not made any effort before my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother and definitely tighter.  My husband has been wondering why I keep asking if he sees a difference on either side of my face.  He always chooses the left side as smoother and softer.  There is a definite benefit to this product!  I&#x27;m going to switch it up at the end of the week just to see if I can confirm the outcome.  The seller needs to place this item on subscribe and save.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this because a tinyt bit covers my whole face and it is very wet &amp; moisturizing.  Just started product so will have to get back to you about the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this serum a small amount goes a long way and I have noticed a difference in a very short time of using the product. Will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I havn&#x27;t had any issues.  It arrived on time and has not irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;so I am pleased with my purchase.  :)</li>
    <li> cant get enough of this product it makes my skin glow I hope to try more products by this company great price too not too expensive thx agnes v.</li>
    <li> Smells TERRIBLE  - I mean like urine or something nasty - and seems to do nothing.</li>
    <li> This serum really works it doesn&#x27;t good job I can&#x27;t believe what a great price! i would get it again and again I hope they never stop selling this</li>
</ol>
