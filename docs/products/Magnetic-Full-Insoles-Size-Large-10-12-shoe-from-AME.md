<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for 10 years. It&#x27;s held up well except one of the middle large magnets fell out last year. It&#x27;s totally demagnetized now. This product is very good for the small amount of money you&#x27;re spending for it. It&#x27;s worth the money. But understand this fact:  this products&#x27; primary benefit is an acupressure massage which benefits the body in that way. And like some reviewers say here it hurts - they are right because the metal is very hard, has small points on it, and it has no cushioning. (if you wear thick socks to cushion your feet, you will defeat the purpose for wearing this product to begin with) No pain - no gain! LOL  By the way, you get used to it after a while. Remember it is beneficial in the way acupressure works. But it is limited because it only covers a small amount of acupressure points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as to using it for magnetic therapy - forget it. The low 800 Gauss rating and small amount of magnets that are in there are nearly worthless for that purpose. If you want magnetic therapy for the foot, as in arthritis, sore joints, plantar fascia, flat feet, exhausted feet, fungal infections on the toes, then search for something with at least 4,000 to 12,000 Gauss and with at least 20-40 magnets in the insole.  If the problem is isolated to one small area, you can use what&#x27;s called spot magnets, which can be less costly but just as powerful or better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NEO magnets have the most power and are used for severe problems. They are usually at least 12,000 Gauss power. The ceramic magnets are next and good ones usually have at least 4,000 Gauss. Not all magnets are created equal, just like cars. Shop and compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other insoles, usually rubberized, foam, or etc, which are made completely as one piece and no real solid metal parts except fragments put inside, should have at least 2,000 Gauss if they are decent. But again, expect to pay more for these products, anywhere from $30 to $125 dollars. You can find some of these on this Amazon website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re problem is mild, or you just want to use it for prevention, or as a gift, or wear it in slippers when you come home at night to take out some of the fatigue in your feet and body, then this less expensive product will suffice, save you money and its fairly sturdy construction lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, as to cutting them to size - you can cut the front and back slightly to reduce the size, but you cannot cut the sides without really mutilating it.

It does fit. They are not foam that is easy to cut (which also will not last as long)  Order the correct size from the beginning or if not sure, slightly smaller so they will fit in your shoes or slippers without cutting.

    <li> Look what the oil companies have started. Everywhere you look, SOB&#x27;s are doubling the price of things we need, like, and want. I quit smoking because Obama is in bed with the tobacco companies and have tripled the price of my brand from $3.49 a pouch to $12.89. Who is that helping. I quit smoking but I am sure they will triple the price of gum next to pinch me again. They are about screwing the working man. Anyway, my bad and soar feet love these inserts. They work excellent and have brought a remedy to my years of pain. Please do not up your price because they work.</li>
    <li> I have post chemo peripheral neuropathy with constant burning foot pain. For what ever reason when I ware insoles with the nubs in them or in this case, the magnetics, my feet hurt less throughout the day.</li>
    <li> These insoles could be filled with dancing ponies and I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.  They are very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Its a massage at first because it stimulates your foot in was way not routine which one can say is a massage but you&#x27;ll come to find out its more pain than anything else. You may enjoy if you dont use often?</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husbands neuropathy... they weren&#x27;t anything special. He didn&#x27;t seem to get relief from them. I wore them and at least like the message they give.</li>
    <li> Did not help the pain and neuropathy Issues in my feet</li>
    <li> I had troubles with my aching legs and tried these.&lt;br /&gt;They sure helped to reduce the pain near zero level&lt;br /&gt;and I am warmly recommending these.</li>
    <li> I actually bought these for my father who is having some foot pain/issues do to arthritis in his right big toe.  He can&#x27;t get injections and can&#x27;t get any real long lasting relief.  So, hopefully these will help him out a little.  If you bought these from a health store, you would look at 2-3x&#x27;s the price.</li>
    <li> Workes good in my husbands shoes.  Dont know what the magnetic does, but it sure helps with the pain. Dont go without it</li>
    <li> I love the insoles and have worn them in my shoes for many years now. They do help with circulation or so it seems</li>
    <li> Made no difference to me than wearing nothing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really use them. the magnet sections are too raised. They make my feet hurt. The magnets are weak too. Not a product for me.</li>
    <li> Poor, tired feet for my hubby.  The insoles are very good at stimulating circulation.  He says there is a difference and since I have always benefited from magnet theraphy, I say good product.</li>
    <li> I have plantar fasciitis this helps!&lt;br /&gt;my feet feel 90% better,&lt;br /&gt;recommended by a friend and he was right,&lt;br /&gt;it helps</li>
    <li> They make a great deal of difference on my feet comfort when I am walking with them in my shoe. I need a pair for inside my sock type. I may just try that today. I&#x27;ll call it insole in my sock. Has a ring to it, if I do say so.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my father.  He has noticed a difference and says his feet don&#x27;t feel numb by the end of the day like they did before the insoles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with Vestibular Vision Mismatch, and these inne soles help me keep my balance. VVM is a rare form of Vertigo</li>
    <li> Excellent good quality product..</li>
    <li> the  product  was  totally  unusable.  extreemly  uncomfortable  and  pretty  much  junk.  the  insoles  were  so  uncomfortable that  it  was  imposible  to  use  them</li>
    <li> these are great for the price some more expensive and dont work as well i would recomend for any foot problems</li>
