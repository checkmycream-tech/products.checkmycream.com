      <li>It only takes a couple seconds to apply and looks very natural and pretty.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but it did come lighter than I was expecting and lighter than I usually get.</li>
      <li>It lights up my whole face and makes me look much younger.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and really does brighten the eye area.</li>
      <li>Applied in big triangles under the eyes really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I have no serious complaints about this and no real accolades either.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d also recommend Trish McEvoy Eye Base Essentials to pair beautifully with this product.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that it is a small product size for the price, wish there was more!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great look and so moisturizing it hides fine lines and brightens appearance. Expensive but goes a long way. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> As advertized, great product!</li>
    <li> Trish Mc line is exquisite. This does a lovely job.</li>
    <li> Love it! Get compliments constantly!</li>
    <li> This is pricey but it does work great. It&#x27;s simple to use and really does brighten the eye area. The only negative I can think if is that the amount of product is small. You may go through it faster than you expect.</li>
    <li> This eye lift product truly brings the dead to life!!!  I never ever want to be without it- I watched the transformation on HSN- took a chance on it- and it is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> Cakes under the eyes and dries out the skin - this product does not lift anything - and is not a very good concealer - still looking for the ideal one!</li>
    <li> Applied in big triangles under the eyes really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This is another Trish fav for me. I have dark spots under my eyes due to my allergies. Concealer has never worked for me - I can still see the circles. But with this, it actually does fade. My eyes look brighter, the dark spots are less noticeable, and it feels great. The key is to use it sparingly. It&#x27;s very creamy and spreads well, so you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this with the fine line refiner and you&#x27;re set!</li>
    <li> This product produces an wonderful effect by illusion, lifting the eye area.  The ingredients are , however, toxic.  Proplylene glycol is very toxic.  It is anti-freeze.  I only use it for special occasions because of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this eye brightener as it blends well and doesn&#x27;t leave crease lines.  So nice I don&#x27;t have to make it to a Nordstroms or Neiman&#x27;s in person to buy it, too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Goes on smoothly and covers beautifully. Only complaint is that it is a small product size for the price, wish there was more!</li>
    <li> I love this, have ordered it several times. It feels light and gives just enough coverage. I</li>
    <li> VERY DRY,DOES NOT COVER WELL, AND VERY SMALL</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works well. It doesn&#x27;t wear off during the day and really does brighten the under-eye area. My only issue is that it&#x27;s only available in one shade. I have very fair skin and this product is a bit too dark/orange for me. Would be nice if it came in additional hues.</li>
    <li> I have no serious complaints about this and no real accolades either.  It&#x27;s fine but that&#x27;s all.  Does not sit in fine lines or dry out - that&#x27;s good.  Dark circle coverage - just eeh.  The cost and the quantity - not so good.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it did come lighter than I was expecting and lighter than I usually get. I&#x27;m sure that was my mistake ordering. I love using this product on my eye lids instead of eye shadow. It only takes a couple seconds to apply and looks very natural and pretty.</li>
    <li> Conceals dark circles and fine lines! Very good product! It doesn&#x27;t leave eyes looking dry and cracked like some concealers!</li>
    <li> I watched Trish&#x27;s videos on HSN.com, and was blown away by this product. It lights up my whole face and makes me look much younger. Dark circles...gone. Tired looking eyes....gone. Pricy, but worth it. I&#x27;d also recommend Trish McEvoy Eye Base Essentials to pair beautifully with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, with a very noticeable improvement in my appearance.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It is expensive and the product container wastes maybe 1/8 of the product</li>
    <li> Perfect shade and perfect coverage</li>
