    <li> This is my favorite lotion and it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores. I love the scent. It really does make me happy. And of course it&#x27;s good lotion, it&#x27;s Nivea.</li>
    <li> The lotion I purchased from amazon is runny and lacks the citrus aroma that I love.  My legs feel drier after using this lotion.  I swear there is something wrong with this bottle of lotion.  Thus I thew it in the trash.  I&#x27;ll never purchase products of this nature from amazon again.</li>
    <li> Light weight lotion for daily use.  Smells amazing, like an orange creamsicle actually.  I was able to catch the scent later on hours after I put the lotion on. It&#x27;s not super strong by any means, but it&#x27;s a nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a nice all-over body lotion. It isn&#x27;t thick or greasy and has a pleasant, but not overpowering scent.  I am sensitive to perfume smells and have never had a problem with it.  Has a light orange scent to it, but not enough that  you feel like you have bathed in an orange smoothie.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Happy products from Nivea. The scent is light &amp; mixes well with other lotions. I even use on my face rather than spending more money on day &amp; night face lotions.</li>
    <li> Smells nasty, and doesn&#x27;t moisturize well at all. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Light weight, not too greasy and smells great. Sometimes it lasts you for a whole day. It absorbs fast into your skin.</li>
    <li> From the reviews, I thought this would be a nice lighter moisturizer for summer.  It may be but the thing I hate is that it leaves a sticky feeling on my skin.  Not exactly what you want, especially for summer.  Not sure what I will do with it, but I certainly won&#x27;t be using it as a daily lotion.</li>
    <li> Nivea happy sensation is a great lotion. I love the smell, it is a light lotion, perfect for the summer, feels good and dry fast.</li>
    <li> Cool, smooth and long lasting. Perfect for dry skin.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a great price.  My  friend loves it. This is the second time I have ordered this product.  It is not available in stores in my area.</li>
    <li> This is a regular purchase to stock up!! It&#x27;s very soft and soothing</li>
    <li> Smells so good,  feels so good on my skin.  And I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the brick and mortar stores...</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion! Never greasy always soaks in skin and has clean scent...</li>
    <li> Love the scent. I have extremely dry skin, and generally require a lotion that is tailored to extremely dry skin. However I marinate in this lotion constantly. I keep it in my office, in my living room, and by my bed. I love the smell so much I always want to use it. This meets my extremely dry skin needs. It might be because i am constantly applying it, if this only had SPF in it, I would never have to use another lotion.</li>
    <li> I think this must be the best body cream. It everything I want in a body cream, smells great leaves your skin feeling ever so great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Arrived on time shipping was no problem.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this lotion. Wish it was a little thicker but at least it absorbs well!</li>
    <li> The smell is okay, it really does not smell like oranges but the lotion is of good quality and I am still using it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion!  And found it cheaper on Amazon than any local store.  It smells great and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product. Terrible packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a BIG bottle for a small price!! I was so happy to see that they made a lotion to match the shower soap that I love so much. I think there must be something in a name because it does seem to make me happier!!!! Hahaha. Mayb it&#x27;s the beautiful orange scent?</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; in the name is pretty accurate.  I know that sounds goofy, but this lotion has a light and pleasant scent that I really enjoy.  It is also an effective lotion, relieving my dry skin and helping it to feel soft and comfortable all day long.  I have bought this product several times.</li>
    <li> My wife will only use this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> Guess I&#x27;m alone in my thinking but I despise the scent, I am not picky but it is gross, it is way too sweet and just weird. It&#x27;s like the burts bees baby wash but worse smelling. Also very thin lotion in general. Thought I&#x27;d get better quality from this brand!</li>
    <li> We have used this particular body lotion for years and cannot see ourselves switching to other brands or other types.  It helps instantly after applying on skin, hands and even face as needed.  Creating the right level of moisture and not too much oily touch.  It smell nice and subtle.</li>
    <li> Super thin/watery. You smell the lotion itself more than the orangey fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am black/African American with normal to dry skin. I love Nivea lotion, but learned that the lotion I use in the winter, doesn&#x27;t work in the summer. But this one is great all year round. It applies and absorbs instantly with no greasy residue. Lasts all day and has a pleasant light citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;I pair this NNivea&#x27;s Touch of Happiness Orange Blossom body wash, which is also great all year round moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My entire family uses both products with no incidents and my husband and 1 year both have sensitive skin. Not to mention the price is right, and even better on Subscribe and Save!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
