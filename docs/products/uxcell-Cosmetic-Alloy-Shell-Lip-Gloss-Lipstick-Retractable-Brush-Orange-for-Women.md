### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great piece of engineering!</li>
      <li>This is definitely a best buy.</li>
      <li>It came before time and the packaging was perfect.</li>
      <li>Still working perfectly after 6 or 8 months.</li>
      <li>It works great, looks great, and a great price.  </li>
      <li>Great and price was great also.</li>
      <li>all but the quality was not so great..</li>
      <li>Caveat emptor for sure!!</li>
      <li>Looks good wish it was just one piece, but otherwise really nice.</li>
      <li>great cheap lipliner brush</li>
      <li>The price is nice and</li>
      <li>Good quality...came quickly!</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Who could ask for anything more?  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Even though it was very cheap, it is worth nothing!</li>
      <li>Does the job if you want a cheap looking application.  </li>
      <li>Using these are new to me and a thicker one works better for me,  Retractable feature works fine.</li>
      <li>I like the capped lip brushed, and this one has a pretty good brush tip for the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to my true &amp; tried Favorite - Revlon covered lip brush.</li>
      <li>handy, as long as you don&#x27;t lose the cover</li>
      <li>Really can&#x27;t complain though for the value!</li>
      <li>and I actually like this one better.</li>
      <li>It is a bit smaller than I anticipated, which has it&#x27;s good points when carrying a tiny purse or wallet, however, it gets lost in my make-up pouch.</li>
      <li>This item doesn&#x27;t cost much, but save your money.  </li>
      <li>It very feminine.</li>
      <li>It is more the size of an eyeliner brush - not wide enough to really use for llips.  </li>
      <li>The so-called brush is so stiff it is more like a pointed sliver of wood.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s even safe.  </li>
      <li>The bristles on the brush are uneven so when I outline my lips, they do not give a smooth line.</li>
      <li>When I first attempted to use it, the brush was so stiff that it gouged my lipstick.  </li>

<li> In my opinion, it is entirely too thin, but then again I guess you get what you pay</li>
<li> As inexpensive as this item was, it was still a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
<li> for something so small</li>
<li> /&gt;Would suggest one does not even spend the small amount</li>
<li> The  piece was broken on my 2nd use, took wayyyy to long for this disappointment</li>
<li> but after two or three applications, it is still very hard and not conditioned to be flexible for your lipcolor.  </li>
<li> The product has a poor craftsmanship and has a weak retractable.</li>
<li> Too thin for me - maybe others like that in a lipstick brush.  </li>
<li> This brush is quite a disappointment!  </li>

    <li> Good quality...came quickly!</li>
    <li> Great piece of engineering!</li>
    <li> Love this. Feels sturdy yet sleek. Still working perfectly after 6 or 8 months. Bought it as a replacement after I lost my Sephora retractable lip brush and I actually like this one better.</li>
    <li> Great and price was great also. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> As inexpensive as this item was, it was still a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;1. The cap doesn&#x27;t stay on when not in use, which means it will fall off in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;2. The brush doesn&#x27;t stay up/protracted when you&#x27;re trying to use it, unless you keep your finger on the sliding mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve had it for less than half an hour, trying to get it to work properly and the metal is already flaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unusable, and with the metal flaking off I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s even safe.  Tossed it in the trash.</li>
    <li> It works great, looks great, and a great price.  Who could ask for anything more?  This is definitely a best buy.</li>
    <li> Looks good wish it was just one piece, but otherwise really nice.</li>
    <li> The price is nice and all but the quality was not so great..</li>
    <li> for something so small it took forever to arrive.  The brush feels like it was glued together and I couldn&#x27;t even use so it got tossed.</li>
    <li> This brush is quite a disappointment!  It is more the size of an eyeliner brush - not wide enough to really use for llips.  In my opinion, it is entirely too thin, but then again I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest one does not even spend the small amount it costs/</li>
    <li> I like the lipstick brush.  I was used to a larger one, so took a little time to get used to a smaller one, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this. It fits everywhere. I have yet to use it but i will soon. It very feminine. It came before time and the packaging was perfect.</li>
    <li> great cheap lipliner brush but after two or three applications, it is still very hard and not conditioned to be flexible for your lipcolor.  Does the job if you want a cheap looking application.  I will buy another brand when the two I purchased go bonkers soon.</li>
    <li> The product has a poor craftsmanship and has a weak retractable. The  piece was broken on my 2nd use, took wayyyy to long for this disappointment</li>
    <li> Too thin for me - maybe others like that in a lipstick brush.  Using these are new to me and a thicker one works better for me,  Retractable feature works fine.</li>
    <li> handy, as long as you don&#x27;t lose the cover coz then the brush won&#x27;t come out!</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t cost much, but save your money.  When I first attempted to use it, the brush was so stiff that it gouged my lipstick.  I softened it up some by bending it with my fingers, but by then the lipstick was already ruined.  I used it a couple of times and then it stayed in my purse for a few days.  When I tried to use it again, the brush would not come out of its retracted position.  What I could see of the brush was covered with lint anyway.  What a crummy product!</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush are uneven so when I outline my lips, they do not give a smooth line.</li>
    <li> I like the capped lip brushed, and this one has a pretty good brush tip for the money. It is a bit smaller than I anticipated, which has it&#x27;s good points when carrying a tiny purse or wallet, however, it gets lost in my make-up pouch. Really can&#x27;t complain though for the value!</li>
    <li> No what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Even though it was very cheap, it is worth nothing! The so-called brush is so stiff it is more like a pointed sliver of wood. Caveat emptor for sure!!</li>
    <li> It is so flimsy and the lip brush tip feels like plastic. I&#x27;m going back to my true &amp; tried Favorite - Revlon covered lip brush.</li>
