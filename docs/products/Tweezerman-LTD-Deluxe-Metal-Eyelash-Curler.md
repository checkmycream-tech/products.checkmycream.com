<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have purchased virtually every eyelash curler ever manufactured, including the top brands. I was looking for a curler that does the job to my satisfaction and, please God, just might include a refill cushion or, two. I almost and halfheartedly purchased a top name brand at my local CVS;  then I noticed Tweezerman eyelash curler right next to it. It cost one dollar more but included 3 refill cushions. I decided, &amp;#34;Oh what the heck&amp;#34;; purchased it and gave it a spin the next day. I was amazed at the results; This eyelash curler is very sturdy; hence, I curled from the mid lash (NOT at the base) and held it for 10 seconds (15-20 seconds for more curl when I&#x27;m going out for the evening). I was very pleased with the results. My mascara also went on in a flash; the eyelash curler was comfy to hold, easy to use and it did an ahhhmazing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman, you may be lost in the crowd and somewhat hidden in the industry but you are the best!:) Thank you!</li>
    <li> Weird curve. My cheap Cover Girl curler works better!</li>
    <li> excellent, worked as expected</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used</li>
    <li> Still not sure how it works,still trying to use it, and see it work.</li>
    <li> Keeps pinching and/or poking me in the eye, have used eyelash curlers for years and this has a weird design that makes it difficult to use. Going back to drugstore variety.</li>
    <li> Well, I was able to use it for my eyes but not all at once. It&#x27;s a bit too curved for my eyes. I&#x27;m chinese and I think I need this thing to be flatter to reach my lashes properly. All in all, I&#x27;ve never done any make-up stuff before so if I&#x27;m able to do it, others probably can as well. Just watch some YouTube videos if you&#x27;re intimidated.</li>
    <li> I used to get expensive eye curlers from Sephora because those were the only ones that seemed to work. Once I got this, I fell in love. PLUS its cheap! Double bonus!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.. This is the only one that works for me!</li>
    <li> This tool is painful to the eye. Not suitable for asian eyes i guess</li>
    <li> I like how the Tweezerman curler makes my lashes look - they get curled in all the right places. The cheap curlers usually crimp my lashes to an awkward position. My lashes normally point downward and curlers make them go upward but not in a natural or flattering way. I&#x27;ve also stopped losing lashes with this curler. This is worth the $12 investment.</li>
    <li> Love this brand! I bought this a while ago and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Tweezerman LTD Deluxe Metal Eyelash Curler in place of my Revlon eyelash curler and I was surprised that I actually prefer my cheapie drugstore Revlon to this Tweezerman curler. I do not find that it curls as well as the pad is very firm and it crimps my eyelashes in a weird way. I would be hesitant to recommend this curler to anyone looking for a new one. I do find Tweezerman products to be superior in craftsmanship and performance but this product didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to use, and gives a long-lasting curl!  Also comes with extra silicone pads.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler works very well.  Better than the last brand I purchased.  Liked that it included 3 extra pads</li>
    <li> No Problems! Fast Delivery! A++++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok curler, it says it doesn&#x27;t crimp lashes but it still does. Maybe I&#x27;m curling it wrong? My old curler works better and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I would not buy it again; it really is not much better than the Revlon or any other normal curler.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job of curling eyelashes. The pads seem to be the main advantage. They are thick and grip well without being so sticky that they remove lashes. Also, the package comes with two replacement pads, so you&#x27;ll be set for a while.  Curling one&#x27;s eyelashes prior to applying mascara really makes a big difference.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this eyelash curler for over 10 years now.  I finally had to buy a new one because I lost mine and I did not hesitate to rebuy this one. It is exactly the same and I do not regret it at all.  I have no doubt that this one will last just as long as the last one.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler and the pads are very cushioning. However, be sure to replace the pads when it develops the slit/cut in it from using the curler a lot. I did not replace it right away and a large section of my eyelashes in the center of my eyelid on both eyes we yanked out! It is taking some time for them to grow back. I saw quite a few lashes down in that split of the pad. So be aware of that. Also, the replacement pads are 1) hard to find in stores; and 2) very expensive online.</li>
    <li> No eyelash curler I&#x27;ve decided is &amp;#34;No Pinch&amp;#34; and this definitely pinches less that others I&#x27;ve tried. I always get a great curl.</li>
    <li> Poor quality item, broke after one week of use. Would not buy again. Not the best, and the price is too high</li>
    <li> I purchased two of the Tweezerman LTD Deluxe Metal Eyelash Curlers (for home &amp; work) that came with four LIGHT BLUE silicone lash pads from Target at least 3 years ago. I love it, the wide pads are more gentle than the other common national brands. When I finally ran out of lash pads I could not find any refills at any of the retailers listed on Tweezerman&#x27;s website and they did not respond to my email. I figured I would try the Tweezerman Purple refills on Amazon since they are made by the same company and say they are silicone. They fit and seem to have the same texture, feel and ability to curl my lashes as the light blue pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this product FIVE stars is that the Tweezerman&#x27;s website SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY statement about &amp;#34;don’t harm the environment&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem to be held up very well if the vast majority of the brick &amp; mortar stores that sell the Curler do not sell the Pad Refills. I walked and drove to many stores looking for REFILLS; and yes I contemplated buying a totally new Curler because I could not find the Pad Refills anywhere except the other kind I bought from Amazon. So much for ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.</li>
    <li> If you have ever used a bad tweezer and then switched to one made by Tweezerman, you have experienced the quality of product that this company produces. I have used dollar-store lash curlers, and gotten very little curl and lots of pain. The Deluxe Metal Eyelash Curler will really give you some curl with definition. I personally did not have to reposition it several times to avoid pinching my lids. The results are super!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler really does the job. I am pretty clumsy, but I was able to use this easily. I like the additional silicone pads. It helped curl without pulling out my eyelashes. You can get an awesome curl with this by heating it up with a hair dryer before using it.</li>
    <li> I have long but super straight lashes. Until I bought these, I used a spring eyelash curler which did no good unless I heated the metal up first. These work way better, though I have to curl multiple times with time in between before I go out the door if I want it to last. Mine came with an eyelash comb, which was nice. The extra three replacement pads were cool. I&#x27;ll buy these again in the future after I wear this one out.</li>
    <li> loved this works amazing quality made and perfect for any woman i have very short lashes and this made them look alot longer</li>
    <li> Ok, but doesn&#x27;t seem any different than the basic Revlon or Cover Girl curler...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this eyelash curler. Went through so many trying to find the perfect curler. This is as good as they get and works great. First few uses it feels stiff a little but BAM, it&#x27;s the best after that! Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Replacing a broken one that was way past its prime. Love this curler!</li>
    <li> This Tweezerman eyelash curler is well made, easy to use, does not pinch the eye or eyelashes, and curls the eyelashes very well. The curler itself is lightweight enough to keep in your cosmetic bag in your purse and it comes with two extra non-stick silicone pads. The difference between wearing mascara without using this eyelash curler and using it are tremendous. Using this curler really lifts the lashes, makes it very easy to put mascara on, and gives the eyes the appearance of looking wide awake. I will never wear mascara without curling my lashes again!</li>
    <li> Like the old days very easy to use and comfortable.  I think I may be a dinosaur as it seems not an item widely used.  Hard to find re-fills.  Of course everything is disposable today!</li>
    <li> Very well made and works like a charm. I&#x27;m still learning how to use this thing as I&#x27;m kind of a clumsy person.</li>
    <li> I have used this eyelash curler for several weeks in hope of being able to say something fabulous about it...or horrible. But I can only offer you this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is quality made. Sturdy. Should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;2. It comes with 3 pads so those should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;3. I feel like the brand new pad is not real comfortable, but once it breaks in, they curl better and more comfortably(just my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my lashes any more than my Revlon curler but that said, all the Revlon ones are not created equal. At one point, I went to replace my curler and ended up with one that was so bad I took it back. Thankfully I found my original one! My friend has the same as my original one and she loves it too. The Revlon one is less sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Tweezerman is fairly equal to that favorite curler, but it seems a little pinchy at the edges. Not something you&#x27;d have to worry about, just to be careful before you squeeze hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this if you don&#x27;t LOVE your current eyelash curler or if it broke. It&#x27;s not disappointing and is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for review. No one has pressured me to say one thing or another and I try to be honest in all I do review. If you found this review helpful, I&#x27;d be grateful if you clicked \\&quot;yes\\&quot; below.</li>
    <li> This being only the 3rd eyelash curler I&#x27;ve owned I didn&#x27;t think there would be any difference figuring that all eyelash curlers performed in the same manner.  However I quickly discovered some noticeable benefits to the Tweezerman Deluxe.  It was much easier to curl the lashes with one or two bumps not sure if this is due to the curve of the curler but it definitely made it a quicker process.  My favorite feature is that it comes with three additional pads making it an excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> They really work great! The perfect curl everytime! You don&#x27;t have to heat it up before you  use and you still get a great curl!</li>
    <li> Well, what can I say?  They are eyelash curlers!  They do curl without pulling, provided you don&#x27;t suddenly move your head while squeezing them.  IMHO, all curlers and tweezers are vastly over-priced, and all make claims that apply to a minority of customers, but some of terribly expensive and really lousy.  These do the job at close to the lowest price, which is about the best one can expect nowadays, I guess.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried practically every lash curler out there.  I have large \\&quot;almond\\&quot; eyes &amp; thick, straight  lashes.  Most curlers do not manage to get all the lashes curled no matter how hard I try.  The best curler I&#x27;ve found is the Shu Uemura &amp; this Tweezerman is the second best. I&#x27;ve owned a Tweezerman curler for several years &amp; keep it in my travel bag; it is less expensive to replace. I will compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman is slightly better built, slightly heavier metal &amp; slightly larger.  The Shu Uemura has just slightly larger finger holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman has a nice rounded &amp; thick silicone pad &amp; comes with 3 replacement pads - generous.  The Shu Uemura has a slightly different shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman gets nearly all my lashes in the curler but not quite.  The Shu Uemura gets them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would give this Tweezerman a try first since it&#x27;s reasonably priced and a good curler.  Finding the right curler is really a personal thing &amp; depends a lot on the shape &amp; length of your eyelid.  So what I find works for me, may not work as well for you.  Shu Uemura has not sold their curlers in US retail stores since 2010.  You can order directly from their website (I think the items ship from Canada).  There are a bunch of knockoffs out there &amp; here on Amazon so don&#x27;t get fooled.</li>
    <li> I got this eyelash curler to replace my Shu Uemura version, which I loved, but could no longer find replacement pads for. The box for this Tweezerman model says that it doesn&#x27;t pinch, but it took several weeks for me to be able to curl my lashes without routinely pinching my eyelids (NEVER a problem with the Shu Uemura). I&#x27;ve been using eyelash curlers for over 30 years, so I&#x27;m no novice. I also have trouble getting all my lashes into the curler. Frankly, it&#x27;s not any better than the cheap curlers you can find in any drugstore or discount store. The only real plus is that it comes with 3 extra pads.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a good product. Nicely conforms to the shape of the eye - that was the only requirement I had. Other than that, all eyelash curlers are the same.</li>
    <li> Comes with three refills which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best brands however are Shu Uemura and Japonesque.  They are just better constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman feigns a Germanic tone but most of their stuff is made in India.</li>
    <li> I wear false eyelashes and was in the market for a new curler. I love that this comes with extra pads and I have a lot of faith in the Tweezerman brand. I had some issues with pinching and I had the same issues with my old pair (only worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not an expert by far but I would recommend these to anyone who asked for my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very clunky and not a smooth slide while closing. I ended up using oil to attempt to fix this issue.</li>
    <li> Good job with no pulling or breakage, also received several extra pads for the curler.  I felt like I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying some eye lash curlers at the grocery store. They really didn&#x27;t work and pinched my eyelids. Read the reviews on Amazon and bought this great eyelash curler. It came with 3 additional pads as well as an eyelash brush. Excellent curler!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be as good as or better than what I think is the best, Shiseido&#x27;s, but this one was just ok. Shiseido&#x27;s is the ultimate best and while this one does not pinch (a big plus) it doesn&#x27;t give you a great curled eyelash either.</li>
    <li> Eyelash curlers usually don&#x27;t fit my eyelashes. For whatever reason, they seem too u-shaped to where they&#x27;ll curl some lashes but not all, and I usually have to go over my eyelashes a couple times to hit them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most eyelash curlers also have the problem of crimping or folding your lashes rather than actually curling them. However, this tweezerman brand has a wide enough pad that it actually does curl the lashes and doesn&#x27;t require me to go over my lashes multiple times very gently in order to get a good curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I particularly like that it comes with a set of three extra pads. Most come with at least one extra pad, but three is downright generous. Overall, this is a great eyelash curler, which is to be expected as this brand is known for having great tweezers and other grooming implements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this curler on both my lashes and some fake lashes. Worked great on both. Easy to use, seems to be well constructed, and I like that it came with the three extra pads.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is known for the quality of their product, and this item is no exception. It&#x27;s sturdy and smoothly functioning. The pads are silicone rather than latex, so they&#x27;re less likely to provoke sensitivities or allergies, and they&#x27;re easier to clean. The curler comes with three extra pads -- four total -- so you won&#x27;t have to replace this curler for a year. That more than makes up for the price difference between this item and its cheaper competitors, even if you aren&#x27;t concerned about quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you&#x27;ll appreciate the quality, though. It curls, not crimps, doesn&#x27;t pinch, and is easy to place. Why add stress to your morning by settling for less?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used eyelash curlers from the time I was in my teens (a long, long time) and had used another brand for the past 25 or so years. This eyelash curler from Tweezerman has made me a convert and I&#x27;m hopeful that this business is in business for a long, long time!  Great product, Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> does not pull out any eyelashes and effectively curls all of them! an ideal eyelashcurler! i have had it for a few months now, and it is still in great shape; have not had to use the extra rubber guard!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used drug store brand (CG) eyelash curlers which are fine.  But because I liked Tweezerman tweezers so much I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.  What a difference!  For some reason these seem &amp;#34;finer&amp;#34;, get closer to the lash line, give a better curl.  I think it&#x27;s less or better padding on the curler. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this brand now,</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler curls without much pressure, so don&#x27;t push hard or you will pull your lashes.  This actual device isn&#x27;t curved enough for my eye shape, so I pinch my eyelid every time I use it.  I am used to using more pressure, so my lashes turn out creased and weird.  I have been using lash curlers for 24 years, so I am not new at this.  Tweezerman is well made and will last a long time, so I wish I could make it work for me.</li>
    <li> I love my Tweezerman eyelash curler! I feel like I&#x27;ve been using the wrong eyelash curler my whole life since I got this one. To give you an idea of my lashes, they are long but naturally straight. I do have almond shaped eyes and this curler fits perfectly around them. It is very lightweight and smaller than other eyelash curlers I have used but it does a great job. Putting on my mascara takes less time now also due to not having to keep curling my eyelashes to get a nice curl. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for an eyelash curler. I&#x27;ve submitted a picture to give you a look at how well it curls my lashes. (Note: I do not use a lot of mascara, and rarely wear eyeliner)</li>
    <li> I have used this eyelash curler ever since my freshman year of high school.  For the longest time I could not find it in my local CVS stores. Finally I decided just to search online and I am so glad I did because this is by far the best eye lash curler. I have tried many other curlers and none of them curl my eyelashes right.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough but I was pleasantly surprised the curler came with extra rubber inlays so it&#x27;s easy to maintain good hygiene with this product, I also wipe mine down with alcohol after each use. The Tweezerman is comfortable to use and even for newbies to eyelash curlers this is simple and straightforward.  It leaves a nice curl on my short lashes that lasts most of the day.  I&#x27;ve found if you want your curl to last 12 hours that you can run your hairdryer on the curler for a second and the heat sets the curl.  Tweezerman is by far the best made curler.  My previous one lasted 5+ years and I have no doubt this one will last equally long.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this eyelash curler and thought I was making the right decision, but after I started using them around the second time  my eyelashes came off and I was so upset! So if anyone does purchase this eyelash curler please beware!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always thought about getting an eyelash curler, but never did: they look like Medieval torture devices and I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d even use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I got the opportunity to get the Tweezerman curler featured here, I jumped on it. Tweezerman makes high-quality, high-tensile, and very sharp/fine tweezers: praise that you wouldn&#x27;t normally associate with such a benign little bathroom tool gets heaped on Tweezerman tweezers, and with good reason. They don&#x27;t rust, they stay sharp, the company backs the product absolutely, and their tensile/tension doesn&#x27;t degrade over time. Tweezerman, in other words, means quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler comes with the metal unit, with soft pads attached. It also comes with additional sets of pads, to change out when they become worn-out or soiled. Some individuals use these after applying mascara, but I prefer to use them first and /then/ put on mascara. Curled eyelashes really open up the eyes, and create a more fresh, awake look when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to when mastering proper eyelash curling technique, but eventually it became incorporated into my daily beauty routine without a thought. Guidance/instructions are included, for the faint at heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman has created a fine, simple, and well-constructed quality product. Definitely will be keeping it in my vanity for daily use when I do my makeup.</li>
    <li> Actually make my lashes look longer and fuller but must follow instructions and apply with a good mascara to see results</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY THE BEST OUT THERE.  THE REFILLS WORK LIKE THE ORIGINAL .  I HAVE USED THESE FOR YEARS. I WOULD RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> It does the job and the price is right.  I like the fact that it comes with quite a few extra pads.</li>
    <li> My Revlon curler fit my fingers better because it was bigger and also was made of heavier materials.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Simple curler. Metal and sturdy with soft pads. It was a good deal and it has been working well for over a month now. I would recommend this eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many eyelash curlers over the years, and this is by far the best one.  My eyelashes are more evenly curled than simply &amp;#34;bent&amp;#34; in the middle.</li>
    <li> Solidly built and works as it should!</li>
    <li> I tried this item because I liked the price.  It is not as curved as most eyelash curlers are though.  It was rather straight across. So I took out the rubber replacement pads and used them in my old curler instead.  That worked!</li>
    <li> I love the brand Tweezerman, have been using their products for 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;Mainly nail nippers and tweezers (the best ever), and have them sharpened for free at their warehouse.  LOVE&lt;br /&gt;But...as far as eyelash curlers are concerned, these don&#x27;t seem to be anything special.  But, totally fine.</li>
    <li> Curling my eyelashes has been a part of my morning routine for over 30 years.  I have very long lashes and using an eyelash curler takes very little thought or effort on my part with great results.  When it was time to get new pads for my old Revlon I thought I would treat myself to a new &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; curler.  After reading multiple reviews I settled on the Tweezerman.  What a disappointment!  It does not matter how I hold it, it pinches my eye lid every time.  I tried switching the pads out, still pinches my eye lids.  I have to come so far out on my long eyelashes to prevent the curler from pinching my eyelids that all I end up with is a weird kink at the end instead of nice rounded lashes...and it STILL pinches my lid.  After 2 weeks I can safely assume it is not a case of operator error.  I&#x27;ll be going to the drugstore to pick up new pads for my old Revlon eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> My old eyelash curler broke, so I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. I&#x27;m not happy at all. Its curling base seems smaller than my last one and it pinches my skin. The tension needed to get the curl I want just doesn&#x27;t seem to be there. I&#x27;m going to be looking for a new  one soon!</li>
    <li> This was my first eyelash curler and I really like it. It curls your lashes well and you won&#x27;t get pinched unless you allow it to, just be careful with that. Overall good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I have very short eyelashes and this is the second Tweezerman I&#x27;ve bought in 10 years only because I can&#x27;t find the replacements for the old curler.  Love this curler, it doesn&#x27;t kink or break my eyelashes!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new eyelash curler and didn&#x27;t want to fork out the $20 for the high-end Shu Uemura one. I have been using that brand for many years with great results, so I was very hesitant about switching. Due to the difference in price, I decided to go for it! For approximately $7.50 less, the Tweezerman Deluxe Eyelash Curler is as good if not better. I like that it comes with three replacement pads, too. I found it easy to use and my lashes look great. No need to go for the expensive brand. Switch to Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> You can buy other brands for less. I&#x27;ve used many over the years, from cheap-o&#x27;s to not-so-cheap-o&#x27;s. What is different about this one is that it seems to fit the eye better, in my case, at any rate, and I don&#x27;t have big large eyes like many do. I was getting pinched in the corner sometimes by the ill-fitting curve of a device. This makes your eye water, darnit! It&#x27;s no fun anytime, but just when you are trying to apply makeup, you don&#x27;t want your eyes watering so that you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material that the insert is made of is not rubber, like the older models, so it won&#x27;t crack and take your eyelashes with it when it does. It is pliable enough to curl and for some reason, masacara applied better, making my lashes look their longest. I&#x27;m happy with this one. I didn&#x27;t realize that Tweezerman made eyelash curlers until now. I don&#x27;t know which one of theirs is best actually, they have several models, another thing I didn&#x27;t realize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Tweezerman: I&#x27;ve used Tweezerman tweezers for the last 6 or so years after buying and throwing away many others. I decided to try them, even though the cost was like I could buy 3 cheaper ones for. It was worth it. Tweezerman even sharpens them for free. I had to buy a back-up pair as the sharpening takes a few weeks, but that is fine. Now we have his/hers tweezers. Getting back to the eye-lash curler, it is working out very well for me. I happily recommend this product, and it comes with 3 replacement thing-a-mah-jigs (the insert).</li>
    <li> I thought an eyelash curler was an eyelash curler.  After trying this Tweezerman eyelash curler, I realized I was wrong.  This product really does curl my eyelashes much better than cheap eyelash curlers.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but my eyelashes are noticeably better curled and not just bent.  The cushion might help with that.  It definitely makes for more comfortable use.  You also get replacement cushions in the pack.  This is an excellent quality product.</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all. I like the cheaper ones you buy at Walgreen&#x27;s that have a spring in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyelash curler based on the other reviews- and I agree with them. It really doesn&#x27;t pinch. I have eye lashes that grow downward on one eye, and nothing would make them curl upwards- until I tried this curler. I threw my other ones away, and will stick with Tweezerman.&lt;br /&gt;For a heated eyelash curler, just warm it up with your blow dryer for a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this eyelash curler, I had a Revlon curler that I had been using for 10+ years. When it finally broke, I decided to try this one, because I&#x27;ve tried other products from Tweezerman, and they have all worked well. It works just as expected, although I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that it works much better than my old Revlon. It is sturdy and high quality. With all eyelash curlers, it will take a little while to break in the pads. It can be slightly painful if I get too close to the roots, but I think that will get better  when the pads loosen up a little.</li>
    <li> I needed to get a new one because my other one was so old the pad on it between was falling off. Works Really Well. Decent Price and Came Quickly.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is quite good - way better than the cheapie ones that you find.  It is nice and sturdy and there is no spring to go bad.  I expect some nice years of use from it. I love the tweezers from this company and was glad to find this offered.  It is good value for price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used eyelash curlers for years. The Tweezerman  is nice because the silicone pads are rounded. The Tweezerman does not crease my lashes &amp; gives them a pretty, gentle curve. However, the curl doesn&#x27;t last any longer than the other eyelash curler I use.  My hair is hard to curl &amp; so are my lashes.  My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl &amp; neither do my lashes. Even with that limitation, I do like the Tweezerman Deluxe Eyelash Curler &amp; it even comes with three extra silicone pads.</li>
    <li> Finally an eyelash curler that grabs all your eyelashes!  I love this curler, it really works well.  The design of this curler is spot on and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> From a brand I trust comes an eyelash curler that delivers, with a comfortable cushion that doesn&#x27;t create an awkward heavy crease on my lash line. Comfortable handles, easy to swap out the two additional pads. What more to say? It&#x27;s an eyelash curler. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have not had much luck with eyelash curlers. It seems like no matter what I do, the curl just doesn&#x27;t last for me. This curler wasn&#x27;t much different. I did notice that the insert things are pretty durable and seem like they will last. If eyelash curlers work for you, this would probably be a good one to buy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to go wrong with Tweezerman.  I&#x27;ve been using their tweezers for years and won&#x27;t use any other brand so figured I would try their eyelash curler.  Definitely worth the couple extra dollars.  I love them.  They curl my eyelashes perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these now, and they are great. I also have the older version with the purple refills, and I have to say I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the two. They don&#x27;t crimp lashes like cheap eyelash curlers usually do, and my stick straight thick lashes stay all day. I have given them out as stocking stuffers year after year. They last a long time, preform well, and I love that they come with 3 refills. You don&#x27;t have to squeeze super hard to get a curl. Just do three easy squeezes.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister as a gift after she used mine on a recent trip to her house. Its great that is comes with replacement pads, although I haven&#x27;t had to replace mine yet and I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year (use a couple of times a week)</li>
    <li> Love this! I have slightly almond shaped eyes and this fit really well. Also great quality and doesn&#x27;t pinch at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find an eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t break easily, pinch or crimp eyelashes.  Hooray for Tweezerman Deluxe--it does none of those things.  The size of the metal curler conforms well to my eyes.  Thanks to thick rounded pads, curls are very natural looking.  I&#x27;ve never experienced a creased, crimped look using these.  The silicone pads are easy to keep clean and they don&#x27;t deteriorate as quickly as latex ones seem to.  Three additional pads are included.  I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found an eyelash curler that works.</li>
    <li> I have super straight eyelashes, there is zero natural curl in any of my hair.  I have to use a eyelash curler in order to see my eyeballs. I have tried many, many brands.  This Tweezerman eyelash curler is definitely among the top curlers that I have tried.  The cushion is gentle on my lashes and provides more of a curl instead of the crimp you get with cheaper curlers.  I also don&#x27;t have to squeeze this metal curler very hard to get noticeable results, a gentle squeeze for a few seconds is all it takes followed by a few coats of mascara.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Worth the few extra bucks -- this curler works better than any I&#x27;ve used before. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These were well rated on many venues. I really like them as well. I am a little new to using lash curlers and feel I&#x27;m really getting the benefit they claim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different eyelash curlers for the past 40 years.  In my opinion, the Tweezerman LTD is the best on the market.  The rubber cushions last longer and the curler, for lack of another word, stays &amp;#34;calibrated&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This feels sturdy &amp; actually curled my short, kinda straight lashes as part of an overall effort to increase the size of my eyes through my new -7.00 prescription glasses. Corneal Neovascularization, folks. Don&#x27;t sleep in your contacts.</li>
    <li> I had a Tweezerman man awhile ago, loved it but lost it.  Thought all were created equal so I bought a cheap Revlon one.  It worked OK in the beginning but then started to crimp my lashes instead of curl them.  Will always be using Tweezerman curler from now on!</li>
    <li> Like this eyelash curler very much. It works better then most curlers. I like Tweezerman products alot including the tweezers.</li>
    <li> Got this as part of sister&#x27;s b-day bundle. She had been complaining about her old eyelash curler taking a lot of effort to curl the lashes and loved these. Will get the job in 1-2 soft squeezes.</li>
    <li> I have almond shaped eyes and my lashes are straight and long.  I have used various curlers and found shu uemura and had used that over ten years until they stopped selling them in the US.  I found a shu uemura curler online on eBay and when I got it was certain it was a fake because the quality was so bad.  I bought a Tarte curler because I was told that it was the next best thing.  I liked that one.  Now I&#x27;m a mother and I like to find deals.  I try some more affordable things now.  I bought and tried the Revlon curler, that was fine too.  I needed to replace it and found the Tweezerman ones.  They&#x27;re great.  The feel of them are nice and sturdy.  They were a little more than the Revlon curlers but in my package I got the curler with a pad in it PLUS three more.  I like to not only be frugal but I like to reuse, reduce and recycle and not having to buy a new curler all the time but instead replacing the pads seem like a good way to reduce. I have not gone a day without curling my eyelashes and putting on mascara. I can go without anything but the eyelashes, for me, are a must.  I can say whatever curler I use there are some keys to my success.  First, rather than just one big crimp, I start at the base of my lashes and pump the curler slowly up to the end. One big crimp and you get L shaped lashes. I like mine to be a big curve.  Another key is the mascara. Even with my shu uemura curler, I couldn&#x27;t get the curl to be full and stay without a good mascara.  I have used maybelline waterproof all my make up wearing life.  I have tried more expensive ones, very expensive, before I was a mommy and I always went back to maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I love this curler.  With the right technique and the right mascara just about any good curler, except the awful eBay knock off,  has worked and this is a nice one at a good price with lots of replacement pads.  I think they&#x27;re as great a my old shu uemura curler.... Finally</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler ever! No pulling. Does a good job.  Lashes stay curled longer!</li>
    <li> I got this a few days ago, and it actually works very very well! the only problem that I have found is that i pinch my skin often. Overall, very good product</li>
    <li> One time I bought a curler from the local drug store and used it once...and amazingly was shocked that it cut off all the lashes on the eye I had just curled.  It was pretty sad!  Anyway, I guess it had a defect but still pretty bad.  This model of curler, is very sturdy, does not seem to pinch which I think can be a problem for us ladies and all my lashes are in tact!!!  Nice product, does what it says, seems safe and well made.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very nice value for this brand.  I am mainly after the refill pads as they are harder to come by.  I noticed, however, that the red pads that came with the pack is a lot more resilient and squishy than the blue one which is a lot firmer.  I&#x27;m not entirely sure which one is better for the lashes but it is taking me a few more squeezes to get the curl I want with these red pads.</li>
    <li> I watched a video on youtube where they reviewed this, I couldn&#x27;t believe that the opening to this was so small until I tried it. I bought it because it was cheaper than another one i saw. I noticed that the packaging said that it would give me the curl but not bend my lashes. I&#x27;ll give them that because my eyelashes are curled and NOT bent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good eyelash curler, but the opening is just too small for me. The opening is about 1/4 of an inch! I didn&#x27;t think I would have such trouble, but I do have to move it around so all my lashes get in there!</li>
    <li> Solid. Not like some of the flimsy ones I&#x27;ve bought and disliked. Good size.</li>
    <li> Great curl.  I loved the extra rubber pieces.  I was worried that Tweezeman was only for tweezers.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> Durable pads really grip and curl lashes -- almost too well! I have naturally thick and long lashes, so if I curl them too far down (close to the base of the eyelid), they bend so that they&#x27;re almost straight up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend warming the curler pads under warm water and lightly drying before use. The warm pads help to curl the lashes.</li>
    <li> The pads on the Tweezerman curler are really nice, just firm enough to curl your lashes and not bend them at an angle like some cheaper eyelash curlers will. This eyelash curler also comes with 3 extra pads!</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler.  I use it to curl my false lashes.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE.  THEY LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> This is a nice eyelash curler.  I bought it because I was tired of using my Cover Girl curler and having to wait 30 seconds for the curl to appear. Cover Girl no longer sells a curler and the one I have didn&#x27;t come with a refill.  The Tweezerman is a nice basic utensil that gives lashes a nice bend.  What&#x27;s even better is that it comes with 3 pad refills.  I used Revlon curlers for years and they are about $8 and come with one refill.  However, the Revlon curler I purchased the last time was very different from the one that I was replacing and it didn&#x27;t come with a pad refill.  I understand there are different Revlon curlers so I&#x27;m not sure which one is which, I only know that the last one I bought didn&#x27;t work well.  My local drugstore only carries the regular and extra large Revlon curlers but I decided to do something different this time.  I think that $12 for the Tweezerman curler with 3 refills is a really good price.  However, I discovered that it is the same price in Walgreeens.  Oh well!  This curler got good reviews on Amazon and I agree.  I have really long lashes but as I age, they have become more sparse.  They definitely need a curl, which makes them look thicker.  I don&#x27;t need to wait such a long time for a curl with the Tweezerman, just a few seconds and VIOLA  curl!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> best curler I have had.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is awesome.  I have long eyelashes, but they are stick straight.  Works just as well as Shu Uemura and Japonesque but is cheaper and comes with replacement pads.</li>
    <li> This is a great lash curler and it came with 3 extra curling pads. Always happy with tweezerman products. For the metal style curlers like this, this is by far the best one I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> Let me start off describing what kind of eye I have. I have a more almond shaped eye, and stick straight stubby lashes. Curlers either are too \\&quot;U\\&quot; shaped to fit my eye or they flat out do not \\&quot;curl\\&quot; my lashes just bend them at a 90 degree angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS curler is perfect for me. It&#x27;s a much wider shape/ longer pad shape. It fits my eyes perfectly and really it would fit any eye being as wide as it is.&lt;br /&gt;It curls my super short lashes. It gets all of them even the outer and inner ones just fine. I only have to pump it a few times at the base, middle and tips and viola! I look like I have lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that tweezerman sells separate pads for these although it comes with 3 extras plus one already on the curler. To me that&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like is that I can&#x27;t just curl my lashes and not put mascara on them to keep the curl. They tend to go flat unless I put waterproof mascara on them within the hour. It could be operator error though since I have oily lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too long, didn&#x27;t read: It&#x27;s a good sturdy curler that performs excellently. I highly recommend it if you have the money. I was getting so fed up with $1 ones that I forked over the $12 and it was sooo worth it for stubby straight lashes!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is way too small for my eyes. I have the revlon one I bought at cvs like 5 years ago and it fits my eyes way better. And I dont have particularly big eyes. I put the rubber pads from this one in my revlon and they work good.</li>
    <li> Great quality with a nice, wide area for lashes.  I also like the wide openings for finger and thumbs as I have big thumbs.  I have used eyelash curlers for years and I feel this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  I can&#x27;t distinguish any difference in quality between the Tweezerman and my old Revlon eyelash curler.  Actually, it feels flimsier and more jiggly than the Revlon one.  I regret the purchase, but alas, not every purchase can be a great one.  This one falls in that category.</li>
    <li> Hate cheap eyelash curlers that pull your lashes out...this one does not do that, and it curls lashes easily!  They are a little more expensive but they are well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is good for deep-set eyes. I have problems with some other eyelash curlers because the top part is too wide and my eye socket bone is in the way. This solves that problem.</li>
    <li> It was so very past time to throw away my old tweezers and when I was at Sephora, I looked at the super expensive Tweezers and decided, it wasn&#x27;t worth it. So happy I found this one. I have another something from Tweezerman - it might be a tweezer ;) - and I love this eyelash curler. I also love that it comes with 2 extra curlers to switch out later. Love it. Works like a charm. Great brand.</li>
    <li> I have been through at least 6 tries at finding the perfect curler for my lashes in the last year.  My favorite, a purple plastic model by Lacrosse finally gave up and I could no longer find the silicon pads for it.  I tried every brand imaginable and still couldn&#x27;t find a light and comfortable one to use.  I always felt like there was some giant metal monster coming at my eyes.  This one surprised me by being light, especially for metal and extremely comfortable.  I love how the silicon pads grip and don&#x27;t pull at my eye lashes. It provides a wonderful and long lasting curl.</li>
    <li> History:&lt;br /&gt;I have used only about 3 brands in the past 15 years (since I was a teen) since eyelash curlers as they don&#x27;t need to be replaced due to use like most products. I&#x27;ve had La Cross for at least 5 years if not longer most likely.&lt;br /&gt;Catching eyelid:&lt;br /&gt;With Tweezerman, I actually had some issues trying not to catch my eyelid when using it trying to get as much eyelash as I feel I do w/La Cross. I don&#x27;t remember if I had issues with La Cross when I first used it too. After a couple uses, I am getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Comparison:&lt;br /&gt;I did each eye w/a different brand &amp; Tweezerman seems to life the eyelashes higher &amp; the curl does last longer.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman LTD Deluxe Metal Eyelash Curler is a comfortable eyelash curler to use.  It did not pull my lashes, and delivered a nice curl without any pinching.&lt;br /&gt;The curler comes with a replaceable insert for the inside edge which provides cushion when curling lashes.  Also included are several refills for this cushioning edge so that you can change out the insert for sanitary purposes.</li>
    <li> nothing special about these. They&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> Nothing about this eyelash curler warrants the price. It works decently but the curl isn&#x27;t very smooth. It comes with extra parts so that&#x27;s a plus, but that&#x27;s about it. There&#x27;s nothing really about it that sets it apart from the other cheaper brands</li>
    <li> Good eyelash curler. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> good price and  works well,comes with replaceable strips.  can be cleaned if needed.  do not hesitate to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an eyelash curler before this one so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but this curls my lashes so well and it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull at all. It makes my lashes look awesome, better than wearing mascara and so much easier and less clumpy.</li>
    <li> This is my first Tweezerman curler, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It&#x27;s nicely-constructed and seems to be holding up well. The curler is a bit wide, but you&#x27;d probably have to spend twice as much to find a better model from the other brands.</li>
    <li> Works well and better than those I&#x27;ve used over the last few decades. I am very glad replacements are included.</li>
    <li> I already have one just like this and I love it. This one is a gift for a nineteen year old.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with how well this eyelash curler works.  It is easy to use and my lashes stay curled without any flopping.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I thought that since Tweezerman had such a great reputation with their tweezers that their eyelash curler&lt;br /&gt;would be of the same excellent level.  Not so.  Didn&#x27;t work, didn&#x27;t curl, a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Throwing it out!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler surpasses any others that I have ever had.  Other curlers didn&#x27;t curl as well and would frequently catch and pull out my eyelashes.  This curler hasn&#x27;t pulled on one yet and gives an awesome curl that lasts all day.  The pad in the curlers are raised rather than depressed into a ditch like surface which I think makes all the difference.  Easy to clean too.  I love it, and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> These are the best pair I&#x27;ve tried so far. They actually curl my lashes. I wish though that they were a little better made where the metal part swivels so they will last forever. Oh well, great product so far.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how awful my old one was until I lost it and purchased this one. Kind of sad I&#x27;ve been missing out all these years! Definitely a great tool!</li>
    <li> I read once that an eyelash curler is a must have. I&#x27;ve been using one ever since.&lt;br /&gt;My old one had it&#x27;s day, so to speak, so I purchased this one and am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with extra pads which is very nice!</li>
    <li> I have always used an eyelash curler. For the past couple of years I have not been able to find one that actually curls my eyelashes at all! This one really does!</li>
    <li> These seem to be at a weird angle, so I have had to relearn how to hold these so I don&#x27;t pinch my eyelid</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curlers ever.  No other brand compares to these - i know, i&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> Doesnt curl my lashes well</li>
    <li> Just as described, quick delivery!</li>
    <li> So I bought these cause my mom&#x27;s best friend had it &amp; her lashes are usually just straight down but when she uses this eyelash curler they look so long &amp; beautiful!!! I would definitely recommend for you to buy these!</li>
    <li> My old eyelash cur;ler finally broke apart and I wanted new ones but didn&#x27;t find it necessary to pay an outrageous amount. These were reasonably priced and they work fabulously. Honestly I didn&#x27;t even realize my old ones really weren&#x27;t even good at all till I tried these.</li>
    <li> Very well designed curler. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I hate going to the mall, and I love having products delivered to my home.  This is a good eyelash curler, and especially since it has refills where the other, more expensive brand that I had been using did not.  As usual, all the orders from Amazon come in on time, bills are correct, and I have never had to return any item other than one that was shipped to me twice by error.</li>
    <li> By far my best eyelash curler. Superior to shu or other brands.</li>
    <li> Awesome curler.  These curl my super straight lashes.  Love this!  I threw the others in the trash!</li>
