      <li>This dryer cuts the time by a significant amount.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it is small and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
      <li>However it more than meets her needs at home which was why I bought it for her in the first place.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Powerful, easy to handle</li>
      <li>I LOVE that this blow dryer has lower watts than most professional dryers.  </li>
      <li>Light weight, relatively quiet, good heat control.  </li>
      <li>Dries my hair in 1/2 the time and works great for getting hair straight before using my HSI professional hair straightener, followed with HSI Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>The airflow is astounding and very unexpected.  </li>
      <li>heat settings are fantastic and the cool button is quick and responsive.  </li>
      <li>Hair feels nice and soft after using this.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and powerful.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer has a very good built quality and even the cable is of a higher quality and does not start to wrap itself in little circles.</li>
      <li>It was not the powerful motor ones at the Salon she was expecting.</li>
      <li>She was very picky about certain dryers and wanted to make sure that she was getting the right one, so I decided to go on a whim and bought her this for Christmas and boy</li>
      <li>There is not much space between the 2 sets of controls for a good grip</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>This blow dryer is so powerful.</li>
      <li>This particular hair dryer seemed like it would fit the bill.</li>
      <li>In addition, the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air.</li>
      <li>I had only ever used cheap hairdryers in my life and decided to finally get a good one.</li>
      <li>Old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy!</li>
      <li>But in my search to replace an old and cheap one</li>
      <li>I was trying to replace a hair dryer that had provided faithful performance for many years, and was also quiet.</li>
      <li>I not always that I would find a blow dryer for this price and it gets as hot as this one.</li>
      <li>Make your hair soft, frizz free.</li>
      <li>Dries hair so fast!</li>
      <li>not really that warm.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair feeling nice and soft not dry and brittle and it still leaves in the moisture and leaves your hair with shine.</li>
      <li>I like that the grill comes off and allows you to clean the device easily unlike old fashioned dryers where you had to pick the dust out of many little holes.</li>
      <li>The mid-heat setting, which i was really looking forward to ( having only &#x27;unbearably hot&#x27; on my prior dryer) was actually pretty cool and the warm setting</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!  </li>
      <li>Very impressed when i received it, but found it quite heavy and loud, due to a more powerful motor w/ multiple features.</li>
      <li>far so good!!!&lt;br /&gt;The turbo velocity is quick drying.</li>
      <li>my only mini-gripe is the button location makes it easy to switch it on and off while holding it.  </li>
      <li>Great deal compared to other quality flat irons!  </li>
      <li>The HSI works well, dries hair quickly, the controls are easy to use and the cord is longer than any other I have purchased.</li>
      <li>There are several speed and heat settings and all work just fine.</li>
      <li>This was such a fantastic product that my wife absolutely loves.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and well made.</li>
      <li>Did not even use it for a whole session.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hair dryer has a very good built quality and even the cable is of a higher quality and does not start to wrap itself in little circles. It is little bit heavier than the dryer my wife used before which is for my opinion the result of a higher quality (the previous hair dryer lasted just 2 years).&lt;br /&gt;It is also pretty quiet for the performance it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;It was a great buy.</li>
    <li> worked great!!!!!!!!!!!!  better then my other ones and i had a lot of them ranging from 10- 100$$$ this one is the best so far!!</li>
    <li> I love it! Dries hair so fast! Very nice condition. Great I can remove filter and clean it! I think this will keep it working efficiently for longer!</li>
    <li> Was leery of purchasing this hair dryer because the initial reviews appeared to be bumped on purpose. Took a chance and we&#x27;re glad I did. It drys her hair in half the time and is sooooo much quieter than her old dryer. She also likes the way the switches work. These move up and down along the handle and its easy to change fan speed or heat setting with just a flick of the thumb. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I have heard no complaints so far. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair.  I LOVE that this blow dryer has lower watts than most professional dryers.  There are three heat settings and two blow settings and between that I can make plenty of combinations for what I want to do to my hair.  It is a bit heavier than your Walmart purchased blow dryer, but it looks and feels high quality.  It never takes me longer than 5 minutes to blow dry and my hair is soft, silky, and frizz free.  Most of the time I don&#x27;t even need to use anything pre-drying to style it.</li>
    <li> i have long hair and was looking for a dryer to speed up the time it takes for me to get ready and it does just that.  my only mini-gripe is the button location makes it easy to switch it on and off while holding it.  but overall, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very powerful and much quicker than your typical hair dryer, at drying hair.  It does not get very hot, which is great, and has three different &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; settings, as well as three different &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; settings, giving you lots of options.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer was working well but suddenly started making a really loud noise after a few months use. The seller was really helpful and sent out a new one which is working well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  My hair dries half as fast than a store bought dryer. I would stick with this brand always.</li>
    <li> this is a quality hair dryer, no doubt about that. But in my search to replace an old and cheap one, i didn&#x27;t consider the size and weight of these newer, salon quality ones. Very impressed when i received it, but found it quite heavy and loud, due to a more powerful motor w/ multiple features. The mid-heat setting, which i was really looking forward to ( having only &#x27;unbearably hot&#x27; on my prior dryer) was actually pretty cool and the warm setting not really that warm. maybe that&#x27;s something to get used to, but didn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair that fast. the other issue for me was simply that the dryer was so much larger that it wouldn&#x27;t fit in my vanity drawer, and with no other storage option, had to find a model that fit.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these blow dryers, one for myself and the other as a gift. The HSI works well, dries hair quickly, the controls are easy to use and the cord is longer than any other I have purchased. I have noticed that my hair is smoother than when dried with my last dryer, a Babyliss Pro. Both of us are happy with the HSI. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I not always that I would find a blow dryer for this price and it gets as hot as this one. It does wonders with my daughters very natural hair. I love it and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I had only ever used cheap hairdryers in my life and decided to finally get a good one. I already owned one of their straighteners, so I decided to give their dryer a shot too. They&#x27;re decently priced and are also a very high quality product. I have super thick hair that normally takes ages to dry all the way. This dryer cuts the time by a significant amount. There is also a free manufacturer warranty on the item, so definitely take advantage of that if you&#x27;re nervous about trying a brand you don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter.. she said the heat is good, but the blower is weak. she has long thick hair and it wasn&#x27;t doing the job... she plans on keeping it though-she is cutting her hair short and feels it will work fine on shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Got this for the wife, who uses it once/ twice a week. For a while she was happy with it, but then it started work intermittently with the heat cutting off and then it completely stopped heating up. We had had many blow dryers in the past and they usually last a couple of years, even the cheap ones, so its pretty disappointing for a &#x27;professional&#x27; grade product to last less than a year in a light use household environment.</li>
    <li> Light weight, relatively quiet, good heat control.  This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve owned in a long time.</li>
    <li> Make your hair soft, frizz free. My daughter has very thick fine hair. It does a wonderful job. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my wife because she never had a professional hair dryer.  To give you an idea on how good this dryer is, it now takes my wife half the time to dry her hair than it would with a (Cheaper) dryer.  The airflow is astounding and very unexpected.  Feels like it is turbo-charged!  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> All the product I purchased from Blue Novelties thru Amazon were Christmas gifts for my girls. They were delighted and thrilled at the way the products worked. I&#x27;ll be saving a lot of beauty salon cost from now on. I love shopping at Amazon.com and I have found a friend in Blue Novelties. Please email me a catalog so I can give it to them. Problem NOW is... they fight over the products.&lt;br /&gt;...I can&#x27;t win, no matter how much I try!  Thanx...Mr. Mac</li>
    <li> It was a gift my daughter requested. I purchased it for her for her birthday which happens to be on Christmas!</li>
    <li> I only wish that I had bought this blow dryer when ever they first came out...my hair drys in more than half of the time faster....excellent product...</li>
    <li> Reviews were great, so we were somewhat disappointed.  My wife found the strongest setting too strong.  The middle setting had the right force but did not allow the highest heat.  Will try to get used to it , but I suspect we will be replacing it soon.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best one I have been able to find! I have very long and thick hair. It used to take me about and hour and a half to dry my whole head, this dryer got it dry in...wait for it.... About 25 minutes! Old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy! But this blow dryer left my hair almost board straight. I almost didn&#x27;t have to use the HSI straightener that I bought along with it. I never used to blow dry my hair because of the time it would take plus how frizzy it would leave my hair but now I have blown dried my hair every single time! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer i have ever owned.  I have thick hair and quickly noticed a difference in how much time i spend drying my hair.  Also the frizz i use to have is now gone.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer.  A little heavy.  My only real difficulty is that I had to make a conscious decision about how to hold it as I dried my hair.  There is not much space between the 2 sets of controls for a good grip and I have to remember not to grasp it up high in the angled area or I press the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting and lose my heat.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft.  I love this flat iron!  Great deal compared to other quality flat irons!  I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was such a fantastic product that my wife absolutely loves.  She was very picky about certain dryers and wanted to make sure that she was getting the right one, so I decided to go on a whim and bought her this for Christmas and boy was she excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat settings are fantastic and the cool button is quick and responsive.  The only little complaint is that the highest heat setting becomes extremely hot and there is almost no need to ever put it on the highest setting as the first and second are hot enough!  Well made product!</li>
    <li> I like that this is light weight.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair gets tangled whey drying</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true. I have long thick hair and it certainly dries my hair a lot quicker than the other dryers. In addition, the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air. I&#x27;m very satisfied and highly recommend! This is a good buy...</li>
    <li> Used once and it blew cold air thankfully after I was done drying. I loved the dryer, so disappointed it broke.</li>
    <li> Have used it 4 times. Powerful, easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;and dries hair in half the time of my. Easy to hold handle design. Best of all, it is small and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> It was not the powerful motor ones at the Salon she was expecting. However it more than meets her needs at home which was why I bought it for her in the first place. A decent price for a nice looking blow dryer. There are three speeds, three temperatures and a cold button. It comes with two detachable mouthpieces and a sample oil product you can rub in your hair before you stylize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it stands up to the Remington for the same price. That one looks more powerful from the description.</li>
    <li> Has a nice holding grip.. Makes alot of noise and pushes very little heat. Could be that I was just unlucky with this one.</li>
    <li> This Hair Dryer has a nice color, and has been working so good.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!!!&lt;br /&gt;The turbo velocity is quick drying. Is comfortable to use and easy to handling.</li>
    <li> Compared to other dryers I have used, this is much quieter. It has a nice slim handle and that is easy to use for me. I like the multi functions. The price was much better than the dryers in the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer and one of the best dryers that I have used. It has a velvet feel to it and light weight. It leaves your hair feeling nice and soft not dry and brittle and it still leaves in the moisture and leaves your hair with shine.</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace a hair dryer that had provided faithful performance for many years, and was also quiet. This particular hair dryer seemed like it would fit the bill. It did not. Did not even use it for a whole session. The main problem was that the plug would not stay in the outlet. Any small movement, which is required for drying hair, and the plug would fall out of the outlet. Have never had a problem with the other dryer, or dryers of guests. The other disappointment was how loud it is. I wish that I could find a clone of my old dryer!</li>
    <li> This works fabulous! Dries my hair in 1/2 the time and works great for getting hair straight before using my HSI professional hair straightener, followed with HSI Argan Oil. Worth every PENNY :)</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this dryer. It has a soft velvety coating that gives it a good grip. There are several speed and heat settings and all work just fine. I like that the grill comes off and allows you to clean the device easily unlike old fashioned dryers where you had to pick the dust out of many little holes.</li>
    <li> While the flat iron is coming apart in less than a year, this hair dryer seems to be a better product so far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it as much as I love the iron I ordered with it, but the hairdryer is great, especially for the money.  It is very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this dryer since it only blows out cold air and takes me thirty minutes to dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer my girlfriend has ever had! Bought this and straight iron said she has had all kinds including two hundred dollar straighteners. This is best ever</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love this. Best blow dryer ever. Worth the money. Hair feels nice and soft after using this.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is so powerful. I have medium long hair and not only did it cut my drying time in half, but it made my hair so soft afterwords instead a fluffy frizz ball. I almost don&#x27;t even need to straighten it. But the HSI straightener gives it that awesome finishing touch. The HSI blow dryer and straightener are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> After my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it&#x27;s &amp;#34;umff&amp;#34; I turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer, my hair stylist, who is a trusted friend even recommended it, and of course even she couldn&#x27;t beat the price, it works really well, my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one, it was definitely time for an upgrade. The power is great and I didn&#x27;t find it to be to heavy. I have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that&#x27;s nice considering I&#x27;m a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn&#x27;t have to much primp time in the mornings :)  I would definitely recommend this dreyer!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the HSI flat iron.  I liked it so much I bought the dryer.  I like the dryer just a much.  It is light weight and powerful.  I have long wavy hair and this dryer works quickly without adding frizz.</li>
    <li> Great product and worth every penny!  Why waste money on a name!</li>
    <li> I was previously using a compact hair dryer that did more damage to my hair.  With the included nozzles, the adjustable temperature and adjustable air power, my hair is smoother and dries a lot quicker than before.  The cold air button is also a plus if you&#x27;re round brushing your hair.  The non-slip coating on the dryer makes holding the device very comfortable.  HSI is powerful and works wonderfully.  Love it.</li>
