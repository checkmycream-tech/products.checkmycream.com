      <li>I sometimes use the Obagi Healthy Skin SPF 35, but find I always come back to this one!</li>
      <li>I pretty much expect it now and am still on the lookout for a sunscreen that won&#x27;t have this effect.  </li>
      <li>I have tried for years and years to find a sunscreen for my face that was light enough to look and go on easily but was substantial enough to provide the protection.</li>
      <li>Thanks Peggy</li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>Before use, I place a small amount on my finger tips and vigorously rub them together to warm the product up.</li>
      <li>This one causes minor breakouts, but is not nearly as bad as most of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>used for two days and my face was super red, I had an rash.</li>

      <li>and I live in Sweden when almost every day is cloudy this part of the year.</li>
      <li>It agrees with my skin (very sensitive, reactive, acne-prone)in terms of: doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritations.</li>
      <li>this is the most coverage with the least amount of &#x27;rub-in&#x27; I have found.</li>
      <li>I bought the whole Rosaclear set together from my dermatologist, and the only thing out of it that I still use is the cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Have sensitive skin with rosacia.</li>
      <li>, it actually helps to clear up my skin.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s not great for very high sun exposure (sitting on the beach or by the pool), as I find I will burn and have to go for something that lasts a little better.  </li>
      <li>First of all it made my normal skin dry, secondly after applying it over my skin, gave a white and pale appearance.</li>

    <li> I have tried for years and years to find a sunscreen for my face that was light enough to look and go on easily but was substantial enough to provide the protection. I have tried all cosmetic counters in all level of department stores and I have tried recommendations in the past  from my doctor. Finally this is the one for me. It works very well and I can actually afford it here. If the price goes up I will have to continue looking for something else. I have had several basil cell carcinomas removed in the past and so far...knock on wood I am doing well with this brand and type. Thank you for making it available here online.&lt;br /&gt;With regards and many thanks for making it affordable.</li>
    <li> It seems a little oily compared to the Rosaclear tinted hydrating complexion corrector.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Purchased after I had sunscreen failure with another brand.  I sweat a lot and even with reapplying the other failed.  This sun screen has not failed - even after I&#x27;ve forgotten to reapply, washed my horse, and sweated bucket loads.  Also has not caused breakouts or any type of flair up.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001R5QSKS Obagi Rosaclear Skin Balancing Sun Protection SPF 30, 3 Fluid Ounce]]  I bought this product a month ago and I am not satified that the time for consumption will expire as soon as 11/11.  I have only a month to consume it and I live in Sweden when almost every day is cloudy this part of the year.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this slightly tinted SPF 30 by Obagi! I have used this SPF for over a year now. I sometimes use the Obagi Healthy Skin SPF 35, but find I always come back to this one!</li>
    <li> I have used rosaclear sunscreen for a couple of years. It agrees with my skin (very sensitive, reactive, acne-prone)in terms of: doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritations. I also like that it&#x27;s pigmented and find it evens out my skintone and redness. Works well under my mineral makeup also.</li>
    <li> I always like this product. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so the slight bit of coloring improves the coloring of my aging skin.</li>
    <li> I started using Rosaclear sun protection after a recommendation from my dermatologist.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the tint because I also thought it was too light, even though this product gives superior sun protection.  I tried squeezing a little into my hand and mixing it with a skin bronzer.  The result has been amazing.  I no longer use liquid makeup; instead I use the Rosaclear mixed with bronzer to achieve a skin color that matches mine.  My rosacea is under control and my skin looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for sensitive and rissues type skin. I have Rosales and the zinc content of this sunscreen calms my skin, protects from sunburn and is the only sunscreen I can tolerate wearing every day.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product because I use obagi cleanser and am happy with it.  Obagi is recommended by dermatologists, but this did not meet my expectations at all.  It does not blend into the skin, leaves a white residue and rolls up when after more blending.  The white residue/balls of product can not be easily brushed off.  The more you try to brush it off, the more it balls up.  Very, very dissatisfied.  It is not useable at all.  I have tried using it with my skin being completely dry, then tried while damp but nothing works.  I&#x27;m stuck with an expensive bottle of product that I cannot use and will just have to discard.</li>
    <li> Items is as described.</li>
    <li> Date of expiration 01/2015.&lt;br /&gt;I used for two days and my face was super red, I had an rash.I think that date of expiration was the cause.&lt;br /&gt;:-(</li>
    <li> this spf really irritated my skin, I have roseacea, and this line is supposed to be appropriate for this condition, not</li>
    <li> the product makes me look washed out.  it has a white base with a pink undertone.  Not what I expected and cannot even use the product.</li>
    <li> There are very little to no sunscreens I can use on my face... until this one.  The titanium dioxide works well to block out the sun while leaving my skin feeling great.  True, with all titanium products you have to rub it in, but this is the most coverage with the least amount of &#x27;rub-in&#x27; I have found. And I do not feel greasy or have a break-out after wearing this, it actually helps to clear up my skin.</li>
    <li> I cant use product with spf makes my skin oily right after I put it on. Makes my makeup look terrible. I about gave up trying to find a sun protection. I found this on amazon and decided to give it a try, works great. Yes it has a little white tone but I find it tones down the redness on my face and it doesnt make my face oily. You dont need to use very much. I am just now purchasing another bottle, lasted about a year. Please keep making this product.                                    Thanks Peggy</li>
    <li> I bought the whole Rosaclear set together from my dermatologist, and the only thing out of it that I still use is the cleanser.  This product feels a little heavy when I put it on, so I tend to avoid it unless I will be out in the sun a lot (my derm gave it to me for daily use, which just isn&#x27;t happening).  Normally sunscreen makes me break out horribly. This one causes minor breakouts, but is not nearly as bad as most of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I pretty much expect it now and am still on the lookout for a sunscreen that won&#x27;t have this effect.  Also, it&#x27;s not great for very high sun exposure (sitting on the beach or by the pool), as I find I will burn and have to go for something that lasts a little better.  In summary, too heavy for daily use, and not strong enough for high exposure, so... not good for much.</li>

This product cakes on your face even before you get a chance to smooth it on. The green tint and sun block protection leave a white film making this product totally unwearable.</li>
    <li> this product is the best for the sunblock. I&#x27;ve used it for years. It is the best</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi Rosaclear Skin Balancing Sun Protection for over a year now. I really love the difference it has made on my skin. Prior to using this product my skin was not smooth and radiant, although I was using other products and taking very good care of my skin. Before use, I place a small amount on my finger tips and vigorously rub them together to warm the product up. I then apply to my face and neck. I would not be without Obagi Rosaclear!</li>
    <li> Great product. Good service. Would repeat. I like Obagi products, especially the ones produced for Rosacea.  They seem to help.</li>
    <li> Have sensitive skin with rosacia. The only sunscreen that I can wear every day and not break my face out</li>
    <li> Ive used other obagi products but this one works the best for my medium fair sensitive skin.  No break outs and good protection. I like that its lightly tinted too</li>
