      <li>It&#x27;s light weight.</li>
      <li>Great product, only oil I will use on my curly hair.</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY!!     </li>
      <li>Wish BG would offer this in larger, more economical sizes.</li>
      <li>Makes my curly hair soft and frizz free.  </li>
      <li>Most especially when blow drying.</li>
      <li>If it does, you have to be using way too much product!  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, but I can too understand how someone not used to essential oils would not appreciate it as much.</li>
      <li>My hair stays under control and looks shiny and healthy all day long.  </li>
      <li>I then switched to pure Jojoba oil but still had to use another product like Frederick Fekai Glossing Creme plus a styling paste.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it&#x27;ll grease up your hair.  </li>
      <li>Because I have so much hair, I do use a lot of product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you put on...</li>
      <li>sometimes 2 on a really humid day.  </li>
      <li>I have grey curly hair and have struggled over the years to find a product that lives up to the claims of frizz free.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to see it here on Amazon and for even a bit less than from the manufacture website.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and definitely frizz free.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Use sparingly as it is highly concentrated.</li>
      <li>A  few drops goes a long way in taming any frizz  due to  weather, etc........... Great product !</li>
      <li>People often think I have thick hair, I don&#x27;t - it&#x27;s very fine, but very dense.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Kiehl&#x27;s Creme with Silk Groom for years, but still always had to use a couple more products to tame my hair.</li>
      <li>if ordered directly from BG  - the price is high for the amount I use    </li>
      <li>Once my hair is blow dried with a roller brush, my hair looks so healthy, soft and smooth without looking greasy or weighed down.</li>
      <li>oh so soft!  </li>
      <li>I wash/style my hair everyday and go through a 1 ounce bottle easily within a month.</li>
      <li>It used to take me so much work to calm it down, and seeing as I am not a morning person, I would often just throw my hair in a ponytail and go.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I us d it.  </li>
      <li>So over all,  + It works on my hair like no other!    </li>
      <li>I have seen a lot of comments on the smell, but you have to remember that this is not the typical chemical/fragrance filled hair serum that you would find in your local drugstore.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s weird how this product made my hair static!</li>
      <li>My hair is slightly ethnic and I highly recommend to all my high frizz gal pals.</li>
      <li>I apply a leave in conditioner, then 4-5 drops of this stuff and work through my ends first, then work some a few inches up from there.</li>
      <li>first off, I have waist-length hair that is fairly thick and has a natural wave.</li>
      <li>It keep my curls soft and definitely changed the texture of my hair which was extremely dry</li>

<li> I use the serum on my towel-dried hair and then blow dry.</li>
<li> If I don&#x27;t use any product in my hair, it is dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> BTW I have dry frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I part my hair in the middle, rub 6-7 drops into my hands and apply it to half of my hair, concentrating on the hair ends.</li>
<li> For the skeptics out there, I started smelling it when I wet my hair in the shower, before I put any shampoo/conditioner or anything, I did not change any products that I use</li>

<li> I do this for wearing my hair curly or if I blow dry with a round brush then straighten.</li>
<li> I have very long, thick, frizzy, dry hair.  </li>
<li> This oil did an average job of de-frizzing my hair.</li>
<li> Living in Florida with thick hair, it&#x27;s a daily struggle to keep my hair under control in the summertime.  </li>
<li> My friend has very thin straight waist length hair, and had thrown some on her hands and worked it from root to tip.</li>
<li> If you put on too little, it clusters in clumps and parts look greasy, and other parts look fluffy.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t notice the scent once my hair is dried.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy, but still conditions the ends</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Helps with frizzies, smells good, &amp; hydrates my hair.</li>
    <li> This product it&#x27;s absolutley amazing. You only need about 2 drops and makes your hair free of frizz and shiny and smells great!</li>
    <li> The man in the house loves this stuff. He has longish, thick, slightly curly hair and uses this oil to maintain a frizz-free look without having his hair looks greasy or too slick.</li>
    <li> I love this product for blow drying my hair.  I have very long, thick, frizzy, dry hair.  This oil helps fight frizz and lock in the moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It definitely lives up to its promise to fight frizz.  My hair holds up both curly and when straightened. Bonus - nice fruity scent.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before!! I don&#x27;t know what it is but I&#x27;ve used other brands of oils for the hair and nothing works like this.  It keep my curls soft and definitely changed the texture of my hair which was extremely dry and now it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair oil I&#x27;ve tried; and I&#x27;ve tried many.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy, but still conditions the ends and I have no frizz.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Ipsy bag in May 2014.  Living in Florida with thick hair, it&#x27;s a daily struggle to keep my hair under control in the summertime.  After drying and styling, I take 3-4 drops on my fingertips and run it through my hair - you don&#x27;t need any more!  My hair stays under control and looks shiny and healthy all day long.  I absolutely love this oil!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, thick hair or frizzy hair (or all three like me) buy this product!  I have tried everything out there for my locks and have not come across a better product!  For those who said it made their hair smell, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s this product.  This product smells great!  i think it smells like a honey lemon smell.  It does NOT make your hair greasy at all!  If it does, you have to be using way too much product!  I have used this product after towel drying my hair.  It is never frizzy nor greasy.  I have also used this product after blow drying my hair and it keeps the friz and fly aways at bay!  Great product to use on humid days.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil I´ve ever tried for my hair.... It is better than MOrrocan Oil... It is just great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. The oil is thick, and when put on your hair doesn&#x27;t spread around at all. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you put on... If you put on too much, you are left with greasy roots, and fluffy ends (or stringy ends). If you put on too little, it clusters in clumps and parts look greasy, and other parts look fluffy. This is terrible stuff, and it smells very earthy and unpleasant. I received this as a gift, hopefully I can find someone who never has greasy hair to give this to. Seriously, only try this on a day when you aren&#x27;t going anywhere, and have the time to re-wash your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Don&#x27;t use too much or it&#x27;ll grease up your hair.  Seriously, just 1-3 drops and you&#x27;re good to go (I have long hair and often only use 2 drops).  My fiance has shoulder length hair and he uses a drop...sometimes 2 on a really humid day.  You stick to this and you&#x27;ll be a happy, frizz free camper.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this stuff!!  It&#x27;s my holy grail hair product. I have stopped looking for better products because THIS is it! I have tried countless products (including Moroccan Argon oil) and have wasted so much money on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work on my hair. first off, I have waist-length hair that is fairly thick and has a natural wave. My everyday style is to straighten it with a flat iron. If I don&#x27;t use any product in my hair, it is dry and frizzy. I used to use Kiehl&#x27;s Creme with Silk Groom for years, but still always had to use a couple more products to tame my hair. I then switched to pure Jojoba oil but still had to use another product like Frederick Fekai Glossing Creme plus a styling paste. I used this combo for years and thought it was the best solution, until I was introduced to Balance Guru&#x27;s No Frizz (sample received in an Ipsy bag). OMG this stuff is wonderful! I use the serum on my towel-dried hair and then blow dry. Because I have so much hair, I do use a lot of product. I part my hair in the middle, rub 6-7 drops into my hands and apply it to half of my hair, concentrating on the hair ends. I repeat on the other side. Then I use another 4-5 drops for the middle &amp; back sections of hair. Once my hair is blow dried with a roller brush, my hair looks so healthy, soft and smooth without looking greasy or weighed down. The product&#x27;s scent is refreshing. I can&#x27;t quite describe it, but it might be the lemon grass. I don&#x27;t notice the scent once my hair is dried. I really love No Frizz, but I consider it pricey for the amount I need to use. I wash/style my hair everyday and go through a 1 ounce bottle easily within a month. Wish BG would offer this in larger, more economical sizes. So over all,  + It works on my hair like no other!    + Eliminates frizz and makes my hair oh so soft!  + Organic ingredients  + Smells great  + easy-to-use dropper bottle that stays clean  +Nice packaging if ordered directly from BG  - the price is high for the amount I use    Recommended? ABSOLUTELY!!     UPDATE 12/2014: I just gave a bottle to my SIL and she has fallen in love with it, too! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Works wonders for curly hair!</li>
    <li> A  few drops goes a long way in taming any frizz  due to  weather, etc........... Great product !</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and keeps the frizz at bay.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It was given to me by a friend who had gotten it in her Ipsy bag, and wasn&#x27;t a fan. Just like any hair product, you can&#x27;t expect it to have the same results for all hair types. My friend has very thin straight waist length hair, and had thrown some on her hands and worked it from root to tip. Made her look like a grease ball. I on the other hand, have curly hair and this stuff worked like a dream for me. With any oil, I would not suggest applying to your roots, unless you are deep conditioning your hair. I apply a leave in conditioner, then 4-5 drops of this stuff and work through my ends first, then work some a few inches up from there. I do this for wearing my hair curly or if I blow dry with a round brush then straighten. I have AMAZING results. Most especially when blow drying. My hair is soft, shiny, and definitely frizz free. I have seen a lot of comments on the smell, but you have to remember that this is not the typical chemical/fragrance filled hair serum that you would find in your local drugstore. This stuff is all organic, and only gets its scent from the oils in the product. I love the smell, but I can too understand how someone not used to essential oils would not appreciate it as much. So, in short, all you curly girls, go get you some!!</li>
    <li> This oil did an average job of de-frizzing my hair. The oil itself doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor, it smells like eucalyptus and did not have an odor when I put it in my hair. BUT once I wet my hair after having it in for a day it made my hair smell really bad, like something had died and rotted in my hair. It was awful, I do not recommend this to anyone. For the skeptics out there, I started smelling it when I wet my hair in the shower, before I put any shampoo/conditioner or anything, I did not change any products that I use so I am 100% sure it was the oil that made my hair stink.</li>
    <li> I received a small bottle of this in an ipsy bag. I was dying to get more and wasn&#x27;t easy to find. I was glad to see it here on Amazon and for even a bit less than from the manufacture website. It is great smelling and really really fights frizz. My hair is slightly ethnic and I highly recommend to all my high frizz gal pals. Use sparingly as it is highly concentrated. It&#x27;s the BEST of all the hair oils ive tried and I&#x27;ve tried em all!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product.  Best oil I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I have grey curly hair and have struggled over the years to find a product that lives up to the claims of frizz free.  This is that product.  I received this product in a kit that I purchased from Costco.  I was pleasantly surprised when I us d it.  It&#x27;s light weight. Smells pleasant.  Makes my curly hair soft and frizz free.  I will buy again however It is pricey for the amount I use on my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird how this product made my hair static! (I use a wooden comb!) Also didn&#x27;t notice anything if I add a 1-4 drops I don&#x27;t notice anything, when I increase the drops it greases my hair! I tried many method like sectioning my hair during application, but still no change in the results. BTW I have dry frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> this stuff is THE WORST. Made my hair so greasy. if you want pin-straight hair that won&#x27;t do anything and that &amp;#34;haven&#x27;t washed your hair in 2 weeks&amp;#34; look then this is the product for you! ugh. Save yourself the trouble and buy Moroccan Oil.</li>
    <li> Great product, only oil I will use on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> People often think I have thick hair, I don&#x27;t - it&#x27;s very fine, but very dense.  Which means, I have a LOT of unruly frizz!  It used to take me so much work to calm it down, and seeing as I am not a morning person, I would often just throw my hair in a ponytail and go.  This product has changed everything.  A couple drops and my hair is nice and smooth.  I like to use it twice a day - once after washing (I wash my hair before bed), and once when styling.  LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair completely smooth and frizz free for a fraction of the cost of a keratin treatment!</li>
    <li> I like this product but the smell is strong ..thats the only issue, but it works great :)</li>
