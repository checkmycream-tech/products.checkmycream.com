      <li>These things look good in concept, but believe me, they aren&#x27;t worth the money...</li>

      <li>The curlers were nice but the first day i got them i put them in my hair with the hair wand</li>

      <li>they work just fine.</li>
      <li>These curlers are easy to put in and are great for just above the shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>However, I am definitely excited to see how my curls turn out.</li>
      <li>, they all bought it , I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>The hook was super cheap</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect to see that super curly hair as like cover page blond hair girl</li>
      <li>got here quick and is just as it said.</li>
      <li>The package includes all diffferent lengths so depending on your needs, you may need to get some more to get all the same amount of curls.</li>
      <li>interested in hair &amp; make up!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like this product!  </li>
      <li>The product may be great for those with short hair, but it is currently listed as good for long hair, and that is simply untrue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out for locks of love, so my hair is really long.  </li>
      <li>She was very upset to learn that it did not work.  </li>
      <li>It is actually really convenient.   </li>
      <li>It is much easier to watch video  than reading the instruction.  </li>
      <li>because they were much cheaper than the trademarked Curlformers.</li>
      <li>So very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>but they looked like they would work reasonably well.  </li>
      <li>And the product image shows curlers that are much longer than I received as well.  </li>
      <li>The stick broke, and it didn&#x27;t even really stay together to begin with, and one of the curlers broke as soon as i opened the package.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We  noticed a same product with a free fringe clip and cheaper price on  sale.</li>
      <li>In a family full of asian ladies with mid-length straight hair, it was a hit.  </li>
      <li>only compliant is that there aren&#x27;t better guidelines or directions of which direction to put the curls in to give a different look.</li>
      <li>Only purchase if you hair is above your shoulders or you won&#x27;t get to use most of the rollers in the package.</li>

      <li>I would not recommend this product and rarely leave comments about such items but felt as if I needed to.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving 3 stars only because I was expecting curlers that would have been able to curl hair as long as the package picture othwerwise</li>

      <li>I was excited to try this product, but as I was assembling the wand, it snapped, as other reviewers have noted.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed is the \\&quot;directions\\&quot; on the back of the box.</li>
      <li>My 12 year old daughter wanted this.  </li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way to use this without the wand.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d get really nice curls that aren&#x27;t super crazy the next day.  </li>
      <li>I ordered for my 10 year old daughter who has long straight hair.  </li>
      <li>The product package shows someone whose hair is MUCH, MUCH too long to use the curlers that I received.  </li>
      <li>Spring for real Curlformers where you can get a whole package of longer length and don&#x27;t waste your money like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You just need to loosen the curls a little bit with the fingers if you want a more messy look.    </li>
      <li>My daughter didn&#x27;t complain about being uncomfortable sleeping and results in morning were nice a big wavy spiral curls.  </li>
      <li>The next defect is incredibly apparent</li>
      <li>I am a smart shopper and don&#x27;t always believe that \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; but in this case, I got two packages of cheap plastic crap that I paid way too much for!</li>

<li> already have flat and curly + professional flat iron total of three&lt;br</li>
<li> I would love to find thicker ones and another package as she has very thick hair!</li>
<li> No way could I have kept them in long enough to actually see if they worked.</li>
<li> I discovered that if you put this on while your hair is still damp, the hair just has this natural curl to it after about half an hour.   </li>
<li> My daughters hair is fairly thin and we barely had enough in 2 packages to do her whole head.</li>
<li> None of the curlers were remotely 13\\&quot; even unrolled, and the longest curlers had only THREE twists.  </li>
<li> Each package contained drastically different numbers of each length of curler, and the length was not consistent within a color either.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried wet, but It came the way I expected.  </li>
<li> I just received my order and got what I expected</li>
<li> Just bought this product for a little something different to do to my hair with little work.</li>
<li> I bought two packages, and each package had several curlers that were broken where the mesh meets the rim at the ends, and each package also had several where the rim at the end was fused shut!</li>
<li> when you open the plastic package the curlers are sealed in--there is a very strong chemical smell, so bad and so overpowering that I got 1/4 of one package in my hair and had to take them out because I was getting a headache and feeling nauseated.</li>
<li> Hard lesson for a child but necessary</li>
<li> Unfortunately the 2 packages I received has mixed lengths and all were too short for my hair.</li>
<li> We did practice on her hair when it was dry to see how wand and curlers worked and it is actually much easier/less painful to pull hair through when it is wet.</li>
<li> I would recommend these to anyone looking for a little pizzazz in their hairstyle.</li>
<li> A few fell out because of her shorter hair in the nape of her neck.</li>
<li> It took her about few minutes  to watch the youtube video (search curlformers and find  \\&quot;wunderwoman910\\&quot;).</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> And the image shows longer pink curlers that have around six or seven twists at least.  </li>
<li> I have past shoulder length hair</li>
<li> Also ripped hair out because it was hard plastic.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The curlers were nice but the first day i got them i put them in my hair with the hair wand and it broke if you are going to get item get and extra hair wand</li>
    <li> I bought these based on a misleading listing and great reviews.  I did not actually get to \\&quot;use\\&quot; them but they looked like they would work reasonably well.  But only if you have short hair!!!  The product package shows someone whose hair is MUCH, MUCH too long to use the curlers that I received.  And the product image shows curlers that are much longer than I received as well.  I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out for locks of love, so my hair is really long.  I knew, of course, that there would be curlers in the box that were too short---that&#x27;s why I bought three packages to get enough of the longer ones.  Somewhere on the product page it says there are 13\\&quot; ones.  And the image shows longer pink curlers that have around six or seven twists at least.  My package contained none of the above.  None of the curlers were remotely 13\\&quot; even unrolled, and the longest curlers had only THREE twists.  Instead of the three sizes pictured, they were all 2-3 twists.  I am in the process of returning them now (Amazon customer service has been great about that return so far).  Perhaps my packages were defects, but buyer beware.  The product may be great for those with short hair, but it is currently listed as good for long hair, and that is simply untrue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an interest combo choice. I initially purchase this for the hair roller; however, I end up liking both items shipped to me! I recommend you to give both products a try!</li>
    <li> These rollers work so good.  I use them on my 7 year old and it makes her hair perfect spirals and she can sleep in them with no problems.  I would love to find thicker ones and another package as she has very thick hair!</li>
    <li> Great curler!  In a family full of asian ladies with mid-length straight hair, it was a hit.  Very good for end curls.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a little pizzazz in their hairstyle.</li>
    <li> Great product and Great combo at a very reasonable price! Good deal, and the roller works like a charm! I would suggest you to go over the instruction before using it for the best effect! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product came in a damaged box, I ordered two sets and only one came with the hook.  The hook was super cheap and I was not pleased with any of it at all!!!</li>
    <li> I just received my order and got what I expected (I read the reviews before buying). The curlers are definitely for shorter hair, maybe shoulder length, so do not go by the blonde girl on the front of the box. However, I am definitely excited to see how my curls turn out. Just bought this product for a little something different to do to my hair with little work.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to using a curling iron to get some waves and volume in my hair.   I discovered that if you put this on while your hair is still damp, the hair just has this natural curl to it after about half an hour.   When I want to have curls for the weekend, I put this on after shampooing my hair at night.   You&#x27;d get really nice curls that aren&#x27;t super crazy the next day.  It is actually really convenient.   You just need to loosen the curls a little bit with the fingers if you want a more messy look.    I really like this product!  It is a great alternative to using a curling iron.  It keeps my hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was planning to buy some hair roller at amazon and we  came across a review from a \\&quot;Mom_2_4_boyz \\&quot;kathy\\&quot; who purchased \\&quot;Hair  Rollers - high-speed changing hair curlers Styling Rollers\\&quot;.  We  noticed a same product with a free fringe clip and cheaper price on  sale. So we decided to give it a try.  It took her about few minutes  to watch the youtube video (search curlformers and find  \\&quot;wunderwoman910\\&quot;). It showing tips for wrapping the hair, pulling the  curlers out and shaping the curl. It is much easier to watch video  than reading the instruction.  My gf love this productI  By the way, we received 18 rollers instead of 16 rollers, which we are  not going to complain about it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried wet, but It came the way I expected.  The product was in perfect condition, everything they told it would come with was there.  Now I just need to try, and make my curls &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> This is really great curly hair roller!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m interested in hair &amp; make up!&lt;br /&gt;I already have flat and curly + professional flat iron total of three&lt;br /&gt;and I tired bunch of hair roller before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I purchased this product just for fun and try some different style without damaging hair and saving time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m asian so my hair is very thick and heavy so I didn&#x27;t expect to see that super curly hair as like cover page blond hair girl&lt;br /&gt;but I saw the curly hair after I used this roller lol&lt;br /&gt;I rolled my hair before I go to bed and next morning&lt;br /&gt;my hair curled perfectly ! and it stays forever lol&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t spray my hair but it stays ..&lt;br /&gt;it is great product&lt;br /&gt;all of my friends who saw my curly hair , they all bought it , I&#x27;m pretty sure&lt;br /&gt;hahaha</li>
    <li> I have to agree with another reviewer about the length of these rollers.  It is mainly for shoulder length hair (or maybe a bit longer).  The rollers are easy to put on in my opinion and the end result is great.  The package includes all diffferent lengths so depending on your needs, you may need to get some more to get all the same amount of curls.</li>
    <li> got here quick and is just as it said. works great I&#x27;m pleased got it quick too very happy Thanks</li>
    <li> These are the easiest and neatest curlers I have ever used. My daughters hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls, but with these curlers the hold the curls all day.</li>
    <li> These things look good in concept, but believe me, they aren&#x27;t worth the money... I got 3 of them into my hair, and then Snap!  The stick broke, and it didn&#x27;t even really stay together to begin with, and one of the curlers broke as soon as i opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and I didn&#x27;t even recieve the &#x27;dariya japan hair/fringe grip magic clip&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions on the back of the package are mispelled, and the grammar is horrible... I couldn&#x27;t even understand what the instructions were talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, these things are a jip.  Don&#x27;t even bother with them, go get some actual curlers, that WILL work.</li>
    <li> If I could give these no stars, I would. If I hadn&#x27;t waited to open them until now, when the return period is expired, I&#x27;d have returned them as well. The first thing I noticed is the \\&quot;directions\\&quot; on the back of the box. They are completely worthless, written in very poor English, so poor that it&#x27;s impossible to make out what they mean. I had to watch videos on YouTube to figure out how to use them. The next defect is incredibly apparent when you open the plastic package the curlers are sealed in--there is a very strong chemical smell, so bad and so overpowering that I got 1/4 of one package in my hair and had to take them out because I was getting a headache and feeling nauseated. No way could I have kept them in long enough to actually see if they worked. I bought two packages, and each package had several curlers that were broken where the mesh meets the rim at the ends, and each package also had several where the rim at the end was fused shut! Each package contained drastically different numbers of each length of curler, and the length was not consistent within a color either. I am a smart shopper and don&#x27;t always believe that \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; but in this case, I got two packages of cheap plastic crap that I paid way too much for!</li>
    <li> I purchased [[ASIN:B003YTMG5Q WSWS - Hair Rollers - high-speed changing hair curlers Styling Rollers (16 Hair Rollers)]] because they were much cheaper than the trademarked Curlformers. Unfortunately the 2 packages I received has mixed lengths and all were too short for my hair. I have past shoulder length hair and my ends were still sticking out and 1\\&quot; or 2\\&quot; at the end of the longest rollers in the box which may have been about 6 or so. Otherwise these would have been great. Only purchase if you hair is above your shoulders or you won&#x27;t get to use most of the rollers in the package. Spring for real Curlformers where you can get a whole package of longer length and don&#x27;t waste your money like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 3 stars only because I was expecting curlers that would have been able to curl hair as long as the package picture othwerwise they work just fine.</li>
    <li> the item was advertised as 16pcs. I only rcvd 10 pcs. Not getting what I paid for.  So very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work but then again it was too good to be true . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> These curlers are easy to put in and are great for just above the shoulder length hair. Be warned though- you will need more than one pack of curlers. My daughters hair is fairly thin and we barely had enough in 2 packages to do her whole head. The curls are cute though.</li>
    <li> I used these for my 4yr who still has her baby hair. It&#x27;s about shoulder length and very thin. These were easy to put in and my daughter slept well with them in. A few fell out because of her shorter hair in the nape of her neck. They were easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only compliant is that there aren&#x27;t better guidelines or directions of which direction to put the curls in to give a different look. I have already recommended them to family and friends</li>
    <li> Wand broke after second use. Also could not get hair through curlers. Difficult product to use. Also did not receive extra product. Will not buy anything else from this company. Very angry customer.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, but as I was assembling the wand, it snapped, as other reviewers have noted.  As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way to use this without the wand.  I would have been happy to pay a bit more for a product that I could actually use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter wanted this.  She paid for this item with her own money.  She was very upset to learn that it did not work.  Hard lesson for a child but necessary, I guess.  I would not recommend this product and rarely leave comments about such items but felt as if I needed to.</li>
    <li> These work well, but I have alot of hair, you would need two packages to get all your hair curled.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the wand didn&#x27;t almost break when snapping it together.  Wand is essential - can&#x27;t use curlers without it.  I ordered for my 10 year old daughter who has long straight hair.  We had best results when used on wet hair before going to bed.  My daughter didn&#x27;t complain about being uncomfortable sleeping and results in morning were nice a big wavy spiral curls.  We did practice on her hair when it was dry to see how wand and curlers worked and it is actually much easier/less painful to pull hair through when it is wet.</li>
    <li> cheap, the package looked sketchy and the product was flacky and broke easily. Also ripped hair out because it was hard plastic.</li>
    <li> These probably work ok... they are too short for my hair, even the longest length would require 2 to get to the bottom of my hair. Also, the coils aren&#x27;t finished very well, they&#x27;ve got plastic on the ends, but some of them have jagged, not smooth looking edges. Some are even sealed shut. I think I&#x27;ll try the ACTUAL product that this product is knocking off and see if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
