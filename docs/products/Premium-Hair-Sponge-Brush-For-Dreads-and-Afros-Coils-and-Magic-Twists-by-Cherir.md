      <li>Great, simple product - gives my husband the style he&#x27;s looking for with his hair.  </li>
      <li>I remember the day I starter my original set.</li>
      <li>The finished product was neatly sectioned twists that I was able to achieve in a fraction of the time and expense of my first lock twisting appointment.</li>
      <li>It is kind of like a high top fade,only short and curly at the top.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>I received this product at a discounted price for my true and unbiased opinion and review.</li>
      <li>Not bad, gets the job done,Nice hold</li>
      <li>what I noticed about this particular sponge is that you don&#x27;t have to force the coils the come very quickly and easy.</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>This really worked great for given me a different textured look for my 4C hair.</li>
      <li>When I first saw the Cherir premium  hair sponge I thought to myself that it was too good to be true but with such reseasonable pricing I knew that it would be worth a try.</li>
      <li>I have by far fell in LOVE with the results of the Cherir hair sponge.</li>
      <li>My review is based 100% on my own personal experience with the product.</li>
      <li>me more time to do other things in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a fraction of the price then the ones at the beauty supply store and have a better grip.</li>
      <li>I love how the coils are more rounded to give you that neat dread look as a posed to other brands (that we have both tested)</li>
      <li>This seems to work better then most of the other brushes out there.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In order to achieve this style, you have to use a sponge and the sponge will curl your hair when moved in the right</li>
      <li>it right up for you.</li>
      <li>This tool works best on hair that is only slightly damp.</li>
      <li>The sponge by Cherir is very effective at creating a similar look without taking the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Material started to break first day of use</li>
      <li>Longer hair might not give as consistent of a result.</li>
      <li>I first washed my hair.</li>
      <li>I got him the Prmium Hair Sponge Brush by Merlite and he was able to not only get the look he desired</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried so many different products I&#x27;ve lost count, he either doesn&#x27;t like the texture it leaves his hair or</li>
      <li>But no matter how many times I say it isn&#x27;t new, my 9 year old insists that it is.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This sponge is easy to use and even with his longer 5in hair it only takes about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>No need to spend too much money on th ingd like Nudred.</li>
      <li>My son really likes this hair sponge...</li>
      <li>This sponge really defines my curl pattern.</li>
      <li>You can also put the butter or a conditioner straight on the sponge and get results</li>
      <li>I actually received mine free as a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on the experience I had using this sponge and the results we achieved.</li>
      <li>The sponge is very sturdy and will not bend with the pressure of rubbing it on your head.</li>
      <li>Price point was reasonable.</li>
      <li>While this works, it is also very time consuming.</li>
      <li>Nice and firm.</li>
      <li>:)) When I first received, I notice a slight tear in it.</li>
      <li>If his hair was shorter I&#x27;m sure it would have taken even less time.</li>
      <li>So simple and quick and</li>
      <li>It took some false starts to figure out the process, which is wide, circular strokes, but it makes perfect curls and twists.</li>
      <li>When I first received it I was excited and opened it up right away and decided to give it a try on my son&#x27;s (dry) hair just to see what if anything would happen and as I already expected nothing really happened</li>
      <li>Was a bit surprised by the size... a bit large.</li>
      <li>My son has beautiful curly hair but it gets very frizzy and the curl loses its definition in places and he ends up looking a mess.</li>
      <li>At first he thought it was more of a joke because his hair is always looking somewhat nappy, but I ensured him I was serious about it and not kidding around at all.</li>
      <li>It should last pretty well, depending on the amount of usage, as he carries it around everywhere</li>
      <li>As you can see in the video my friend is natural and her hair is</li>
      <li>I have natural hair.</li>
      <li>The holes are smaller on this sponge than on some others I&#x27;ve seen which really helps make a nice tight curl or dread if you do it long enough.</li>
      <li>reading this a laugh I called in my 15 year old daughter and asked her to give it a try because she had watched a few of the videos with me.</li>
      <li>Such a cool little styling product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works wonderful. helps if u have curl gel in ur hair. also do not press hard when using this, go is soft circular motion. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
    <li> Works great for short hair twist.</li>
    <li> This item i found to be better than others i have used.  The foam compared to the others remained in tact.  Would/ Have recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Great arm exercise</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:253a2b3d190586e90501cd1c52b02334]] I have by far fell in LOVE with the results of the Cherir hair sponge. This is actually my second one that I have ever purchased. As you can see in the video my friend is natural and her hair is short,(She let me use her to show you all the results)and what I noticed about this particular sponge is that you don&#x27;t have to force the coils the come very quickly and easy. I love how the coils are more rounded to give you that neat dread look as a posed to other brands (that we have both tested) that left our hair with a pointed look on the tips. The sponge is very sturdy and will not bend with the pressure of rubbing it on your head. I hope that this video demonstration was helpful to you and I honestly an truly feel that this is a great investment for natural hair. It gives your hair versatility and the ability to try something different on your hair. Hands down the best hair sponge I have. Invest in your hair by getting Premium hair sponge by Cherir. I received this product at a discounted price for my true and unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> Great for short hair bad for long hair.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9f3aea6de1f6189c4b9fc0adc58b548c]]There is. New hair trend called the CRUDDY. Well it&#x27;s really not new, I remember guys when I was in high school in the 90s having the style. It is kind of like a high top fade,only short and curly at the top. But no matter how many times I say it isn&#x27;t new, my 9 year old insists that it is.&lt;br /&gt;In order to achieve this style, you have to use a sponge and the sponge will curl your hair when moved in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;My son thought any sponge would do and it looked a frightful mess. I got him the Prmium Hair Sponge Brush by Merlite and he was able to not only get the look he desired but he was able to do it BY HIMSELF -giving me more time to do other things in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a fraction of the price then the ones at the beauty supply store and have a better grip. The 1 year guarantee is great because normally sponges wear out after a couple of days and it&#x27;s just like throwing money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I like the hair sponge and it serves it&#x27;s purpose for the most part.  However, I thought the holes would be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Before this purchase I was looking at buying the Nudread hair sponge, but they were about 40 dollars, no good. My sons and myself used this sponge and it works awesome. If you&#x27;re reading this review that means you&#x27;re thinking about buying this hair sponge. I only have one piece of advice don&#x27;t think about it, do it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product works great very durable also can&#x27;t be happy enough</li>
    <li> I had no idea that a sponge could be a styling tool. The Merite Premium Hair Sponge is designed to smooth and create curls, and also groom dreads. It took some false starts to figure out the process, which is wide, circular strokes, but it makes perfect curls and twists. I didn&#x27;t have any dreads to try it on, but I can see how the concept would work. And you&#x27;d think it would come apart in the process, but it really is a tough little number, and hold up well to repeated uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and hair enlightenment are my own.</li>
    <li> This hair sponge is great for creating twists and dreads in naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have created twists in my son&#x27;s hair through manually twisting sections with my fingers. While this works, it is also very time consuming. The sponge by Cherir is very effective at creating a similar look without taking the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a YouTube video to determine how to use the sponge which was helpful. The technique I followed that worked for me was to rub conditioner into his hair and wait 1 minute. Then I rubbed the hole side of the sponge against his head in a circular motion. The longer you rub, the more defined the curls will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is trash and I want a refund</li>
    <li> works great gives hair a nice touch</li>
    <li> Great! Easy to use. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> This hair sponge is a LIFESAVER for us! My son has beautiful curly hair but it gets very frizzy and the curl loses its definition in places and he ends up looking a mess. We&#x27;ve tried so many different products I&#x27;ve lost count, he either doesn&#x27;t like the texture it leaves his hair or just plain doesn&#x27;t work. This sponge is easy to use and even with his longer 5in hair it only takes about 5 minutes. The holes are smaller on this sponge than on some others I&#x27;ve seen which really helps make a nice tight curl or dread if you do it long enough. You can also use the tip your finger to stretch and widen the holes a little if you want the curl less tight, just depends on the style you are going for. We added a little shea butter and let it sit a minute to soak in well and rubbed away in small circular motions moving around his head slowly to give enough time for each section to curl up. If his hair was shorter I&#x27;m sure it would have taken even less time. You can also put the butter or a conditioner straight on the sponge and get results but I wanted to let it sit a minute. The hair gets caught into the holes and the circular motion twists it right up for you. So simple and quick and the results are as good as if he had sat for an hour for me to do it manually. Awesome. The sponge itself is well made and should last us a long time. I would definitely recommend trying one of these if you&#x27;re looking to manage a wild set of locks or switch your style up. Such a cool little styling product. I actually received mine free as a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on the experience I had using this sponge and the results we achieved.</li>
    <li> My son has been growing his hair out for a couple months now and he has been asking for me to do something with it. So when I came across this product I was excited and what made it even better was that I was given the opportunity to receive the Cherir Premium Hair Sponge for free in exchange for my review and honest opinion. So here it goes.....   When I first received it I was excited and opened it up right away and decided to give it a try on my son&#x27;s (dry) hair just to see what if anything would happen and as I already expected nothing really happened so we waited until after shower time and decided to give it another try. Well... After the shower and the normal routine of washing and applying product we sat down and gave the sponge another try well I tried my hardest to get it to show me some kind of result at the rate I was going something would have been better than nothing! I was starting to get frustrated because I read review after review and watched a few videos so I had to be doing something wrong. So I kept trying and just when I started to see little twists forming and continue ahead with the process I somehow made it worse and undid what I started. At this point I needed a break and yes this might give some of you reading this a laugh I called in my 15 year old daughter and asked her to give it a try because she had watched a few of the videos with me. Well she got right to it and within a few mins we started to see it work. It had made very nice, cute, evenly spaced twists. I would say to anyone ready to give up when they don&#x27;t see immediate results to take a step back breathe and then try again because as skeptical as I was this product really does work and does exactly when it claims to do. I would definitely recommend this to others.   *I received this product for free in exchange for my review and honest opinion*</li>
    <li> Cannot get my hair  to twist/coil with this sponge.  I have tried different hair products with it and nothing.</li>
    <li> Does not work like the videos&lt;br /&gt;Spent about 2 hrs to my adult sons hair &amp; still didnt look like the videos &amp; didnt really last for one day!&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointing for him!</li>
    <li> Not bad, gets the job done,Nice hold /grip. Price point was reasonable. Delivered as expected (about 4 days)</li>
    <li> I like the products I finally received  it . I think  it&#x27;s a Little  pricy.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Use big firm circular motions with moisture or gel. Does begin to shed very small particles of foam after usage over time.</li>
    <li> The sponge creates perfect twists all over my hair</li>
    <li> Bought this two months ago, it&#x27;s worked pretty well for a while, however after a couple of months, it&#x27;s starting to break down and leave small little flakes of the sponge in my hair. Not thrilled.</li>
    <li> My son really likes this hair sponge...</li>
    <li> Love this sponge, my son now has curls for the first time!!</li>
    <li> The holes are too big</li>
    <li> Very Happy with my Purchase..!!!</li>
    <li> Great, simple product - gives my husband the style he&#x27;s looking for with his hair.  Note: the product works best with a certain maximum length of hair.  Longer hair might not give as consistent of a result.</li>
    <li> Works Terribly with my twa right noe. Maybe it works better with longer lengths of hair. I didn&#x27;t get my desired texture.</li>
    <li> This really worked great for given me a different textured look for my 4C hair.</li>
    <li> My son loves it, curls for the girls</li>
    <li> I have thick 4c hair...just made my fro chunky,  not curly.&lt;br /&gt;This is for those with fine or thin hair and are pressed for time.  Sturdy.</li>
    <li> Poor hair brush, I&#x27;ve gotten this today and I&#x27;ve been trying to get curls but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Nothing different happened to my hair. I see no change what so ever.</li>
    <li> This product works like a champ!! I can finally have my hair like I want it on the daily basis. Definitely a good buy! :)</li>
    <li> This sponge is great!</li>
    <li> This sponge really defines my curl pattern.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first but this baby works as advertised. I tried growing my hair out before but styling it was such a hassle. Now with this sponge I just hop out the shower, add a little product, and pass the sponge over my head a few times and I&#x27;m good to go.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> Good material. Nice and firm.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premium Hair Sponge / Brush For Dreads &amp; Afros, Coils &amp; Magic Twists by Cherir works great. I&#x27;m a African American woman. This hair sponge is great for creating twists and dreads in naturally curly hair. I have natural hair. My hair is not short and it&#x27;s not very long. I would say it&#x27;s a little past shoulder length. Using this brush was simply.  This tool works best on hair that is only slightly damp. I first washed my hair. I applied a leave-in conditioner.  I used the sponge in a circular motion across my entire head. You can&#x27;t press heavily on your hair and rotate the brush in one direction. The longer you rub the brush on your hair, the more defined curls you will get</li>
    <li> Over a year ago I cut my dreadlocks that I had been growing for 8 years. After growing it out for one year i decided that I wanted to start another set. I remember the day I starter my original set. I had to sit through a hair appointment that lasted approximately 3 hours as my beautician performed the tedious task of twisting each section of hair one by one. When I first saw the Cherir premium  hair sponge I thought to myself that it was too good to be true but with such reseasonable pricing I knew that it would be worth a try. My Cherir premium hair sponge arrived on 7/24/15. Later that night I washed and dried my hair and then began utilizing the  Cherir premium hair sponge to twist my hair back into locks. To my delight it worked! The finished product was neatly sectioned twists that I was able to achieve in a fraction of the time and expense of my first lock twisting appointment. I am a very happy customer and would recommend the Cherir premium hair sponge to anyone who desires to start locks or who simply wants to achieve the &amp;#34;twisted&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> A lot better then I expected to be. This seems to work better then most of the other brushes out there. I got this for a friend as one of his gifts for his birthday. At first he thought it was more of a joke because his hair is always looking somewhat nappy, but I ensured him I was serious about it and not kidding around at all. So he tries it out a few days later and I see him again, his hair wasn&#x27;t the usual semi matted look as he&#x27;s trying to grow an afro at the moment. His hair actually livened up a bunch compared to before, he actually had some lush to his hair the next time around instead of looking a bit dreadful and unmanageable as usual and has appreciated it since.</li>
    <li> This review was actually dictated by my 15 year old son.&lt;br /&gt;Me: What would you rate this hair sponge?  Son: 5-Star&lt;br /&gt;Me: What do you like about it?  Son: Hair twisted a lot faster than other ones.&lt;br /&gt;Me: What&#x27;s different?  Son: Doesn&#x27;t tear easily. Not picking black sponge out of my head afterward.&lt;br /&gt;Me: Any difference when holding it?  Son: Nope. They all made about the same. Maybe a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion:&lt;br /&gt;As I was watching him do his hair, it did appear that the coils were beginning to pop immediately. The picture attached was only after about 15-20 secs, as he was trying to leave to go play basketball. (His ride in the back ground :)) When I first received, I notice a slight tear in it. (see picture). However, this didn&#x27;t affect the intended purpose. The sponge seems to have a nice quality to it. It should last pretty well, depending on the amount of usage, as he carries it around everywhere he goes. I do expect the name to come off soon, just because of the hand placement in order to use it. Overall, I would recommend it and I agree with the 5-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a coupon to buy this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. In no way does this affect my opinion. My review is based 100% on my own personal experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Not really a good product</li>
    <li> Arrived on time - very quickly. Was a bit surprised by the size... a bit large. But it definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> No need to spend too much money on th ingd like Nudred. This works just as well, and twists like a pro</li>
    <li> Not what I expected gonna get the twist brush because this curls my hair too much . Material started to break first day of use never didn&#x27;t know it was a As Seen on TV  product . Not looking forward to purchasing as seen on TV products ago.</li>
    <li> This is truly a premium hair sponge. It Made of very great quality materials. It also extremely durable and the craftsmanship is excellent. The form of the hair sponge is designed to fit nicely in your hand. Very easy to use because of the deign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review of the product. The opinions of the product are based on my experience with and use of the product.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my son hair.  I&#x27;m guessing you must have coarse hair for it to work</li>
