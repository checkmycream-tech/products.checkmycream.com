      <li>Otherwise, they are a nice size and the case is great to protect them.</li>
      <li>Good tweezers, but the case doesn&#x27;t stay together.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and the woman I&#x27;m dating just bought her own pair because she loved mine.  </li>
      <li>They were amazing.  </li>
      <li>A nice addition to a bugout bag or emergency kit.</li>
      <li>The light is perfect, you Don&#x27;t have to twist or turn your head to get the room light</li>
      <li>This mini-tweezer in its own case is so well-designed, and made.</li>
      <li>This compact tweezer is nice and comes with case, if you keep in pocket you won&#x27;t jab yourself.</li>
      <li>Case is a nice touch.  </li>
      <li>And nice to have a case to keep safe.</li>
      <li>I was so happy with the first ones I ordered these.</li>
      <li>The case is nice to have and makes packing it for travel easy and safe (you don&#x27;t have to worry about it puncturing your shampoo accidentally in your dopp kit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They effortlessly are able to grab and hold onto the hair when I tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Not any more.</li>
      <li>Favorite tweezers ever.  </li>
      <li>Just the tweezers I&#x27;ve been looking for, but wish we were able to pick the color of the case.</li>
      <li>So, I think these are going to suit my need much better.</li>
      <li>I like this size better than the longer ones, as I feel they offer a bit more control.</li>
      <li>My favorite tweezers.</li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>I do not think these ones are as good as the first ones.  </li>
      <li>This is sharp and perfect!  </li>
      <li>Comes apart easily.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE these tweezers, nice tight grip at the end and a great carrying case.</li>
      <li>The mirror with light allows the smallest and thinnest of hairs to be seen.</li>
      <li>This is the first pair I have not been satisfied with.</li>
      <li>I read a review where another customer mentioned that Tweezerman products coming from India where not as good as the Italian ones.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I gave a couple out last year to my sisters and they love them as well!</li>
      <li>She is right, the Tweezerman I received are from India and compared to other Tweezerman products they are not as good.</li>
      <li>The tweezers themselves are nice and sharp.</li>
      <li>The case, however, is fragile and comes apart at the hinge pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Great value; works as well as the expensive german kind.</li>
      <li>Combine this with Tweezerman LTD slant tweezers and you get great tools for those white and black hairs that pop up.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem to pull out the super fine hairs like the other ones I have from tweezerman.  </li>
      <li>I got these after buying another pair a few years back and they were great</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure, because mine are very girly pink.</li>
      <li>Easy to use; no problem holding the smaller size, although I do have decent manual dexterity.</li>
      <li>Also easy to dig a hole in skin; got to be careful.</li>
      <li>I looked on the box, and I found the main difference...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>Will probably buy a few more of these.</li>
      <li>rotating part of case looks a lit bit fragile, but strong enough.</li>
      <li>The lifetime sharpening that Tweezerman offers is just an added bonus!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would also stick to the full size tweezers next time, they&#x27;re not that much smaller than the regular sized Tweezerman tweezers.  </li>
      <li>just right to see the hair only to loose it when you reach for the tweezers.</li>
      <li>I tried looking locally for great tweezers that would get those menacing little hairs, reading the packages, tilting them every which way to make sure they closed completely.</li>

<li> Like that the tweezers come with a small plastic cap for the very tip of the tweezers, in addition to the overall case.</li>
<li> They are thin and makes it easier to grab the hair even if the are super short.</li>
<li> I have another set with comes in a case and every single time I pull them out to use, the cap is off.  </li>
<li> I have dispensed with the case and just keep them loose in the drawer.</li>
<li> Bought for my husband then it showed up pink!</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t grab the hair as easily as other tweezers.</li>
<li> it is sharp and well polished, it has convenient size.  </li>

<li> Like the few reviews down, I didn&#x27;t want pink!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands because Tweezerman will not be outdone in this space.  </li>
<li> Grabs those little &amp;#34;barely out of the skin&amp;#34; hairs.</li>
<li> The tweezers are still secure in the base</li>
<li> I recently dropped them tip down on tile and dented them badly.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s just a wee frustrating to hunt in my suitcase of a purse for the cap.  </li>
<li> I hate pink...</li>
<li> Feel disappointed and tricked by the green picture.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> This is sharp and perfect!  Small sized to keep in my drawer and works just like the real size!  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Favorite tweezers ever.  I guard them from my family so they don&#x27;t disappear.</li>
    <li> My favorite tweezers.</li>
    <li> Colors may vary... that&#x27;s for sure, because mine are very girly pink. I hate pink... good tweezers though</li>
    <li> it is well done. I has excellent quality. it is sharp and well polished, it has convenient size.  rotating part of case looks a lit bit fragile, but strong enough. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have had 6 pairs of these and only replaced because I lost them. This is the first pair I have not been satisfied with. They feel like the final polishing/finishing was not done. They do not perform as I have come to expect from tweezerman. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used these to pull a big sliver out of my kids foot. This thing is well built and the case is an added bonus. Will probably buy a few more of these.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t grab the hair as easily as other tweezers. Otherwise, they are a nice size and the case is great to protect them.</li>

    <li> I received a pair of Tweezerman tweezers (Swiss made) about 8 years ago as a gift from my sister.  They were amazing.  I recently dropped them tip down on tile and dented them badly.  I decided to stick with the brand and get these.  Not even close to the same quality.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they work pretty well, but not remotely as well as my old pair despite them being several years old.  I looked on the box, and I found the main difference... These are &amp;#34;Made In India&amp;#34;.  I would also stick to the full size tweezers next time, they&#x27;re not that much smaller than the regular sized Tweezerman tweezers.  Keep shopping!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, exactly as described. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Tweezerman honors all their products and happily keeps your items in perfect condition.</li>

    <li> The tweezers are good but the carry case is horrible.  Comes apart easily.  I would give 5 stars for the tweezers, 1 star for the case.</li>
    <li> I got these after buying another pair a few years back and they were great and I needed some for my purse.  I do not think these ones are as good as the first ones.  They don&#x27;t seem to pull out the super fine hairs like the other ones I have from tweezerman.  I wont spend the money on another pair now.</li>
    <li> This mini-tweezer in its own case is so well-designed, and made. Perfect for travel or purse. Wouldn&#x27;t go on vacation without it! Great price and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Just the tweezers I&#x27;ve been looking for, but wish we were able to pick the color of the case. Like the few reviews down, I didn&#x27;t want pink!</li>

The mirror with light allows the smallest and thinnest of hairs to be seen. I was so happy with the first ones I ordered these. The light is perfect, you Don&#x27;t have to twist or turn your head to get the room light just right to see the hair only to loose it when you reach for the tweezers. I tried looking locally for great tweezers that would get those menacing little hairs, reading the packages, tilting them every which way to make sure they closed completely. I would get them home and they may work for a short time but eventually I&#x27;m out looking for another one. Not any more. I have a travel set, a purse set, and a set in the bathroom. Mr.Tweezeman is my tweezers!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these tweezers, nice tight grip at the end and a great carrying case.</li>
    <li> Good tweezers, but the case doesn&#x27;t stay together.  I have dispensed with the case and just keep them loose in the drawer.</li>

    <li> Great tweezer. And nice to have a case to keep safe.</li>
    <li> Great value; works as well as the expensive german kind. Case is a nice touch.  Tweezerman is a great brand.</li>
    <li> Like so well, I buy them for my friends.</li>
    <li> I think these are going to be perfect in my purse.  I have another set with comes in a case and every single time I pull them out to use, the cap is off.  The tweezers are still secure in the base but it&#x27;s just a wee frustrating to hunt in my suitcase of a purse for the cap.  The &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; on these aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  So, I think these are going to suit my need much better.</li>
    <li> Great stainless-steel product with a convenient carrying and protective case.  A nice addition to a bugout bag or emergency kit.</li>
