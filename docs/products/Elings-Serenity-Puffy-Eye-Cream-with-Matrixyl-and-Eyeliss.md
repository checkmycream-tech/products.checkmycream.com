### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with it!</li>
      <li>I do my best to keep vitamin e oil on my face when I am inside and it also seems to help in conjunction with this cream.</li>
      <li>Whie the product sounded great and the reviews glowing</li>
      <li>and I can see good result.</li>
      <li>am delighted to have found something that works for me.</li>
      <li>but it seems to have made a fairly permanent difference.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>However, I do not allow my lack of melatonin to keep me from my favorite outdoor sport: triathlon.</li>
      <li>I imagine that with continued use, it will work even better as it promises to do.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
      <li>Since I drink alcohol and a lot of coffee, I do not expect better results,</li>
      <li>The texture is light and cooling and disappears into the skin.  </li>
      <li>However, even when applying a tiny drop, the cream itself greatly increased the undereye puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am happy with the product since I have only been using it for almost 2 weeks</li>
      <li>It has this cool feeling once you dab it around your eyebags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will continue to use and re-order this as the product is reasonably priced and has both matrixyl and eyeliss which are both important ingredients for someone with puffiness concerns.</li>
      <li>I still use it most nights, and will definitely keep a tube on hand</li>
      <li>I developed chronic under eye puffiness from allergies and this genuinely cleared it up.</li>
      <li>This is a complete waste of time and more importantly...</li>
      <li>Everything went very well with this purchase</li>
      <li>I have very puffy eyes from allergies and didn&#x27;t think that anything would help.  </li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t absorb particularly well.  </li>
      <li>My wife HIGHLY recommends moving on to try another product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have always had puffy eyes, with one eye particularly more puffy than the other, so its genetic in my case.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, upon my first application of this cream, my undereye areas immediately became even more puffy, so much so that the eye that did not have a bag before now had a bag just as large.</li>
      <li>However, just now I am beginning to notice that these creases no longer are large enough to catch</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say that the puffiness is totally eliminated but certainly is a noticable difference in a month&#x27;s time.  </li>
      <li>but they clear up before lunch time.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not use it.</li>
      <li>and so far no results.</li>
      <li>It is a perfect base for any coverup I use under my eyes.</li>
      <li>but I have tried other products for the sagging skin under my eyes and this has started to work right</li>
      <li>I have very pale skin that is easily damaged by the sun.</li>
      <li>damage due to these infractions include my first ever wrinkles: the under eye creases (I am 28 years old).</li>
      <li>of all the other products I have tried, this eye cream really has surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>I searched on Amazon for \\&quot;puffy eye cream\\&quot; and was reviewing the results comparing ingrediants (my allergies are severe enough to limit even the natural ingrediants I can use)and reviews, when I came across Serenity.</li>
      <li>I tried to give it a shot, having read online that it may take time for eye puffiness to go down, so I applied it for about 5 days in a row, and I made sure to only apply a little tiny bit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have systemic allergies and am in my 40s&#x27;, I thought nothing would help my puffy eyes. I searched on Amazon for \\&quot;puffy eye cream\\&quot; and was reviewing the results comparing ingrediants (my allergies are severe enough to limit even the natural ingrediants I can use)and reviews, when I came across Serenity. Whie the product sounded great and the reviews glowing I was pretty skeptical that such a modestly priced cream could do all it claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I am a skeptic no more. From the first use the night I received it; the results have been dramatic coworkers commented on how rested  I looked the next day. My 79 year old father commented that I looked younger and he doesn&#x27;t notice subtle change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say without hesitation Serenity works wonders for me. I won&#x27;t be without it and I will reccommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for the first time and was anxious to see how it worked for puffiness under the eyes.  Have been using it both at night and in the morning before makeup and find that it is making a difference.  Can&#x27;t say that the puffiness is totally eliminated but certainly is a noticable difference in a month&#x27;s time.  Will continue to use and re-order this as the product is reasonably priced and has both matrixyl and eyeliss which are both important ingredients for someone with puffiness concerns.</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin that is easily damaged by the sun. However, I do not allow my lack of melatonin to keep me from my favorite outdoor sport: triathlon. Despite wearing sunscreen, 2+ hour races in the noon-day sun leaves my skin red. I do usually follow up with a regime of aftercare products, but damage is still being done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The damage due to these infractions include my first ever wrinkles: the under eye creases (I am 28 years old). I tried everything under the sun to get rid of them and nothing worked.... until this cream. I am shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and the creases have definitely gotten lighter (no, they have not disappeared, but I honestly do not expect them to). It used to be that whenever I wore makeup, the foundation would like to settle into these creases and make me look at least 10x as old as I am! However, just now I am beginning to notice that these creases no longer are large enough to catch my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the other products I have tried, this eye cream really has surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I put it on twice each day and don&#x27;t wear makeup unless I have to (i.e. work). I do my best to keep vitamin e oil on my face when I am inside and it also seems to help in conjunction with this cream.</li>
    <li> My eyes were completely swollen after using this product for a few days. If you have sensitive skin, do not use it. Had to request a refund which I received promptly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few weeks. I think it is helping.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my eye baggage unfortunately. It doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
    <li> I have problems with puffy eyes especially during allergy season. Also, I had sagging skin under my eyes that needed firming up. So, I decided to search for a product that would help with this problem. I read the reviews about \\&quot;Elings Serenity Puffy Eye Cream\\&quot; and I decided to order it. I have used it for about 4 weeks now. I use it morning and night. My eyes are no longer puffy and the sagging skin under my eyes has improved - it is firmer than before.  This product works for me. I love it!  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I would like to not exaggerate here but I have tried other products for the sagging skin under my eyes and this has started to work right away.&lt;br /&gt;Although I do not want to reveal my exact age, I am in my fifties, I have an oily complexion, olive skin and not many of wrinkles. I do not have \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under my eyes but there was a bit of sagging skin that needed firming up.&lt;br /&gt;After trying several products with Retinol and also PSF Phyto-Lift Cranberry Eye Gel which is very expensive this product is the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it three times. I put just a dab or a drop in the morning and in the evening before going to bed and I massage it in with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted to have found something that works for me. It does firm up the thin skin around the eyes. I imagine that with continued use, it will work even better as it promises to do.&lt;br /&gt;Skin types are different and this may not work for everyone, but it is definitely a try if you have the same problem I had (notice the had instead of the have?)</li>
    <li> After about a week showed results,  I have been using twice a day and I can safely say I can look in the mirror without saying Ugly,  Since I drink alcohol and a lot of coffee, I do not expect better results,</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.  This is a complete waste of time and more importantly... MONEY !!!!  My wife HIGHLY recommends moving on to try another product</li>
    <li> itchy eyes.. nothing happened except redness and itchiness I don&#x27;t think that was what we were striving for. ugh ugh</li>
    <li> I developed chronic under eye puffiness from allergies and this genuinely cleared it up. I tried a number of other products with caffeine, HA etc that did nothing. I tried tightening serums that did work but dried out my face horribly. It took about a month of using the serenity cream 1-2 times per day but the eye bags are essentially gone now. I occasionally wake up with puffy eyes if I don&#x27;t get enough sleep but they clear up before lunch time. I still use it most nights, and will definitely keep a tube on hand but it seems to have made a fairly permanent difference. And it didn&#x27;t dry out my under eye area like the clay based products did. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t absorb particularly well.  It leaves a greasy feeling residue, which I do believe after 4-5 days of use worsened my puffy eyes.  This wasn&#x27;t due to an allergic reaction.  I&#x27;m giving it one star because while it made the puffiness worse, the skin under my eyes feels slightly firmer.  If anyone has sagging skin/wrinkles around the eye area, which I do not, I imagine that this might help.</li>
    <li> After reading online about the effectiveness of ingredients such as Eyeliss and Matrixyl, I searched Amazon and found Elings Serenity Puffy Eye Cream. I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have always had puffy eyes, with one eye particularly more puffy than the other, so its genetic in my case. Unfortunately, upon my first application of this cream, my undereye areas immediately became even more puffy, so much so that the eye that did not have a bag before now had a bag just as large. I tried to give it a shot, having read online that it may take time for eye puffiness to go down, so I applied it for about 5 days in a row, and I made sure to only apply a little tiny bit. However, even when applying a tiny drop, the cream itself greatly increased the undereye puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it will work for others, and maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time, but with the results I witnessed, enough was enough.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for four days and so far no results. However, I like the texture of the cream. It feels like an expensive cream. It has this cool feeling once you dab it around your eyebags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see after I finish the tube. I will let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today, sept. 15 I saw some changes. My bags are less puffy but not totally gone. I am happy with the product since I have only been using it for almost 2 weeks and I can see good result.</li>
    <li> I started using Serenity some months ago and saw a definite change almost immediately.  I have very puffy eyes from allergies and didn&#x27;t think that anything would help.  The texture is light and cooling and disappears into the skin.  It is a perfect base for any coverup I use under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I hate to review an item with one star, but it didn&#x27;t improve my eye bags a bit after applying it twice a day for two months...</li>
    <li> Everything went very well with this purchase</li>
    <li> This eye cream helps with the puff eyes during the day</li>
