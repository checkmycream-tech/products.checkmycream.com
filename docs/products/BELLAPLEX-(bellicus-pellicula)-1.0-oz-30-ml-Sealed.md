      <li>and it&#x27;s very good</li>
      <li>This is a very good product.  </li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer for post-procedure,  along with being a wonderful moisturizer at any time.  </li>
      <li>excellent item, great value, still using this item, and hopefully will see great results but leaves skin feeling great</li>
      <li>My wife loves this, so I am a happy camper.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working okay !!</li>
      <li>I believe it would have been very effective along with the Hydroxatone Am/pm Anti wrinkle Cream.</li>
      <li>This cream is very effective.  </li>
      <li>I stopped for a year but found my skin didn&#x27;t look as good</li>
      <li>the product itself is good.</li>
      <li>I bought this for years and have been happy with it, but all that I bought this time had a silver top and non of them had a plastic stem</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it again on my own terms paying what I thought to be a fair price.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have tried that is gentle and reduces wrinkles too.</li>
      <li>It hydrates and smooths skin, is very light and not oily.  </li>
      <li>Yes this is a great product it works really well for my skin.</li>
      <li>I was satisfied with this product it delivered results.</li>
      <li>As a moisturizer, it is outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I love bellaplex.  </li>
      <li>but this latest order is the pits.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>...Don&#x27;t buy and don&#x27;t try to rate this product if you have to have so many words to say this product does not work.</li>
      <li>its easy to uplie and seems to be non greasy for my skin.</li>
      <li>I liked this product because it was very gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>It states that it will get rid of fine lines and wrinkles, but the truth is, if you want to do that, you must have surgery or botox, or restaline, or any of those types of products/procedures.  </li>
      <li>I just pulled off the bristles and used the handle as a spatula, worked out fine.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It works well on my fine lines and creases around my mouth if used regularly&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>It gave me blemishes (whiteheads), and did nothing to reduce the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>It is fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>seems they forgot an important part of the pump...</li>
      <li>People say that I look pretty good for my age, which they say looks 10-15 years younger than my 63 years.  </li>
      <li>Seen results within the first week!</li>
      <li>It is all natural and safe for your skin.</li>
      <li>Try 2 months worth</li>
      <li>The price is right, what do you have to lose?</li>
      <li>Luckily, I had an eyebrow, eyelash comb and brush that was ready to throw away.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it:</li>
      <li>This item lasted me for exactly 14 days.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to most anyone, to be used after one of the above procedures.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several months and have seen no improvement in my fine lines.</li>
      <li>and it really makes the wrinkles dissapear.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so most of them not only do not help with reducing the appearance of wrinkles, but the irritate my skin too.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>Like many other people, I have tried numerous wrinkle products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a new type of packaging the pump action doesn&#x27;t work on the 1st 3 tubes tried out of my order, avoid like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it before</li>
      <li>I have used the product direct from the company&lt;</li>
      <li>I have been told that my 67 year old skin looks like a 25 year olds.  </li>
      <li>Too early to determine if it&#x27;s working</li>
      <li>have you got of using it if the pump action doesn&#x27;t&#x27;  </li>
      <li>I have used it around my eyes with no irritation even though I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>at the time of this review, I was 50 years old.</li>
      <li>I am 63 yrs old, and so I am not sure if it gets rid of fine lines on younger skin.  </li>
      <li>I used Bellaplex for years but got tired of so many customer rep changes at their home site and the price never the same.</li>

<li> It stings just a little</li>

<li> Firmly up my face and neck.</li>
<li> No better than less e xpensive brands and the container didn&#x27;t work from the beginning!</li>
<li> For so much money I was disappointed.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s use in conjunction with hydroxatone AM/PM anti-wrinkle complex and hydroxatone age defying toner.</li>
<li> I was not happy with the packaging.  </li>
<li> I used a very thin piece of wood.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and have seen no improvement in my fine lines. I don&#x27;t think it works.</li>
    <li> Bellaplex is one of the few facial products I can use.  It is fragrance free.  It does not iritate my skin and it really makes the wrinkles dissapear.  I can use it under my makeup in the morning or over my makeup in the middle of the day to add a little moisture and it blends well with the makeup either way. I have been told that my 67 year old skin looks like a 25 year olds.  Bellaplex is not the only reason but it is a big factor.</li>
    <li> I have used Bellaplex for about 5 or 6 years now and I will not switch.  People think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am!! Update: at the time of this review, I was 50 years old.</li>
    <li> No better than less e xpensive brands and the container didn&#x27;t work from the beginning! Had to be torn apart and product dug out with a popsicle stick!</li>
    <li> This item lasted me for exactly 14 days. For so much money I was disappointed. I have not repurchased. I believe it would have been very effective along with the Hydroxatone Am/pm Anti wrinkle Cream. I used the amount less than the size of half a lentil pea twice daily. I expected longer use from it. It is obvious that it either leaked or was not 1 oz. I felt cheated indeed.</li>
    <li> This cream is very effective.  I noticed a difference the first time I used it: It hydrates and smooths skin, is very light and not oily.  I have used it around my eyes with no irritation even though I have sensitive skin.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but hate the container....seems they forgot an important part of the pump...so it doesn&#x27;t come out well. They may want to review how the pump works as none of the 4 I purchased work and I have to scrap the product out of the tube with a stick!</li>
    <li> I ordered Bellaplex about 2 weeks ago.  I sent Amazon an email with no  response.  The bottle leaked into its case and about 1/4 of the cream was lost.  I was not happy with the packaging.  I have use what was left but found no positive results.</li>
    <li> the product itself is good. I have used it for years. But my last order only had half the product in it. The third party supplier offered to replace it but I did not want to bother to send it back.</li>
    <li> Did not work...the same as any over the counter night cream....Don&#x27;t buy...Don&#x27;t buy....Don&#x27;t buy...Don&#x27;t buy and don&#x27;t try to rate this product if you have to have so many words to say this product does not work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for years and have been happy with it, but all that I bought this time had a silver top and non of them had a plastic stem so you can&#x27;t pump the cream out you have to dig it out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a new type of packaging the pump action doesn&#x27;t work on the 1st 3 tubes tried out of my order, avoid like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it before and it&#x27;s very good but this latest order is the pits.&lt;br /&gt;What chance have you got of using it if the pump action doesn&#x27;t&#x27;  work.&lt;br /&gt;Try something else.</li>
    <li> I really never got to use the product. When it arrived the sprayer didn&#x27;t work. I have to return the item</li>
    <li> Too early to determine if it&#x27;s working but the packaging appears larger than the quantity in the package. After only about 3 weeks and it no longer pumps product.</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it was very gentle on my skin. It is all natural and safe for your skin. I was satisfied with this product it delivered results.</li>
    <li> Bellaplex has lifted and tightened my sagging aging neck and I recommend it&#x27;s use in conjunction with hydroxatone AM/PM anti-wrinkle complex and hydroxatone age defying toner.</li>
    <li> I tried this product daily for a month.  It gave me blemishes (whiteheads), and did nothing to reduce the fine lines around my eyes. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this, so I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> excellent item, great value, still using this item, and hopefully will see great results but leaves skin feeling great</li>
    <li> Bought two and neither pump worked… so I had to dig the cream out… only an ounce inside!  Just put it in a jar!</li>
    <li> Yes this is a great product it works really well for my skin. its easy to uplie and seems to be non greasy for my skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working okay !!</li>
    <li> might work couldn&#x27;t tell</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  You can feel the effects in about a week.  I use it daily with my face routine.</li>
    <li> I have used the product direct from the company&lt;br /&gt;It works well on my fine lines and creases around my mouth if used regularly&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say the product pump on both containers does not siphon up&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come out when turned upside down&lt;br /&gt;Will have to use a q tip&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t it be in a jar?&lt;br /&gt;So I won&#x27;t use this supplier again</li>
    <li> I prefer this one over the Hydroxatone.  It stings just a little but it&#x27;s supposed to and I knew it was working.  The down side is  the pump, it simply doesn&#x27;t work.  I used a very thin piece of wood. Luckily, I had an eyebrow, eyelash comb and brush that was ready to throw away. I just pulled off the bristles and used the handle as a spatula, worked out fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using bellaplex for a few years now, and I am not going to give it up.  As a moisturizer, it is outstanding.  It states that it will get rid of fine lines and wrinkles, but the truth is, if you want to do that, you must have surgery or botox, or restaline, or any of those types of products/procedures.  I love bellaplex.  I would recommend it to most anyone, to be used after one of the above procedures.  It is a great moisturizer for post-procedure,  along with being a wonderful moisturizer at any time.  I am 63 yrs old, and so I am not sure if it gets rid of fine lines on younger skin.  But I know that it helps for my skin.  People say that I look pretty good for my age, which they say looks 10-15 years younger than my 63 years.  So I say GO FOR IT!!!  Try 2 months worth and if you don&#x27;t like it, try something else that you do like.  The price is right, what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> Like many other people, I have tried numerous wrinkle products.  I have sensitive skin, so most of them not only do not help with reducing the appearance of wrinkles, but the irritate my skin too.  This is the best product I have tried that is gentle and reduces wrinkles too.</li>
    <li> I used Bellaplex for years but got tired of so many customer rep changes at their home site and the price never the same. I stopped for a year but found my skin didn&#x27;t look as good no matter what other products I used. I was thrilled to find it again on my own terms paying what I thought to be a fair price. Oh, and my skin looks great again!</li>
    <li> It is working great! Firmly up my face and neck. Seen results within the first week! Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The dispenser for the lotion quit working on the second day.</li>
