      <li>and they were fresh .</li>
      <li>They taste and work exactly the same as they did so many years ago!</li>
      <li>The delivery was right on time too.  </li>

      <li>Taste great, long lasting flavor.</li>
      <li>I love the fruity flavor and the soft, but not too soft, texture.  </li>
      <li>They are of an unusual texture though, so at first glance</li>
      <li>We always had a tin on the counter for staff and they really are therapeutic.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more of a harder gummy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see the value here.  </li>
      <li>they war here fast</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really see it helping with throat issues</li>
      <li>WOW!!!</li>

      <li>I love the flavor of black current and can vouch that these are true to that flavor.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re kind of like a hard gummie bear.  </li>
      <li>Hard chewy…has not been effective for me</li>
      <li>The scent, the taste....takes me right back.  </li>
      <li>Nice thing about these is that you pop one in your mouth a couple songs before you&#x27;re due to belt one out and therefore keep a long moisturizing throat drool going...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again and would love to try the other flavors.</li>
      <li>these are super expensive per dose, so I tell my kids &amp;#34;they are not candy&amp;#34; but man, on rare occasion any of us get a cough, these little things are amazing.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my ENT for bronchitis.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful, natural and sooooo soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>as far as helping my cough.</li>
      <li>They taste good, not awesome.  </li>
      <li>I am 75 years old, and I remember the original &amp;#34;Allenberrys Glycerin Black Currant Pastilles&amp;#34;  -  in the same packaging  -  that my father, who was a singer, always carried with him.  </li>
      <li>I first had these pastilles when I worked for a local university medical center pharmacy.</li>

<li> Expensive, but worth it!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure, It helped some but not enough to buy for that reason only, I&#x27;d buy for the taste and the moistness i get in my throat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this for my throat, I just like blackcurrant flavors and chewy things. So rather than knock myself out with a handful of sugary chewy candies, why not have one or two of these? Satisfies my urge to chew.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t found these in years.  my mother used to have them all the time. so tasty and delicious a treat</li>
    <li> WARNING: DON&#x27;T BUY THESE!!! I DID AND NOW I AM ADDICTED!!! WOW!!! AMAZING SWEET BUT NOT SO SWEET TASTE!!! HELPS WITH YOUR VOICE TOO AND MAKE YOU FEEL GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Everything you can imagine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I found these sooner! Buy the 15oz!!!</li>
    <li> Hard chewy…has not been effective for me</li>
    <li> These are ok flavor.  Nothing strong or menthol, kinda like cheap gummy bears but a bit stiffer.  They are crazy expensive for what you get.  They are in a metal tin like an altoid tin and there&#x27;s only 1 tin in the order.  Don&#x27;t really see it helping with throat issues but now if you order them, you can&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned!</li>
    <li> Santa always put a box of these in our stockings growing up!  The scent, the taste....takes me right back.  And they&#x27;re GOOD for me!!</li>
    <li> I first had these pastilles when I worked for a local university medical center pharmacy. We  stocked these specifically for our customers who would use them prior to class lectures or speaking engagements at the university. We always had a tin on the counter for staff and they really are therapeutic.  The only negative is that the relaxing effect doesn&#x27;t last very long; i would say no longer than a half hour.  I keep them on my office desk now just to keep a scratchy throat soothed.</li>
    <li> Since I was a little girl my mother has given me Grether&#x27;s Pastilles for my sore throat.  I decided to get some more because I was having difficulty speaking on the telephone all day.  You can feel the soothing effects of this pastille immediately.  They are the ones you remember as a kid.  Expensive, but worth it!  I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> Lovely taste and soothing on the throat. Pricey but nice. Will re-order, but not TOO-TOO often.</li>
    <li> These lozenges are wonderful. I am a singer and have  found these to be very soothing when my voice is tired. I have shared  Them others in my chorus and quartet and now they are all ordering them.  They are also available in sugarless.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly on due date. Its a gift to my worship leader and he says they are great. I will continue to order. As a side note, I also bought him [...] and he raved about this and passed it around band practice for his other singers to try. He might like the spray better. Maybe its a good pairing</li>
    <li> Taste great, long lasting flavor. However, i don&#x27;t know that they offer the advertised vocal chord nourishment. They seem to work better when supplemented with a vocal spray. Nice thing about these is that you pop one in your mouth a couple songs before you&#x27;re due to belt one out and therefore keep a long moisturizing throat drool going...</li>
    <li> It is not a cough drop but is extremely soothing for a sore throat.  One of the few remedies I found that actually works.</li>
    <li> these black current pastilles are very addicting as someone else said because they taste good. Not a sickly sweet type treat. it&#x27;s more of a harder gummy. as far as helping my cough. I&#x27;m not sure, It helped some but not enough to buy for that reason only, I&#x27;d buy for the taste and the moistness i get in my throat.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my ENT for bronchitis.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful, natural and sooooo soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is price (minus one star)!&lt;br /&gt;About $52.00, with shipping and handling for 176 pieces &#x3D; $0.28/piece.</li>
    <li> I love the flavor of black current and can vouch that these are true to that flavor. I can also vouch that these are expensive.</li>
    <li> This simply works like a magic. It settles your vocal codes. However it&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to what it does.</li>
    <li> My concern is that everyone tries them and likes them leaving none for me and my long addicted to Pastilles family.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and soothes the throat. A little expensive, but my daughter had singing auditions and they came in handy.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! I speak several times a week as a part of my job. I love these and use them before, after and in between all my speaking engagement. They are amazing at keeping moisture and avoiding horseness.</li>
    <li> Bought these at a pharmacia in Switzerland.  They are great for soothing my throat.  I thought they were expensive at nine Swiss francs but now they look like a great deal.</li>
    <li> I am 75 years old, and I remember the original &amp;#34;Allenberrys Glycerin Black Currant Pastilles&amp;#34;  -  in the same packaging  -  that my father, who was a singer, always carried with him.  These were  the only lozenges I&#x27;ve ever known that soothed the throat without interfering with a singer&#x27;s performance  -  and I thought they had gone out of business.  I am thrilled that Grether&#x27;s are now available on Amazon!  The only difference is that the outside of each lozenge is no longer shiny, which means they no longer stick together.  That is the only change I discern, and that is an improvement.  They taste and work exactly the same as they did so many years ago!</li>
    <li> Good, but not any better than Ricola.</li>
    <li> They are expensive, but worth it. I have been eating this since I was a little kid. They are the perfect amount of chewiness and fruitiness. I love the strong flavor and the way they soothe my throat. I only allow myself one a day... Because if you break it down each pastille is about a $1. Something to look forward to with each sunrise.</li>
    <li> these are super expensive per dose, so I tell my kids &amp;#34;they are not candy&amp;#34; but man, on rare occasion any of us get a cough, these little things are amazing.  handmade in switzerland in personal batches, they&#x27;re delicious and they heal.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a small snack (10 calories each) and glycerin and blackcurrant to boot. Never be without a tin. Ever.</li>
    <li> These pastilles are so soothing and the taste is amazing!  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again and would love to try the other flavors.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  These were one of my mother&#x27;s favorites, thus always make me think of her.  Thankfully, the flavor of these haven&#x27;t changed in all these many years.</li>
    <li> These are great, a little pricey but considering the quality it is worth the price. My tin has lasted me about a month.</li>
    <li> I love the taste and dexture of these pastilles.  Growing up in England I miss Blackcurrants and these are really good and not covered in sugar.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, not for the price.  Way too expensive.  I don&#x27;t really see the value here.  They taste good, not awesome.  They are smooth and nice, but don&#x27;t see a reason for buying these when I could just gargle, drink warm lemon tea or a teaspoon of honey may do the trick. Or even a cheaper brand maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the Nelson Bach brand and see how they compare.  Better price.  We&#x27;ll see...</li>
    <li> Tastes so good! really keeps your voice at very good condition. A little too expensive but will order again!</li>
    <li> Great taste and serves the purpose.  The delivery was right on time too.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Pastille a are juicy and have a great taste.  If you are having throat issues -dry, not much saliva, scratchy. Then these are for you. I bought these for a friend who had surgery and a damaged vocal cord. She said that they were the best things she could of ever had.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother. She loves them.</li>
    <li> These are great if you are losing your voice.  I usually get laryngitis twice a year, but since I found these, it haven&#x27;t lost my voice.  Taste great.</li>
    <li> I love Grethers  they war here fast and they were fresh . perfect .. I love them so I am ordering more.</li>
    <li> Good product with good results.</li>
    <li> This is cheap candy from Switzerland. Yes, they are yummy, but who would pay this kind of money for these gum drops? Am I missing something here?</li>
    <li> I love the fruity flavor and the soft, but not too soft, texture.  Very unique and refreshing.  Not medicinal, but soothing.</li>
    <li> Use ALL the time . Great product!  Received on time.</li>
    <li> Just got these for the first time, and I love them! They are very fruity, and have a smooth melt in your mouth texture! Recommend them for anyone who has a sore throat, sings a lot, talks a lot, or if you like the sweet taste.</li>
    <li> Delicious and soothing after teaching Group Exercise classes all day.</li>
    <li> It has probably been 35 years since having these delicious&lt;br /&gt;pastilles. Love love love them. Would easily recommend them&lt;br /&gt;to black current lovers.</li>
    <li> Am trying this product</li>
    <li> Used these alongside &amp;#34;Throat Coat&amp;#34; tea and &amp;#34;Singers Saving Grace&amp;#34; spray one time when I was really sick right before a performance.  The consistency is more like a hard gummy bear than a traditional lozenge, which was strange/  Didn&#x27;t taste great, but seemed to work....just not as well as the spray.</li>
    <li> I am a Voice Actress and love these!  I used to use other lozengers, but these are delicious.  I like REGULAR, not sugar free!  They are like a gummy bear!  Thank you Grethers!</li>
    <li> Being an Apothecary type product chic...I love the old-fashioned look of the container as well as the emollient, succulent properties of these lozenges/pastilles! Quality..and at times you have to pay to get it..Grether&#x27;s are my all time fave...Try them...I think you will likey! ;)</li>
    <li> These were recommended by a vocal coach to lubricate vocal chords &amp; ease scratchiness.  They work great.  They are of an unusual texture though, so at first glance you maty want to pass.  But they taste great &amp; work really well.  They&#x27;re kind of like a hard gummie bear.  They are pricey, so not for everyday use, but if you&#x27;re a vocalist that needs to perform with a scratchy throat, they&#x27;re wonderful.  Also great if you&#x27;re doing an extended program to keep your vocal  chords lubricated.</li>
