      <li>Finally found the perfect shampoo!</li>
      <li>My wife originally bought this shampoo in Japan, and was worried about running out because it makes her hair look so nice.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great product, but the shipping cost is too high.</li>
      <li>bottle of super deluxe shampoo a friend once got me.  </li>
      <li>The smell is so unique and flowery, but more importantly it leaves my hair silky without being oily.  </li>
      <li>Do you want to have smooth hair like silk?</li>
      <li>But last week I had to buy more, as my hair does not look or feel as good now as it did while I was using this product.</li>
      <li>I like it because I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair for 3 days or 4 because looks clean.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, leaves hair clean and soft.</li>
      <li>However, by the time I was ready for more shampoo</li>
      <li>I loved this brand when I lived in Japan and stocked my suitcase full when I moved back to the States.  </li>
      <li>The price is not bad for a 400ml package.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my black hair shiny and tangle free.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting anything more than just a decent shampoo that left your hair smelling good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m worth it, after all.&amp;quot;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does leave your hair soft, shiny, and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous high end shampoo and conditioner combinations, claiming to make your soft, shiny, and healthy, and have been less than impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>The delivery by the seller was very fast.</li>
      <li>I have super fine blonde hair, so oil shows up very fast.  </li>
      <li>A staple for most Japanese women.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this shampoo on a trip to Hong Kong.</li>
      <li>In my opinion it even works better than the $50 (!)</li>
      <li>, I could not help noticing that my hair was in much better condition than it had been prior to this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After the first or even the second use, I didn&#x27;t really notice a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>it really smoothes my hair.</li>
      <li>I may not buy again though, as I expected more from Shiseido&#x27;s hair product.</li>
      <li>Now thanks to Amazon, anyone can ( and should ) give Shiseido Tsubaki shampoo a try.</li>
      <li>After three weeks of use of this shampoo, my thin hair now looks much more healthy.</li>
      <li>This is great for long male hair, especially if you have an oily scalp.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers have stated that they discovered Tsubaki shampoo while staying in hotels in Japan and Hong Kong and have fell in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for more than half year now.</li>
      <li>but I dont love.my hair looks very shiny and clean But make my hair Dry and puffy</li>
      <li>And, like most Japanese bath products, you only need to buy the bottle once</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say I only use conditioner every third day or so since the shampoo does such a good job of keeping it soft.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To be honest, I have reverted back to my frugal self and have purchased other shampoos since.  </li>
      <li>This stuff actually does seem to perform at a higher level.</li>
      <li>Most shampoos are essentially the same product with different fragrances and colors added to differentiate.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft that they run through my fingers like silk.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>My hair is always dried &amp; frizzy but after using Tsubaki shampoo &amp; conditioner, my hair feels healthier and smooth.</li>
      <li>Hope Amazon can sell it directly.</li>

<li> you just need a small dollop.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t spend money on fancy shampoo.  Many times I&#x27;ve heard stylists and beauty experts say that shampoo is shampoo; don&#x27;t waste your money buying expensive products.  And while this product is not too terribly expensive, it does cost more than what I&#x27;m used to spending.  But on a whim, I thought, &amp;quot;Why not?  What do I have to lose?  I&#x27;m worth it, after all.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually pleasantly surprised.  After the first or even the second use, I didn&#x27;t really notice a significant difference.  However, by the time I was ready for more shampoo, I could not help noticing that my hair was in much better condition than it had been prior to this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I have reverted back to my frugal self and have purchased other shampoos since.  But last week I had to buy more, as my hair does not look or feel as good now as it did while I was using this product.</li>
    <li> Good price and good value. I have recommended it to all of my friends! Do you want to have smooth hair like silk? Use it!</li>
    <li> The delivery by the seller was very fast. I have used this product for more than half year now. It&#x27;s great product, but the shipping cost is too high. The shipping is more than the product itself. Hope Amazon can sell it directly.</li>

    <li> This stuff is amazing, leaves hair clean and soft. Not sure why I would use anything else other than you can&#x27;t find this in our local store. I have thick, slightly wavy/coarse graying hair. The conditioner is terrific too. My daughters love it too. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a moisturizing shampoo but it makes my hair dry</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. My hair is so soft that they run through my fingers like silk. Guess who is using it now? My husband! The same result on his hair. We are now regular users.</li>
    <li> My huseband ann me fell in love with Shiseido!! This shampoo dies miracle to my hair. Delivers more moisture to my colored hair then conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It makes my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic to find this on Amazon.  I loved this brand when I lived in Japan and stocked my suitcase full when I moved back to the States.  The smell is so unique and flowery, but more importantly it leaves my hair silky without being oily.  I have super fine blonde hair, so oil shows up very fast.

    <li> I first discovered this shampoo on a trip to Hong Kong. It smells great and leaves my black hair shiny and tangle free. I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore because the shampoo is so moisturizing.</li>
    <li> it really smoothes my hair. i really love it. i think it should be used everyday with other Tsubaki products.</li>

    <li> Great shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using the same product for the past 6 years. It&#x27;s expensive but to me, it&#x27;s perfectly worth it.</li>
    <li> Most shampoos are essentially the same product with different fragrances and colors added to differentiate. This stuff actually does seem to perform at a higher level. It leaves hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> I came across this product at a Japanese grocery store in my area. The shampoo smelled great so I decided to give it a try. I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting anything more than just a decent shampoo that left your hair smelling good. I&#x27;ve tried numerous high end shampoo and conditioner combinations, claiming to make your soft, shiny, and healthy, and have been less than impressed with the results. Shiseido Tsubaki shampoo is different. It really does leave your hair soft, shiny, and healthy. I am very happy with this product and am even happier that Amazon is now selling the 400ml refills for both the shampoo and conditioner. Other reviewers have stated that they discovered Tsubaki shampoo while staying in hotels in Japan and Hong Kong and have fell in love with this product. I can now understand why. The reason is simple. Shiseido  Tsubaki does what other brands only claim. Now thanks to Amazon, anyone can ( and should ) give Shiseido Tsubaki shampoo a try.</li>
    <li> This is great for long male hair, especially if you have an oily scalp. Try the conditioner too, but be warned it&#x27;s effective.</li>
    <li> leaving my scalp with an itchy feeling</li>
    <li> This shampoo make my hair shine and nice. This is my favorite  and I love it. I am glad to get it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it works charm on my hair but it&#x27;s alright as a daily shampoo. The price is not bad for a 400ml package. I may not buy again though, as I expected more from Shiseido&#x27;s hair product.</li>
    <li> Purchased it all the time when I lived in Japan, and it was great!  It&#x27;s still great, and I&#x27;m delighted I can order it here in the States!</li>
    <li> you just need a small dollop. It works wonders especially on dry hair.  Do not overuse.  It has a very nice clean smell.</li>
