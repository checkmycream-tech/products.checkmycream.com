    <li> good product, quick delivery!</li>

    <li> This is my favorite body spray, it is all I use, and Its getting very hard to find.  The scent is very  clean and refreshing and I am always getting compliments on it.  I always try to buy 4 to 6 bottles at a time so I can keep it in stock, but its getting harder to find.  Does anyone know, where I can purchase it?    Thank You  Donna Walls  E-Mail add  madisonavenue6@hotmail.com</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent by FAR.  I&#x27;ve searched everywhere and cannot find anything that comes close!  I can&#x27;t BELIEVE the Gap stopped making it. It makes me want to buy every Amazon store out, because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll run out some day!  Heaven has a fresh, flowery scent without being overbearing at ALL.  I am super sensitive to smell, and normally get headaches from perfume.  I think I could spray this ENTIRE bottle on and not have it negatively affect me at all.  It even has a sort of calming effect on me (hence the title of the review.)  I spray it and it&#x27;s like, well, Heaven!  I get compliments almost daily on how great this smells, it baffles me that Gap discontinued it!  I almost want to give it a bad review to make sure the online shops won&#x27;t sell out!</li>
    <li> Smells just like I remember! Thank you</li>
    <li> Great light clean. My favorite.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s from the gap so there&#x27;s some stupid involved there. I never buy anything from that place. BUT I LOVE THIS SMELL. I am compelled to own it. If I can&#x27;t smell like a man, I&#x27;m happy to smell like this.</li>
    <li> This body splash has a sweet, fresh scent. It is great for daytime and works for hot weather. You can spray it several times a day because it is smooth and the scent wont stay too long.</li>
    <li> I have worn gap heaven for over 15 yrs now, and unfortunately this is not the real deal. Or if it is, it has been diluted or altered. It does not smell the same and the scent does not last. I am very disappointed as I do not have the time to purchase gap heaven at the store on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Light clean smell reminds me of your Daughter who passed away 10 years ago. she was such a girly girl she would love it to.</li>
    <li> Light scent you can live with all day. Gap is discontinuing this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome, as usual.  Very quick delivery!</li>
    <li> So happy I found this!  Heaven has been a long time favorite scent and when it was discontinued I thought I would never find it again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite, it shipped quickly and I&#x27;m still getting compliments on it.</li>

    <li> My daughter loves this hard to find body spray. I buy it whenever I can find it. It&#x27;s a shame they stopped making it. It is a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this everywhere.  I got it quickly and it is the exact same product as I got at the store.</li>
