      <li>It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive too, given how much skin products are these days.  </li>
      <li>The absolute best moisturizer, light and clear.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and works fine with moisturizer, etc.</li>
      <li>It has helped to fade the fine (and not so fine) lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li>This product is not greasy and leave your skin soft,silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Its not quite enough if you use it alone, but it is a great addition to what I am already using.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
      <li>It is so light, so it absorbs well.</li>
      <li>i am about to order my third bottle as i have been so pleased with this product...very fair price compared to others and it lasts quite a while ...</li>
      <li>Overall however Squalane is a great oil for your skin, works GREAT under Make up also, any kind, not sure about mineral powder though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product is worth the money!</li>
      <li>THE ORIGINAL</li>
      <li>Great price and lasts long time.  </li>
      <li>It is absorbed very quickly and does not leave a greasy residue, the scent fades rapidly.</li>

      <li>All the reviews I read before purchasing this product are true.</li>
      <li>Revitalizes skin, hydrates, absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>Then why not do a quick online search for &#x27;how sharks help us breathe&#x27; to see what could happen to the oxygen levels on this planet if sharks are wiped out.</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Very pure and clean.</li>
      <li>It is very much like the Oceanic, light, lightly lavender scented, and much cheaper.</li>
      <li>It is a little more watery in texture than my previous squalane, but I have found it is light and perfect for the warmer months.  </li>
      <li>Looking at ingredient labels I decided to make my own facial serum</li>
      <li>I am pleased so far.</li>
      <li>Practically eliminated noticable fine lines and crows feet within a week, BUT you might want to use it very sparingly at first until you know if you are allergic to it.</li>
      <li>I use a different kind of Squalane before and compared to this one it is very runny.</li>
      <li>So light and fast absorbing.</li>
      <li>and my face look better and is never dry anymore.</li>
      <li>I use this oil every day and like it very much.</li>
      <li>I like this oil very much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great crap , love it. mixes well with other crap I may put in it, should last a long long time no less</li>
    <li> Great product ...second time I&#x27;ve ordered it.   This product is not greasy and leave your skin soft,silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - or any others you see for sale containing squalene.    Squalene is derived from sharks, which have to be killed in order to extract this product. Worldwide, sharks are being killed at a staggering rate - approx 73 MILLION A YEAR. That&#x27;s almost 250,000 EVERY DAY. This rate of slaughter is utterly unsustainable, and shark species are in real danger of mass extinction within the next 10 years at this rate. The majority are killed in a truly barbaric way for their fins only - then the mutilated and still alive shark is thrown overboard to bleed slowly to death or drown. Search for &#x27;shark finning&#x27; on Youtube if you have the stomach to see what really happens. Squalene harvesting takes place using other sharks - so even more have to die in order to provide a pitiful beauty treatment.     According to medical trials, this product - like so many other &#x27;wonder products&#x27; in the past - makes big claims but does not actually work. Do your own search and find out. However, I note that many reviewers here report that it does. Maybe that&#x27;s true, or maybe they&#x27;re just seeing what they want to see. Who knows. Either way, I hope losing a few wrinkles is worth the environmental devastation that will ensue as shark populations are decimated.    How many of you like breathing? Then why not do a quick online search for &#x27;how sharks help us breathe&#x27; to see what could happen to the oxygen levels on this planet if sharks are wiped out. Then maybe you&#x27;ll figure out why I&#x27;m kicking off the way I am....</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is because your natural skin oils (of which, squalane is a constituent) perform essentially the same function.  As a person with somewhat oily skin, I found that I did not really need the product unless my skin was in need of immediate protection.  But for people that need a good skin protectant and acne reducer, this product should serve you well.</li>
    <li> This is a teriffic product. I was seeing lines (road maps!) in my face and I put the oil on after cleansing my face and then cover that with collegen cream and bingo!  I could see a difference in about a week.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product helps my skin to be soft and silky.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to do so.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My facialist recommended I pat a few drops of this oil over my night cream for extra moisture. It works beautifully! The tiniest amount is all that&#x27;s necessary and the oil soaks in quickly. It&#x27;s great for nail cuticles too!</li>
    <li> This soaks in well but I ultimately developed allergic reaction.  Ended up with swollen, itchy eyes.  If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money! It will help chaffed lips. I have a bottle in my car to smooth on my lips especially in winter months. One other is hiding fine lines on the face. I feel it is good for underneath the eyes. It soaks right in otherwise pat dry with a dry wash cloth if desired. This is my second bottle which does last for sometime. Goes along way....Love using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin product, it protects from the enviroment, an antioxident and repairs the skin, it is used in most skin creams and lotins. I like using the pure oil, it moisturizes and repairs. i have been using it for almost a year and i can see the difference in my skin, and it isnt very expensive. I love it.</li>
    <li> My skin is constantly dry, even 1 hour after using heavy moisturizer.  This product solved that problem--no more dry skin, and best of all, the oil can be easily incorporated into your beauty regimen.  I drop a few droplets into my regular moisturize and apply like I normally would.  The oil does not smell like anything.  It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive too, given how much skin products are these days.  Definitely worth a try if dry skin if your problem!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and nowhere on the box, bottle, or pamphlet does it say what it is made from other than \\&quot;squalene\\&quot;. I assumed, silly me, that this was squalene derived from olive oil having never heard of any other kind. With some digging I found that this is a fluid extracted from shark livers. As someone who does not support the killing of sharks  I would not have bought this product had I known that was the source.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have nothing to say about how this product actually works as I will not be using it--just wanted to provide a little bit more information for those who are interested.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother. Mayumi Squalane skin oil does well for my mother&#x27;s very dry skin. It moisturizes the skin well. My mother said she noticed some of her wrinkles disappear. The oil is also very easy to apply. This is very important for my mother since she tends to be very clumsy. The easier for her to handle items in her hands, the better.</li>
    <li> All the reviews I read before purchasing this product are true. This skin oil doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s a relief to be able to put oil on a thirsty skin when for years I was afraid to. I use it on my heels, elbows, the outer corner of my eyes and cuticles. Time will tell if it has other magical powers.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product.  I use this oil every day and like it very much.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! So light and fast absorbing. The younger you are when you start using it the better. I use it on my lips, face, neck  and any area really that needs moisturizing. And you can&#x27;t beat this price. A customer for life!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my skin feel so soft.  Overtime, I hope it continues to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I wish they would package it in a plastic bottle. My daughter broke mine after I had it for about a week! It can become very slippery when the oil gets on the outside of the bottle!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft and supple; fine lines disappeared. I use it in lieu of a toner. Very light texture.</li>
    <li> This squalane oil leaves your face so soft.All u need is 2 drops for face and neck. You could put sunblock in day or at nite use your nite cream. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Practically eliminated noticable fine lines and crows feet within a week, BUT you might want to use it very sparingly at first until you know if you are allergic to it. (Other reviewers have been allergic to it as well.) It can cause an itcy, red burn allergic reaction to your skin.  I also got a red skin/burn reaction from it using it on my shins for dryness. I dont want to say dont use it, because it does work wonderfully on fine wrinkles, but at the same time, I want you to know it might cause you reaction problems.  I had to quit using it completely. :(</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have oily skin and rosacea with breakouts.  I have tried a lot of different products and am very happy with the Mayumi Squalene oil.  It feels great, seems to be getting rid of my fine lines at the corners of my eyes and lips - and BEST - does not make my sort of sensitive skin break out. I use it under my makeup and at night under my usual moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Can be used alone, can be used as a nitetime treatment. I also mix a drop or 2 in my regular face creme when I need a little extra moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This skin oil keeps my face and neck soft, applied right after cleansing, and it reduces the amount of face cream that I apply over it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I used to use the Susan Love&#x27;s Oceanic Squalane, but she discontinued it. I found this one on amazon and decided to give it a try. It is very much like the Oceanic, light, lightly lavender scented, and much cheaper. I use it on my skin twice a day after washing my face. It is absorbed very quickly and does not leave a greasy residue, the scent fades rapidly. I love, love, love this product. It keeps my skin soft and hydrated (I do use a moisturizer). The bottle lasts over a year since one uses only a drop or two. I don&#x27;t know how well it would perform on an oil skin since my skin is normal to dry. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> There are other squalane products that are made from Olives. Check Squalane 99 from Mitch&#x27;s Bits of Stuff. Good information to have if you don&#x27;t like contributing to shark hunting.</li>
    <li> After reading about this product I decided to buy it. It really does take the dryness away on my face leaving it soft feeling. All the moisturizers I have tried never made my face feel as good as it does with using this product.</li>
    <li> It was a pleasant shopping experience and really do think the product is top of the line.</li>
    <li> The absolute best moisturizer, light and clear.  Extra bonus is value.  I use it day and night,  it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
    <li> I like this oil very much.  It has helped my skin because it used to be very dry.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Same 100% Squalane that is in more expensive brands.  Great price and lasts long time.  Really does work for aging skin.  After only one week friends and coworkers were commenting on difference in my skin and asking what I was doing different.  Note that it is a little \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; when you first put it on but the shine part fades within few minutes or so leaving your skin looking dewy but not greasy.  Very happy with purchase and think you will be too.</li>
    <li> I have replace moisturizer with this product, it works really well and my face look better and is never dry anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has helped to fade the fine (and not so fine) lines around my eyes and mouth. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me break-out. I think it&#x27;s a great purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> This product is very useful for dry areas of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also good for your hair, I like to add a little to the bottle of my conditioner.</li>
    <li> I first started using this product when I lived in the desert ... Tucson, AZ. I now live in New England so primarily use it during the winter months.  I am caucasian and in my mid-30s. It gives my skin a healthy, radiant glow.  I love it and highly recommend it. It is so light, so it absorbs well. You can also add some of this product to your favorite daytime/nighttime cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and had to go to a Health Food store to get it.It was so convenient to get it thru Amazon.I will use Amazon for my next order of this product</li>
    <li> This was too greasy for my liking. There are other skin oils that will penetrate much better than these. I guess I&#x27;ll use it on my body just to use it up.</li>
    <li> Two days ago I suffered a general systemic allergic reaction and suspected a skin care product that is pure squalane oil. This was not a skin reaction, mind you, but a respiratory/airways reaction with general body swelling. I was astounded to learn from reliable sources (medical articles) that squalane (chemically very similar to squalene but stablized) is a well known immune system adjuvant. An adjuvant provokes autoimmune reactions, and squalane is banned from vaccines in most of Europe because of its danger. Squalane is not allowed in the U.S. in vaccines, due to its well known trigger of autoimmune reactions and possibly disorders. In some studies, it has caused long term autoimmune disorders - narcolepsy, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Some gene lines are more susceptible, but the reactions are common enough that there seems to be more going on than this. I have complained to the FDA that squalane should not be allowed in OTC beauty products when it is too dangerous in vaccines! Crazy. For an overview of studies, Google for ASIA or Shoenfeld&#x27;s Syndrome - An Autoimmune Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants.</li>
    <li> i live in the mountains and i was having major skin problems caused by the dry air. a friend gave me a sample and it took a week for my skin to go back to normal, and moistured. it worked for me, and now that the winter is approaching i&#x27;m getting more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a decade. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and works fine with moisturizer, etc. It lasts for several months.</li>
    <li> This squalane is light weight and completely absorbed by the skin. It is the primary active ingredient in most dermatological products.</li>
    <li> Perfect skin care oil.  Revitalizes skin, hydrates, absorbs quickly.  Use along with my favorite face cream and alone. It may also be used under make-up.  I love this oil, it helps cure my wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I complimented a friend on her beautiful skin and she told me about this product she has been using for years.  I bought and tried it and love it.  It is oily when you first put it on for only a couple of minutes, but then it soaks in and your skin is soft and lovely.  I heartily recommend it.  I&#x27;ve become a permanent user.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, but I did not like the feel of it on the skin and did not see any dramatic effects after using it. I am going to endorse Kiehl&#x27;s products, despite their high price. Kiehl&#x27;s also contains squalane, but for some reason, it blends into the skin well and does add immediate glow and freshness to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did work well on the lips. Hydrated the lips very well, so that is where I intend to use it. That&#x27;s it. Honest review.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 100% olive oil squalane and us it regularly. it is one of the best products I have ever used. please dont support the killing of sharks for a beauty product that can be purchased from olives and just as good.</li>
    <li> I have relatively ok skin and I take good care of my diet. I have been using natural skincare since 2006 but they did not do much for me till I started using Mayumi Squalane. I&#x27;ve tried another form of squalane which was derived from olive, but the plant based squalane did nothing for my skin. But this Mayumi Squalane, which is derived from shark&#x27;s liver, made my skin soft and got rid of the roughness in the corners of my nose. I knew from the first application that this is THE FACIAL OIL for me...a keeper! I got it cheaper from another online shop. Please go to the comment page for more details.</li>
    <li> No difference in my skin and I have been using it as they recommended on the bottle for the past 2 months.  I even took a picture of my facial skin before and after.  Nothing.  NEXT!!!!</li>
    <li> It is a great oil that absorbs well into the skin and feels so light, despite being an oil.  Definitely recommend for oily skin.  You can&#x27;t get any oilier than my skin and I just love it...especially mixed with other light carrier and essential oils.</li>
    <li> I REALLY CAN&#x27;T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS SO CALLED SQUALANE AND BABY OIL, THIS DOES NOT SOAK INTO THE SKIN LIKE THE ORIGINAL, I THINK IT IS JUST BABY OIL SOLD FOR A HIGH PRICE......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying for the second time,oil is wonderful,moisturizes the skin,removes wrinkles,I will buy more!recommend,help from sunburn.I really like,byee byeee :)))))))))))))</li>
    <li> This is the best! Throw out all other moisturizers! You can use this everywhere including around the eyes.  I rub one small pump, (I put a small pump that was on another small bottle of moisturizer I had on the Mayumi bottle) on my hands and then pat the excess on my face and neck after my morning shower! I&#x27;m 39 and someone who did not know how old I was thought that I was 27! There is no harsh perfume either, love it!</li>
    <li> Friend was talking about this skin oil. I decided to try it since I was running low on sweet almond oil. Love it! Recommend it, skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I use a different kind of Squalane before and compared to this one it is very runny. Since it does not come in a dropper but only it a squirt bottle it was not a good value for me. I wasted way to much of the product that way and with the consistancy of the product. Overall however Squalane is a great oil for your skin, works GREAT under Make up also, any kind, not sure about mineral powder though.&lt;br /&gt;I do recomment you try the product from Timeless Skin Care and compare which is a better fit for you</li>
    <li> i am about to order my third bottle as i have been so pleased with this product...very fair price compared to others and it lasts quite a while ... i use it as directed, under my moisturizer and i have really noticed the benefits...a terrific value and product</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product for very long. I have noticed the eye lines and around the lips lines have really gotten smaller. It is not really greasy, so it must be absorbing into the skin right away. I have had a recent surgery and an appling it onto the scar to see how it works there. I am pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mayumi Squalene for over 15 years. It really has made a difference in my skin. I always get asked, what do I use. Being a guy, we don&#x27;t usually pay any attention to our skin. One of my clients shared about how she liked the way it made her skin feel. I tried it and was hooked. Although it seems to be a small bottle for the price, with daily liberal use after shaving it last about 5 months. Try it,  you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> this oil is usually way down on the ingredient list of most moisturizers/cosmetics. It actually mimics the skin and absorbs very quickly. Do not waste $ on expensive creams, etc. Use a few drops of this alone or mixed with your own facial day/night cream. You will not be sorry. Best brand around in my opinion</li>
    <li> Looking at ingredient labels I decided to make my own facial serum and this was a very economical way to obtain one of the major ingredients.  It comes in a nice glass bottle. Very pure and clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to replace my current oil that was running out.  It is a little more watery in texture than my previous squalane, but I have found it is light and perfect for the warmer months.  It comes with an applicator top that you put on to allow slow application.</li>
    <li> Its not quite enough if you use it alone, but it is a great addition to what I am already using.&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any effects that any other oil wouldn&#x27;t do.  I agree that is a ripoff of Squalene.  Instead, get some preparation H from Canada with biodyne.  That works.  Got some in Canada this week but you can get it off Amazon.  I&#x27;m not going to get any more of this SqualAne.</li>
    <li> I had heard from a friend&#x27;s mom that this was all she ever put on her face.  She doesn&#x27;t wear make-up and her skin is amazing!  I do understand that is hereditary, but decided to give this a try.  It&#x27;s not too oily, but doesn&#x27;t have the best smell to it.  I didn&#x27;t see anything amazing happen using this, but my skin did feel smoother. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Squalane oil is a refined olive oil, excellent for the skin and body. I highly recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very nice for dry skin, absorbs quickly (no residual oily feel) and can be used easily w/ other facial products, if desired. . Was also a very good price w/ convenient delivery.</li>
