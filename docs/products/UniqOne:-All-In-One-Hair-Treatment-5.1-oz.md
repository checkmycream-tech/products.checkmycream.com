    <li> love, love this product. really works!</li>
    <li> Received replacement and must apologize for Style Edit negative comments.  I finally received them.  I had said that they never came but a neighbor&#x27;s relative took them in for me while I was away and didn&#x27;t know that at the time.  I have not used them yet but at least I have them now.  I have used the Revlon ONE leave in spray conditioner and it is amazing!  A fantastic 5 star product that I will reorder when I run out.  It is seriously like magic!  It really does it all, as it says.  Lift, volume,  shine, silky and NO FRIZZ!!!!!  It is amazing and I never would have thought that Revlon would have such an upscale product that works on hair like Albert Einstein&#x27;s twin sister!!  I&#x27;m a senior and it makes my hair young and sexy again and EVERYONE has taken notice.  Looks like I had a Brazillian hair treatment and I didn&#x27;t.  WOW!!</li>
    <li> Love it for my curly hair but also works for my straight haired daughter.</li>
    <li> I  like. it  so  much.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells great as well?</li>

    <li> Love it! My hair finnaly are easy to brush :-)</li>
    <li> very nice, light leave in conditioner. Be careful not to use to much. My hair is med to short and I spray 2-3 pumps in the palm of my hand and then rub together and work thru my hair. Never feels heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> The Hair Treatment is the best treatment I have ever used. Thanks Amazon for the possibility to buy it.</li>
    <li> smells great and last long-hair does not get stiff</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Its a great product but too perfumed. It would be great if it came unscented.</li>
    <li> makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything special, like body or sheen that is significant</li>
    <li> Awful...completely awful! That&#x27;s the way I feel about the fragrance. I can&#x27;t tell you if the product works or not because I cannot get passed the smell. Like a perm or old lady strong perfume. I have to rewash my hair to get the stink out. I wouldn&#x27;t even pass this on to anyone. Not even my worst enemy! It&#x27;s really that bad. I wish I would have listened to the reviews on this product, because previous comments had stated how bad the fragrance was but I didn&#x27;t listen. Nope, instead I waited and waited for it to arrive in the mail. I had also ordered the cleansing conditioner but canceled it thinking it too would smell like the treatment spray. Not happy at all to have wasted more than $20. Do not buy or you will too be sorry!</li>
    <li> Good hair treatment !</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair look younger, gleamier, healthier.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> works pretty good - but it smells like an old man&#x27;s cologne, so don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;m gonna last with it.  im always lookin over my shoulder to see if there&#x27;s a cologne infused guy following me</li>
