      <li>The GNC pill crusher works way better.</li>
      <li>; yes it&#x27;s more like ground to sugar consistency rather than baby powder; it takes more than 1 turn to crush the pill.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great pot it does exactly what it should</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Doesn&#x27;t work on most of the tablets I tried to crush. Might work if your hands were strong as Samsons! Impossible to clean.  Would return but not worth the hassle even with Amazon&#x27;s easy returns.  I would take a refund if available!</li>
    <li> works great.used everyday</li>
    <li> I like this products...does the job and quickly. I tossed the other pill crusher I had...this one I will stick with.</li>
    <li> Crush pills as designed...love it!</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly and it is simple and easy to clean.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Only breaks them up slightly, does not crush.</li>
    <li> Crushes to a powder! I take a vitamin that I cannot take whole without choking. The vitamin is hard and nearly impossible to crush. I purchased this crusher with little hope. But to my dismay, it crushed my vitamin to fine powder. I have no problem crushing the pill with just a twist. My first use truly amazed me. Great little crusher!</li>
    <li> POOGreat little crusher!  Portable and fairly easy to use, though sometimes if you have a larger pill and don&#x27;t want to split it you really have to put some muscle into twisting and crushing, but overall gets the job done and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have purchased pill crushers before that would either break in crushing a large pill or would not crush well.  This one does exactly what is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Finally a crasher that works well and also beautiful and convenient. It is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t take much space in the purse.</li>
    <li> Has a smooth crushing surface, so is difficult to use.  Pill crushers that have a rough surface work much better and with less torque required.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product instead of Sabi&#x27;s pill crusher:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000KL1N3C Pill Crusher -Pill Pulverizer]]  This pill crusher by CM is what I currently use and is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had!  I recently bought the Sabi pill crusher because I wanted to have a backup on hand because I sometimes dropped the CM crusher due to arthritis in my fingers and a weakened grip.  I must say, it has yet to break, so it has proven to be of strong construction.  It&#x27;s not perfect:  the little blue covers on the top part are starting to come off and you have to wash out the crushing chamber every now and then because of pill reside, but those aren&#x27;t big issues with me.  Of all the crushers I&#x27;ve tried, the CM crusher has been the easiest one for me to hold and twist to crush the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to review the Sabi pill crusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Sabi pill crusher due to the 5 and 4-star reviews on Amazon and the advertising of this product as being easy to use and producing perfetly crushed pill powder \\&quot;with one twist\\&quot;.  I feel that I was duped and may contact Amazon to check on the authenticity of these reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst pill crusher I&#x27;ve ever used and really can&#x27;t believe anyone with arthritis or any other issues with their fingers or hands would find the Sabi pill crusher easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I think the design isn&#x27;t very well thought out.  The threads of the crushing chamber and the top, crushing part are both inside the crushing chamber where the powder from the pills can coat them.  Every pill I&#x27;ve crushed has left residue in the chamber and, of course, on all the threads in the base and the crusher top part.  What a pain to have to wipe these parts after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I find the pill storage actually too deep for my needs although someone else may need this large chamber.  The lid to this pill storage compartment just flips off and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would hold up to long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another drawbackis the overall design.  For me, it is very hard to hold the base in my left hand and turn the top part as there is nothing to help me grip it and both sections are smooth plastic.  I have to use more force to grip both parts due to this smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider my arthritis to be mild.  I do have constant pain with swelling, and weakness in some fingers and in my grip but still have full range of motion in all fingers.  I couldn&#x27;t even imagine someone with arthritic problems worse than me using this crusher at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the product features from the Amazon page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;-- Sabi Pill case with tear-shaped grip makes turning easy on hands/wrists&lt;br /&gt;-- Super-strong pill crusher mechanism ensures perfect powder with one twist&lt;br /&gt;-- Top cap opens for pill box storage to become 2-in-1 crusher-and-case&lt;br /&gt;-- Great for preparing medications for kids and pets&lt;br /&gt;-- Crushes hard-to-swallow pills into powder\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and product description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Sabi Crush tablets of all shapes, sizes and textures into a fine powder, with minimal effort and twisting with the Crush pill crusher. Can also be used for animal health. BPA-free and medical-grade, antibacterial plastic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with these statements:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Sabi Pill case with tear-shaped grip makes turning easy on hands/wrists\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it is NOT easy on the hands/wrists because it is too small and there is nothing to help my fingers hold on to each section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Super-strong pill crusher mechanism ensures perfect powder with one twist\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this not to be true at all.  Some of my pills have required multiple twists to turn the pills to powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Sabi Crush tablets of all shapes, sizes and textures into a fine powder, with minimal effort and twisting with the Crush pill crusher.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to use more than minimal effort and twisting to turn some of my pills into powder and have had to grip the base quite hardwith most of my pills which causes pain in my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone without arthritis or other issues with their fingers/hands may find the Sabi pil crusher easy to use, but I doubt that anyone who does have finger/hand issues would be able to use it with ease.</li>
    <li> This is a great pill crusher.  It is very easy to use and you will be able to crush your pills without much effort at all.  The design is very comfortable to use and does not hurt your fingers or palm.  The pill box is also a very good size so you will be able to store quite a few pills in there.  A good product!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really crush the pills in the manner that I thought.  The GNC pill crusher works way better.</li>
    <li> Regrettably, this product doesn&#x27;t reduce the pill to powder.  I had to use a hammer to finish the job.</li>
    <li> Works just like it&#x27;s supposed to. We use it for glucosamine so we can sprinkle it on dog food.</li>
    <li> It makes it fun to crush pills!</li>
    <li> I liked the product! Works very well for my household. I was impressed with the quality of the plastic. It&#x27;s pretty heavy duty.</li>
    <li> Got this one to my dad on Father&#x27;s day and he loves it... I wasn&#x27;t really sure if he would like it but he said it is really useful and he likes the look of it.</li>
    <li> Broke up my adderall pill into fine powder in 20 twist.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to use. Works on large pills as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job in crushing. The only issue I have with it is the bottom ring seems to catch some of the crushed pill. We ended up taping it on a plate to get the rest out and then brushed it on a spoon. Its a good thing to have tho since I have 2 guys in the home who cant swallow pills.</li>
    <li> I bought this to crush up my dogs pills and it does a great job was very impressed with the qualiy</li>
    <li> I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.  My oldest son is sometimes prescribed various different medications for his ADHD, asthma, and allergies. Some of these medications are only available in pill form for his age. He has a hard time swallowing pills and what a fight it is! Crushing them with the back of a spoon like I usually sends particles flying all over the place. I then have to scrape them up to mix with usually applesauce or whipped cream. With this pill crusher, I can store his medications that he needs in the lid, which snaps off and back on. Crushing them is soooo easy with this thing. It doesn&#x27;t look like it would work since there are no teeth, grinders, etc. It is smooth on the underside. But it&#x27;s tear shaped design gives you a good grip, and with one twist, his pills are literally ground to a fine powder. I could easily see how this would be great for people with arthritis, or for anyone who needs the convenience of a crusher and a container all in one!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I&lt;br /&gt;have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> Does not work well for small tablets.  Had to purchase another brand of pill crusher.</li>
    <li> It will smash you pills with little effert</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product it doesn&#x27;t crush big pills</li>
    <li> EFFORTLESS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review the Sabi CRUSH Minimal Effort Pill Crusher and was very pleased with the ease of use. Simply place the pill inside the tub, screw down the handle, and your medicine is ready to use! This CRUSH is great to assist in making pills easier to swallow! If you are going to be out and about with your loved one and need to keep pills for crushing, no problem! This pill crusher has an easy open pill box in the lid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> CRUSH 2-in-1 Pill Crusher/Container is an easy pill smasher that creates a  powder form of medication and vitamins that is easier to ingest in food or liquids.  My husband became an instant fan of this product as with the greatest ease of a simple twisting motion of the CRUSH, he effortlessly  pulverized vitamins which I then mixed into a glass of orange juice. The conveniently included pill box in the top cap of the 2-in-1 CRUSH for storage of pills in a self-contained case is a great idea. - See more at: [...]</li>
    <li> For those who can&#x27;t swallow pills this is the perfect fix. It can also be carried with you anywhere you go.&lt;br /&gt;The Sabi pill crusher has a small compartment up top to store your pills in. Just unscrew the top blue piece from the bottom white piece, throw the pill inside. Screw the blue lid back on and voila! You now have the crushed to a powder pill. Just add to water or juice or even, for kids, applesauce. Also perfect if you have to hide pills in food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> I have severe RA and this tool was very easy to use. No pain on my wrists and hands. Crushed my pills to the consistency that I like to. Also worked well with my dogs meds too!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Idea: Crush up your multivitamins and put in your smoothies for better absorption! That&#x27;s my plan for my Sabi Crush.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher mills any pill into a fine powder i love this especially if you can&#x27;t get one to take their pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Reading over the other reviews--- they are correct. Probably not a good thing if you have arthirtis; the pill container on top is unnesc. deep; yes it&#x27;s more like ground to sugar consistency rather than baby powder; it takes more than 1 turn to crush the pill.  So, while there may be other products out there, I&#x27;m really happy with this one! One of those things that you didn&#x27;t realize could make your day-to-day life so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to crush my dogs pills and put them in her food--- thus I don&#x27;t worry about any of the issues mentioned by others. Except that the container is unnesc. deep. It easily, effortlessly and consistently crushes the pills. It&#x27;s not messy because everything is contained within it. And it stores easily in my drawer. I also think the quality is good-- thick plastic, the lid isn&#x27;t going to break (knock on wood!), etc.</li>
    <li> When I first use the pill crusher it worked very well, it broke up the pills into small pieces. Than after using the pill crusher for almost a month it was harder to break pills into small pieces and I had to apply more force. The added force  caused the plastic groves to became stuck and I striped one of the groves causing it to be unusable. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> My tween son has one vitamin that he despises the taste. We crush those pills and put them in vcaps for easy swallowing with no taste. We&#x27;ve tried a few crushers in the past and this one works the same. Drop pill in the deep well, turn a few times and you get a sandy like consistency. Repeat multiple times if you want it finer but you won&#x27;t get a dust like consistency as some crushers provide. Because it has the container on top to hold the pills, it makes it perfect for taking with us on weekend trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> I love being able to split pills efficiently down the middle for DD when we are forced to give her anything stronger than she should have or can handle. Not only are these both effective tools, they are both small enough to toss in a purse, diaper or gym bag, and any type of luggage just in case you might need them on the go as well!&lt;br /&gt;Read more at [...]</li>
    <li> I have to admit, the crush has made my life easier. My kiddos have a hard time taking pills, so the crush has allowed me to crush their pills down easily and mix it in with yogurt or applesauce. The only thing I see as an issue is that it doesn&#x27;t crush it down into a consistency that i would prefer. I mean, it does crush it ( sometimes I have to turn more than  once to do so- but it works overall), but it doesn&#x27;t turn it into the powder form I would like to see. My kids can tell, which is fine for the older ones, but my 5 year old doesn&#x27;t like it as much. Overall, it has been very useful and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> This is fabulous for &amp;#34;hiding&amp;#34; my dog&#x27;s pill in his food. I grind it up and mix it in wet dog food. He can smell it, but he is at least willing to eat it that way. The only method that works besides just cramming the dang pill down his throat.</li>
    <li> The product was very easy to use and crushed the pills without any problems. It was very easy to handle and did what I expected. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful pill crusher . Easy to clean. . . Best One that I have ever used . Love It . Would but again</li>
    <li> hard to turn with arthritis fingers</li>
    <li> It was nice to have a pill crusher that didn&#x27;t break after the first use.  I have repeatedly used this product and it&#x27;s still working great each and every time.</li>
    <li> I love it! The pill crusher crushes pills to a perfect powder. It&#x27;s super easy to use and self explanatory. Some pills may not crush all the way at one go. And when I&#x27;m not using it for crushing pills, I keep my vitamins and minerals for daily intake!</li>
    <li> This item worked for less than 4 months - stopped crushing the pills.  Be weary if need for long-term use.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that I am very glad I was able to review. I love how this holds my pills in the top and then when I need one crushed up I can just take on out, unscrew the top from the bottom drop the pill in and crush it. This is a great two in one product.&lt;br /&gt; I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I was literally amazed how this pill crusher actually crushed my pills. I had gotten a chance to review this great product from Tomoson, and I am beyond thrilled with the results. I am so happy I own one of these. I just love it, and it&#x27;s great for people who hate taking horse pills like me for instance. All my worries are gone now (: Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works good.  Leave a few &amp;#34;crumbles&amp;#34; behind but easy to get.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it makes pill taking a breeze for daughter who hasn&#x27;t quite mastered the art of swallowing pills whole.  I also like that blue top of the CRUSH doubles as a pill box.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to keep in my purse or diaper bag.  I would definitely recommend this product for those who have difficultly with swallowing pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I have a hard time taking pills and taking my prenatal vitamins is the worst. So using this product has really helped me. I just turn the cap and it easily crushes my large prenatal vitamins and then I add them into my smoothies in the morning and I never taste them. I think it&#x27;s a great product and I love that it bonuses as a pill container. There is plenty of room to keep quite a few pills in there. It&#x27;s perfect for traveling with and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> I received one of these to review on my blog.  My 10 yr old son gets migraines and has trouble swallowing pills so I thought this would be nice for him.  I tried it. When unscrew to put the pills in it was a little hard for me to get the threads aligned.  I had 2 excedrins in the base.  I had to really put some torque behind it to crush the two pills and it wasn&#x27;t crushed very fine.  I had to unscrew it then screw it again 3X to get it to an acceptable consistency that my son could comfortable swallow in some pudding or applesauce.  The built in pill box is nice.  It&#x27;s a sturdy product.  It&#x27;s travel size so it would be easy to stick in a purse.  I think those with arthritis or issues with grip strength would have a hard time with this product though</li>
    <li> It is extremely difficult to crush any pill with this crusher without putting stress on your wrist. You have to break large pills in two and place them a certain way for them to crush without many painful rotations.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t intend to order this pill crusher.  In looking at the crusher, it looks like a pretty good one.  I seems to have most of the features of the one I did order.  I am thinking it may be a little less convenient because the crusher would be a little harder to hang onto.</li>
    <li> Great product for those who wants the pill&#x27;s a little mashed, but if you are searching for dust this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> the pill crusher is very good. will crush the pills to almost a powder so if you have a problem with getting pills down this will slove it that is how good it is.</li>
    <li> When you just want to crush that one pill or vitamin, aren&#x27;t interested in getting out the mortar and pestle just for one pill, or if you have arthritis or weak hands and cannot easily crush pills (or other things similar to them).. then this is your answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve used it personally to crush everything from non-chewable vitamins (to pour into juice) to cloves (for cooking). My wife has used it to crush medications, aspirin, you name it. It works great and is easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite because it allows you to crush up your pills completely. You can then sprinkle them onto your food or mix them with water instead of trying to swallow a huge pill. We recently bought some vitamins that are chewable but that taste horrible. My kids won&#x27;t even touch them, and to be honest, I don&#x27;t blame them! This product makes it easy to crush up vitamins or other pills that are too big or bulky to swallow for easy consumption. I also like that you can store your pills inside the container. This makes it really easy to bring your meds with you on-the-go.</li>
    <li> Great little product. One twist chops up the pill and a second turns it into a powder.  This is perfect for someone who also doesn&#x27;t have a lot of strength. Great for the elderly.</li>
    <li> It just so happened that the week after I received the CRUSH Minimal effort pill crusher, that I got a cold and had some massive pills prescribed. I, sadly, am not able to swallow large pills so I had a chance to try both the pill crushers. They worked perfectly! With a simple twist or two the pill was pulverized and ready to be dissolved or added to a food for consumption&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> I like how ez it is to use the pill crusher and that larger pills can be broken down well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Both of our dogs take two supplements that are supposed to be chewable (Denosyl &amp; Marin), but the aren&#x27;t too crazy about the taste. We&#x27;ve been crushing them on the kitchen counter with a can of dog food, but the results vary and it&#x27;s messy. These are big tablets, so I wasn&#x27;t sure this gadget would be big enough to crush them. When it arrived I was happy to see that it&#x27;s big enough and strong enough to easily crush the tablets. I can even fit a weekend supply in the pill container for out of town trips and camping weekends. Very nice product!</li>
    <li> too hard to crush the pills. Not worth the price</li>
    <li> I have found this easy to use. It takes a few twists to crush a large pill but it does not take much force. Usually if it does not crush easily it&#x27;s just a matter of moving the pill but it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to crush it. The lid on the storage compartment is not secure, so it&#x27;s not really that great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to clean. The ridges gather pill dust and the two compartments (top and bottom) fill with water when I throw it in my dishwasher.</li>
    <li> This little device gave me a great big thanks from my wife and one of my daughters who help care for my elderly mother.  They told me it was wonderful and made pill crushing and splitting so much nicer.  We recommend this little, simple device.  It can handle even the toughest of pills!</li>
    <li> This would be handy if it crushed pills of all sizes. Bought this for someone who can&#x27;t swallow pills to take with them on a long vacation. Figured it was small enough to carry in a pocket. Well it crushes medium/large pills fine but for some reason it completely misses small ones. Doesn&#x27;t even dent the dang things. What&#x27;s up with that? A pill crusher should crush all pills easily. It has one job for crying out loud! Baffling since the threads do go all the way down to the bottom of the well. Seems silly to me.</li>
    <li> There are instances when liquid medicine is not available or the pill form is cheaper so my mom used to crush our medicine when we were younger. She would use a pestle (the one she uses to pound garlic) and the medicine would often launch off the table. I was excited to try the Sabi CRUSH 2-in-1 Pill Crusher because I know this would be handy specially for my daughters. I tried crushing a pill and was glad I used minimal force to grind the pill. I only had to turn it once to grind the pill. If you like a finer texture, twist it again for the second time. It&#x27;s very lightweight and the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Save your money. This device is simply not up to the task.  Fails to crush anything but very soft pills.</li>
    <li> This things works very well on all pills.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth manual pill crusher and this one does a very nice job of crushing. Unlike all the others, this one doesn&#x27;t hurt the hand while turning the knob down tight.</li>
    <li> Works well. Breaks pills to a powder. I use to crush vitamins then add it with other ingredients in my blender for&lt;br /&gt;smoothies.</li>
    <li> The wife says that it does NOT finely crush a large vitamin pill with just one twist; she has to loosen and retighten about 6 times, and even then she ends up having to dump the broken coarsely broken up pill into a mortar and pestle to get the fine powder she wanted. Also, going through all that hurt her wrists.</li>
    <li> This pill crusher works great.  I use it to crush pills for my young daughter and then mix the powder with juice or applesauce.</li>
    <li> Finally someone made a pill crusher that works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pill crusher is the best one we have ever used&lt;br /&gt;and we have several and they all junk compared&lt;br /&gt;to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad cannot swallow pills without crushing them.</li>
    <li> I have to say that my hands don&#x27;t have much strenght in them at times so I waited until I had one of these day to use it . I like the shape of it cause for me it made it easy to hold on to cause I could get it set in between my thumb and my pointer finger and get a good grip with my hands on this day.  I did have to screw the crusher twice when I used it but it was because it started to cross thread for me but it was still easy for me to use.  It is not a fine powder but it is still small enough to add to food or to mix in a drink.  This is coming from someone who does have trouble opening stuff and has health problem and I do have mild arthritis.  I received my product for free and I am review this item from my own personal experiences.  I only recommend products that would personally use</li>
    <li> If you are like me and use a lot of medications, sometimes it just gets to be a little much when the pills are so darn big it&#x27;s hard to swallow them! So, I was very excited to get this new pill crusher from Sabi called Crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to you can take the very top off and store pills in there and then the bottom part of this pill crusher is where you will crush the pills. It&#x27;s very easy to use and I like that it&#x27;s super easy to clean out and ready to go for the next time you need to crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have RA &amp; Fibromyalgia so I can appreciate these small things that might not seem like a big deal to some people, but when you have no strength sometimes to do simple things, it does mean a lot. My hands are my weakest link so having products that make my life much easier to handle is important to me. Such a small thing like this makes a huge difference in my life. On the days that I feel I just can&#x27;t swallow another big pill, it&#x27;s nice to know I have options. And that is really what makes products like this a godsend to me, it gives me back options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Most pill crushers on the market require repeated twisting and untwisting to get the job done, and can be very difficult on the hands. In addition, most pill crushers out there can only crush small pills and cannot handle turning larger pills into powder. I thought that this was awesome because I can store the ones that are too big for me to swallow and when I get ready to take them I just get this out and crush them and add to my hot tea or whatever else I am drinking and it&#x27;s done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> This works great, a heck of alot better than smashing between two spoons.A good product.</li>
    <li> My dog has arthritis in her back left leg and takes medication for the pain. But it is so difficult to get the pills down her throat. One of them is large, and the other is small. We tried the crusher tonight with both pills at one time (one oblong, one rectangular). I told my husband that he should split the pills in half (or more) before crushing, and should crush them one at a time. He had to push fairly hard to get the pills to crush. We were thinking about cutting them into smaller pieces when we looked inside - everything was crushed! We put the crushed pills into a piece of roast beef, and voila!, our dog too it without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Innovative design that crushes pills of any size or shape, and that is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Do have to exert some force to crush the pill. However, my husband has arthritis in his hands, and it was fairly easy for him to use the crusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the $10 I paid and the crusher I received.</li>
    <li> Best pill crusher I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m crushing very large, very hard brittle flea pills, and it does the trick.  I have to back off and re-crush several times to completely reduce to powder, but it works.  And there are no little teeth at the bottom for stuff to get stuck in.</li>
    <li> This thing would not crush anything unless it was the size of small walnut! I sent it back. It was impossible to screw it far enough down to crush a pill. Definitely don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> it really convenient to have so easy to use and crushes pills fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I was given a Sabi CRUSH to review and was pleasantly surprised by just how wonderful this pill crusher is.  I have tried others in the past and was disappointed because they did not crush the pills very well, but this one was an exception.  It works great.  I am even able to easily crush the pills with my weakened hands due to having muscular dystrophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this is a great pill crusher if you are in the market for one.  It has a bigger top which is easier for weakened or arthritic hands.  I personally have a lot of trouble swallowing pills and this really makes it a lot easier for me.  I believe that you would agree with me when you purchase this pill crusher.  It even has a little spot for you to put pills so that you can carry both the pill crusher and pills all in one place.  I find that to be a great novelty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> The CRUSH minimal Effort Pill Crusher allows you to  solve the big ill issue in a flash. All I had to do was place the pill in the crush chamber, put on the top and twist. I was expecting to need to do multiple twists to make it work, and was surprised when it stopped after less than a turn. I removed the lid to find the pill nicely crushed. The results were perfect for adding to juice or pet food to make taking medications a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of this crusher is that it features a pill holder in the top. It makes keeping track easier because if you need 3 a day, you put that many in the top each day, and you will always know if you missed a dose.&lt;br /&gt;rs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I had no issues using this, but can understand where people that have issues with grip might. but this is a really &amp;#34;handy&amp;#34; product to have around.</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on the descriptions \\&quot;Super-strong pill crusher mechanism ensures perfect powder with one twist\\&quot; and \\&quot;Crushes hard-to-swallow pills into fine powder with minimal effort\\&quot;.  With one twist it crushed my pill into a grainy, sand-like texture.  On several subsequent twists it broke down the grains a bit but it was still far from \\&quot;powdery\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I see the word \\&quot;powder\\&quot; in a product description, I expect the end result to be like baby powder, or powdered sugar.  This crusher just can&#x27;t seem accomplish what is stated in it&#x27;s description to my pills.  I have to dump the end product in my mortar and pestle to achieve my desired consistency.  I was sad to discover that it&#x27;s just not an effective tool for a one step bump and rail on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m disappointed with the performance of this product, considering the price and materials it&#x27;s made from, I&#x27;ll be quite honest in saying that I was prepared to write this review.  I would just appreciate it if the product description were not so misleading and exaggerated.</li>
    <li> It takes a great deal of twisting (as hard as you can) to get the pill to START crushing.  You have to get in there and crush the pill a little bit yourself with like the end of a pair of scissors and then start the process over again.  It&#x27;s time consuming but eventually you get your pill SOMEWHAT crushed/ in powder form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about 3 weeks with one pill per day.  Yesterday, the bottom part, where you put the pill... has cracked in a circle form around where the pill would sit.  SO, now it&#x27;s useless because the top of the crusher doesn&#x27;t reach the pill anymore because the cracks lowered the base portion.  So, so frustrating.  I can&#x27;t find a good pill crusher to save my life.  If anyone finds one, I&#x27;d love to know!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a high quality pill crusher around and now I have found one! This really does a great job at crushing pills and with little effort. I also love that it has a place to store pills...big plus!! Now when my kids need to take a pill (which they absolutely refuse to do...) I can crush them up and place in food or drinks and not have to fight them to take their medications. Love this pill crusher very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> This is a terrific product! It crushes pills better than any other crusher I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s so neat that you can store the pills right in the top! I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this. It&#x27;s making my life easier.</li>
    <li> I really like this pill crusher! This works great... some pills are harder then others and you might have to twist it again, but it does a great job in very small amount of time! . :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works well.  I found the best way to give pill medications to cats is to crush them, and mix with food.</li>
    <li> very helpful for old hands</li>
    <li> exceeded expectations perfect for my pets meds</li>
    <li> This crusher works pretty well. It did make my wrist a bit sore trying to twist as tight as possible but it did the job.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> To be honest I sent it back for refund I wasn&#x27;t happy with it and the turning hurt my hands there was nothing to really help me apply a good grip to turn and grind with.</li>
    <li> Crushed a large pill up easily.  While I do have a little arthritis and carpel tunnel, I had no trouble turning the bottle to crush the tablet.  It did leave a few pieces that weren&#x27;t as fine as the rest and just had to shake it all to one side and do it again in order to get it all to a fine powder.  Am mixing this with the dog food so wanted it pretty fine so the dog wouldn&#x27;t find/taste it.</li>
    <li> Works great and crushes pills effortlessly.  Just as described..</li>
    <li> Since having gastric bypass surgery, all my pills must be crushed.  I can&#x27;t believe that this pill crusher works as good as it does. I am very happy with this product.</li>
