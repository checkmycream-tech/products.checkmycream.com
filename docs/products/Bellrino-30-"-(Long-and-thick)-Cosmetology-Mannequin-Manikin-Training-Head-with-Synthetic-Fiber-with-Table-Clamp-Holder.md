      <li>The face looks like the picture, and the makeup is painted on good.</li>
      <li>This mannequin is good for someone who doesn&#x27;t mind these things.</li>
      <li>She knows so many braids, it blows my mind!  </li>
      <li>She found it best to use a large tooth comb to comb through &amp;#34;Rita&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair.</li>
      <li>The length is nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent as a practice head for older kids or adults that want to practice braiding.  </li>
      <li>Her hair is very easy to comb.  </li>
      <li>The hair is easy to work with and stays fairly tangle free.</li>
      <li>The head has some give even once it&#x27;s clamped but for the most part, it stays put.</li>
      <li>so glad i have it now.</li>
      <li>They love to fix hair..</li>
      <li>I love the manikin.</li>
      <li>It styles nicely, and there is so much more she can do with the extra length.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my nine year old grand daughter that wanted a Barbie Head</li>
      <li>I received my mannequin head quickly but the hair started coming out the first time i was braiding her hair.</li>
      <li>She picked this out and spent her own birthday money on it.</li>
      <li>She loves it except for it not having a definite &amp;#34;direction&amp;#34; for the hair on the top.</li>
      <li>I can see younger kids liking this very much, better than the toy head versions in the toy aisle.  </li>

      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I really, really like this mannequin head.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t so gentle.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it tangles a bit, but so does real hair.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with the stand, while other products require you to purchase this separately.</li>
      <li>She owns another hair-styling head, but it was not intended for professional use, and you can really tell the difference!  </li>
      <li>Some updo&#x27;s are difficult, but she is a great practice head.</li>
      <li>Besides the bald spot her hair really is thick, and nice.</li>
      <li>By no means is this professional.</li>
      <li>Bought for Christmas for my 4 yr and 6 yr old girls.  </li>
      <li>This head has very long, very realistic hair.  </li>
      <li>There is an odd part and cowlick on the top that makes it harder to do an even French braid</li>
      <li>I recommend her to someone who wants to do simple hairstyles, and loves long hair.</li>
      <li>For the price, and her long, thick hair I am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>It was almost impossible to do a nice looking French braid because I could not get the hair to smooth down.    </li>
      <li>Ordered for my nine yr old, loves this,  fixes hair daily and does a different style always.  </li>
      <li>Not to happy :(</li>

<li> Just like the picture the hair is long, and silky.</li>

<li> The hair is very thick, soft, and shiny.</li>
<li> We tried using inexpensive wigs but they are so hard to keep in place and they tangle constantly.</li>
<li> Some chunks go to the left, some to the right, but there isn&#x27;t a defining line or a part to work with, so she gets frustrated when trying to do small, intricate braids.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little odd to look at but it clamps to a table or counter.</li>
<li> but we can usually work around it.</li>
<li> holds no type of curl and is hard to work with</li>
<li> I bought this product for my tween-age daughter, who has become obsessed with doing hair.  </li>
<li> THIS is a awful doll head.</li>

    <li> I liked the product it was great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my tween-age daughter, who has become obsessed with doing hair.  She knows so many braids, it blows my mind!  She owns another hair-styling head, but it was not intended for professional use, and you can really tell the difference!  This head has very long, very realistic hair.  It styles nicely, and there is so much more she can do with the extra length.  I love that it comes with the stand, while other products require you to purchase this separately.</li>
    <li> wont curl, wont take bleach. THIS is a awful doll head.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my nine yr old, loves this,  fixes hair daily and does a different style always.  All the kids play hair stylist constantly.  Made the greatest gift.</li>
    <li> hair is not as long as expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair I used for cosmotology class. Just like the picture the hair is long, and silky.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this mannequin head. I only use it for braiding. Sometimes it tangles a bit, but so does real hair. The only thing I&#x27;d change about it is that I&#x27;d make the head a little bigger. Either its head is small or the people whose hair I braid have large heads. :*) I really like the fact that it came with a clamp to attach it to a table.</li>
    <li> The hair falls out and is not really what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love the manikin. Im so glad i have it now. It got here on time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent as a practice head for older kids or adults that want to practice braiding.  I can see younger kids liking this very much, better than the toy head versions in the toy aisle.  By no means is this professional.</li>
    <li> I use this for modeling hats and also synthetic dreadlocks. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got this for my nine year old grand daughter that wanted a Barbie Head so she could practice doing braids.  She loves it! She was braiding it and doing pony tails with barrets and hair pins! She found it best to use a large tooth comb to comb through &amp;#34;Rita&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair.</li>
    <li> With this mannequin, there are pros and cons. Every head is different, but this is what I found with my mannequin.  Pros  The hair is very thick, soft, and shiny. The length is nice. The face looks like the picture, and the makeup is painted on good. The table stand works great, and her head moves around in the stand. Her hair is very easy to comb.  Cons  She does have a bald spot. If you look at her from the back, you can&#x27;t tell, but in the front it&#x27;s bald where her part would be.  Because of the way they put her hair in, it is hard to smooth down. It was almost impossible to do a nice looking French braid because I could not get the hair to smooth down.    This mannequin is good for someone who doesn&#x27;t mind these things. Besides the bald spot her hair really is thick, and nice. Some updo&#x27;s are difficult, but she is a great practice head. For the price, and her long, thick hair I am satisfied.  I recommend her to someone who wants to do simple hairstyles, and loves long hair.</li>
    <li> Very good. Would tell others to buy</li>
    <li> My 11 year-old daughter had become a big fan of braiding and playing with longer hair. We tried using inexpensive wigs but they are so hard to keep in place and they tangle constantly. She picked this out and spent her own birthday money on it. It&#x27;s a little odd to look at but it clamps to a table or counter. The head has some give even once it&#x27;s clamped but for the most part, it stays put. The hair is easy to work with and stays fairly tangle free. There is an odd part and cowlick on the top that makes it harder to do an even French braid but we can usually work around it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 12 y/o daughter for a birthday present. She loves it except for it not having a definite &amp;#34;direction&amp;#34; for the hair on the top. Some chunks go to the left, some to the right, but there isn&#x27;t a defining line or a part to work with, so she gets frustrated when trying to do small, intricate braids.</li>
    <li> holds no type of curl and is hard to work with</li>
    <li> Bought for Christmas for my 4 yr and 6 yr old girls.  They love to fix hair..but my head hurts after a while.  Lol.  They aren&#x27;t so gentle.  These are perfect for them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product ...</li>
    <li> I received my mannequin head quickly but the hair started coming out the first time i was braiding her hair. There are thinning places and my bf says she needs Rogaine... Not to happy :(</li>
