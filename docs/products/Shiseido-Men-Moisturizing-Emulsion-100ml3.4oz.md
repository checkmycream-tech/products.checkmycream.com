### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent place to shop.</li>
      <li>with &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone complexion is a perfect match.  </li>
      <li>The best one that I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Works and price is very good.</li>
      <li>Good deal!</li>
      <li>great moisturizer for men</li>
      <li>He is happy to use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great value for the money.  </li>
      <li>its ok , not the best as the revitalizer</li>
      <li>Does not have SPF which is probably good if you spend a lot of time outdoors.</li>
      <li>The lotion does a great job of keeping my face from drying throughout the whole day, and it feels great soothing the skin after a shave.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, fast to absorb and good smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from CVS stuff to Clinique to other fancy brands and this one seems to work the best for me.  </li>
      <li>The produce seems genuine.</li>
      <li>It dries fast, alcohol-free, applies easily, non-oily, very light to no fragance, and keeps the face moisturized almost all day</li>
      <li>but when I do it feels nice and am hoping I can use it more often but feel the need that I don&#x27;t need to moisten my face because it gets oily later on in the day.</li>
      <li>Not bad I guess...</li>
      <li>I have used this cleaners along with Shiseido Moisturizing Emulsion for years, super quality product.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer has a nice feel to it, but the general recommendation is to avoid putting alcohol on your face, which this product does contain.  </li>
      <li>The lotion has a smooth watery texture which makes it easy to apply but the alcohol in the product really dries out the skin, likely negating the effects of the moisturizer and causes skin to become oily easily.</li>
      <li>So I am glad to find a one that he is willing to use regularly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time now and is great however, this time my product arrived without a box (no biggie) and was not sealed (big deal to me).</li>
      <li>Great product, not sure why was discontinued by Shiseido ?!</li>
      <li>Men are actually very picky about their lotion.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this face lotion, and will probably be using it for as long as they make it.</li>
      <li>Highly recomended if you need it for every day use.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just right for my Asian skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this actually too much</li>
      <li>The only reason I give this 4 stars over 5 is because I used this product since I was in high school.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and usually I go through a bottle simply because I use too much.  </li>

<li> Strange too that the ingredient list for this product cannot be found anywhere.</li>
<li> has cleared up redness and dry skin</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, and a bottle will usually last me a year.</li>
<li> However after this last trip and see their prices pulled out iPhone Amazon app and what do you know each product was half the price.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s no much to say about this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 16 years.</li>
<li> This serves as a base layer of moisture while another deep moisturizer goes on top.</li>
<li> They also make a little exfoliating brush that I use when I remember.  </li>
<li> It has a very slight scent to no scent at all, depending on who you ask.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure if my skin is changing, but every night around 5-6pm, my face starts releasing the lotion, which gives off an oily look.</li>
<li> And we know dry skin is bad.</li>
<li> If you are tough guy weekend warrior like me never putting on sunscreen flyfishing, shooting, etc.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> its ok , not the best as the revitalizer</li>
    <li> It was what I need. I went to the local shop three times, but it took long time to get my order. After I ordered from here, it was only a week or so. There was no box as seen and no seal on the bottle. The produce seems genuine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time now and is great however, this time my product arrived without a box (no biggie) and was not sealed (big deal to me).</li>
    <li> The only reason I give this 4 stars over 5 is because I used this product since I was in high school. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin but I&#x27;m not sure if my skin is changing, but every night around 5-6pm, my face starts releasing the lotion, which gives off an oily look.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a nice feel to it, but the general recommendation is to avoid putting alcohol on your face, which this product does contain.  Shiseido&#x27;s idea seems to be, since we&#x27;re men, we can take it.</li>
    <li> have been using for a month and works well. has cleared up redness and dry skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from CVS stuff to Clinique to other fancy brands and this one seems to work the best for me.  It dries fast, alcohol-free, applies easily, non-oily, very light to no fragance, and keeps the face moisturized almost all day (some days, i have to re-apply).  It&#x27;s a great value for the money.  PS:  Does not have SPF which is probably good if you spend a lot of time outdoors.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no much to say about this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 16 years. Shiseido is my #1 choice for my skin care needs.&lt;br /&gt;I received this order 4 days after the order. Not bad I guess...</li>
    <li> Great product, not sure why was discontinued by Shiseido ?!</li>
    <li> I have been using Shiseido Emulsion for a long time now.  Works and price is very good.</li>
    <li> The lotion has a smooth watery texture which makes it easy to apply but the alcohol in the product really dries out the skin, likely negating the effects of the moisturizer and causes skin to become oily easily. Strange too that the ingredient list for this product cannot be found anywhere.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, fast to absorb and good smell. The best one that I have ever tried. Highly recomended if you need it for every day use.</li>
    <li> My daily routine consists of using a sulfur wash in the shower, so my face comes out dry. And we know dry skin is bad. I use this after scrubbing my face with the associated tonic water. This serves as a base layer of moisture while another deep moisturizer goes on top. Been using this for years and it&#x27;s just right for my Asian skin. Not too oily.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this face lotion, and will probably be using it for as long as they make it. It has a very slight scent to no scent at all, depending on who you ask. The lotion does a great job of keeping my face from drying throughout the whole day, and it feels great soothing the skin after a shave.  A little goes a long way, and a bottle will usually last me a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves it. Its not scented. Its not sticky. He is happy to use it. Men are actually very picky about their lotion. So I am glad to find a one that he is willing to use regularly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this actually too much but when I do it feels nice and am hoping I can use it more often but feel the need that I don&#x27;t need to moisten my face because it gets oily later on in the day.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleaners along with Shiseido Moisturizing Emulsion for years, super quality product.  As a male this is about as fancy as I get and can remember daily.  Using these two products for a male esp. with &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone complexion is a perfect match.  They also make a little exfoliating brush that I use when I remember.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and usually I go through a bottle simply because I use too much.  Just a pea size dab should do the trick.  If you are tough guy weekend warrior like me never putting on sunscreen flyfishing, shooting, etc.  I do actually notice the difference when I consistently use both products and when I run out and lazy and don&#x27;t want to run to Nordstroms.  However after this last trip and see their prices pulled out iPhone Amazon app and what do you know each product was half the price.  Good deal!</li>
    <li> Always like to use this lotion. Excellent place to shop.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer for men</li>
</ol>
