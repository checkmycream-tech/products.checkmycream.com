### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The GiGi Creme wax with Tea Tree Oil is the best waxing product that I have used till now.</li>
      <li>Good quality wax!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who has a wax warming machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is also not that great.</li>
      <li>The warmer is a great tool too.</li>
      <li>It works really good</li>
      <li>Best of all, it removed all the hair the first time and works on the rest of the body too!</li>
      <li>I ordered more from GIGI since i was so happy.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>liked the wax, I thought it did a really nice job.  </li>
      <li>have not been able to find one, I think I will end up making my wax...</li>
      <li>the more I use it.</li>
      <li>I think it is more soothing for stomach and front of bikini, as well as legs than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>This worked great on my eyebrows and lip but bikini not so much.</li>
      <li>I think I will get better at this</li>
      <li>The wax spreads easily when warm; just don&#x27;t let it get too cool</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you know what you are doing and own the warmer!</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair so this wax worked fine for me.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasent scent and just feels gentler than the honey waxes - goes on easy and comes off smoothly.</li>
      <li>Compact easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>The texture of the wax is fantastic, it melts well, goes on smooth and comes off quite well.  </li>
      <li>This product may not have a nice smell as others such as the sweet honey smell</li>
      <li>The coarse eyebrow hairs which I always plucked actually CAME OFF with this wax, root and everything which was very surprising to me.</li>
      <li>I throw it right away.</li>
      <li>All in all a positive first experience!</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave as many residue as the other waxes does after waxing and it can be easily remove by after wax \\&quot;oil\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I got my first eyebrow wax with this product at a salon</li>
      <li>It smells good, is very gentle, and holds onto my coarse facial hair.  </li>
      <li>I usually use moom&#x27;s wax but after reading good reviews about this I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>i love the Brazilian wax i got from salons, but was expensive, after trying a couple of waxes i found this one and LOVE IT !</li>
      <li>The Gigi Wax off also does not work very well...</li>
      <li>I would say, overall, the great job this wax does outweighs the small annoyances.</li>
      <li>This product is best at use when is preheated at least half an hour to an hour beforehand.</li>
      <li>It takes longer than 25 minutes to heat up the wax, especially when the canister is full.  </li>
      <li>but the smell is really bad(like strong paint smell) but other then that it works.</li>
      <li>I am highly recommending this product.</li>
      <li>or it gums up a little bit on your applicator (as most waxes will).  </li>
      <li>You still need to use epilating strips (muslin or non-woven disposable) as its not a hard wax.</li>
      <li>The honey was too sticky in my opinion and the blue azulene has to be just the right temperature/consistency</li>
      <li>and I was VERY surprised at the results.</li>
      <li>I just used this wax for the first time today with no mishaps or big messes!</li>
      <li>I was super excited when opening the box and then realized that the wax container/box had broken and the wax even leaked out and made it stick with the packaging bag.</li>
      <li>In regards to actually pulling up hair, this wax picks up the hair very well.  </li>
      <li>I might as well buy the natural wax which has honey and vinegar.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Like other reviews, I have found that it does leave more residue than some waxes, BUT it usually only happens when I don&#x27;t cover it enough with the strip.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get any short or fine hairs left and there is very little redness after waxing.  </li>
      <li>since the wax cools down quickly after it leaves the warmer making it harder to apply.</li>
      <li>I took me about 3-4 times to really get the tricks down for self waxing but and a pro now and continue to by this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the honey wax and blue azulene GiGi wax for my face (chin, upper lip &amp; brow) with some success over the past several years.  </li>
      <li>This creme wax is far less sticky than a regular &#x27;honey&#x27; type wax, but that doesn&#x27;t mean its less effective at all, just easier to work with.</li>

<li> If hair is long and dense, TRIM it with a trimmer before waxing.  </li>

<li> In short... this product is not worth it...</li>
<li> I was so nervous but just be careful &amp; take your time</li>

<li> Now I don&#x27;t have to waste my hard earned money for something I can do myself.</li>
<li> and I usually turn on the warmer about 35 minutes before I wax.  </li>
<li> There was no residue left behind on my skin like the sticky stuff that honey waxes leave behind.</li>
<li> Less painful than some salon</li>
<li> It also left a nasty residue behind on my skin that I literally had to scrape off with my loofah and scrub.</li>
<li> BUT, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either!</li>
<li> This is horrible.</li>
<li> The worst part is removing the residue.</li>
<li> It did NOT remove any hair at all (I used it on my leg) and was sticky (worst ever for removing the residue afterward).</li>
<li> Terrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am an esthetician and purchased this for my home use.  It smells good, is very gentle, and holds onto my coarse facial hair.  Highly recommended if you know what you are doing and own the warmer!</li>
    <li> The product looks different from the picture but I guess its the same. It works really good but the smell is really bad(like strong paint smell) but other then that it works. PS its hard to take off the residue its really sticky.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my eyebrows and lip but bikini not so much. I will keep going to the salon for bikini waxes or find another wax for the bikini area.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing myself for years, and this wax is not as sticky as the others plus it doesn&#x27;t pull on your skin harshly. I must admit, I have only used it twice so I have yet to test it out thoroughly.</li>
    <li> The GiGi Creme wax with Tea Tree Oil is the best waxing product that I have used till now. It is not as sticky and harsh on the skin as the honey wax. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave as many residue as the other waxes does after waxing and it can be easily remove by after wax \\&quot;oil\\&quot;. This product may not have a nice smell as others such as the sweet honey smell BUT, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either! Basically it just smell like wax.  This product is best at use when is preheated at least half an hour to an hour beforehand. I am highly recommending this product.</li>
    <li> This product is so badddddddd.... The worst part is removing the residue. The Gigi Wax off also does not work very well... The smell is also not that great. I might as well buy the natural wax which has honey and vinegar. have not been able to find one, I think I will end up making my wax... In short... this product is not worth it...</li>
    <li> I just used this wax for the first time today with no mishaps or big messes! I was so nervous but just be careful &amp; take your time you should have no problem using this wax. I think I will get better at this the more I use it. I think I could have had the wax a little warmer (I used the lowest setting. Next time I will use the Med heat setting.) since the wax cools down quickly after it leaves the warmer making it harder to apply. All in all a positive first experience!</li>
    <li> This creme wax is far less sticky than a regular &#x27;honey&#x27; type wax, but that doesn&#x27;t mean its less effective at all, just easier to work with.

    <li> The texture of the wax is fantastic, it melts well, goes on smooth and comes off quite well.  I dont&#x27; typically have problems unless I use it on loose skin like arm pits.  THAT&#x27;s a NONO!  I think it is more soothing for stomach and front of bikini, as well as legs than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wax to use with my [[ASIN:B0030ZRS7A GiGi Wax Warmer]].  It takes longer than 25 minutes to heat up the wax, especially when the canister is full.  I don&#x27;t mind the wait, but the packaging suggests 25 minutes and I usually turn on the warmer about 35 minutes before I wax.  The wax spreads easily when warm; just don&#x27;t let it get too cool or it gums up a little bit on your applicator (as most waxes will).  Like other reviews, I have found that it does leave more residue than some waxes, BUT it usually only happens when I don&#x27;t cover it enough with the strip.  In regards to actually pulling up hair, this wax picks up the hair very well.  I don&#x27;t get any short or fine hairs left and there is very little redness after waxing.  I would say, overall, the great job this wax does outweighs the small annoyances.</li>
    <li> This product truly works. I&#x27;ve tried various waxes and they would all leave hair behind. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who has a wax warming machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I used the Gigi dusting powder before waxing which might have helped.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair so this wax worked fine for me.  But for my sister, who has coarse hair, it didn&#x27;t work, at all.  Since we share supplies we will be buying the Brazilian wax in the future as it works for both of us.</li>
    <li> I usually use moom&#x27;s wax but after reading good reviews about this I decided to give it a try. And I must say that I was totally disappoint with it. I do wax at home since last 10 years &amp; I have tried many different brands &amp; I must say that this was the worst among them all. It is too sticky &amp; didn&#x27;t pool out any hair. I throw it right away.</li>
    <li> I bought this wax and a wax heater to start waxing my legs and my partner&#x27;s chest.  We both use salon services, but it was getting too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the wax, I thought it did a really nice job.  I&#x27;m new to this, and I have tough leg hair. this stuff did well.  Less painful than some salon treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did learn a few things which could be really helpful for beginners:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If hair is long and dense, TRIM it with a trimmer before waxing.  Makes it much less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The wax sticks to EVERYTHING, hair and skin.  dust skin with talc powder to keep  the wax from adhering to skin.  Makes waxing much less painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Again, the wax sticks to EVERYTHING! cover all work surfaces to make cleanup easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you&#x27;re getting a lot of drips, turn the warmer temp down.</li>
    <li> i love the Brazilian wax i got from salons, but was expensive, after trying a couple of waxes i found this one and LOVE IT ! I took me about 3-4 times to really get the tricks down for self waxing but and a pro now and continue to by this product.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I was super excited when opening the box and then realized that the wax container/box had broken and the wax even leaked out and made it stick with the packaging bag. I bought it and a Gigi wax warmer but decided to throw it away after 2 times of trial. It did NOT remove any hair at all (I used it on my leg) and was sticky (worst ever for removing the residue afterward).</li>
    <li> I got my first eyebrow wax with this product at a salon and I was VERY surprised at the results. The coarse eyebrow hairs which I always plucked actually CAME OFF with this wax, root and everything which was very surprising to me. I am definitely buying this product for home use! There was no residue left behind on my skin like the sticky stuff that honey waxes leave behind. You need a wax warmer also.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for wax that actually works, and finally I found it! I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work because I have tried Sally Hansen, Nads, Zip wax, Parissa you name it..I had to suck it up everytime and go to the salon and pay $10-25 for an eyebrow and lip wax. Now I don&#x27;t have to waste my hard earned money for something I can do myself. It was easy to use and didn&#x27;t hurt. I have really sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t get irritated. Best of all, it removed all the hair the first time and works on the rest of the body too! Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the honey wax and blue azulene GiGi wax for my face (chin, upper lip &amp; brow) with some success over the past several years.  The honey was too sticky in my opinion and the blue azulene has to be just the right temperature/consistency or I get ingrown hairs so I thought I&#x27;d try this wax after reading the reviews.  I couldn&#x27;t get this wax to work whatsoever so I did get all the pain with waxing but it left every single hair no matter how I varied the heat.  I threw it away and went back to blue azulene.</li>
    <li> This is horrible. It didn&#x27;t remove any hair at all, no matter the temperature of the wax. It also left a nasty residue behind on my skin that I literally had to scrape off with my loofah and scrub. Terrible!</li>
    <li> Got the job done (legs, lip, brows, bikini area) but removing residue was a nuisance (scrubbed w/baby oil and sock or towel rag) However, a little bit of wax goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love it! Good quality wax! Removes all the hair without sticking and hurting! I ordered more from GIGI since i was so happy. The warmer is a great tool too. Compact easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
