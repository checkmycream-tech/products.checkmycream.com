      <li>Weston :)))</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty healthy but needs a good product and this was not it.</li>
      <li>It has a very clean scent.</li>
      <li>It helps my sensitive scalp and makes my hair smell great.  </li>
      <li>Every time I walk into a Westin the whole place smells so good.</li>
      <li>It smells yummy and my hair looks like a super model (almost) every time I wear it!</li>
      <li>I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and body wash last year and was extremely happy with the products that were sent to me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The White Tea Conditioner is great smelling but makes my scalp itch.</li>
      <li>I recently ran out and was very pleased to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this scent....</li>
      <li>had the same great smell as the one I tried before however, and did not make your hair feel soft</li>
      <li>Reminds us of our stays at a Westin or Hilton hotel.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair smelling fresh.</li>
      <li>First introduced to this shampoo and conditioner when I stayed at the Westin in Colorado.</li>
      <li>The first time I came across this conditioner while staying at the Westin Hotel in Seattle.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my wife the last time we stayed at the Westin on Hilton Head Island, she had fallen in love with the room sample.  </li>
      <li>We first used it at a Westin and now my huband doesn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
      <li>like it!&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I like</li>
      <li>Using these products bring back the sensation of being on vacation, which has a strong positive connotation.</li>
      <li>I do LOVE the smell but for the high price I would rather buy biolage which actually moisturizes.</li>
      <li>He really likes the scent and said it makes his hair softer.</li>
      <li>Seriously smells light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Very expensive, but perfect to give as a gift or to someone that you&#x27;d like to sniff their hair.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t bother with conditioner, but when I opened up the sample bottle and took a big sniff, I loved the smell and decided to treat my hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>Still, it is the exact same product...</li>
      <li>This fragrance is light and slightly citrusy.</li>
      <li>For both of us it is very drying and leaves our hair in knots and not soft at all.</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this scent....only thing is make a bigger bottle!!!!!!! Seriously smells light and refreshing. Love it.</li>

    <li> Every time I walk into a Westin the whole place smells so good. I love the shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The candles are a dream!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife the last time we stayed at the Westin on Hilton Head Island, she had fallen in love with the room sample.  I could not think of a better gift for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Staying at the westin is always a great time. Using these products bring back the sensation of being on vacation, which has a strong positive connotation. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to always feel like they were on vacation?</li>
    <li> It helps my sensitive scalp and makes my hair smell great.  Great product.  I wish they would bottle this product in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Reminds us of our stays at a Westin or Hilton hotel.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> The White Tea Conditioner is great smelling but makes my scalp itch. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a product I won&#x27;t be able to use.</li>
    <li> The smell. I just love the smell. Had to buy after a stay at one of their hotels. Not a particularly great conditioner/shampoo/lotion, but the smell just lures me in.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Westin White Tea Aloe (Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Wash) by my darling boyfriend. I fell in love with the wonderful scent instantly. I was very happy when i found out that i could buy the Westin products from Amazon. I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and body wash last year and was extremely happy with the products that were sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering to make another purchase this year but found out that the price has gone up from $12.00 to $16.95. I think that $19 is a steep price to pay for a 7 ounce bottle. Oh well, I might just grab a bottle as a gift for myself for Christmas :D</li>
    <li> The conditioner works much better than the shampoo.  A bit pricy for the size of the bottle, but I love how it makes my hair smell.</li>
    <li> First introduced to this shampoo and conditioner when I stayed at the Westin in Colorado. It has a very pleasant aroma. I purchased a shampoo and conditioner set for my friend-girl and a set for myself.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this shampoo at the Westin in Seattle and just HAD to have it in my shower.  It smells yummy and my hair looks like a super model (almost) every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner after a day in the pool plus it reminds me of Maui, need to get the lotion next.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes your hair feel great.  But it has terrible chemicals in it (sulfates, etc)!!</li>
    <li> My Husband and I went on our honeymoon in Maui at the Westin and this was our sample conditioner. I couldnt wait to buy a bigger bottle, the smell reminds me of our honeymoon in Hawaii every time I use it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the 2nd time as a gift for my Dad. He really likes the scent and said it makes his hair softer.</li>
    <li> had the same great smell as the one I tried before however, and did not make your hair feel soft it left it with a stiff feeling</li>
