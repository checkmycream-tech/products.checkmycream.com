      <li>I can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s a bronzer tan till I wash it off before bed and see how fair I am (which shows the BurnOut is doing its job.)</li>
      <li>Hope it&#x27;s that good.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, doesn&#x27;t disappear as easily as the Burnout spf 30 for face and body but is very good otherwise.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Consistency was a little thick and sticky for my liking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good insofar as it rubs in pretty nicely and seems to do the trick.  So it&#x27;s good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s bad insofar as it seems to work its way into my eyes and stings and also is only waterproof for 40 minutes, which is kind of low.  So it&#x27;s bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to do better: non-sting, longer-lasting, nicely-rubbing-in zinc-oxide block.</li>
    <li> I usually use vanicream sport, but I purchased this product because it has slightly better UVA protection. So far, I like it. It has a much lighter consistency than vanicream and doesn&#x27;t appear white. Also, this product does not break me out at all even if I don&#x27;t wash it off at night. The only detractor is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize your face. It applys very dryly and it leaves my skin a little dry (not too much though). Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> We purchased product for a trip to Cancun in Feb.  Granted we are from the North were it is cold and little exposure to the sun for about 5 months, so we were definately untanned and in need of the SPF.  After applying the product and spending an 1 1/2 hours outside both of us were FRIED.   We ended up purchasing a different sunscreen for the rest of our vacation.     Another couple also purchsed this product and had the same results...Sunburn after short exposure period.      Save your money and buy a different product.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of sunscreen, and this works great for a daily sunscreen. It goes on clear and seems to do the trick. However, wearing this in conditions with water like rafting or snowboarding causes my face (the only place I apply it) to break out into a rash after exposure (probably from it washing off?). I tan pretty easy and I have had my fair share of exposure, but other products don&#x27;t seem to cause this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have extremely oily skin on my face (at 47) and because it contains zinc as the sunblock and contains no dimethicone (which make me break out). I have been using for approximately a month and it seems to not make me break out (no more than usual) and the zinc is theraputic for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Works well - gives great protection from the sun and is EXTREMELY water proof. I only had two complaints - one is that the smell takes some getting used to (another reviewer described it as smelling like modeling clay, and I can&#x27;t think of a better description). My other complaint is that it clogged my pores - but this won&#x27;t be a problem if you only use it occasionally. I would not recommend it for daily use though, not for women at least ;)</li>
    <li> I wear it daily on my face (even on my eye area) and it never burns.   I rub it between my hands first and it disappears within a minute on my face.</li>
    <li> I needed a sunblock that was also a moisterizer as I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for both. After much research, I decided to try burnout. I have been using it for 6 months and I LOVE it. I have very sensitive AND dry skin.  I would commonly get milia with most sunscreens.  However, this sunscreen/moisterizer keeps me hydrated, well protected from the sun and free from white-heads (though I also use Paula&#x27;s choice BHA for that too).  I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband is allergic to Oxybenzone which is in every sunscreen EXCEPT pure Zinc Oxide and/or Titanium Dioxide which go on like white paste and cannot be rubbed in with any amount of effort.     This went on light and smooth, not thick or heavy, easy to spread, and completely clear.  He never broke out from this either. We love it and it&#x27;s the only product on the market he can use without breaking out other than Zink that we could find, and we have tried everything.</li>
    <li> I searched for a very long time to find a perfect facial sunscreen, and I have found it!  I&#x27;m using the Obagi Nu-Derm system on my face, and due to the Retin A I needed a good physical sunblock to avoid burning.  Everything I tried turned my face into a grease-ball, and even after being out just an hour I&#x27;d still be a bit pink.  I break out pretty easily, and so this was a concern when trying a product that is fairly expensive compared to brands I have tried in the stores.  Burn Out is everything I was hoping for: non-greasy, I don&#x27;t break out from it, there is no white cast to my face, no sensitive reaction- and best of all, I am protected from the sun!!!  I also like the fact that it is environmentally friendly and safer than so many other sunscreens out there.  I can put my makeup over it and the amazing thing is that I no longer have to add much powder to set my foundation, and I never have to blot during the day.  I highly recommend this product for women who have done facial peels, or are using Retin A and need a physical sunblock!</li>
    <li> This stuff is just too sticky.  I wore it as a daily sunscreen for about a month.  There&#x27;s no question that this stuff is sticky - you feel it the second you put it on your hand to apply.  For the month I wore it, I tried hard to not let anything touch my face - ever.  But sometimes it&#x27;s just unavoidable: hats or hair touching your forehead, shirt collar on your neck, the occasional nose itch, etc.  Its like one of those sticky mouse traps, but on your face!    Another minor annoyance was that this stuff smells like metal.  I know zinc is a metal - right there on the periodic table next to copper - but I didn&#x27;t expect to smell like the tin man in the rain.  In Burn-Out&#x27;s defense, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunblock Lotion SPF 60+ and it smells like metal too (but not as much).    Maybe this sunblock is better suited for occasional use while you&#x27;re outdoors, at the beach, etc.  Having said that, the review by the guy who used it in Cancun and got burnt scares me a little.  I really never spent enough time in the sun wearing this stuff to really test its sun blocking ability.  At 18.6% zinc you&#x27;d think it would work okay if applied correctly...    It&#x27;s a plus that Burn Out is all natural and has anti-oxidants.  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t feel or see any free radicals jumping off my face so I had to temper my enthusiasm a little.    BTW - I&#x27;d recommend Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunblock Lotion SPF 60+ over Burn Out.  It is not nearly as sticky and has twice the SPF.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!  It&#x27;s got a high percentage of physical block, yet it goes on without the whitish cast that you normally get with zinc oxide products.  It also does not look or feel greasy on my skin.  My all-time favorite sunscreen is Obaji SPF 50, but this is a good alternative at 1/3 the price.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I cannot say how effective this is as a sunscreen because I tried it on and had to go wash my face before leaving the house. On paper it sounds good: High zinc oxide content; supposedly no chalky or white residue on the face, oil-free; natural, non toxic ingredients etc etc. All those were the reasons why I bought this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the first time I tried to use this  just before going in to work in the morning, my face was left coated with a ghostly white film that wouldn&#x27;t come off. I used very little of the product but it just wouldn&#x27;t rub in smoothly. My brows and hairs on my face were thoroughly coated. I had to wash my face again to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, like I said, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to see if it is effective as a sunscreen, because I had to wash it off. I guess it probably might work best on other parts of the body besides the face, or if you&#x27;re going to the beach and don&#x27;t mind looking like a ghost.</li>
    <li> I have to wear sunscreen every day.  Like ALL the many mineral based (zinc and/or titanium) screens I&#x27;ve tried, Burnout is greasy.  But it is the LEAST GREASY one so far.  That my number one criteria.  Unlike all the others, I have re-ordered Burnout.  It spreads easily (not thick and pasty, more like thin toothpaste), is invisible, and seems to do a good job of protecting.  No odor.  It washes off more easily than the waxy ones, so I still use a one of those on my hands.  Why can&#x27;t anyone make a mineral screen that&#x27;s not greasy?  Lots of non-mineral ones go on dry and you can&#x27;t feel them on your skin.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase bio-degradable sunscreen for a trip to Cozumel.  After reading many reviews, I was hesitant to purchase many of those offered because people said they had trouble with application and with pasty whitening of their skin.  This brand was not hard to apply, quite smooth in fact, and it did not whiten.  I stayed out of the sun as much as possible so I can&#x27;t really say how well it protects you from the sun, but I didn&#x27;t get burned either.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! I break out with every sunscreen and all of the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve used leave me ghostly white even when they claim they&#x27;re clear.  I found this one originally at Mothers Market (they have a kids/babies version as well) and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it had such simple natural ingredients and said it was for sensitive skin.  It blends nicely and really is clear.  It is not greasy AT ALL which is rare with sunscreen.  The only issue I have had with it, and it doesn&#x27;t happen every time which remains a mystery to me, is it occasionally goes on sort of clumpy.  But if I keep rubbing it in it spreads out and blends in just fine.  I don&#x27;t typically wear this as a daily sunscreen since my skin is so so so sensitive, but any time I wear sunscreen Burnout is my go to guy.  It&#x27;s super water resistant and I&#x27;ve taken it on several vacations.  I have incredibly pale, sunburn prone skin.  I fry in about 10 minutes in direct sunlight.  This kept me milky white on my trips to Panama and Costa Rica even when I was very active going in and out of the pool and ocean and sweating a ton in the humidity and jungle adventures.  I live near the beach and go walking outdoors often and I&#x27;ve never once been let down by this sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve gotten all my friends and family hooked on this stuff. I wear it on my face and body and I have never ever had an issue with it migrating to my eyes, even when I&#x27;m being very active.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Whole Foods (for less $) and I love it! I have tried so many sunscreens and find this one superior - no chemicals, no thick, white pasty residue, no fragrance or smell. Works perfectly under my makeup. Just a tad sticky, however, but again, no white residue. Never seen such a high zinc oxide (18.6%) level. Physical sunscreens (such as this one) are superior to chemical sunscreens, according to derms.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s sticky, but it works great.  You can always wash it off later, when you come in out of the sun.  You do have to spend a little time rubbing it in, and yes, the appearance of your skin will remind you of the tin man in the Wizard of Oz, but it works.  As I have gotten older, my face has begun to easily sprout little brown spots when I spend time in the sun.  So it&#x27;s time for forget tanning, and keep my face protected when I&#x27;m out.  A pale face with smooth looking skin is better than tan with spots all over it (and no, they aren&#x27;t freckles.  Much bigger.). This product does the job well, and it&#x27;s convenient to keep in the console of my car, for all those times that I&#x27;m traveling to visit grandbabies and we decide to get out in the sunshine without prior planning on Nina&#x27;s part.  I don &#x27;t freak out about what the sun is going to do to my face if I have this along.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t understand the reviews downing this product. I use this product everyday under lots of makeup. I spent lots of time outdoor gardening and my skin is especially sensitive to the sun due to being on the highest dose of Retin-A and \\&quot;me Irish blood\\&quot;. I find this product to be lightweight, non-sticky, and to work pretty good as a moisturizer for your body and face. I live in sunny California and I find this product does an excellent job of preventing me from burning. I come from the skin care industry, so I am comparing the consistency of this product to suncreens from Sheisiedo, Laura Mercier, and Chanel. I personally like this sunscreen better than my Shesiedo SPF 60++ face and body sunscreen, due to its fine consistency and its much lower price. I also love that this sunscreen does not have any chemical like parabens, and is very natural. My sensitive breakout prone skin is thankful. For the people who have problems with this product coming off, try putting is on freshly cleaned skin, and not adding more moisturizer, unless your skin is really dry.</li>
    <li> Like others have mentioned, it is really sticky and doesn&#x27;t easily rub in. However, it is paraben free, so I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 7/8/14&lt;br /&gt;The reformulation of this is really, really bad.  If you have sensitive skin in any way, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  I used it on my face as I usually do, and after about an hour, my skin started to feel as if it were burning and it turned bright red.  I washed my face several times but could not get rid of the sensation.  Today, two days after using the new formulation for the first time, I have tiny blisters on my cheeks and have some areas where the skin is peeling off.  I don&#x27;t know what chemical it was that they added for me to have such a severe reaction.  At first I was upset, but now I am incredibly angry.  I don&#x27;t know why they had to change the formulation, but they have definitely lost a customer.  I will be telling everyone I recommended this sunscreen to about the reformulation and the horrendous reaction I had to it.  BurnOut, don&#x27;t be a sell out!  Clean up your sunscreen, change it back to what it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen!  I have extremely sensitive skin and every sunscreen I had ever used made me either break out or it made my skin very irritated.  My esthetician recommended this for me and I have been amazed by it.  I am not bothered by the smell (some people don&#x27;t like it) and as far as a white cast to the skin--in my experience, your skin has to be clean before you put it on.  Otherwise it will put a slight (for me, at any rate) white cast to the face.  I have never had it make me noticeably white, though.  I have dry skin, so maybe this is more of an issue for people with oily skin?  Nevertheless, I really love this sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year I have very sensitive skin. It works great.Wasted lots of $$$ trying different products.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot-it&#x27;s a lot more matte than most sunscreens and very moisturizing. I haven&#x27;t been tanned or burnt since using it, excellent sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything and this is my GO TO sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now.  I&#x27;ve never had any breakouts or skin problems as a result of allergic reactions to this product.  It&#x27;s great for those with extremely sensitive skin.  And yes.....it really does protect you from burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is that it does have a tendency to clump up in areas while applying.  If not rubbed into your skin well... you will have white marks left behind on your skin.  Also, it does leave a slightly glossy finish to your skin.  So.....when applying to your face it can look a little greasy on close inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most sunscreens as you get hot and begin to sweat.... the sunscreen has a tendency to start to feel sticky to the touch.  But again....I&#x27;ve personally experienced this with almost every sunscreen I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
    <li> My doctor is a big believer in daily use of sun block containing zinc oxide, which is a physical rather than chemical barrier to the sun&#x27;s rays.  BurnOut has a high percentage of zinc oxide and does an admirable job of protecting skin from burn (based on a full day of boating).  However, it was impossible to get it blended into my skin.  It&#x27;s not as bad as the old, thick white zinc oxide, but it stayed visible all day.  To be fair, I&#x27;ve tried two other brands with varying percentage of zinc oxide, and none were any better.  I was hoping for something I could wear under makeup...but this doesn&#x27;t work for daily use.  However, I&#x27;ll use it for beach or boating days.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and also break-out prone skin; chemical-based sunscreens always gave me an allergic reaction so I have been wearing physical sunblocks (zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) for years. I have tried so many different physical sunblocks but they were either chalky and whitening or would just run off me when I sweat or swam. Burnout was one of the pricier options but I finally gave it a try and now I will use nothing else! As other reviewers have said, it is very hypoallergenic (no fragrance, or chemicals), doesn&#x27;t leave you all white and sticky, and I have never gotten a sunburn if I am careful to apply it in the morning! Completely worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the best chemical-free sunscreen I have ever purchased and I have tried 10+ brands.  It goes on clear and the texture is great - thin and does not feel sticky or like glue (some do).  I wore this on my recent hawaii trip and did not have one burn and barely even tanned.  Also, I surfed for 3 hours straight and still did not get a burn without reapplying.  This is a great brand!! Going to try the ocean tested version next.  Thanks Burn Out, I have been searching for a great chemical - free sunblock and I found it!!</li>
    <li> so a few years ago i made the decision to try and eliminate as many non essential chemicals in our life and discovered that most sunscreens are full of nasty things which actually create free radicals &amp; oxidation products when \\&quot;protecting\\&quot; you from the sun.  So, i protect myself &amp; my kids from skin cancer only to end up with some other cancer and aged skin from the sunscreen I use?  No thanks!  I love Burn-outs zinc oxide sensitive skin, clear sunscreen.  Its pure and simple.  The only draw-back I have found is that its shelf life is usually less than a year - let me explain.  My experience is that after about 9-12 months it starts to either get kind of sticky or runny in the bottle &amp; doesn&#x27;t seem to protect as well once this happens.  Not too much of a problem for us since we practically drink the stuff year-round to protect from strong sun even in the winter months.  Its not as convenient as spray-ons but it actually works!  We&#x27;ve had lots of missed spots &amp; sunburns from spray-on sunscreen.  My son has never burned using Burn-out even after all day in the sun/surf (with re-applies every few hrs)  This isn&#x27;t cheap, or easy, but it does a fabulous job, which is whats really important with sun protection.  I recommend this to everyone I know, and even those I don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry this unused to be Awesome lotion but the formulation changed and it now contains ceytl alcohol and other alcohols that bother my skin. I used burned to a crisp with this new formulation. Sent it back</li>
    <li> This is the best face sunscreen EVER!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  You don&#x27;t need very much; just a tiny amount goes a long way.  HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> used this product on recent cruise vacation - i burn very easily and this product prevented any burn and i was snorkeling for several hours a day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;did not show white, but went on clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Aesthetician and I have tried many natural sunscreens in search of the perfect daily use product, minus the use of chemical sunblocks. In my opinion, this is the best natural daily use sunscreen I have ever tried. Here&#x27;s the details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros (Make sure you give the tube a little shake right before you dispense the product to mix the ingredients in case of separation)&lt;br /&gt;- No white chalky film&lt;br /&gt;- No shiny greasy mess&lt;br /&gt;- Make up goes on over this sunscreen really well. Almost makes my make up look better, acting sort of like a primer.&lt;br /&gt;- No smell at all&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores **see more info on this below**&lt;br /&gt;- Thoroughly protects my skin from UVA and UVB rays&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or make my face itch&lt;br /&gt;- Much cleaner ingredients than all your other mainstream drugstore brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- There is a very slight tackiness on the skin. Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, but it may for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, all that said, addressing some of the comments of it clogging their pores, keep this in mind...you must THOROUGHLY cleanse your skin to remove. Otherwise, yes, you could possibly get some clogged pores from using this, or any sunscreen for that matter. I use an oil based cleanser with a warm wet washcloth first wiping everything off. Then I cleanse one more time with Keys Island Rx Foam Cleanser. No problems at all. I love this product so much, I intend to retail it for my clients. I have also used the Ocean Tested sunscreen from this line for my body when I am going to have prolonged exposure and it is equally fabulous. **LITTLE BEAUTY TIP** To make sort of a tinted moisturizer, in the palm of my hand I mix this sunscreen with a tiny bit of RMS Un Cover Up balm (a lovely tinted good for your skin balm). Makes the skin look gorgeous! It can be quite a journey looking for the sunscreen that is \\&quot;just right\\&quot; but this one is worth the try.</li>
    <li> I like that this has no smell and is made of natural ingredients, however I would not purchase again b/c it is hard to rub in and feels greasy.</li>
    <li> This will turn your face white if you sweat a lot during activity.  This works fine as an everyday sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Of all the sunscreens I&#x27;ve ever tried, this is my favorite, by far.  I use it daily as I do frequent chemical peels.  I actually find it evens out my skin tone, a bit like a foundation primer.  It does lighten slightly, but not noticeably to others, and I think it does so prettily.  Brightens.  I love that it has neither the signature smell nor the stickiness of every other sunblock I&#x27;ve tried.  I tend to get blackheads, so I&#x27;ve paid close attention to it&#x27;s effect in that respect and if anything, it&#x27;s helped.  It&#x27;s just moisturizing enough to go without using another moisturizer in the winter, but not so much as to be annoying in the summer.  So great.  Do try to keep it out of your hairline, however, as it will make your hair stiff.  Love it.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier (unless it were cheaper).</li>
    <li> I developed sunscreen allergies a couple of years ago and have tried all of the alternatives to traditional sunscreen.  Many of the zinc oxide ones and titanium dioxide ones claim they aren&#x27;t greasy or smell weird but so many of them do both. They can be so viscous and hard to rub in and then you are covered in this awful white sheen that gets all smeared and gross when playing sports.  But this one, finally, is just what it says and is fantastic. I will be buying this from now on. It rubs in easily and goes on clear,  truly!  Many thanks to the manufacturers for finally getting it right, better for me, better for the environment, better all around! And, I no longer have to explain my appearance to people, I can just blend in like everyone else wearing sun protection.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great for everyday facial use and for use under makeup as well. After rubbing it in, my face does feel rough, itchy, and my hair sometimes sticks to my face because of the sunscreen, but if you wear lotion before applying it, it&#x27;s not as bad. It keeps you from touching your face as much. I normally wash it off when I&#x27;m in the office, and re-apply before going outside again.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it for swimming/sweaty sports since I have tried, and my swim goggles slips easily off my face, and the sunscreen washes off faster, even though it is water resistant for 40 min. I wouldn&#x27;t really use this for anything else besides my face and neck because wearing clothing on top of the applied area can become rough, itchy, and uncomfortable.  My only real complaint shortly after purchasing, one night, I only had my desk lamp on in my room and the tube was sitting on my desk next to the lamp, I noticed it was HALF EMPTY!!! Maybe is the tube is bigger, and only 3oz is in the container, or they&#x27;ve tricked us and put less than 3oz in the tube, and pretending to sell it as 3oz of sunscreen advertised! In the end I&#x27;m gonna end up buying this product again after I run out, because it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used for my face with safe ingredients, and it hasn&#x27;t made me breakout on my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for our trip to Mexico because it was environment friendly.  I did not expect to look like a ghost after I got out of the ocean.  It leaves you white and chalky looking!  Even after you take a shower there are still traces of it on your skin if you didn&#x27;t scrub hard enough when showering.  I would not recommend it to anyone!  I purchased three bottles.  My husband lost one when we went swimming with the dolphins and I ended up throwing the third one away!</li>
    <li> Whatever the size is supposed to be..ll it&#x27;s only half filled it seems.  Kinda expensive for a tube half filled with sunscreen. Hope it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out the Environmental Working Group best rated sunscreens, and so far this one is my least favorite. It goes on kind of oily, but then gets sticky. It also felt really susceptible to sweating off in the Texas heat.</li>
    <li> Used this sunscreen during early spring. Might as well did not use any - I am covered with sun spots all over my face. I also used it on my hands, and they are tanned, with different tan intensity, as if I had fingers of different colors. Nice circus effect, but not what I was shooting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am obsessive-compulsive when it comes to sunscreens, so I sure applied enough and reapplied often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: minimum, if any, protection. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have horrible acne and very oily skin. This sunscreen went on smooth and soaked right into my skin. It actually makes my skin matte all day. I read a lot of people saying it was sticky but that is not the case at all. I&#x27;m using retina a so I really had to start using sunscreen and I&#x27;m so happy I found this!!! Btw I bought mine from Whole Foods. Maybe it&#x27;s newer.</li>
    <li> My husband is allergic to pretty much all the sunscreens out there esp. then ones containing avobenzone (which is almost all of them).  This is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t cause him to develop a rash and itching.  It is purely a mineral blocker containing zinc oxide and no other ingredients.  Unlike other sunscreens containing zinc oxide this actually goes on clear w/o leaving that chalky, white paste all over.  Absorbs well and provides excellent sunprotection.  Highly rec. for those with sensitive skin and sunscreen allergies.</li>
    <li> This sunblock Rocks! I called the company and requested some samples. It is wonderful stuff. Non-greasy, and no corpse-like white cast. I heartily recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> For many years, I struggled with dry, flaky, and red/irritated skin.  This was due to mostly having used skin care products that were filled to the brim with chemicals, and not to mention, the over-use of exfoliant&#x27;s. Bad skin owner!! I have since transitioned to all natural/organic venues to baby the skin I&#x27;m in and it&#x27;s been paying off.  My only issue was finding a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t leave my facial skin dry, flaky and irritated....I tried everything under the sun--DeVita, Badger, Loving Naturals, Marie Veronique, Kiss My Face, Soleo Organics(2nd runner up), UV Natural, Elemental(currently using this for my body and it&#x27;s decent), etc., etc.,....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter in the star of the show....BurnOut Eco-Sensitive Sunscreen!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, my friends, is magic for my skin.  Smooths on like buttah--no smearing and pulling against my skin, is clear--no ghost face(if I don&#x27;t rub it all in completely, I&#x27;ll have a smudge of white, but even after an hour of my boyfriend not telling me I have a white streak on my cheek, it still rubs in nicely.&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally figured out that my type of skin is not able to stand a zinc percentage higher than 20. I always thought, \\&quot;more is better!\\&quot; well, not in this case. This stuff is hands down my holy grail of sunscreen for my face.  I don&#x27;t even wear make-up anymore since figuring out my skin care cleansing regime and sunscreen.  Pretty friggin&#x27; happy.</li>
    <li> My wife says, &amp;#34;This is the only sunscreen I will use under makeup because it&#x27;s not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t contain the possible carcinogen titanium dioxide. Rather the active ingredient is zinc oxide. It&#x27;s eco-friendly for the ocean too!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Living in California, I have sun hitting my skin whether I&#x27;m gardening, driving, talking, breathing. I have learned, painfully, to not rely on one single moisturizer or sunscreen. Instead I use \\&quot;levels\\&quot; depending on the brightness of the sun. Took me awhile to figure out, so just sharing tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 18.6% zinc oxide. For my oily skin, I always massage in EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) first. That actually counters my oily skin and provides a level of moisture to help with mineral sunscreens (make sure you allow time for the EVOO to absorb, at least 30 mins). I then use Burnout for my 4th Level protection. It&#x27;s non-whitening and non-nano, which is darn good. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and is great for water activities, as it stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st Level &#x3D; rainy, heavy overcast, staying inside (Wholly Hemp Moisturizing Cream)&lt;br /&gt;2nd Level &#x3D; some clouds, regular day, up to 72 degrees (Avalon Essential Lift SPF 15 Moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;3rd Level &#x3D; sunny, no clouds, outside or driving, mid 70s (Wholly Hemp SPF 20 Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;4th Level &#x3D; bright sun, warm, water activities or athletics, low 80s (Burnout Sunscreen SPF 30)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a light weight sunblock that prevents tanning. I wasn&#x27;t sure such a thing existed...but it DOES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read previous reviews and decided to give it a try, but honestly didn&#x27;t expect much. I live in the Caribbean (Trinidad) so the sun is HOT...ALL the time!! As in, it actually stings your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do a little walking each day to get to and from work and I noticed I was actually getting a tan with this minimal sun exposure. I am brown with light skin, so I tan easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this sunblock and I was pleasantly surprised by how smoothly it applies and blends into my skin. It does not look cakey, does not feel heavy or greasy, but rather feels more like a moisturizer! The scent is quite pleasant as well. This sunblock is also a very good base for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with regards to preventing tanning, AMAZING! I wore this sunblock on the day of a 5k walk...in the blazing sun, and NO TAN!! I was amazed! I have since ordered 2 more tubes although the first still isn&#x27;t finished (I have a bit of a shopping problem lol) as I never intend to leave the house without applying this miracle worker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this sunblock especially for people who hate getting sunburn and an unsightly tan :)</li>
    <li> What more can I say? After years of trying every sunblock under the... you know, this one is my baby.  Goes on clear. Stays on not matter what. Doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t have a chemical fragrance.  Washes off easily. This is sunblock heaven!</li>
    <li> Great Product I have combination skin (sensitive)I use it in my face with or without makeup I live in a hot weather.</li>
    <li> The old formula was perfect, but this new one is so sticky and doesn&#x27;t rub in at all. Similar to any cheap zinc-based sunblock. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;The company should have indicated that the formula has changed.</li>
    <li> This product has 18% zinc oxide, can&#x27;t beat that protection. And, it is easy to apply, no clumps.</li>
    <li> The last time I wore it, I remember thinking that it would be great for someone with oil-prone skin. My skin is normal moisture-wise. I don&#x27;t have to use body or facial lotions. Burnout left my face uncomfortably taut and enhanced fine lines. I tried adding hyaluronic acid serum for moisture, but the product was still way too drying. I could add another facial moisturizer, but I will use the rest up on my body only. An expensive experiment for me. I wish I could give this a better rating since it is eco-sensitive.</li>
    <li> Really like the product other than the fact that it turns milky looking on the skin and serms to come off if you get into the water. Nice texture though,  and goes on clear.</li>
    <li> Like another, highly recommended zinc sunscreen, this one made me break out like crazy along the jawline. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, just not the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the consistency is rather thick and tacky feeling once on.  However, I didn&#x27;t break out anywhere except for my jawline.</li>
    <li> Unlike others, this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have that sticky oily feeling when you use it. I also like that it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients</li>
    <li> I tend to not use sunblock as much as possible, but this stuff is great. Used it in the Dominican Republic when I knew I was going to be out on the water for great lengths of time. Never got a burn.</li>
    <li> Horrible. This was greasy and nasty. Couldn&#x27;t stand the way it felt on my skin. It also cause huge cystic acne a few days later after having clear skin for months. It doesn&#x27;t say non-comedogenic so I was worried about that. I was right!</li>
    <li> The BurnOut Zinc Oxide sunscreen has been my go to for 4 years. I&#x27;ve re-purchased several times, and have always worn it underneath a full face of makeup. It protected my skin from the sun(very important since I use Retin-A), helped keep my acne from scarring too badly, and wasn&#x27;t greasy. It left a white cast on my skin, but I have dark skin so it was understandable. It was the best sunscreen I&#x27;d found, after using several different ones from here in the States, Europe and Australia. It has now been re-formulated, and the search for a good sunscreen is now underway again. My new tube leaves my skin a greasy mess, and is now clogging my pores. It feels awful going on, and never completely dries or settles. I am so disappointed. For all future buyers, please disregard the glowing reviews. They were for the old formulation, which was truly stellar. The new one, you need to stay far, far away from.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is knocking their new formulation.  This is my first Amazon review and I want to make sure everyone knows it is the same.    The way that it goes on in terms of look and feel is EXACTLY the same.  It&#x27;s not white at ALL (unlike Badger) and it absorbs easily and feels very light.  I am super picky about what I put on my face and I work outdoors so trust me I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  This stuff is the s*** and I am SO glad to have found it.    Go to Whole Foods and test the new product - I did before I bought the 35 and it&#x27;s essentially the same.    LOVE IT.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Leaves a sticky after effect. Sticks onto hair, fringe. Not suitable for people who want to use it everyday or using it on limbs</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen a lot. It doesn&#x27;t have the sticky feeling and doesn&#x27;t leave white cast. It also absorbs well.</li>
    <li> This non chemical sunscreen is the best I found.  I live in Hawaii and use it every day. Haven&#x27;t been burned yet.  Reef friendly too!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is okay to me. I like that it&#x27;s free of harmful things and is made of zinc oxide at a good percent. As for protection in my experience, it&#x27;s not quite there for me yet.  It does prevent me from getting sunburned, but it makes my skin look a bit dull and like it has a slight tanned tinge to it (not that conspicuous, but I notice it). So I may be still getting slightly tanned although using this while being in the sun for only a short period of time (0.o) Therefore, I will move on to something better regarding that...and will only use this as a fall back on product.</li>
    <li> I used this while surfing in Mexico and compared it with another all natural for-baby product. This one was creamier and easier to apply. It was not greasy. Best of all, it protected me for 2+ hours in the water.</li>
    <li> I use products that irritate skin like Retin-A, Glycolic Acid, TCA, Kojic Acid. This is the only sunscreen that does not burn me after using treatments, why? Because it&#x27;s a physical sunblock, and the ingredients are natural. It&#x27;s not a chemical sunblock at all and that&#x27;s the wonderful thing about it. Physical Sunblocks &gt; Chemical sunblocks. I&#x27;ve been using this for a whole year now and I will never buy another sunscreen. They need to make this in a huge size so I can stockpile. One tube in one year and I&#x27;m still not done. A little goes a long way. However, if you are a darker skinned individual, this will leave  a slightly white cast on your face if you do not rub it in really well.</li>
    <li> Best clear zinc sunblock. Others I&#x27;ve tried are either really greasy or really opaque. This one is neither. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this product at whole foods to use on my face. I have very sensitive skin on my face and its very acne prone. Other sunblocks cause breakouts. I&#x27;ve used this various times this summer on my face and its worked wonderfully. It worked better than the Alba sunscreen I bought for my body as today I got badly burned on my body but not on my face. Interesting, considering I applied the Burnout hours before applying the Alba!</li>
    <li> It smells and feels like any other sunscreen.  It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;added scent&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s just the zinc oxide smell, and it goes away much quicker than some other brands.  It was slightly greasy, but I was still able to use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burnout sunscreen for years and had turned several family members onto it. It was moisturizing, non-greasy and pretty much disappeared into skin. Burnout was my go-to, everyday sunscreen here in Georgia where the sun can be quite strong. It also had a great recommendation from the EWG for stability, UVA/UVB protection and lack of harmful ingredients. If you check the EWG website now there are two Burnout sunscreens listed, but not this one. I purchased the new formulation from Amazon without noticing the change. The new product is tacky and remains tacky throughout the day. It is also patchy on the skin. I&#x27;m a pretty fair person. So even when sunscreens have a white cast, it is not as apparent on my skin. However, the patchiness makes the white cast evident even on my light skin. I cannot fathom why they would change such an outstanding product. Burnout, if you read these reviews please bring back the old formulation or at least make it available. You&#x27;ve lost a customer.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida, so the sun kills my skin. I have been using this for quite a while and you can definitely tell the difference between me and the people around me that don&#x27;t use sun screen.</li>
    <li> First of all this product is good for white people or very light skinned folks. But for brown skinned and dark skinned people this isn&#x27;t for you. I&#x27;m brown skinned and When I put this on my face people at school ask me if im wearing makeup (im a guy) It turns your skin a very slight purple ish and it makes you look like your wearing ghost makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good.</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended to me by a Dr. who uses it on a regular basis.  I have really sensitive skin as it has been burned many times from riding my motorcycle over the years.  This has really made a huge difference as it prevents me from burning even during the sunniest days.  Just remember to keep applying it during the day.</li>
    <li> This product is mild to the skin. As compared to other Zinc products, this doesn&#x27;t leave as much of a white residue as the others.</li>
    <li> Why a company would take a clean and very effective sunscreen and reformulate it with questionable ingredients is beyond me. VERY disappointed in this product now and will search for a cleaner sunscreen that deserves my money.</li>
    <li> Hopefully Burnout pays attention to customers and will return to their old formula. I have used this for years and the last tube I got I had to triple check to make sure I got the same sunscreen, it was a disgusting greasy mess! Look at any popular review site and you will see that everyone agrees and is extremely disappointed in this company. I will be returning this product and will not buy again unless they go back to their old formula. My entire 5k running group used this which consists of about 50 people and we all have to find another sunscreen to use now. We will be trying out Livestrong with has a higher zinc oxide percentage and seems to be less greasy.</li>
    <li> Not only is it a zinc based formula but it also goes on very clear which is great for my SO who has a large beard and very dry skin. The only whiteness you&#x27;ll see is if your sweating a lot and some of it will come off. Otherwise it works great and doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets in your eyes either.</li>
    <li> This was my all time favorite sunscreen, and now that I am pregnant, I felt okay using it due to how few ingredients it had. My new bottle, sadly, has many, many more ingredients and is much more greasy. I will be returning it. Ugh. Now I have to find a new one. Anyone have suggestions?</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I would have gladly given this product 5 stars - 6 if the system would allow it - but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE the new formula. I hate it in every single way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formula was elegant, light-weight, and highly effective. It was beautiful on the skin, leaving no white cast, and worked great alone or over moisturizer. It set to a beautiful semi-mate finish, didn&#x27;t run when I got sweaty, and didn&#x27;t smear or stain my clothing. It was awesome to have a sunscreen I could use for both face and body. As a very pale person with extremely sensitive skin who burns easy and lives in the southwest, it was a blessing to find this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;new and improved&#x27; version just plain sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to squeeze out of the tube. It feels heavy on the skin, and never seems to set completely. It leaves an unattractive white cast on my skin, runs badly when I sweat, and leaves the edges of my clothing goopy and gross. White lines of it build up in the creases of joints like elbows and knees. Forget about wearing it under make-up or applying it over moisturized skin. And the big &#x27;ECO&#x27; on the front of the new packaging? What a joke. The ingredient list has almost doubled and most of the new ingredients are totally unpronounceable unless you have a bio-chem degree. The extra 5 points of protection? Forget about that, too. Between it rubbing off and sweating off plus how thinly you have to apply it just to tolerate having it on your body,it is LESS effective than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly do not understand how a company who had such a brilliant product could so easily turn it into garbage in a tube and expect customers to neither notice or care. Was it a cost thing? I would gladly have paid another dollar or two per tube for the same formula, instead of having to waste a lot of time and money searching for a replacement sunscreen. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING BACK THE OLD BURNOUT FORMULAS!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t burn when I had this for my nose- I have really sensitive skin. But downside is it doesn&#x27;t let your skin breathe and most people put on sunblock when it&#x27;s sunny and hot out- I was excessively sweating with this product. Little sweat beads all over my nose and under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I tried this at my local health food store and loved it. Went on easily, smoothly, no white cast. I read glowing reviews online. I was so excited to finally find a chemical-free, oil-free sunscreen safe for sensitive, acne-prone skin. Then it arrived. I excitedly/patiently waited for a sunny day and carefully dotted the cream allover my face and gently massage it in. Hmmmmm. Not absorbing very well. Kinda greasy. Ooh, really greasy. Well, maybe I just need to keep rubbing it in. Nope. Am I doing something wrong? All those glowing reviews! What if I emulsify it with a little warm water? Helps a tiny bit... But I look like a crazy greasy ghost! To quote Sara aka Jimmy Fallon, EW!! SOOOO DISAPPOINTING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can use this now and not look frightening is dot it around my face, massage in with wet fingertips (rewetting several times) let it sit for a few mins, pat my face with my hands (mattifies it some) and then apply a little foundation/CC/BB cream or bronzer allover. A yellower tone is better as the sunscreen makes you look pale pink - removes all the yellow/tan. The good news is it does look ok under makeup and it is gentle for sensitive skin. Other than that though... *sigh*...the search continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, now I see all the current reviews saying how horrible the new formulation is. They weren&#x27;t there when I did my initial research! :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student and used this sunscreen when I went to Mexico on spring break a few months ago.  I have fair skin, reddish hair and blue eyes, so I burn fairly easily.  However, this sunscreen worked great for me.  I didn&#x27;t burn at all and only reapplied twice a day (about every 3-4 hours).  It also didn&#x27;t leave ANY white residue on my skin, which is awesome because that is often the problem with these types of sunscreen.  Some people are complaining about the reformulation, but this is the first time I used the product and I think it&#x27;s great!  Definitely try it out.</li>
    <li> This WAS my absolute favorite sunscreen product ever and I have used very expensive ones in the past.  I would have given it 10 stars before they changed it.  I wore it every day and recommended it to friends and even my skincare specialist.  However, the new formulation is terrible.  I still have my old tube and when compared, there are A LOT of added chemicals and ingredients in the new version.  It also doesn&#x27;t have the same waterproof time as before.  The sunscreen now causes breakouts and is so greasy, I can&#x27;t wear it outside my house without looking ridiculous.  I am not writing this to bash the company as I thought they made a great product.  My hope is that they will see this feedback and others and consider bringing the old formula back.  Also, if you have used this in the past beware that it is not the same.</li>
    <li> Safe for the ocean, non-nano (won&#x27;t get into your blood stream), blends in clear, not that chalky white. Remember to apply at least 40 minuets before going into the ocean to conserve the ocean!</li>
    <li> I turn into a lobster in the sun. This sunscreen stays on and keeps me protected. Broad spectrum protection against UVA and UVB without harsh or toxic chemicals. Goes on clear and not greasy. On top of that it&#x27;s friendly towards the environment. Definitely worth the couple dollar difference from the cheap brands for this kind of quality. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen, including hypoallergenic brands, to which my son has not had a severe reaction.  Every year I forget and apply the wrong brand, and we end up dosing him with Benadryl and cortisone creams.  I hope this brand is never discontinued!</li>
    <li> I used to wear this sunscreen every single day. It went on beautifully, I could wear makeup over if I wanted to, it had a nice semi-matte finish, all around lovely. It didn&#x27;t cause clogged pores or breakouts and was actually quite soothing on my skin. Unfortunately, the completely unnecessary reformulation has ruined this sunscreen. It is now feels greasy, heavy, and disgusting. It leaves a terrible white cast and never truly sinks in. They have also added several new comedogenic ingredients. It&#x27;s truly, truly awful. If you were a faithful user of this sunscreen and are about to purchase a new bottle, please save your money.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for two years and loved it because it was the only zinc oxide sunscreen that was clear and non-greasy.  However, recently I bought several tubes of this product without knowing that they had recently changed the formula.  The new formula goes on white and greasy and stays that way no matter how much you rub it in. It&#x27;s terrible!  I loved the old formula and wished they hadn&#x27;t changed it.  I will no longer buy this product.</li>
    <li> Pros: Easy to rub in. Almost no stickiness or greasiness. No white residue.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Poor water resistance. If my kids are in the water this stuff slides right off. Suggest saving it for non-water activities. We prefer thinkbaby for swimming.</li>
    <li> I have used many different brand of natural sunscreens.  This one seems to be easier to apply and leave less white residue.  Not sure if it give enough protection from sun though.  Maybe 1 or 2 hr outside is ok but if you plan to stay outside for several hours  apply it as often as you can</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SUNSCREEN.  NOT TO THICK, NO BAD ORDER.  GREAT BRAND.  I LOVE SUNSCREENS THAT HAVE ZINC OXIDE, HELPS PREVENT C-.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect sunscreen. I like the way it feels on my skin (imagine that in a sunscreen). It is tinged a little white but it is not noticeable. Doesn&#x27;t have that gooey smelly feeling of other sunscreens, so it is one of a handful that I believe works well with makeup and oily or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this sunscreen. It&#x27;s the only one i use on my body AND my face. Dermatologists and aestheticians always recommend a sunscreen with physical protection at the highest % you can find. This one has that! It does go on a little white, especially with my brown skin. But that&#x27;s ok. I just massage it in a bit more lol. The extra massage work is a small price to pay for good sunscreen. It&#x27;s also Eco-friendly, which helped when I went swimming with the dolphins this summer as they didn&#x27;t allow any other type of sunscreen at their facility.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the good reviews, I hated it. It left my face ghostly white (even when I didn&#x27;t use a lot) and in places where my face was white, it was super glossy. I have acne-prone skin and it didn&#x27;t make me break out. But, I can&#x27;t use a sunscreen that leaves my face white and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend. If anything, the KissMyFace Face Factor Sunscreen for Face and Neck 2oz tube is better (though that leaves my face a bit shiny as well).</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It goes on a little greasy, but it absorbs after a few minutes. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t break me out. Pretty much every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried gave me zits, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens. And I HAVE to use sunscreen every day; I&#x27;m ghoulishly pale. I&#x27;ve even noticed that I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts at all since I started using it (and I generally get a few every month, regardless of what I use), but that could be a coincidence based on other products I&#x27;ve started using. But at least I can say that Burnout doesn&#x27;t aggravate it. Highly recommended for anyone who tends to get zits whenever they use sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is one of the least harmful of the sunscreens, from what I&#x27;ve read, and it blends into the skin pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have a tan/dark complexion and I&#x27;m heavily tattooed... So anything with a white residue is going to make me look like I&#x27;m wearing full body Kabuki makeup!&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the first sunscreens I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue (once rubbed in and absorbed).&lt;br /&gt;The other huge plus is the high rating it gets from the EWG&#x27;s annual Best Sunscreens list... Something everyone should know about.</li>
    <li> its great, but to prevent increase pigment you need to have combo titanium/zinc oxide</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Goes on smooth. Can be used under makeup w/o a greasy feel. Love that my face is uber protected. No more skin cancer hopefully w/ this stuff. HIGHLY recommend. Even bought a tube for my neighbor. 6/4/2015*****UPDATE: my above review was for the very superior OLD formula which was ( 18.6%zinc oxide and 30SPF) and DOES NOT say ECO in large letters on tube. The company made these changes and did not even mention the reformulation. I bought several tubes of the new stuff. HATE IT! It is sticky and greasy,goes on very white. UNLIKE the old superior formula. PLEASE Burn-out give us back the original...</li>
    <li> Am in the medical field so have researched sunscreen. This is my second order. not chalky. not nano. a physical block.</li>
    <li> As a dermatologist, this has become my personal go-to sunscreen because it is:&lt;br /&gt;1) non-nano Zinc, preferably absence of chemical blockers&lt;br /&gt;2) SPF &amp;#62; 30&lt;br /&gt;3) it truly is clear and non-greasy (but hydrating).</li>
    <li> My family and I have been using this sunblock daily for several years and I used to recommend it to all my friends.Even carried it to Europe for my friends there. It used to be non-greasy, fast drying, clear on the skin, and worked well under make-up or on sensitive skin. It had a short and very basic ingredient list with no nasty surprises.&lt;br /&gt;However, the company has recently changed the formula of this sunblock by adding almost a third of new ingredients to increase its SPF30 to SPF 35. As a result, this new sunblock is so much greasier and goes on much whiter that the previous one. When I compared the list of old and new ingredients, I noticed it is now 30% longer with all kind of stuff that wasn&#x27;t there before: Polysorbate 60,Cetearyl Glucoside,Polyglyceril-3,Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Ricinoleate, and on and on. What is all this stuff?!Why did they have to mess with a good product? It used to be the safest and best performing sunblock on the market-- in the past,the Environmental Working Group rated it as the top sunblock for its health safety.&lt;br /&gt;The new version of this sunblock is absolutely inferior to the old one. Now, it is no different of any other physical sunblock on the market: greasy, white on your skin and not suitable for use under make-up unless you love the shiny face effect. With all the new ingredients, I also find it more irritating to my kid&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just to make it clear, the reformulation was done just in the past 2-3 months and the majority of old glowing reviews are for the old formula. The new sunblock has the word ECO in large letters on the top  and no longer has \\&quot; water resistant for 40 min\\&quot; promise on the bottom ( or anywhere else, for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;What is also annoying that there is no warning on the tube that the formula has been changed. How about giving us, loyal  customers, a heads-up that you have made some significant changes? As a result, I unknowingly purchased several tubes (at $16+ per each tiny tube) of an inferior new product without ever having a clue. I am unhappy with this sneaky approach by this company and will no longer trust them or buy their products.</li>
    <li> The new formula is bunk! Please bring back the old SPF-30 formula. At the vary least please tell us when you &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the product so we can decide if we want that.</li>
    <li> This worked good and was not pasty at all. Did not burn while in the Mexico sun all day. Waterproof as well, did not have to re-apply.</li>
    <li> I will not use a chemical block on my face. I first used a product called Cotz which was like theater grease paint. The cap had to be screwed-off entirely and it dispensed through a pin hole opening. All of these issues are not experienced with Burn Out. It is not the cheapest sun protection product out there but it was well thought out for fast outdoor use and it blends-in very well</li>
    <li> I have been using a lot of different sunscreen including La Roche Anthelios 50 and I like this one the most because it actually control my oil.  I have combination skin and my face would look very oily using other sunscreen but this one stay matte all day.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best and was recommended to me by an esthetician for my Rosacia. It is so gentle and really keeps out the sun. I don&#x27;t have to reapply it all the time either. I only wish I did not have to pay shipping, which costs almost half of what one tube costs! Usually I buy two tubes at once to get the free shipping.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a thick white sticky film on your face ..waste of my money ...</li>
    <li> If you want to look dead, stock up!!! It is advertised as being clear but it isnt, and you look like a ghost.</li>
    <li> The least greasy, least white physical sunscreen I have found. I&#x27;ve been through three tubes. I have tried Badger, Loving Naturals (blech!) Blue Lizard and many others. This and Clinique City Block are the only ones I have repurchased.     If you burned with this you did not apply enough or did not reapply when it was necessary. This is very effective sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is very good fragrance-free sunblock. It is not too heavy or too white in color. I recommend this to all people who dont want perfumes.</li>
    <li> Good but too expensive</li>
    <li> Works well for my toddler.  We live in an extremely hot climate near the equator.  This stuff goes on well and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead, pale-faced woman with very sun-sensitive skin.  VERY.  This goes on very thick.  After a few minutes my body heat melted most of the &amp;#34;white look&amp;#34; away. This is a barrier sunscreen so it is supposed to stay on top and &amp;#34;shade&amp;#34; your skin.  No discernible smell to me.  I noticed that it settled on my hair follicles after cutting the grass in 90+ degree weather and profuse sweating.  But NO SUNBURN.  If you are considering the Blue Lizard - I bought it too. No sunburn either, but it is very thick and whitening.  I felt it still on me until I showered and washed it with soap.  I have acne prone skin - no problems. In fact it dried me out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the BurnOut though.  It just felt better.  It is listed on the www.ewg.org website as a safe product. Their FIRST recommendation is COVER YOUR SKIN no matter what product you are using.  You only have one skin - protect it at whatever the price.</li>
    <li> Some people have mentioned the stickiness but I find that this actually helps my makeup to adhere better - it stays put all day long, plus no shine - hurray!</li>
    <li> Greasey and leaves white residue</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer.  The new formulation is sticky and greasy.  They had it right originally, but went and messed up a perfect sunscreen with one that no longer works for me.  The new formulation is by far the stickiest sunscreen i have ever used.  If you like having your hair stick to your face all day, then this would be the sunscreen for you.  I would say it is similiar to wearing sticky lip gloss and having the wind blowing and your hair sticking to your lips.    It is embarrassing.  I can&#x27;t wear this sunscreen to work since having hair stuck to my face does not look very professional.  I only wished i hadn&#x27;t bought multiple tubes of this new formulation.    Update:  i emailed burnout to let them know they need to change the formulation back.  They now have a sunscreen specifically for the face that is not greasy.  They sent me samples and I tried it and it is similiar to the original formulation and even better in fact.  It is slightly lighter weight and leaves your skin dewy without a white cast.  Currently it only comes in a jar, but i was told it will be offered in a tube in about a month.  I can&#x27;t wait to get the tube.</li>
    <li> What are you doing BurnOut? You used to have the very best sunscreen for both children and adults. Now you have changed the formula. I am looking at the old bottle (purchased in May 2013) right now. It is a list of natural ingredients. It has worked perfectly each and every time we have used it. Now I need to waste a few more hours of my life to find another sunscreen.... I hope someone from the company reads this review and responds. I will become a loyal customer again if you change the formula back to the way it was, which was natural and effective. It looks like many other reviewers agree. Did you make these changes to save money? This is what it seems like to me, given the nature of the changes. So disappointed in you BurnOut. We are going to try ThinkSport Kid Safe Sunscreen Thinkbaby Livestrong SPF 50+, which is a 20% Zinc Oxide formulation.  Hopefully we can find a product that is as good or better than the &#x27;old&#x27; and now &#x27;retired&#x27; Burnout.</li>
    <li> I like the Eco-friendliness of the lotion and how it leaves my skin non-greasy and without the white residue of other sunblock lotions. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Please note that this has been reformulated! New ingredients are below. If you love the old version, please email the company and plead with them to change it back :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient: Zinc Oxide (non-nano) 18.9%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Polysorbate 60, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Stearyl Alcohol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Ricinoleate, Isostearic Acid, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol,  Xanthan Gum, Carrageenan, Helionori, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice,  Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Ethylhexylglycerin.</li>
    <li> I have been religiously using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch for years now, and have been happy with it except that it burns my eyes and are made up of too many toxic chemicals. I wanted to move onto a physical sunscreen, which is oxybenzone-free, paba-free and uses no nano zinc particles. The only worry was that physical sunscreens tend to lay on thick and chalky, which didn&#x27;t work for me as I would put it on before I go into the office everyday. I did not want to go into work looking like I&#x27;m going to the beach!    Received my tube of Clean and Clear 2 days ago and I am just AMAZED. It is just as sheer as the Neutrogena, without all the chemicals! Now I regret that it took me so long to switch over. I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!    Will be testing it on the beaches of Carmel over Memorial Day weekend. Will update on how it does on the beach.</li>
    <li> BEST and healthiest sunscreen out there. I switch between this and Tate&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Why, why did they have to change the formula?  It was the perfect sunscreen for me, keeping me from turning into a cherry AND absorbing oil!  Then, they changed the formula and now it is not as effective at either of those things.  My makeup slides off and I&#x27;m red to top it off, very attractive.  Sigh.  I&#x27;m trying adding zinc oxide to my makeup and see what happens from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original formula &#x3D; 5 stars (faaaabulous stuff!)&lt;br /&gt;New formula &#x3D; 2 stars (less a star for: redness after even walking to my car, oily, changing the formula)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 10/22/2014:  I started adding zinc oxide non-nano uncoated powder to my Clarins foundation and it is turning out great!  I opted for lalune naturals Zinc Oxide Powder.  I do have to use a little more foundation to make sure I don&#x27;t end up with a white tint, but overall, I could not be happier with both the sun protection and the oil absorption.  No more need for a sunscreen at this point.  Hope this helps someone else out there!</li>
    <li> After trying 10+ different sunscreens for my super sensitive son (including half of the $$$ ones at whole foods), this one was the only sunscreen that didn&#x27;t give him a terrible rash and puffy eyes.  Protection is great.  He can go in the pool for about 1.5 hours before I need to re-apply.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen clogged my pores and made me break out so badly. I saw a lot of great reviews on this product but I suppose it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great it goes on clear with no fragrance and does the job!  However I do wish for the money it was a larger tube , this won&#x27;t last long for me as I use it on my face everyday.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a physical sunscreen to see if it would make me break out less -- in that regard this sunscreen wasn&#x27;t too bad.  It also blended in well enough that it didn&#x27;t leave me looking too much like a ghost (although I&#x27;m already quite pale to begin with).  Unfortunately I&#x27;m rating it lower because I couldn&#x27;t stand the texture it left my face with.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to describe it... dry and tacky and not soft or feeling moisturized at all.</li>
    <li> This is the only sun screen I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause itching.  It is recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I used Epicuren Zinc Oxide sunscreen for years.  It is hard to find a zinc oxide sunscreen with a nice texture.  The BurnOut Eco-Sensitive zinc oxide sunscreen is just as good if not better than the Epicuren one.  It has a similar nice texture that soaks in well.  The BurnOut is also a higher SPF and half the price.  I have switched!  BurnOut is my new go to for sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11-17-2012  I have since quit using this as my everyday sunscreen.  It seems to break me out.  I suppose it could be a hormonal shift or something,  but it only seems to happen when I use this sunscreen regularly.  I still use it when going out for an event in the sun (swimming, water park, amusement park, etc) or something like that, but I have quit using everyday under my makeup because it seems to break me out.</li>
    <li> I am so pale I&#x27;m practically albino. I live in FL and get blistering sunburns just walking from my car to a store sometimes.  I&#x27;ve tried the common brands in stores, and I still seem to burn right through them.  This is a zinc based sunscreen, but is CLEAR.  It is highly effective and I&#x27;ve spent days in full sun on my kayak or on a boat and haven&#x27;t gotten burned (except for the inevitable spots you miss - perhaps a solid white sunscreen has a few advantages).  So happy to have found a great sunscreen that is safe and environmentally sensitive.</li>
    <li> I recently discovered this suncreen. It feels light and is transparent, not easy to find. Decent ingredients. Am very happy with it, though find it a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many sunblock products on the market and have only been mildly pleased with any of them.  I live in Arizona and you really need to protect your skin here on a daily basis.  Read some good reviews and decided to give this one a chance.  So very glad I did.  Yes, it says Zinc oxide in the ingredients.  But it leaves no white residue at all.  I use it on my face and neck and find it to be a very clean, light, and not greasy at all.  This is definitely a &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34;.  I will be purchasing more of this immediately.  Great product and I highly recommend you give this one a try.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is natural and only contains zinc oxides which is a mineral sunblock. It leaves a matte finish on my face and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue. It never made me break out even though I have acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend uses it when he surfs and he loves it. He says that it doesn&#x27;t runoff or end up in his eyes and he never got sunburn wearing it. We bought it for the first time in a surf shop in Santa Cruz and a guy who had skin cancer in the past said that he was using this sunscreen now because other chemical sunscreens have more chance to give you cancer than protect you from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> This was my daily sunscreen for a bit until my friend told me about Thinkbaby. This sunscreen is still great though. i love that it has no scent, is non-greasy, and safe/non-toxic per EWG. It is a little tacky in texture, which my other friend loves because she has oily skin and doesn&#x27;t like to use a lot of other sunscreens for that reason. However, my friend who told me about Thinkbaby doesn&#x27;t like the tacky texture at all. I prefer the Thinkbaby since it has higher amount of zinc oxide. But this is still a great sunblock option especially if you want a non-scented, non-greasy, and non-toxic sunblock.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product ~2 weeks ago. Every time I did a lactic acid peel on my forehead, it pretty much re-darkens after a couple weeks. As at then, I was using a neutrogena sunscreen. I switched to this after searching all over the net for a good and affordable ZO ss for hyper pigmentation prone skin. Long story short: my forehead has stayed clear and even since I started using this. As time goes, I&#x27;ll update you all. (Wish me luck)</li>
    <li> What a great sunscreen! Feels good on the skin, dries clear, not scented - very happy with this product - and it&#x27;s made in California! I read the ingredients list while shopping for sunscreen, and this one stood out for the minimal list of ingredients - nothing objectionable. And it&#x27;s well-priced. I&#x27;m ready for summer!</li>
    <li> The only things I don&#x27;t love about this are the price and the fact that I can&#x27;t get more at one time yet. Bigger bottle please.</li>
    <li> I got serious about using sunscreen on my face daily after I started using a retinol A product on a regular basis (makes skin more sensitive to sun). I had a long list of must haves - no nano particles, 100% chemical free, fragrance free, non-greasy, not chalky, not too ridiculously expensive, and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I thought for sure any sunscreen that didn&#x27;t turn my face white would have nano particles. Well, Burnout has exceeded my expectations. I wish I had found this sunscreen in my teenage years!! It feels light, almost instantly disappears into my skin, and not greasy at all. It&#x27;s almost like I am just putting on a regular moisturizer. I was using California Baby while waiting for this product to arrive and holy cow what a difference! This stuff is the best and now I don&#x27;t mind putting on sunscreen my face and neck everyday.</li>
    <li> If you are allergic to sunscreen this is the best product I can find on the market.  It&#x27;s a physical block, and it&#x27;s the most easily spreadable one, that leaves you the least white and pasty looking of all the dozens of others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other clear zinc&#x27;s on the market, but this is the only one I have found that does not have Oxybenzene in it, and that&#x27;s the part that my husband&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t like it seems.</li>
    <li> I agree with what several reviewers have stated.  BurnOut changed their formula to SPF 35 from SPF 30 -- even though the difference between 35 and 30 is minuscule.  Instead, we have a sunscreen that is much more greasy, creating more of a sheen when you apply it -- rather than a preferable matte finish.  BurnOut also included more chemicals into the formulation . . . not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing.  If you&#x27;re looking for a natural sunscreen, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This works great, but it does leave a bit of white behind when I rub it in.</li>
    <li> This pure zinc oxide sunscreen is GREAT!  I use it every day on my face for maximum protection.  It&#x27;s NOT white once you put it on at all.  It soaks right in and disappears.  I put a small amount in my palm and rub my hands together.  Then I spread it on my face, wait a minute, then put on my make-up.  It&#x27;s not greasy, shiny or white.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate like chemical sunscreens can.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, no white residue, matte finish and no breakout! Great sunscreen over all! I&#x27;ve tried so many natural sunscreen and all of them break me out.This is what have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy. No obvious film. Highly effective. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Can wear under make up. Lasts all day and keeps your skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked well for me. It&#x27;s Eco-friendly, and that&#x27;s what I needed for snorkeling in Cozumel. Just don&#x27;t forget to reapply after getting wet!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this religiously because of the white cast it leaves on my skin so i can&#x27;t speak for its performance as a sunblock. I feel like i still tanned while i had this product on. Will however give it another chance and see</li>
    <li> I love the sunblock. The best sunblock I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> One of the best non-chemical sunscreens I have tried. None of the problems described by other reviewers who were critical. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s been available for a more reasonable price than when it first appeared on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen a year ago and fell absolutely IN LOVE - it was light and almost watery/Cooling on the skin. I use it on myself and two children. So --- was time to repurchase....&lt;br /&gt;...I was sooo disappointed - they reformulated it. Both my new tubes were thick as heck and beyond sticky and gross feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am soooo bummed!!!&lt;br /&gt;The original formula was my holy grail - loved it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m on the hunt for a new brand...</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was recommended for sensitive skin. I found it to be very drying immediately upon application.  It does go on clear, which is nice, but I am unable to use it on my extremely sensitive, dry skin.  Back to my more exspensive brand.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and have tried many types of sunscreens. Most dry in white streaks or I sweat them off during the day. Some brands cause a burning sensation on my face or, if I apply them on my forehead, they end up getting in my eyes. I took the Burn Out sunscreen on a trip to St. Maarten (lots of swimming) and later to Zion National Park (lots and lots of hiking). This sunscreen performed beautifully. I put it on my face, arms and hands (used a spray for my legs) and I had zero sunburn at the end of each day. I usually reapply once during significant activity and find that it lasts all day. The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> As someone with a history of basal cell carcinoma and consequent Mohs surgery, I need the best sunscreen I can find. I&#x27;ve tried so many, and they either don&#x27;t offer much protection, smell terrible, or leave a sticky feeling. I mix a small amount in my hand with my foundation before applying, and I love it. No scent and no stickiness. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because I couldn&#x27;t take all the chemicals and smells of the other sunscreens out there (like the Coppertone, Nivea, Aveeno...etc) so I opted for a mineral sunscreen with the zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is VERY sensitive to chemicals and I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells. The other sunscreens make me feel sick to my stomach and gave me horrible headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this sunscreen. I put it on my daughter and myself 15 minutes before heading out into the sun and water. It was very easy to rub in and didn&#x27;t leave us looking white or ghostly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got into the pool I noticed it started to streak and run. I for sure thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but it did!  I don&#x27;t know if what was running of was just extra that wasn&#x27;t completely rubbed in, but it worked great! We were in the sun and swimming for 5 hours, we didn&#x27;t even reapply, and we didn&#x27;t get burned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little odd but not strong. It does smell a little like metal, but it was very tolerable to my sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because even after showering I can still smell it on my skin and my skin is a little dry feeling. But I haven&#x27;t found a sunblock yet that still doesn&#x27;t smell after I&#x27;ve showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also give it 4 stars because even though I squeezed the bottle and mixed up the sunscreen before I opened it, it still felt like it was only 2/3 full. Felt a little light and empty. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a full 3oz.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled. The pictured tube &amp;#34;Burnout 30SPF&amp;#34; is NOT what you will be getting. The 30 SPF was great, but unfortunately, it has been discontinued. This one, the 35, is HORRIBLE! Thick, white while the other actually made my skin look better. I was thrilled when I discovered Burnout 30 SPF for sensitive skin several years ago. After running out, I ordered the Burnout for sensitive skin, only to find out that the 30SPF had been replaced with the 35 SPF. I have searched for the previous one to no avail. Bottom line, the picture is a misrepresentation of what you will be getting. The consistency is not even close to the original. With all of the complaints regarding this, you would think that Burnout would offer the one that was  a hit, especially for those of us who have sensitive skin. The search goes on. (Sigh) Guess it was too good to be true to think that it would last.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.  Absorbs immediately and does not feel greasy.  Would definitely purchase more.  Would like to be able to purchase in Canada</li>
    <li> After 2 skin cancer scares, I wanted to find the best sunscreen and by my Google searches, lead me to this product. It is very thick and bright white. Takes some time to apply to ensure it&#x27;s rubbed in well, which takes some effort. I am a Caucasian male with tattoo&#x27;s. On my skin it wasn&#x27;t as noticeable but on the ink you can see a white film even after it&#x27;s rubbed in making my tattoo&#x27;s look &amp;#34;faded&amp;#34;. Once I showered though, the ink was dark again so I appreciate that this stuff will help prevent tattoo&#x27;s from fading. If you&#x27;ve done any research, SPF 30 is what anyone would need as it blocks 96% of UVA &amp; UVB rays. I was still able to get a slight - slight tan. If tanning is what you&#x27;re looking for, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you want to remain skin healthy - then give this a shot! I did not get a sunburn anywhere this product was placed.</li>
    <li> I used to love this sunscreen. It was perfect: high protection and no shininess... it actually made my face look nice and matte! I reordered it and didn&#x27;t notice the change. Big mistake! Now, it is incredibly oily and hard to rub in. BurnOut: PLEASE bring back the old formula! You are losing so many customers over a foolish change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My kids have sensitive skin and this did the trick!  No break outs or rashes from this product!</li>
    <li> product goes on smoothly, but my skin didn&#x27;t like it and felt itchy after several hours.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen feels great on my skin... it&#x27;s not oily, relatively fragrance free, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
    <li> After buying six different types of biodegradable and organic sunscreens for a trip to Mexico, and not finding one that I really liked on the trip, I was reluctant to try this one on the last couple days. I was pleasantly surprised however.  It was so easy to put on and rubbed in so nicely. No white ghost with this lotion. There was no smell, which was great because some of the others made me smell like putty the whole time I had it on. It didn&#x27;t need multiple reapplying past the norm. And it protected my skin well. I took it again to Myrtle Beach recently and it once again impressed.  I have bad breakouts with sunscreen, and while I breakout on my back while using this, it was so much less than I have gotten in the past. What a relief. My only negative for this lotion is that it is sooooo expensive for so little lotion. It was gone before the end of my Myrtle Beach trip having only used it a total of Mayne five days.  That&#x27;s no good in my book, but I did reorder for next year.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for oily skin; it absorbs without being greasy.  It also does not make your skin look white.  High amount of zinc protects really well and is soothing to skin.  Like the other added ingredients that are good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Other than it ears off a little quicker than other sun products...this cream is great for sensitive skin. My daughter has had reactions to most all sunscreen but this one has passed</li>
    <li> I like this sunblock, because it is relatively harmless to my toddler. However, if it is so hot outside, that the kid sweats, this washes and rubs right off! I could not use it in this case and ended up putting my own sunblock on him. Otherwise we use it all the time</li>
    <li> has a very clinical smell - just okay, better ones out there. prefer the badger sunscreen with lavender.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing for a few years &amp; I absolutely love this sunblock.  I use it on my face &amp; it never gives me an issue - and most stuff makes me break out.  I love that it is &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; free.</li>
    <li> Goes on unevenly. It cakes up and I get spots of white that are very difficult to rub or smooth out. The only comparison I can think of is that it is like trying to rub candle wax into your skin. Although greasy, the Honest Company sunscreen is a better alternative.</li>
    <li> No more teary eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I thought the banana boat for kids was the only sunscreen I could use and still stings my eyes slightly.&lt;br /&gt;But BurnOut has ZERO sting!&lt;br /&gt;Its a little pricey (a lot) but its worth it if I can use it more often.</li>
    <li> Will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but an essential for people with sensitive skin. Have actually researched many different sun screens and this one comes out on top. Living in Florida, a good sun screen is a must.</li>
    <li> Sure, you want to skip all the chemicals and get solid protection from the sun. But, do you want to wash, no, scrub your face 5x in a row and still feel like there is a sticky film suffocating your pores? Then by all means, use this product! I highly recommend EltaMD&#x27;s SPF 46 sunblock lotion. Clear zinc without the sticky film!</li>
    <li> non toxic and vegan, stays on in the water, works on my irish pale skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for this product for years.  Recently I bought this and was surprised how dramatically the new formulation has deviated from the old one.  It is nothing like before!  It now feels greasy and thick just like the average sunscreens on the market that you can pay a fraction of the price for.  Hugely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the non-chemical formula. And it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; (no harmful chemicals) water-proof sunblock you&#x27;ve found it! I absolutely love BurnOut and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Well, this Burnout seems to have a big following, I wish it had worked out better, but honestly I cannot see how anyone would put this on their face every day. Maybe a good beach sunscreen, but even after showering and waking up the next day my face still had a sticky residue, and I have the beginning of a cystic acne spot on my forehead, which I havent had in nearly a year. I&#x27;m sure the ingredients are all safe, but I&#x27;m not sure whether EWG actually tested the sunscreens out or just did an ingredient analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to give up on sunscreens after reading the EWG report, the other natrual physical/zincs (devita, alba natural physical, etc) seem to have the same ingredients as burnout + or - a few, the chemicals seem to all be toxic, and every drugstore facial moisturizer with SPF irritated my skin or made me break out. I will try the Laroche-Posay Anthelios, but some reviews say that leaves people greasy as well, and it is expensive, and it contains Octocrylene which is considered a moderate hazard and &amp;#34;can penetrate into the skin and act as a photosensitizer, resulting in an increased production of free radicals. Free radicals can induce indirect DNA damage and potentially contribute to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users, according to Wikipedia.&amp;#34; So in the end, I think unless I&#x27;m going to be in the sun more than half an hour, I&#x27;m just doing without...</li>
    <li> I like the formula a lot, and on paper, it seemed perfect. But I find the product very sticky and heavy for my combination, acne-prone skin. Also, it broke me out within 3 days, and I had a huge cyst above my eyebrow. The lighter sunscreens I had been using did NOT cause this. I was quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen actually has a calming effect on my problem-prone skin (sensitive to products, mild rosacea, acne breakouts).  And the 18.6% zinc oxide gives me confidence that my skin is well protected from UV waves. It sits lightly on my skin and any white cast is minimal to none. I don&#x27;t use this sunscreen on days spent mostly indoors at home/office or running errands, but for outdoor activities (gardening, walking, hiking, biking, etc) this is my sunscreen of choice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a result of hormones or age, but my skin is now a lot more sensitive than it used to be.  After having two episodes of contact dermatitis (swollen, very red, and itchy skin) as a result of skincare ingredients that I used to be able to tolerate, I had to completely overhaul my skincare products, including sunscreen.  I had tried \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (i.e., zinc or titanium based) sunscreens in the past, but I could not find one that did not leave me looking ghostly or caused breakouts.  I have very oily skin so I hate anything that feels like it would add more oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone on another skincare forum recommended BurnOut&#x27;s sunscreen, which is how I came to \\&quot;discover\\&quot; it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the company is located in a nearby city, Santa Cruz, CA.  I took a chance and ordered a tube from Amazon and I used it as soon as it came in, while my face was still red and raw from contact dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, BurnOut did not irritate my still-healing skin, which was still red and raw when I started using it.  There is no \\&quot;sunscreen smell\\&quot; that one usually associates with chemical sunscreens, which is a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, on my light olive skin, there is a slight whitish cast, although I&#x27;d be the first to admit that I perhaps put on more than most people, and I reapply at least once throughout the day.  BurnOut Clear has decent water resistance, and the sunscreen achieves that water resistance with ingredients that form a \\&quot;film\\&quot; on your skin, which with this one leaves a slightly tacky texture that might bug the heck out of some people. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, except when I reapply it, and I can see it \\&quot;gunking\\&quot; together in spots (most of it around my hairline), but again, I apply a full teaspoon of sunscreen to my face, which is probably a lot more than most people apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I have had zero breakouts with BurnOut, probably because it uses zinc oxide rather than titanium dioxide.  It goes onsmoothly, spreads well, and has the aforementioned slightly tacky, but not at all greasy finish.  Some dry-skinned folks may find this sunscreen too drying, but since I&#x27;m quite oily, I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  The slight tacky finish doesn&#x27;t really bother me because it does sit lightly on your face rather than feeling heavy and greasy as some sunscreens do.  I imagine that if I were more motivated, I could apply some powder over to mattify everything.  The water resistance is very good, which is a nice change from other natural sunscreens that I&#x27;ve used in the past that have washed right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a decent, non-irritating, non-chemical sunscreen at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5/2/13:  I have since moved on to Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 for my face.  Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 goes on clearer than BurnOut, and the finish is silky-smooth, not the slightly tacky finish of BurnOut, making Elta a superior choice for underneath makeup.  However, since BurnOut is less expensive than Elta, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase BurnOut and use it for my body.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a sensitive skin (especially her face).  Kiss my Face is the only one that works for her face so far so I was looking for higher SPF one.  This one reddened and stung her face so I can only use it on her body.  Not sure what ingredient in it is causing it.</li>
    <li> If you care about what you put on your skin, then this sunblock is for you. It is formulated with effective ingredients that do stop sunburn from setting in and its an eco-friendly product. The sunblock vanishes into your skin without making you excessively pale. The cream blends in better if your face is slightly moist first.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, doesn&#x27;t disappear as easily as the Burnout spf 30 for face and body but is very good otherwise.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I wanted something without all the nasty chemicals that generally come in sunscreen. And it does seem to work, but it has a weird smell so I don&#x27;t like to use it.</li>
    <li> Every year when I go down to spring training I burn that first day in the bleachers.  I have tried every zinc oxide and titanium oxide lotion I could find.  This one was easier to rub in, less white, and I did not reapply in the 4 hours I was sitting in the sun.  I did not burn.  However, the reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars was because I don&#x27;t think the tube was full.  The next day I got pounded by ocean waves (for hours) and it pretty much stayed on.  I didn&#x27;t burn.  Of course I&#x27;m not tanning at all with this stuff on, so I tried going out early one morning without it for a walk on the beach and I burned.  But I wore it the rest of the week on top of my burn and I slowly turned into a light tan...and no peeling.  So I think this stuff is pretty good, albeit expensive, even if you do happen to get a full tube.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have tried every sunscreen under the... well... sun!  If the sunscreen worked, it felt awful on my face.  If it felt good to my face, it didn&#x27;t work.  This sunscreen both works and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with melasma, any amount of sun causes me to get hyper-pigmentation over a significant portion of my face.  With 2 horses, I&#x27;m in the sun for a few hours a day.  I haven&#x27;t had any sun issues since starting on BurnOut, even when I go to the barn 4-5 hours after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put it on, it feels like a nice, moisturizing cream.  It soaks in quickly - by the time I apply my mascara, it&#x27;s soaked in completely.  It does have the slightest of white tinge to it, but nothing like a lot of the physical sunscreens out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had been using this sunscreen for years, then they changed the formula.  It is now very greasy.</li>
    <li> I adore Burnout Eco-Sensitive sunscreen! It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I trust when running, swimming, or at the beach. It has major staying power and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin covered in a whitish cast. When I wear it, my skin stays perfectly pale. It is a cult product among those in the beauty industry. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to wear under foundation.  It&#x27;s simply too heavy for me.  It seemed like I could feel it on my face all day.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to wear it during the summer at the pool, etc., when I&#x27;m not wearing a foundation.  I switched to a SPF 45 BB cream and like that much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first tube of this sunscreen and am ordering a second; this is by far the best general sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m very fair and burn easily with no tanning, so I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen daily on face, neck and back of hands for the past 6 years or so.  I got very interested in pure zinc oxide sunscreens once UVA radiation came into the spotlight, but quickly discovered that it&#x27;s a cantankerous ingredient.  Most are thick and heavy, leaving a white cast on your skin that are difficult to spread.  I&#x27;m a guy, and trying to rub in a heavy cream when you have chest hair is an extremely unpleasant feeling.  I went through a lot of ZnO sunscreens (Coppertone, Glacier, etc) trying to find one that was tolerable to wear every day and that wouldn&#x27;t alter my appearance, and this is the only ZnO sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that does the job,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Rubs in clear and pretty quickly (granted I&#x27;m already pale, but all other ZnO sunscreens still make me look way whiter)&lt;br /&gt;-Has never irritated my skin&lt;br /&gt;-Does its job, I haven&#x27;t been burned while using this (but be smart, sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make you invincible to the sun, just resilient for a few hours.  Wear clothing, reapply, etc).&lt;br /&gt;-Good level of protection for daily wear, and pure ZnO so you get excellent UVA protection as well.&lt;br /&gt;-Stays in place, doesn&#x27;t run or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Gives your skin something of a chalky texture.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out personally.&lt;br /&gt;-Does have a mild scent to it, generally unoffensive, but people can tell you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;-Makes me a bit more prone to sweating where I&#x27;ve applied it, but not enough to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if this works well in water, but I know that BurnOut makes a beach version of this sunscreen that might be worth checking out called BurnOut Ocean Tested.  My guess is that this really isn&#x27;t intended to go swimming with (advertises that it retains its SPF for 40 minutes in water, but I think those measurements are pretty suspect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final word of warning, this is still a ZnO sunscreen.  So far, I&#x27;ve never been able to find one that matches a chemical sunscreen for comfort and ease of application, and this is still true of BurnOut.  I still keep around chemical sunscreens for when I&#x27;m feeling monumentally lazy.  However, it does cross that critical threshold of being useable on a daily basis without being a huge pain to apply, smelling terrible, or leaving a white cast.  In my mind, it&#x27;s darn near perfect.</li>
    <li> I love that this natural sunscreen goes on clear!  So easy to rub in. There&#x27;s not a trace of white. Really nice, quick to use.  No smell either.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product on my face and neck for over two years, and decided it was time to finally go public with a review. I could not be happier. I&#x27;ve been wearing daily sunscreen since the 80&#x27;s when I started using Retin-A for acne. My skin has always been oily and pimply, and as much as I hated putting any kind of product on it, sunscreen was a must because of the photosensitivity. I used department store brand sunscreens (Clinique, Prescriptives, Clarins, etc) in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, but was never a fan. I started Peter Thomas Roth sunblock(recommended by an aesthetician) in the late 90&#x27;s, which worked a bit better for me until I became conscious of cosmetic toxins and did my research (with help from the EWG database.) Found out PTR had a slew of undesirable chemicals and tried about a dozen other less toxic sunscreens, none of which I was happy with. They were usually too greasy feeling or left too much white residue. Just about gave up all hope and was going to go back to PTR when I came across BurnOut. I really could not ask for anything more. It leaves a very faint film that actually works to even out skin tone and a leaves a very matte finish. Even though it does not seem to be drying at all, it&#x27;s so oil controlling that I can actually mix in a little moisturizer before applying it to my face. This is significant because with all the other products I used before, I had to mix in an oil controlling product before applying, even though the T zone shine would still come through after a few hours anyway. I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere without blotting papers. I love that I can control the quality and quantity of moisture that I need when I need it, like in winter. Since switching to BurnOut, I very rarely get whiteheads any more. And though I still get blackheads, I don&#x27;t get them as fast as I used to so I can go months longer between facials, instead of going every two weeks. I get compliments about having beautiful skin now, which never happened to me before. I had such bad skin before it haunted and depressed me. I cannot think of anything negative about this product, which is amazing in itself as battles with teenage and adult acne over the years have given me a crotchety attitude towards skin products. I am not saying this sunscreen will solve your acne problems, but it will not make your problem skin worse. I truly recommend this highly to people with concerns about skin clarity, acne, and/or oily skin. For people with mature, dry skin, I recommend using a moisturizer with it. If this product were ever to be discontinued, I don&#x27;t know what I would do. I know it sounds dramatic, but only if you&#x27;ve been through acne-induced hell would you understand.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Winning combination discovered! Have started mixing in a dab of The Body Shop Honey Bronze gel bronzer to BurnOut to get the most natural looking skin color ever. A little bronzer goes a looooong way. I can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s a bronzer tan till I wash it off before bed and see how fair I am (which shows the BurnOut is doing its job.) Try it for yourself and let me know how it works for you!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Non-greasy. Very little white tint. Very happy with purchase. I have been using Badger sunblock, it&#x27;s so greasy and gets on everything. But, this is great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it&#x27;s one of the top-rated sunscreens on SkinDeep (a nonprofit that rates products based on toxicity). I use it daily. It does take a little work to rub in (it has a bit of a white cast), but it isn&#x27;t too bad. I have extremely sensitive, rosacea-prone skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. If you are looking for a gentle, nontoxic sunscreen for your face, this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> The only sunblock I swear by. I have super sensitive skin and I wear this almost daily. I apply it once my moisturizer has dried and under any light makeup I wear. A bottle lasts a long time because I only need a dime size. Please wear sun protection every day, and with this it will be so much easier because you don&#x27;t have to worry about a breakout.</li>
    <li> I am going to be 49 this year and going through menopause. I noticed little wrinkles being more prominent on my face so I&#x27;ve been using products with vitamin A to stave off the signs of aging. You have to avoid sun if you use retinol products. The worst effects of going through hormonal changes is getting a mustache on the of your lip! It&#x27;s not hair, but the actual skin becoming discolored and darker! It&#x27;s so embarrassing! Sun exposure makes it worse, even darker and I searched Amazon for a product with a high enough zinc oxide content to prevent any sort of tanning. I found BurnOut with 18% zinc oxide so I decided to try it. My friend remarked how pale I was despite the hot Nevada sun, but I don&#x27;t really have any other alternative than being tan with a mustache!</li>
