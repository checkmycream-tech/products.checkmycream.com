      <li>I was really happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Great quality and a great piece.</li>
      <li>Great replica.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be happy to have it in my collection.</li>
      <li>But as props:THESE ARE AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Looks so authentic and awesome.</li>
      <li>It has beautiful etching and the metal it is made of is very strong.  </li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the razor</li>
      <li>and I can now reenact all my favorite scenes from the movie!  </li>
      <li>Wonderfull built, with amazing attention to detail</li>
      <li>It has a nice edge to it though i wouldn&#x27;t try shaving with it.</li>
      <li>It is nice , but requires sharpening to be functional, which I didnt know before purchase.</li>
      <li>Scales are also steel and their detail is etched in nicely.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>it works better than the razors u buy at wallmart.</li>
      <li>i recomend this to anyone searching for sweeney todd razors! :)</li>
      <li>after being horrified with the sweeney todd costume, let me say that this is the hightlight of my holloween, a great blade and good quality, i have been cut a few times, but no doubt my own fault</li>
      <li>The razor is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>But if you want the experience of shaving like the mountain men, you will enjoy this.</li>
      <li>I received the blade in a short amount of time and was happy to see I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>But it is really cool to have</li>
      <li>Received the razor very quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It is a very heavy, sharp, and detailed razor, may require a little honing after buying it but is still good and best of all it is made from great steel.</li>
      <li>it was worth the $$</li>
      <li>If you looking for a fun knife</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a large, unique, inexpensive, friction folding pocket knife, then this is for you.  </li>
      <li>This straight razor looks cool and is of thicker stronger steel than what i thought it would be, Seeing that it was made in china.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but since when are replicas ever exact?</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s exactly what this thing is.  </li>
      <li>The metal it&#x27;s made out of is good and heavy, over all I&#x27;d give the a 5 star review.</li>
      <li>And as props, they are very intricate and the detail is spectacular, not exact</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say look around for another tool, unless you really need a Sweeney Todd knife.</li>
      <li>Well made, very sturdy.</li>
      <li>What steel are they really?</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a baby butt smooth shave, I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s humanly possible to get it from this one.</li>
      <li>STAINLESS CHINA.\\</li>
      <li>Like others have said this does not come with a shave ready edge.</li>
      <li>I will say this, they are not toy&#x27;s or really tools for that matter.</li>
      <li>i like the look and feel of a straight razor rather then a defence knife.</li>
      <li>From the pics I saw online, that&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be, and I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a solid folding knife that looks cool, this is it.</li>
      <li>Again, for basically $10 shipped, these are a bargain, and about the level of fit and finish I expected.</li>
      <li>What I was looking for when I purchased this (2 of them, actually) was a large straight razor shaped pocket knife.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a generic stainless blade with a softer but functional heat treat (think M-Tech, etc.)</li>
      <li>Both of mine came sharp enough to scrape hair off my arm, but with a good reprofile to a shallower angle (from about 50* included down to 40*) they are now hair-popping sharp.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an actual straight razor with the proper blade geometry for shaving, look elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>It does come pretty sharp so I&#x27;d recommend keeping it away from kids.</li>
      <li>One is simply marked \\&quot;STAINLESS CHINA,\\&quot; and the other</li>
      <li>I expected this to be a real razor not a novelty item</li>
      <li>also the blade itself is pretty sharp (definitely not a toy).</li>
      <li>It is sharp but not shave ready.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really too sharp to be a toy or a Halloween prop, but then again it&#x27;s not really sharp enough to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One was nice and stiff (befitting such a heavy blade) while the other was quite a bit looser.</li>

<li> One was nice and stiff (befitting such a heavy blade) while the other was quite a bit looser.</li>
<li> wanted this as a prop for a Sweeney Todd costume and while it looked good and sturdy I decided not to take it with me to the party since it was too sharp and potentially dangerous around drunk people :)</li>
<li> Etching on the scales is deeper on one knife than on the other, and blade grinds are a bit vague and wavy, though not terrible.</li>
<li> The razor is too thick, and large, and looks NOTHING like the movie.</li>
<li> /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m using it as a fancy letter opener, but the lack of a lock makes it rather hard to use for much else</li>
<li> This is a strange product, one one hand</li>
<li> A few taps on the pivot pin with a ball peen hammer on the anvil of my bench vise fixed this without issue.</li>
<li> The scales are also stainless, and are held together with peened pins at both ends, with little tiny pivot washers at the pivot end and a small standoff at the other.  </li>
<li> so i can insert a small steel locker pin to hold the blade in a fixed position when i want and if not just remove it.</li>
<li> It is NOT a straight razor.</li>
<li> Not actually sharp in the least.</li>
<li> They are sharp (in every context of the word) props.</li>
<li> it is poorly titled and came brand new dull not even sharp enough to be used to cut boxes.</li>
<li> straight razor and they will crap their paints like a 2yr old.</li>
<li> (doesn&#x27;t really work for sharpening pencils or cutting tougher material.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However it is a bit heavy</li>
<li> The blade is 3/16\\&quot; thick at the spine and hollow ground down to a relatively thin edge.</li>
<li> Very heavy.</li>
<li> I was at least expecting this would be the sharpest i would ever see it.</li>
<li> This product sucks.</li>
<li> ...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR$$!!!</li>
<li> I was unfortunate to be tricked into buying this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought 2 of these razors to use with my sweeney todd cosplay. And as props, they are very intricate and the detail is spectacular, not exact but since when are replicas ever exact? And for the price, they were a great buy. I will say this, they are not toy&#x27;s or really tools for that matter. They are sharp (in every context of the word) props. I love them. But if you are looking into buying these razors to use as razors, you can but I would say look around and see what else you can find. But as props:THESE ARE AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Received the razor very quickly and it was exactly as described. If you are looking for a solid folding knife that looks cool, this is it. Scales are also steel and their detail is etched in nicely. Like others have said this does not come with a shave ready edge. I am very happy with the seller and the product. Have already recommended it to others. If you looking for a fun knife this is it, if your looking for a close shave...keep looking.</li>
    <li> It is a very heavy, sharp, and detailed razor, may require a little honing after buying it but is still good and best of all it is made from great steel.</li>
    <li> after being horrified with the sweeney todd costume, let me say that this is the hightlight of my holloween, a great blade and good quality, i have been cut a few times, but no doubt my own fault i recomend this to anyone searching for sweeney todd razors! :)</li>
    <li> What I was looking for when I purchased this (2 of them, actually) was a large straight razor shaped pocket knife.  From the pics I saw online, that&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be, and I was not disappointed.  That&#x27;s exactly what this thing is.  It is NOT a straight razor. If you&#x27;re looking for an actual straight razor with the proper blade geometry for shaving, look elsewhere.  If you&#x27;re looking for a large, unique, inexpensive, friction folding pocket knife, then this is for you.  The blade is 3/16\\&quot; thick at the spine and hollow ground down to a relatively thin edge. Both of mine came sharp enough to scrape hair off my arm, but with a good reprofile to a shallower angle (from about 50* included down to 40*) they are now hair-popping sharp. One is simply marked \\&quot;STAINLESS CHINA,\\&quot; and the other \\&quot;440 STAINLESS CHINA.\\&quot;  What steel are they really? 440A? 8Cr13MoV? 5Cr?  Who knows?  It&#x27;s a generic stainless blade with a softer but functional heat treat (think M-Tech, etc.) At this price point you can&#x27;t be too choosy. The scales are also stainless, and are held together with peened pins at both ends, with little tiny pivot washers at the pivot end and a small standoff at the other.  One was nice and stiff (befitting such a heavy blade) while the other was quite a bit looser. A few taps on the pivot pin with a ball peen hammer on the anvil of my bench vise fixed this without issue. There is no play between the blade and scales or between the scales themselves in relation to one another (i.e., a decently solid build). Etching on the scales is deeper on one knife than on the other, and blade grinds are a bit vague and wavy, though not terrible. Again, for basically $10 shipped, these are a bargain, and about the level of fit and finish I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a strange product, one one hand it&#x27;s really too sharp to be a toy or a Halloween prop, but then again it&#x27;s not really sharp enough to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this as a prop for a Sweeney Todd costume and while it looked good and sturdy I decided not to take it with me to the party since it was too sharp and potentially dangerous around drunk people :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m using it as a fancy letter opener, but the lack of a lock makes it rather hard to use for much else (doesn&#x27;t really work for sharpening pencils or cutting tougher material.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say look around for another tool, unless you really need a Sweeney Todd knife.</li>
    <li> It is nice , but requires sharpening to be functional, which I didnt know before purchase. I will get it sharpened soon.</li>
    <li> Looks so authentic and awesome. Great quality and a great piece.</li>
    <li> Great replica. It has a nice edge to it though i wouldn&#x27;t try shaving with it. But it is really cool to have</li>
    <li> I expected this to be a real razor not a novelty item it is poorly titled and came brand new dull not even sharp enough to be used to cut boxes.</li>
    <li> Well made, very sturdy. However it is a bit heavy so I would t use it to shave. It does come pretty sharp so I&#x27;d recommend keeping it away from kids.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Very heavy. It is sharp but not shave ready.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull built, with amazing attention to detail I&#x27;ll be happy to have it in my collection.</li>
    <li> i bought this for myself because i needed a razor to shave my head  with&lt;br /&gt;and it works better than the razors u buy at wallmart.</li>
    <li> This product sucks. Simple as that. I was unfortunate to be tricked into buying this. The razor is too thick, and large, and looks NOTHING like the movie. Trust me...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR$$!!!</li>
    <li> This straight razor looks cool and is of thicker stronger steel than what i thought it would be, Seeing that it was made in china.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor bc i like the look and feel of a straight razor rather then a defence knife. Remember they call it a razor for a reason. As i like to say.... Pull a 6&amp;#34; knife on an attacker and they get scared, Pull a 11&amp;#34; straight razor and they will crap their paints like a 2yr old. I modified mine by drilling the blade and handle so i can insert a small steel locker pin to hold the blade in a fixed position when i want and if not just remove it. All in all it was worth the $$ i payed 4 it.</li>
    <li> The razor is fantastic.  It has beautiful etching and the metal it is made of is very strong.  I am very pleased with the razor and I can now reenact all my favorite scenes from the movie!  Ha Ha.</li>
    <li> Cowboys and pioneers shaved with this type of razor. It&#x27;s a step above shaving with a buck knife. If you&#x27;re looking for a baby butt smooth shave, I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s humanly possible to get it from this one. But if you want the experience of shaving like the mountain men, you will enjoy this. Take it camping or on your next hunting trip.</li>
    <li> Not actually sharp in the least. Couldnt shave a rock with this. I was at least expecting this would be the sharpest i would ever see it.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this purchase. I received the blade in a short amount of time and was happy to see I got my money&#x27;s worth. The design on the handle is well done and looks the part for a Sweeney Todd costume, also the blade itself is pretty sharp (definitely not a toy). The metal it&#x27;s made out of is good and heavy, over all I&#x27;d give the a 5 star review. No complaints.</li>
