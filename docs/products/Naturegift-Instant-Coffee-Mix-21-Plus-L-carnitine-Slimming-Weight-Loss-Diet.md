      <li>Very nice product, tastes great; in addition to the instant coffee - it contains carnitine, vitamins, oligofructose and minerals; this composition may have health benefits.</li>

      <li>This is similar to drinking the cans of monster beverages, but a much better flavor.  </li>
      <li>I do think one should take TWO packets before each meal instead of one to really get the benefits, AND what I have gotten from this product is a sense of calm around food.</li>

      <li>This coffee help me from becoming hungry which in turn helps to loose weight.</li>
      <li>I mean, you don&#x27;t have to add any sweeteners or milk because it&#x27;s already pretty milky and nicely sweetened on</li>
      <li>this helps me fill full until I can grab a snack or my next meal.</li>
      <li>After two weeks of drinking it, I feel like I gained weight not lost, it makes me SUPER hungry all day long!!!!</li>
      <li>Also, there was a little bit of a mix up with the order, but the seller was quick to fix it.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I drink it just in hot water and other times</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Taste good and I think if elimination is a problem it might help.</li>
    <li> I use 2 packets each morning and the taste is great. It fills me up and my appetite is curbed until lunchtime. I have found that if I take in fluids (water, tea, regular coffee) this helps me fill full until I can grab a snack or my next meal. I do not feel jittery or lightheaded. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this type of product and i must say that it is very effective I I&#x27;m very happy with my results</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t quite place the taste but it was unique in a good way.</li>

    <li> I love this product..</li>
    <li> This may work with some but not me. I did what it said and I gained weight. I ride a bike for 5 miles and drink this before bed and I gained 3 lbs.</li>
    <li> Dont like the taste. Too creamy. Not sure if the product works because I didnt even finished my first cup.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but I couldnt give any more info about this product. Thank you</li>

    <li> Very good product, makes u s*** alot and reduces your weight.  I also noticed Im not hungry for lunch when I drink in the morning so it curves appetite, bought two more bags.</li>
    <li> My mother in law used it for one month and she lost 5 lbs!!! What an amazing product. She bought two more.</li>
    <li> I tried diffrent coffee before this one and it worked, but after reading reviews on this product, I wanted to try it. After two weeks of drinking it, I feel like I gained weight not lost, it makes me SUPER hungry all day long!!!!</li>
    <li> good coffee i like it good taste love it i recommend this product to everybody. try it is good and delicious.</li>
    <li> The picture in the catalog showed 10 packets in a bag but when I got it there only 5 in a bag.</li>
    <li> Arrived within the dates provided, excellent flavor, I will write more as I see the results, so far it&#x27;s delicious and so easy to make, just hot water and dissolve the pouch into it and voila! the provider is very friendly and wrote a thank you note and sent an thank you gift. very nice too.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a similar product from Naturegift at a local Asian store. I couldn&#x27;t find the product in my local store. I found this on Amazon. I work nights and add this to my coffee when I an extra kick.  The flavor is good.  I wanted the vitamins and minerals in this.  This is similar to drinking the cans of monster beverages, but a much better flavor.  I recently noticed this product is no longer available through Amazon. Guess I&#x27;ll have to start my search all over again.</li>
    <li> I have gained three pounds, but I don&#x27;t know that it is from the coffee.  I have ordered a total of 6 bags now.  I drink it several time a day.  Perhaps I would have gained more if I hadn&#x27;t had the drink to fill me.  It doesn&#x27;t make me jittery and I think it is yummy.  Sometimes I drink it just in hot water and other times I add it to a cup of brewed coffee.  It has nutritional products in it, so it shouldn&#x27;t be bad for me.  I wish I could read it, everything is in Thia, so I don&#x27;t know what the nutrion or instructions actually are.  I like the flavor, so I do plan to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I can drink it without having to add the sugary creamer since it already has creamer in it.  It&#x27;s pretty smooth.  I ordered it for my mom and she likes it too.</li>
    <li> The directions and the entire label are in Tai language.  I do not see the weight loss happened.  The taste is like other packaged instant coffee.</li>
    <li> This coffee help me from becoming hungry which in turn helps to loose weight. It really has a good taste and is easy to make , just poor in cup add hot water. I take to work for quick pick me up and curve my hunger feelings.</li>
    <li> So, because \\&quot;Anna\\&quot; is deciding to leave very vague reviews about various diet coffees, I decided to add my own-- hopefully actually helpful-- review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TASTE:&lt;br /&gt;This diet coffee, for one, tastes reeeeally good. I was taken aback at the great taste the first time I had it and the taste just seems to grow on me. I mean, you don&#x27;t have to add any sweeteners or milk because it&#x27;s already pretty milky and nicely sweetened on it&#x27;s own, just by adding hot water to the powder. It&#x27;s versatile as an iced drink, too. Each packet is about 70 kcals, which is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight Loss:&lt;br /&gt;For dieting purposes, I have found that it curbs my appetite quite a bit. However, you do have to actually drink this like five minutes before eating (not with your meal) to feel an effect. The package says \\&quot;drink 1-2 packets before each meal\\&quot;, and they mean it. The effects of the coffee will wear off by the time you have your next meal. I haven&#x27;t lost any weight yet, BUT(!!) I do think one should take TWO packets before each meal instead of one to really get the benefits, AND what I have gotten from this product is a sense of calm around food. I don&#x27;t feel horribly hungry all the time and I don&#x27;t have food chatter in my head (\\&quot;what if I eat too much today?\\&quot;, \\&quot;What if I have to go out to dinner and accidentally order something high in calories?\\&quot;, \\&quot;Did I do okay yesterday?\\&quot; blah, blah, blah) all day long. When I do feel hungry, I drink the coffee and don&#x27;t panic over how much I might eat. I like it a lot and will keep buying it simply for those reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also:&lt;br /&gt;It is neat that there are actually vitamins in this coffee drink. It didn&#x27;t make me feel jittery or over-caffeinated either, people. That was a big surprise for me, too. I can drink this before dinner and still go to sleep later!</li>
    <li> There may be those who know this product, and like it...but....It&#x27;s NOT at all like ANY instant coffee I&#x27;ve ever had. Tastes like Potem, with vitamins added.&lt;br /&gt;It would help ALOT if the product Info/Ingredients List was in English.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, tastes great; in addition to the instant coffee - it contains carnitine, vitamins, oligofructose and minerals; this composition may have health benefits.</li>
