      <li>My feet have never felt so good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works really well.  Much better than others I&#x27;ve used. Well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> This little machine works really well on rough heels and callouses. It takes a while to get them smooth the first time (depending on how rough they are) but it&#x27;s easy to maintain them from then on.  It has a good shape and is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Works great and my callus&#x27; are smooth now. Charlene</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works wonders on smoothing my feet. Recommend to anyone that needs a little help.</li>
    <li> Love my purepedi! Would rate the quality 5 out of 5. Does a better job than any pedicure I&#x27;ve had! I will be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> Wow what a great and wonderful product.I have bad hands due to fibromyalgia,so it&#x27;s very difficult for me to grip anything for any length of time,without my hands going numb.this is so simple and quite to use,my hands don&#x27;t suffer.anyone who has problems will know what I&#x27;m saying.love,love,love,this.try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my feet, but the instructions said you could use on your hands which I promptly did. My hands are dried and cracked and snag on my clothes-no amount of lotion (and I&#x27;ve tried them all) has ever helped, just a few seconds with the PurePedi and my hands are silky smooth. My son has very dry elbows which makes the skin look dark like their dirty, he used the PurePedi on his elbows and they are now smooth and clean looking. Ready to use out of the box, rollers are easy to install and a good design to reach wherever! This product does not come with batteries which is stated on the box. Great product!</li>
    <li> The PurePedi does a decent job of removing calluses, but it tends to bog down at times even with new batteries. Another concern that I have is how much the replacement rollers will cost. I fear that the rollers may not last very long.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try an electronic grinder on my feet and my husband teased me but I&#x27;m glad I did. This product worked really well. I like to use the fine grinder and do a little at a time, My heels look and feel better. I apply lotion/cream right after and my skin is able to soak up the moisture right away. A+ for this one.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! The course roller is the way to go - work well.</li>
    <li> Wow, seriously surprised with how well it works. I also purchased the replacement rollers, because i have alot of foot needs, lol. really widdled them down the first time. I look forward to progressively soft feet.</li>
    <li> Time to bring out the flip flops!&lt;br /&gt;The PurePedi instantly removed the dry dead skin without discomfort on my sensitive skin. Leaving my feet smoothed and polished. Easy and comfortable to hold. Clean ups in seconds. Only downside is batteries not included. I give this ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.</li>
    <li> not as powerful as they say, you have to take a lot of time because it bogs down easly</li>
    <li> Item exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> My husband surprised me with a PurePedi and I have to tell you just how awesome this product is!  I have callouses and really, rough, dry cracked heels that only a professional pedicure could address.  Now, thanks to PurePedi, I can take care of these issues at home and don&#x27;t worry about bacteria, too much pressure from the metal blades and the rough scrubbing from that pumus stone they use or or the hassle of going to a salon. I give PurePedi a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5!   It&#x27;s a wonderful product and oh how I wish I had it sooner!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying using my new PurePedi.  I was able to smooth out all the rough spots on my feet just in time for a cruise I went on recently.  The outer edges of my big toes get quite hard and callused.  I used it to trim and smooth them down a little at a time, and it worked like a charm.  It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the volume of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; that flies off my heels when I use this and by how silky smooth my feet are when I finish.  The device is very easy to use and absolutely pain-free.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t work very well. It heats up a lot, which could burn your skin. I think a $10 pedegg works much better for rough heels. I don&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I like this callus remover. It is easy to use and made my rough areas very smooth and polished. Much easier to use than the ped egg I have been using for years.  While it didn&#x27;t remove 100% of the hard skin the first time, I didn&#x27;t expect it to and plan to use it every few days or so until its done.It was a great price too.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  I love it!  Makes my feet feel really smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. It&#x27;s been working well, and my feet are smoother, with very little work. Price is right, too.</li>
    <li> I love in sandals all year long and always struggle with calluses, especially on my heels.  This works perfectly and is pain free.</li>
    <li> I received the PurePedi Electronic Callus Remover as a gift from my daugher and I absolutly love it.  This is a wonderful product and I will absolutly recommend it to my friends and family. On a scale of 1 to 5 I rate it a 5.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is so great, it removes calluses so quickly and easily.  It&#x27;s well made and comes with a spare roller and a coupon to receive another spare so it should last for quite some time.  I am very pleased with it and I think it&#x27;s really good for anyone to use in between pedicures to keep your feet soft and callus free.</li>
    <li> This machine does wonders on a callus. I have hobbit feet and in no time they are soft and smooth. The changeable heads make it so if you want to work on sensitive areas you can. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it takes awhile to remove a thick callus. Not much pressure is able to be applied or it stops spinning. I DO love the convenience and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Awesome product &amp; I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Pure Pedi Callus Remover. I am on my feet all day long and now I am happy to take my shoes off at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Angela~</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Very pleased with how it works.My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It does the job and is not too abrasive.  My feet as ready for summer!</li>
    <li> This thing is wonderful! My feet get pretty rough around my heels and this smooths them out with little effort. If your feet are super super callused, don&#x27;t expect this to be your solution. This is not a belt grinder.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were both impressed with how well this product worked. We would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> My husband used this first and seems to have done a good job on his &#x27;man feet&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it spins too fast, but the rough skin comes off anyway.  For the price, especially because it was a lightening deal, it was a bargain.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!  This little gem is amazing!!  I have had several pedicures and they get some of the callouses off but not all of them.  I have a pedi egg but it is difficult to use as I only have the ability to use one hand.  I am able to reach every where with this and it really does a great job!  It has already made a HUGE difference and I have only used it twice but I am sure that if I use it a few more times my heels will be totally smooth!!  I can&#x27;t say enough good about this!  I am using re-chargable batteries and it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hate it but the one I received was defective and wouldn&#x27;t turn off unless the batteries were removed. I&#x27;ll try my luck with another brand.</li>
    <li> I used it almost immediately after it was delivered.  It worked great and did as it was advertised.  I would agree with other posters that quality batteries make a difference.  Also, you cannot press hard or you will cause it to struggle.  It works just as good with light pressure.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but runs through batteries fast.  We have rechargebles, but I have not finished the job yet, with multiple attempts.  When the batteries are removed, they are very warm.</li>
    <li> Good product made my feet so soft. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is a very simple device, very easy to use. It does the job well and offers two rolls: coarse and fine. I like to use both to get everything and my feet are nice and soft. It certainly does the job and I expect to use it quite a bit during the summer.</li>
    <li> It works great! I was disappointed at first that it did not come with double AA  batteries like most of the similar products  however, the quality of the item makes up for it. It removes the dead skin I have yet to try out the course roller because the basic roller does the job perfectly. It is imperative that you have powerful batteries for this item because the more powerful your batteries are the better it works. It removes calluses and it&#x27;s safe to use on hands. After only 10 minutes of use once a week I can wear heels all day with out my feet feeling sore. It is also safe, gentle and effective to use on people with diabetic foot problems so I purchased one for my mother. Just follow the directions of the enclosed booklet and you will see results within a short time. I recommended it for any person that have problems with hard spots , calluses, or just want their feet to be  smooth.</li>
    <li> Best product I ever used on my feet.  They are nice and smooth now.</li>
    <li> Works well and good price.</li>
    <li> Just finished using the PurePedi for the first time and I love it! Such a simple, but really effective product. It left my feet super smooth and soft. I also like that it&#x27;s small enough that I can take it when I go on travel or vacation. Love it!</li>
    <li> It worked on the areas of my feet that weren&#x27;t too bad, but wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my dry heels.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time with my heals cracking. I take good care of them so that I don&#x27;t. I bought this to help with matainance but it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> Like a belt sander for your feet but quiet and not too rough works great</li>
    <li> Works great. Very unexpected, I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Did a good job. Be careful not to catch skin in roller.</li>
    <li> This is so gentle and easy to use. You can&#x27;t  hurt yourself, because it will stop the roller if you push hard enough. I use this everyday and I have not had any redness or irritation. Make sure you get a good quality foot lotion to put on after, it helps! I have seen a great improvement in the appearance of my feet. Yes it does take time! This callus remover comes with two interchangeable heads. One is course (purple) the other is extra course (turquoise), One cleaning brush and instructions. It runs on two AA batteries not included.</li>
    <li> The purepedi is awsome.  I only user once and my heals are smooth as it can ever be.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  My feet are as smooth as when I was a kid.  Very easy and quick to use!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really take off any callous, weak machine and I still have to go to my podiatrist to do the callous removal properly.  It is probably o.k. if you are a 80lb model witha little rough skin, but that is all this machine can do.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have had dry cracked feet, especially my right one for all of my life.  I have tried everything, but nothing worked until I tried the PurePedi Electronic Callus Remover.  One application using the coarse roller, removed the dead, dry skin.  I now have smooth feet that I can proudly display in sandals.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!! Better than expected, thanks a lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rene Morales</li>
    <li> I have the worst dry heels and with the help of PurePedi I am able to keep them healthy.  So far this has worked the best for my hard to keep hydrated heels.  I highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> This was better then anticipated.  My husband has tried many different things and this is the best.</li>
    <li> The PurePedi is definitely a 5 out of 5!  Works very quickly and very well!  Have ordered another one to give as a gift.  Thank you for such a terrific and easy to use product!</li>
    <li> Took advantage of the lightning deal.  I had some bad callouses on one foot and this unit easily removed them with no discomfort.</li>
    <li> I give your product 5 stars! It was simply amazing! My husband even let me do his feet!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Purepedi on amazon just a week ago, and i cannot tell you how much of a difference its already made. Our feet feel like when we were kids! the rollers are very gently with our skin, but still very effective on our calluses. Have recommended it to a few friends already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this product 5/5.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this.  I bought it for her to replace her &amp;#34;Ped-Egg&amp;#34; and it is a huge improvement over that product.</li>
    <li> So far is a great tool, but I can&#x27;t tell how long the roller will last before I have to but a new one. Pretty sure I&#x27;ll have to buy a few replacement heads soon. But it does a great job. I am using it every day to get my feet back to normal.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of buying one for the wife from quite some time, but the high entry cost always made me wonder if it was worth it. So when a deal came on Amazon on this, I decided to take the plunge and order one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has not been disappointed. It works as advertised, and so far, we&#x27;ve not had to change the battery. Both the blue and the purple rollers that come with it do the task as needed, and I&#x27;ve just been asked to purchase another one for my Mom. As compared to other products in the market, this is value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that using this clever device just one a week keeps my feet smooth.</li>
    <li> I get deep cracks every year in my heels.  This is the first time I have used an electronic callus remover.  I usually get a pumice stone and soak my feet.  That was messy and time consuming for okay results.  The end result from this, AMAZING.  My heels have not been this smooth in years.  I am embarrassed to say that it took about 30 min per foot.  However, I was able to use this without any other prep besides placing a towel under my feet to catch the dead skin and saved my wrist from having to do the grind work.  Four stars because it would be nice for those with severe feet to have a coarser sand paper option.  The included head still worked for the but not as great because it had lost its coarseness (hopefully this is why it was so time consuming).  I have already purchased replacement heads so that I can do maintenance rounds.</li>
    <li> Loved how this works!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works just as advertised. Made my feet feel great. Great communication from seller, will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I saw it on tv first but didn&#x27;t realize how great it would work.  My feet get such bad calluses but the PurePedi made my feet so unbelievably smooth.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical that these battery powered unit would be strong enough to be worthwhile, but i have been pleasantly surprised.  not to say you cannot push too hard and cause it to stop spinning, but you can definitley improve your feet.  you may have to spend some time on it the first few uses if your feet are bad, but you will be impressed after you get the initial layers off.  my feet are VERY smooth and feel great.</li>
    <li> Let me first state that this is not the fault of the product, but my product arrived used. The packaging was clearly mauled and there was skin dust on the smoothing stone.  Disgusting!  I immediately thought, someone apparently didn&#x27;t like this and sent it back, which of course instantly gave me a negative opinion.  I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to give it a fair shot at using and rating by how well it works, but I did put batteries in it and it didn&#x27;t seem to have much power at all!  I mean, seriously, you can stop the spinning stone easily with your hand.  So maybe it was good that it came used...or perhaps this one is just defective.  I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> Much better than expected</li>
    <li> Worth to have one home. No more cracks!!</li>
    <li> I loved this item. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I&#x27;ve already told several people about it. I&#x27;ve had chronic problems with dry, cracked heels and the Purepedi has done wonders in just one week! I&#x27;ve been using it before taking a shower and then putting lotion and socks on after getting out of the shower. My feet have never felt so good. I highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well and makes my feet feel so good!!!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this PurePedi! The handle and size of it all is just great. I love that it comes with two rollers, too! I could tell a big difference in my feet after just one use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s loud but does a good job at removing hard dry skin does not do so well with flaking dry skin.  It really goes through the batteries as well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I am happy to say that this does work. It is easy and painless. It quickly removed the foot callus and hard skin on my heels. Draw back was you provide the batteries so unless you have them sitting around at home it is off to the store for you. One other thing I did not&lt;br /&gt;appreciate is it is made in China. This nation is not known for product safety so I was a bit afraid. Make sure you put some thing under your feet because&lt;br /&gt;you will have a ton of dry skin all over if you do not.</li>
    <li> I used the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; roller, and my teenage daughter used the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; roller.  We both loved it!  It gently shaved away the dead skin from our heels.  Our heels feel awesomely smooth now.  We also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;tracks&amp;#34; like the callous blade shaver.  One thing we wish the PurePedi had is a power adapter although it is not a big deal because the 2 AA batteries seemed to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well on my tough callouses.  I like it better than the ped-egg because I always worried about slicing my skin with the ped-egg.</li>
    <li> I purchased the PurePedi cordless callus remover on June 18, 2015 from Amazon.com. I wanted to use the product for a few months before writing this review. I have used this product several times over the summer and have not had to pay for a professional pedicure. I was truly amazed at how effective this product is in removing dry skin and calluses from my feet. I use this product every two weeks on the bottom of my feet and heels. My feet feel so smooth and soft after I use it. This was definitely a purchase I would recommend and am happy about making.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She used it on one foot for a few seconds and was impressed by the difference it made. She then asked me to try it. I had never bothered with pedicure in the past. So it&#x27;s safe to say that my soles were not the smoothest. A few seconds of usage smoothed out all the rough patches on my feet. We are very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It made my feet feel wonderful. Saves me from going to nail salon so much</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It removes the dead skin on my heels as if by magic.  I just glide the brush over the heels and I see cleaner, pinker skin.  This is especially great when you wear sandals for the day and your heels are grimy.  A quick sweep with the PurePedi and it looks like you just had a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and to clean, after the first time using could feel the difference on the bottom of my feet.  Very happy feet!</li>
    <li> So easy to use and left my heels feeling baby soft. I&#x27;m buying one for my Mom now too. Love this! The blue roller says it&#x27;s extra coarse, but it&#x27;s the most effective for me.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised.  Good product</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Just used it once and I have already tried recommending it to friends and family. An extremely effective and easy to use product.</li>
    <li> Operates well and it seems to be durable.</li>
    <li> Although initially I found this item ridiculous, I now find this product very useful.  The PurePedi is gentle and effective.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased the PurePedi for my husband and he loves it!  Much better &amp; smoother than the manual ones.&lt;br /&gt;fwa</li>
    <li> Works well and is exactly as described</li>
    <li> This product worked as advertised.  I would rate it a 4. The only drawback is that it appears to need replacement rollers somewhat often.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I have been wanting one of these for a long time and when it came available on a Lightening deal I HAD to jump on it!!! I am SO glad I did....I also purchased two sets of replacement parts...coarse and extra coarse...personally I like to start with the extra coarse and then finish up with the coarse...heels and feet now as smooth as silk...the unit does not come with batteries which is no problem as I always have a healthy supply on hand and I do recommend changing them out often to get full power from the PurePedi...this saves me SO much time and elbow grease working on my feet with an awkward foot file or pumice stone and much more effective!!!...definitely recommend treating yourself to this purchase!!! Also works great on rough spots I develop on my hands from working.</li>
    <li> I just received and used my PurePedi and I love it! I promptly threw away my old &amp;#34;egg.&amp;#34; I am going to be ordering these as gifts for my sisters and mom. They&#x27;ll love them too!</li>
    <li> My neighbor told me about this product. I have horrible feet that like to crack. You can&#x27;t even feel it do the work. My feet are so much smoother. I love it!</li>
    <li> works pretty good hope it lasts</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 80-year old mother. she has the worst time keeping her feet in good shape. this works wonders!</li>
    <li> Works great!!! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Great!  Does the job and very easy to use.  A lot easier then a pumice stone.</li>
    <li> I gave it five stars but would give it more if I could!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this pedi tool.  I like how easy it is to clean. the roller pops off so you can brush it or rinse it off. I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now, I&#x27;m happy with the results. I would like the option of a coarser roller, but I&#x27;m seeing good results with the roller provided. My heels are much smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost everyday since receiving it a couple weeks ago.  It works, nice and easy..</li>
    <li> Works very well, just follow the directions and make sure you have a towel under your foot, because it makes a mess with all of the skin it takes off.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all on your feet, just don&#x27;t use on your elbows if you have extra skin on your arms, because it will grab it and that hurts.</li>
    <li> I used the callus remover once since receiving it last week and so far I&#x27;m satisfied by the performance. I only tried the course roller with some generic batteries and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Works well however the rollers only last a single use pretty much. My feet are not even that thick... Just seems like an expensive options</li>
    <li> So far so good, everything worked as suggested. Great Product</li>
    <li> While it does work, it only takes off the thinnest layer of skin. I use it more as a smoother because trying to use it to remove calluses would take hours!</li>
    <li> The product has worked amazingly well in 2 applications.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it! I had lots of areas of rough and calloused skin on my feet, and one use of this device had my feet sandal ready. It really is much better than I thought it would be. I rate it a 5 on a 1-5 scale. I am so happy with this device that I&#x27;m telling friends and family!</li>
    <li> Useless for serious callus issues, I returned it, but I guess if you need something VERY gentle or tend to injure yourself easily or without knowing, this could be the item for you. Mine are mostly on my heels and when cracked have commonly measured just over 1/8&amp;#34; deep, this was like nothing even on the lighter areas on my toe pads and such. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I was using the Ped Egg file but this little gadget removed hardened skin on my heels much better and faster.  Thanks Amazon for having this as a lightning deal for me to try it out.</li>
    <li> WOW! I could&#x27;ve saved a bundle just using sand paper. Essentially all this is, is a sandpaper roller, hooked up to a grinder. It&#x27;s does what it says though. It does have multiple speeds: Ouch, and OH MY GOD WHAT DID I DO!!?</li>
    <li> Grinding the calluses and other gross ugly things from my feet is now easy and quick!  Thank you Mr. Pure!</li>
    <li> Great item.  Did a better job than expected on removing the tough calluses on my heels and the hard to reach balls of the feet. Would highly recommend this to anyone who has problems with calluses.  Extremely easy and effortless to use.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It works exactly as described, and my feet feel amazingly soft.</li>
    <li> I love using this to maintain my pedicure.  It is also great to smooth rough skin around the fingers.  It is simply, easy and effective</li>
    <li> I received this product today and tried it immediately.  I was very impressed with the way it works. I am ordering one for my daughter too Trying figure out how to register the PediPure  Update - I ordered two more for my daughters.  This product works great.</li>
    <li> Just got the PurePedi in the mail, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out to see if it actually works. IT DOES! Given I don&#x27;t have any super intense calluses, but I definitely had them. I notice that my feet get rougher in the summer time when I am wearing shoes less. Anyhow, after using PurePedi my feet feel super soft and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product. My husband is going to try it out tonight (he has worse calluses than I do), so we will see how it works for him. Just a run down of what you get: One PurePedi, 2 callus removers rollers (one coarse and one extra coarse), a brush to clean the remover, and a travel cover for the callus remover roller. It needs 2 double A batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall...I recommend!</li>
    <li> he product was easy to use and has an comfortable design.  It is efficient and effective so I give it a 5/5.</li>
    <li> Just pulled it out and used it! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It worked just great. Smooth heels from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Linda T.</li>
    <li> * great safety features.&lt;br /&gt;* easy to hold - even for those who have hand problems.&lt;br /&gt;* Vibration is not irritating to a hand holding the device.&lt;br /&gt;* very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;* would recommend it to a friend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of me wishes that:&lt;br /&gt;* extra coarse roller was even more coarse&lt;br /&gt;* Speed of the roller was faster</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have had a different brand (sold at Wal-greens) and it worked, but the heads were so expensive.  The replacement heads for this one are so much more reasonable, and it works even better than the name brand one.</li>
    <li> The tool is easy to use, comes with a coarse and fine rotary file, and runs for quite a long time on 2 AA batteries. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I used my PurePedi this morning and I love it.  It was painless and very efficient and I am very happy with it.  I do wish the rollers would last a bit longer though so I&#x27;m glad you are providing 2 free ones.  I will continue to use this product.  And now after a week, I have to say that the painful callus I have had on the ball of my left food is painless!!  I REALLY love this gadget!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the way you have to clean it- the brush they give you for doing it is too small &amp; not effective- it also made my feet burn for an hour plus after using it &amp; I followed the directions &amp; the recommended time perfectly- there are other products on the market that do the same as this does. like a pumice stone for much less money &amp; a little bit of time invested!</li>
    <li> works well to remove dry skin on feet</li>
    <li> This works great! I used it on my boyfriends feet who I fight with regularly to take care of his callus&#x27;! It took a little while to get to the bottom on it, but it was well worth it.  It works better than any metal file that we&#x27;ve tried.  I would HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
    <li> A gentle way to remove calluses.  I don&#x27;t believe the rollers are going to last through many uses because it does take a while to remove thick calluses.  It&#x27;s preferable to a callus scraper.</li>
    <li> This is a great home tool for pedicures!</li>
    <li> Surprisely easy to use and I applied the gentle roller and it does make my feet smoother</li>
    <li> Love this little gadget!  It has done an excellent job of keeping my feet in shape in between pedi&#x27;s, so much so that I noticed they don&#x27;t pull out the big file anymore, lol.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems running through batteries, and it&#x27;s been a couple of months.  I even got one for my bestie!</li>
    <li> This works well, but takes a while to get the results I want. Don&#x27;t know how long batteries will last.</li>
    <li> This product is the best invention EVER!  It really works great. I wish I would have purchased this months ago.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this callus remover.  I&#x27;ve tried several similar items - the Pedi Egg, pumice stones, microplanes, creams, gels, etc.  I&#x27;ve never had good luck with any - in fact, I&#x27;ve hurt myself from being over-zealous with the microplane.  The PurePedi is simple, effective, takes no effort and I am stunned by the amount of dead skin that comes out of it!  It&#x27;s painless and very effective.  The device is very sturdy and is quite powerful with a brand new set of batteries.  I use in on average of 2-3 times per week.  The first time, I really removed a lot of dead skin and calluses - and now I use it mainly for upkeep.  The only downside is the battery life - but given how powerful and effective this tool is, that&#x27;s to be expected.  I love it so much that I purchased additional PurePedis for my friends and family.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, works well</li>
    <li> No need to get a pedi! Used this a few times and then put some coco butter on my feet and they are super smooth!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product and recommended to my daughters</li>
    <li> Works well if you use a light touch.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Its simple to use yet very effective!  Highly recommend this product to anyone looking to soften their feet.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and my feet are no exception. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of things to keep my feet smooth and soft with little success. The first time I used this I was amazed. It’s fast, easy and you don&#x27;t have to wear gloves to protect your hands (like you do with some liquid callus removers) - best of all it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are just as smooth using this as they are after I have a pedicure - maybe even better. A definite &amp;#34;great buy&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Awesome tool. Works better than any hand held. Wish I had it years ago.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My skin has never felt so smooth!</li>
    <li> Have had cracking skin on my heels that would get painful quite regularly. Used this callus remover one time and it painlesly removed virtually all of the problem skin. It is essentially a battery powered sander that has a good grit barrel and very good speed for skin removal. Looking forward to using it more and hopefully resolve the problem for good.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s gentle yet effective at removing calluses. it didn&#x27;t get rid of all my rough calluses at once, but it made my soles much smoother than before. perhaps with more treatments the calluses will be totally gone. i like that there was no mess and all.</li>
    <li> I loved this product and rate it a 5.  Made my feet very soft and I am very happy with the outcome!  I have tried stones and lotions and nothing worked, pumice stones just felt like they tore my skin instead of smoothing it.  This product is gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a new customer, who used the Purepedi twice in one night. Once on my feet and then in my boyfriend&#x27;s. We are both so very impressed with this little gadget that we decided to get another from Amazon .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this tiny miracle.</li>
    <li> Works but wish it had more power</li>
    <li> I just received my PurePedi from Amazon this afternoon and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my adult life, heck, even as a teenager, I&#x27;ve had really thick calluses on my feet... just like my mother and her mother. To say they&#x27;re uncomfortable would be to put it very mildly... in the summer, they&#x27;re at their worst; they crack, making it painful to walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything... from foot emery boards (tedious) to pumice stones (a joke) to callus shavers (dangerous!), and finally found an acceptable solution several years ago in the PedEgg/Microplane-style foot rasps, though it&#x27;s very easy to get too carried away and break the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the PurePedi as one of Amazon&#x27;s lightning deals, I decided to give it a shot. As a first impression, I have to say I&#x27;m VERY impressed--it&#x27;s easy-to-use, gentle, and *most importantly* effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this product and seeing how well it works, I would feel very comfortable recommending it to my friends/family as a great value even at full price. Though I cannot speak to the durability of the rollers over time, I can say that the device itself (I&#x27;d give the quality a 5/5) as well as how easy it is to change out the rollers makes this a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> This thing is great! Sure easier than using a stone or foot file.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I ordered this because I was sceptical due to the price. I am so glad I tried it!  I had thick, ugly callouses on my feet. I hadn&#x27;t gotten a pedicure in a year because I was so embarrassed. I used the coarse file and in just a few minutes they were gone. I just ordered replacement heads so I will never be without it. It honestly did a better job as far as getting dry skin and callouses off my feet than a salon.</li>
    <li> Smooth feet for sure! This really does work better than any other product I have tried, chemical or manual. I will be recommending this to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give it 1 star!  No power at all!!!  I tried to return but seller closed return window after 2 weeks!!  I wonder why?!?!  It&#x27;s the worst product I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon by far!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!  I wish someone had left a review like this. Lightening deals aren&#x27;t always GOOD deals! 😩</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my feet feel. It might have been smaller than expected but it does the job. I think it does the job just as well as going into</li>
    <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughtful husband gave me a PurePedi for my birthday.  I would rate it 5/5. I have some scarring from prior foot surgeries and this roller works better than anything I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much!!!</li>
    <li> Great purchase!  I&#x27;ve struggled with &amp;#34;man feet&amp;#34; for my entire life, and have finally gotten a routine down that works for me, but was still struggling with those last bits of flaky dry cracked skin.  While I still need to soak my feet and use a callus shaver for the thick calluses I am cursed with, this product is WONDERFUL at smoothing out the ragged edges or flaky dry spots that you just can&#x27;t shave off.  Very glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool. Works better than any hand held.</li>
    <li> It works really good.</li>
    <li> This is a 5 all the way, I love the PurePedi i.t works great!!!!</li>
    <li> What an awesome device, the price is right. This works as it says it does, it really takes care of business and I am pleased I gave this a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with the ability to receive free extra rollers.  This reduces the time it takes to round out, then using a stone. Much smother now :)</li>
    <li> The PurePedi Electronic Callus Remover was amazing.  It was effortless, took very little time, and was quiet.  Don&#x27;t forget to put a towel under your foot before you start.  The start button was a little hard to push, but I&#x27;m sure it is that way for safety reasons if a small child were to get a hold of it.  I recommend it to anyone who wants nice smooth feet with little effort.</li>
    <li> Great product - it looks like a mini power sander!  It quickly and gently removed rough dry skin from my feet.  They were soft and smooth in just a matter of seconds!  This is so much easier (and more effective) than trying scrub with a pumice stone or one of those &#x27;grater&#x27; looking things!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I wont be using the manual scrapers anymore. This is so easy to use and effective. Although i dont have a lot of callus, it definitely smooths out the rough spots on my heel.</li>
    <li> I love this device. It is very simple to use and is extremely effective on calluses.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that does what it claims. There are other products like this but they are much more expensive. For the cost of about one pedicure you can keep your feet callous free and smooth as silk. Simple to use. Lightweight and easy to hold. Changing the head is simple and quick. They snap on and off in an instant. I look forward to having soft smooth feet forever!</li>
    <li> I will be honest. I was skeptical. I didnt think there was any way this thing would work.  I tried the blue one  on a couple of thick callous skin spots on my foots, and almost instantly they were gone. You can see the skin flaking away, and you are left with much smoother skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This PurePedi callus remover is awesome! I have always had these thick calluses patches on the top of my feet right below my ankle. I tried all the other callus scrapper devices and never got close to smooth. But this product truly amazed me! My feet are beautiful and silky smooth because they are callus free! The device itself is so easy to use. First put in two AA batteries, hold the safety button down when pushing it to the on position and it works like a charm. Comes with two different rollers with different grades depending on your preference of smoothness. Rollers are easy to switch out. Comes with safety sheild for roller when not in use.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with how well and how quickly this product helped smooth my heels. It is a problem I deal with every summer and typically used a foot file to eliminate the dry skin. That took quite a bit of scrubbing on each heel. It is so nice to let the PurePedi do the work!</li>
    <li> This purepedi electronic callus remover is highly impressive. I had dry soles and callus that had built up over time and using this remover made my soles smooth. I cannot remember the last time I felt this way about my soles. This remover is easy to use, read and follow the directions indicated on the product manual and you will be  pro in no time. Although the description said batteries included, I did not receive any and I would be contacting them. Apart from that, it is an excellent investment and would definitely recommend it to smoothen your heels and soles. Its a &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; buy.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a foot spa product for a long time. The problem was everything I looked at or even considered was either not right for me or very expensive. This PurePedi Electronic Callus remover is just what I had in mind. You can not only smooth away calluses, but you can also smooth the sides, back and soles of your feet. It is a great all around product. The PurePedi is so much better than those harsh sharp metal scrapers. All it takes are two AA batteries and works great. It doesn&#x27;t take long at all and it actually feels pretty good on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great product and I am so glad I got the chance to get it.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have gotten this years ago. My feet are loving this!</li>
    <li> Absolutely a pedicure extender! A great user friendly, easy travel must have item in my cosmetic bag. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this little device! I do wear heels daily so I get a callus on the ball of my feet. I was previously unsuccessful with pumice stones and pedeggs and this was able to remove it in seconds! My only complaint is that the roller tends to fling the skin dust everywhere in a cloud, so try to get as close to a trashcan as you can and don&#x27;t lean in, otherwise you&#x27;re breathing in your own dead skin.&lt;br /&gt; That being said It&#x27;s a great easy way to remove calluses!</li>
    <li> When I first received this callus remover I took in out of the packaging, and noticed it required 2 AA batteries which is not a big deal you can buy a 4 pack for $1. After I purchased the batteries I installed them (super easy) and away I went using it. With the cold weather my skin has gotton rough on my feet. With just one use I could tell it worked! Though I was a little grossed out seeing my dead skin fall down like powder I was kinda amused at the same time being able to see it actually working. All in all I recomend this little device!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Pain-free and works like a charm!!  I&#x27;m glad I ordered the replacement rolls for it - I&#x27;ll use it every day!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I rate it a 5. My feet are soft now.</li>
    <li> So as spring approaches, I decided it was time to pull out my PurePedi and smooth out my winter feet.  To my happy surprise, my feet are smooth!  After I added lotion it felt and looked like I just had a pedicure. Just add polish and I&#x27;m ready for my flip flops)</li>
    <li> Back in June I purchased from Amazon your PurePedi. I finally opened the package today. After wearing sandals all summer and doing a lot of hiking, my heels were pretty rough and starting to hurt a lot. When I opened the package I saw that I could provide feedback to you for a free twin pack of replacement rollers. Well, I am happy to do that. My rating would be a 4 out of the 5. The reason is because it didn’t completely solve my problemed heels, but it did help a lot. It really smoothed out quite a bit of my heel, but there is a part that peeled back a little. I was not surprised at that, and I knew I would need some extra work on that part. However, for the most part, I am very pleased with my purchase and it worked very easily.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised, comes with coarse and finishing rollers</li>
    <li> My feet are so bad that I am embarrassed to go for a pedicure.  When I saw the PurePedi offered as the deal of the day, I thought why not try it?  After my first use, I have been given new hope for these tired feet.  Looking better already!  Thanks, PurePedi, for saving the day!</li>
    <li> Works great to get dry cracked heels in shape for summer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon and absolutely love it.  Its light, easy to handle and isn&#x27;t loud like others products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry, cracked and callused skin on the bottom&lt;br /&gt;of both feet and this product gently removes the dead skin making my feet feel soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It also works well taking care of calluses on hammertoes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Pure Pedi and rate the quality of this product a 5 on a scale of 1-5.</li>
    <li> Poor quality product.  It stalls everytime I touch it lightly to my skin.  Not worth the purchase if it continues to shut down.  There is not enough power to ever use on feet.</li>
    <li> Works great. Quick shipment. Powerful. Just  as described.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Such a simple way to remove callus&#x27;.  Added with some foot lotion my feet are soft and have never felt better.</li>
    <li> I have been interested in getting this for a while.  I finally decided to purchase it and I don&#x60;t know what possessed me to wait so long.  This item exceeded my expectations.  The callus remover not only removes the dead skin from your feet, it smooths the area so it feels baby soft.  Lightweight and portable, it fits easily in your hand.  Well designed so it contours to any area that it needs to get at.  Safe to use, no need to worry about the cutting and bleeing you might get from manual callus removers or skin nippers.  It also comes comes with a second roller head to use on tougher surfaces.</li>
    <li> The  PurePedi callus remover is agreat way of removing calluses,i used to use a razor blade but now use the PurePedi ,its takes off the dead skin ,works great after i soak my feet in a foot bath. I recomend this product,great callus remover</li>
    <li> I just received my PurePedi and I have to say I&#x27;m in love!! I have tried many other foot files, callus removers and foot scrubs that left a lot to be desired. So I was hoping but not expecting great results. I have to say that this little device is just amazing! It&#x27;s so simple to use, only requires 2 AA batteries and simple to use. I love that there are 2 different roller types a course and extra course. It was very easy and fun to use and the results are just amazing. I&#x27;m so excited for the upcoming spring and summer weather so I can show off my feet without embarrassment of dry, scaly, rough feet. Now my feet are as smooth as a babies bottom! Thatnk you for creating such a efficient device that actually works!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I originally had four stars on this as decided by my wife, but she just asked me to order additional heads and told me it is great, so I am upping it to five stars.   I bought this for my wife who up to now has used hand tools for her heels and corn. She says this is much easier. She particularly likes the interchangeable rollers and that it comes with a cleaning brush. Her only concerns were how long the rollers will last before needing replacement and how long the batteries will last. I can&#x27;t imagine battery life being much of an issue, but we will have to wait to see how durable the heads are. Overall, she is quite happy with it and glad we got it.</li>
