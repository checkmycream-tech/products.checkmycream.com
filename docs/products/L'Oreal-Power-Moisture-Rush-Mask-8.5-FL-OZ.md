      <li>It really works, smells wonderful and most importantly</li>
      <li>I love this mask.</li>
      <li>(detangle bottom to top)  Step 2:  </li>
      <li>I love this product for my dreads</li>
      <li>Smooth hair!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s is water based so the consistency is more liquified</li>
      <li>I was so excited!  </li>
      <li>Love this product, the smell, the easy application-</li>
      <li>It would be best to dry your hair before applying this hair mask.  </li>
      <li>Clean scent!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s good for product life because it&#x27;s easy to apply throughout hair and get full coverage w/o using the full container on each treatment.    </li>
      <li>I purchased mine at Wal-Mart for about half the price than Amazon; however, the mask is awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to chemical free hair.  </li>
      <li>ENJOY</li>
      <li>my hair is so soft and smell so good.</li>
      <li>Can you believe it, well this one was full with no seal</li>
      <li>, the softness of the extensions was as close to authentic and natural hair that is growing from the scalp!!!  </li>
      <li>I reserve this product for when a need a quick hair pick me up.</li>
      <li>I found that the Loreal Total Repair 5 provided more moisture and made for easy detangling.</li>
      <li>I am actually able to get a comb through my hair right after the shower and it makes my hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I SMILE.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff for making your hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Not only was the curl definition of the extensions BETTER than when I originally received the hair shipment</li>
      <li>It has allowed my curls to remain vibrant, while my fine hair strands are manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product, it leaves my hair silky and smooth and I have super dry hair.</li>
      <li>I think i found this at HEB, and they are supposedly out of stock right now..</li>
      <li>and I finally got back into putting more loving care into it.</li>
      <li>Now I alternate between this and my moroccanoil intense hydrating mask and honestly I might not repurchase the moroccanoil product</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, smooth, and just nicer looking &amp; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>first impression?</li>
      <li>I tried the product and the consistency was kind of liquidity and not much of a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am natural with 4A hair texture those who are familiar with kinky hair know that it craves moister.</li>
      <li>but when i got it the substance was half full not even full!</li>
      <li>It seems like it coated every strand and separated it so much that it made my hair stick out.</li>
      <li>Advanced Hair Care Total Repair 5 Restoring Duo Shampoo &amp; Conditioner products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>My hair is much nicer than it used to be when I was shampooing 2 or 3</li>
      <li>haha..</li>
      <li>My hair loves tthis stuff, fast penetration, and not to mention it smells like tropical breeze.</li>
      <li>The cream instantly infuses and moisturizes every strand of your hair, once applied, it appears as a thin turquoise cream that is easily applied onto your hair and scalp with a pleasant (not over-powering) fruity scent.  </li>
      <li>Everyone thought I&#x27;d had my extensions refreshed/replaced with new ones!    </li>
      <li>But this will be part of my new regimen!</li>
      <li>so you may get same, better or different results.  </li>
      <li>The price was decent and I bought the two of them to give them a go.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Many may choose to use this product as a stand-alone; I found using this product with the other L’Or&amp;eacute;al products I mentioned earlier is very helpful to my hair regime</li>
      <li>Many may choose to use this product as a stand-alone; I found using this product with the other L’Or&amp;eacute;al products I mentioned earlier is very helpful to my hair regime</li>
      <li>When i used the L&#x27;Oreal total repair 5 restoring shampoo and conditioner I got better results for my very dry hair.</li>
      <li>The softness and new and improved curl definition lasted for 7 days.  </li>
      <li>I was concerned about the Hyaluronic and was informed that (Hyaluronic acid is already present in your scalp, so by using a product which contains even more of it, such as a shampoo/conditioner or hair mask moisturizers will further absorb into your scalp), allows you to experience the benefits of having moisturizer applied to your scalp/hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The top of jar was not screwed on properly and the mask was not only in the jar but coated the outside of jar.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to maintain the original softness and sheen of the hair when as it is when first installed (wearing a sew in).  </li>
      <li>So depending on how dry and damaged your hair is, you may like one product better than the other.</li>
      <li>so far-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not noticing much of a difference in my hair after using this two different times.  </li>
      <li>I saw this @the walgreens and upon applying i hair was soft.</li>
      <li>They are very similar, and personally for me, I will use this product until it is finished as it is a high quality product, but will most likely purchase the total repair restoring in the future.</li>
      <li>you decide to apply on immediately after rinsing your hair, it would be advisable to dry your hair first.  </li>
      <li>However, my hair is super dry and needs extra moisture.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend- just know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different</li>
      <li>With so many deep condition  products outs on the market its hard to say i am stuck with this for life</li>
      <li>I was in search of a new deep conditioner and decided to try it out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this is the first non-salon hair product that I&#x27;ve found that really works well.</li>
      <li>I only hope the product performs as well on my natural hair after I uninstall the sew in.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your hair very soft and make it easier to blow dry it.</li>
      <li>LATER WOW SLIKY, BLOW DRY FLAT IRON</li>

<li> My lightened long hair loooooooves this stuff!</li>
<li> I have curly dry hair</li>
<li> I mean, I&#x27;ve gotten so pampered by all of those high end</li>
<li> If you have dry relaxed or texlaxed hair, don&#x27;t hesitate give it a try today!</li>
<li> Since I have been working on rebuilding, strengthening, and revitalizing my hair from further damage due to over-processing, dying, blow-drying, and all other processes I have noticed that L’Or&amp;eacute;al is coming out with products that my hair is responding to positively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Ok i am shocked @</li>
<li> No thanks...</li>
<li> I have extremely curly hair</li>
<li> I would have expected it to be smoother and less frizz.  </li>
<li> I probably got half of the contents in usable condition since the other half lined the inside of package.  </li>
<li> Although I had saved this product to order in a few days, a friend purchased this for me as a gift, to see if I would like this product, additional to the other L’Or&amp;eacute;al products I already include in my hair regime schedule.  </li>

    <li> I think i found this at HEB, and they are supposedly out of stock right now.. but when i got it the substance was half full not even full! and it was sealed. Can you believe it, well this one was full with no seal haha.. and it works perfect! (: Thank you anonymous owner.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product. It did not leave my hair soft, and it actually noticeably dried out my hair after using it frequently for a few weeks. It did the opposite of what a hair mask should do.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using the L’Or&amp;eacute;al brand as my hair regime which includes; L’Or&amp;eacute;al Total Repair 5 Damage Erasing Balm-Advanced Hair Care, and L’Or&amp;eacute;al Advanced Hair Care Total Repair 5 Restoring Duo Shampoo &amp; Conditioner products. Since I have been working on rebuilding, strengthening, and revitalizing my hair from further damage due to over-processing, dying, blow-drying, and all other processes I have noticed that L’Or&amp;eacute;al is coming out with products that my hair is responding to positively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a conversation with friends, they mentioned another product that would enhance my hair would be an intensive moisturizing conditioner named L’Or&amp;eacute;al Power Moisture Moisture Rush Mask with Hyaluronic. I was concerned about the Hyaluronic and was informed that (Hyaluronic acid is already present in your scalp, so by using a product which contains even more of it, such as a shampoo/conditioner or hair mask moisturizers will further absorb into your scalp), allows you to experience the benefits of having moisturizer applied to your scalp/hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combination has allowed me to maintain, rebuild, restore, strength, rejuvenate, and create balance for my hair.  The cream instantly infuses and moisturizes every strand of your hair, once applied, it appears as a thin turquoise cream that is easily applied onto your hair and scalp with a pleasant (not over-powering) fruity scent.  As I started using this product, it removed tough tangles while moisturizing my hair without my hair feeling weighted down from the product, non-greasy, and will not smear clothing or stain bed sheets/pillows. It has allowed my curls to remain vibrant, while my fine hair strands are manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to apply on immediately after rinsing your hair, it would be advisable to dry your hair first.  Since it is thin, it would blend in with the excessive water and run out of your hair. It would be best to dry your hair before applying this hair mask.  Many may choose to use this product as a stand-alone; I found using this product with the other L’Or&amp;eacute;al products I mentioned earlier is very helpful to my hair regime treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this product to others, including Amazon Customers if you are looking for an additional moisturizer mask cream for your hair strands and scalp treatment. Although I had saved this product to order in a few days, a friend purchased this for me as a gift, to see if I would like this product, additional to the other L’Or&amp;eacute;al products I already include in my hair regime schedule.  Delivery/packaging was exceptional, and I would state that the Seller and my friends were accurate in description of this product.

    <li> It is just wonderful! Leaves your hair very soft and make it easier to blow dry it.</li>
    <li> The product was a great buy and so I said why not. I tried the product and the consistency was kind of liquidity and not much of a moisturizer. Plus its not an actual treatment. The scent is wonderful though. I don&#x27;t hate , but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on my hair journey for months now and I&#x27;ve used several moisturizing conditioners and none worked but THIS, awesome!!! my hair is soft, hydrated and happy :) plus it smells wonderful and the scent lasts. The price is great btw. Now I alternate between this and my moroccanoil intense hydrating mask and honestly I might not repurchase the moroccanoil product but I have to always have this Loreal Power Moisture! It really works, smells wonderful and most importantly it moisturizes! If you have dry relaxed or texlaxed hair, don&#x27;t hesitate give it a try today!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. It has done wonders for my hair! Must buy!</li>
    <li> I used this product on my human hair extensions so I can only attest to that.  I wear the Onyc (see [...]) Mongolian Kinky Curly 3b/3c hair.  Because they are extensions it&#x27;s hard to maintain the original softness and sheen of the hair when as it is when first installed (wearing a sew in).  I used the Loreal Power Moisture NOURISHING hair mask with the Herbal Essence Hello Hydration conditioner for a co wash treatment.    Step 1:  I applied the conditioner, rinsed and detangled hair with shower comb &amp; fingers.  (detangle bottom to top)  Step 2:  I then applied the hair mask and put on a plastic cap for 15 minutes.    This product REALLY NOURISHED my extensions!!!!!  Not only was the curl definition of the extensions BETTER than when I originally received the hair shipment, the softness of the extensions was as close to authentic and natural hair that is growing from the scalp!!!  I was so excited!  Everyone thought I&#x27;d had my extensions refreshed/replaced with new ones!    To maintain I just tied my hair up (pineapple style) in a silk scarf each night and untied in the morning let the mist of the shower hit my hair, finger styled and off I went.  The softness and new and improved curl definition lasted for 7 days.  I only hope the product performs as well on my natural hair after I uninstall the sew in.  I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to chemical free hair.  I&#x27;m 7 months post last relaxer, but have not done the big chop and may not.  I&#x27;ll update once I have a chance to use on my own hair.    Love this product, the smell, the easy application- it&#x27;s is water based so the consistency is more liquified but that&#x27;s good for product life because it&#x27;s easy to apply throughout hair and get full coverage w/o using the full container on each treatment.    I&#x27;m stocking up on these- I have a supply of 6 so far- they are priced well I got mine on sale at Rite Aid with the loyalty card for $4.99.  Can also be found at Walmart, Target, CVS...    Highly recommend- just know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different so you may get same, better or different results.  But this will be part of my new regimen!</li>
    <li> SAW ON GMA, PURCHASED, USED OH MY. GREAT FOR MY HAIR I AM 52 I NEVER DIED MY HAIR, BUT TEXTURE CHANGES AND YOU WANT WHAT YOU WANT.LOL  I USE NEXXUS  SHAM/ COND THEN PUT IN LOREAL COMB 7 PUT A PLASTIC ON YOUR HAIR LONGER THAN RECCOMMENDED, HAIR FRIST, SHAVE,EXFOLIATE, ETC 20MINS LATER WOW SLIKY, BLOW DRY FLAT IRON IF YOU DO. I SMILE. ENJOY</li>
    <li> I love this product for my dreads my hair is so soft and smell so good. I use it in water to moisturize.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It smells incredible!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I reserve this product for when a need a quick hair pick me up. It does an awesome job that I can count on.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it leaves my hair silky and smooth and I have super dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and it moisturizers your hair nicely while leaving a clean pleasant scent. However, my hair is super dry and needs extra moisture. When i used the L&#x27;Oreal total repair 5 restoring shampoo and conditioner I got better results for my very dry hair. So depending on how dry and damaged your hair is, you may like one product better than the other. They are very similar, and personally for me, I will use this product until it is finished as it is a high quality product, but will most likely purchase the total repair restoring in the future. I would suggest trying both and see which one agrees with your hair best.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair a little past shoulder length and I saw this in walmart (which was only $6) and immediately was intrigued by it&#x27;s green color. I was in search of a new deep conditioner and decided to try it out. I left this in for about 2 hours mixed with a few natural oils (peppermint and coconut), when I rinsed it out it felt as though I hadn&#x27;t put any conditioner in at all, don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
    <li> This is so moisturing and not greasy !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this is the first non-salon hair product that I&#x27;ve found that really works well. I purchased mine at Wal-Mart for about half the price than Amazon; however, the mask is awesome. I am actually able to get a comb through my hair right after the shower and it makes my hair feel very soft and silky. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for making your hair soft and shiny. I am 63 and losing the luster; this puts it back.</li>
    <li> The packaging &amp; smell are great but this doesn&#x27;t work as I thought. Instead of making my hair less frizzy, it made it worse. It seems like it coated every strand and separated it so much that it made my hair stick out. No amount of hair products help after that happens. No thanks...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not noticing much of a difference in my hair after using this two different times.  I would have expected it to be smoother and less frizz.  Disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have curly dry hair and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will add moisture. I saw this in the store and decided to give it a try. That packaging is beautiful and I liked the smell. Sadly, this dried out my hair and made it extremely matted. I found that the Loreal Total Repair 5 provided more moisture and made for easy detangling.</li>
    <li> Ok i am shocked @ the negative reviews this product received. I am natural with 4A hair texture those who are familiar with kinky hair know that it craves moister. I was in dyer need of a deep treatment, my hair was matted,dry,and tangled, i was past due for a DT. I saw this @the walgreens and upon applying i hair was soft. I was amazed! My hair loves tthis stuff, fast penetration, and not to mention it smells like tropical breeze. I took it a step further and sat under my hair steamer for 30 mins then i detangled. It has great slip and just gets the job done. With so many deep condition  products outs on the market its hard to say i am stuck with this for life but i dont see why not continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Not sure why I ordered this online when I could have purchased at drug store.  Anyway, it was very messy when it arrived.  The top of jar was not screwed on properly and the mask was not only in the jar but coated the outside of jar.  I probably got half of the contents in usable condition since the other half lined the inside of package.  I did try the product and thought it worked well enough.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and I finally got back into putting more loving care into it. I am on a tight budget so no more pricey shampoos or conditioners, sadly... I mean, I&#x27;ve gotten so pampered by all of those high end brands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to head back and try something cheaper and picked this up at my local Walmart after someone told me about the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage Erasing Balm but I also saw this one on the shelf. The price was decent and I bought the two of them to give them a go. I tried the total repair and I felt like the ends of my hair were burnt but there was no split ends in sight. That&#x27;s a bit odd, isn&#x27;t it? I tried it a few times before I switched to the moisture rush mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression? Awesome shine! Smooth hair! Clean scent! And for the negatives? I wish I knew about this product sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye, 50 dollar conditioners and hello 5 dollar bliss!</li>
    <li> My lightened long hair loooooooves this stuff! It makes my hair soft, smooth, and just nicer looking &amp; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up shampooing (well, almost, I shampoo maybe once a month)  and I wash now just with conditioner (currently liking Loreal Power Moisture conditioner). My hair is much nicer than it used to be when I was shampooing 2 or 3+ times a week.</li>
