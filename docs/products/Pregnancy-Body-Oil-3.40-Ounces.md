      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
      <li>好用，值得购买  very good worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The smell the oil has is nice and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
      <li>Fast drying and a perfect pregnancy oil</li>
      <li>It helps alleviate itching, smells nice, and rubs in well.</li>
      <li>and I liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>It is nice as well that you can use the leftover after baby and for baby massages as well.</li>
      <li>BUT, I can say that it smells so nice</li>
      <li>I do like this oil, smells great, feels nice, absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I started to notice stretch marks appearing on my belly and thighs under the skin, but I kept using this product hoping it would prevent more from appearing.....</li>
      <li>I love this belly oil.</li>
      <li>I love weleda products.</li>
      <li>i swear by this oil and have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
      <li>is so lovely.</li>
      <li>They say it&#x27;s mostly genetic -</li>
      <li>This product has a interesting, non-feminine scent.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and it really felt good massaging it on my belly and tights.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely and it soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample while touring a hospital for delivery</li>
      <li>This oil has a nice smell and moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
      <li>I love how it is absorbed into the skin right away and does not stain clothes like some oils can.</li>
      <li>I think this product really works :)</li>
      <li>When I run out, I&#x27;ll just go to a store and buy it, full price or not.</li>
      <li>It had such a nice light scent and is free of chemicals.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve quickly gone through the sample and will be purchasing a full bottle.</li>
      <li>and when you are pregnant you need to apply generously to moisturize and prevent the stretch marks...</li>
      <li>I am still pregnant so its&#x27; ability to prevent stretch marks on me, is yet to be proven.</li>
      <li>I was pregnant because I was terrified of getting stretch marks.</li>
      <li>i started using it when i was 6 months pregnant and ended up using it until i delivered.</li>
      <li>product does not have a strong smell and does not absorb super fast</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price</li>
      <li>No stretch marks my whole pregancy!</li>
      <li>This oil helps my itchy pregnancy belly skin so much!</li>
      <li>I used this oil on my first and did NOT get stretch marks anywhere</li>
      <li>even though most of the people i talk to contribute me not having stretch marks to my gens, I think it&#x27;s the oil that actually helped.</li>
      <li>but I honestly think it&#x27;s helped big time in preventing stretch marks so far.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty much covered everywhere else ;( Point being: It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>love this product because it is natural high quality oils that nourish my skin and so far have prevented any stretchmarks</li>
      <li>I am  almost certain if i use it every day and really massage it in my thighs</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>However, it works very well.</li>
      <li>either way I tried to help my skin as much as I</li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>It will last you 3 weeks the most especially using 2x a day and on your belly and breasts.</li>
      <li>This time around I&#x27;m making damn sure I am putting it not only on my stretch mark free belly but also any other parts that may be getting larger.</li>
      <li>It left my skin so soft and 8 months after giving birth, I am completely stretch mark free.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
      <li>If I get stretch marks because I was waiting on this oil to arrive, and wasn&#x27;t able to use it for a few weeks, I blame Vitacost!</li>
      <li>It might be weird though because I don&#x27;t have a uterus or any of the appropriate plumbing for being pregnant,</li>
      <li>Love that its not super greasy and leaves my skin feeling light with a delicate scent.</li>
      <li>And I thought I was in the clear until I got to about 32 weeks.</li>
      <li>so far no stretch marks (now 36 weeks along).  </li>
      <li>also use it on my thighs etc to try and minimize the look of old stretchmarks from when I was a teenager</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
      <li>I use that right before I get dressed since it&#x27;s less oily than the other (although the belly oil soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all)</li>
      <li>but I have had stretch marks before (just from growing too fast) and I got tiny stretch marks last pregnancy on places</li>
      <li>I used it during my first pregnancy (alternating, daily, with Palmer&#x27;s) and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.</li>
      <li>A little Pricey, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>my old stretchmarks will not only be minimized but will almost disappear.</li>
      <li>NOT A SINGLE STRETCH MARK!</li>

<li> Used it during my pregnancy with twins, and although I had stretch marks from previous pregnancies, I didn&#x27;t get any new ones!&lt;br /&gt;Loved the smell</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but nice and subtle!</li>

<li> I just ordered my 3rd bottle and am due in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I used it religiously throughout my pregnancy (3 times a day, everyday)</li>
<li> I prefer natural, subtle and earthy fragrances.</li>
<li> (i have heard from other moms that stretch-marks cannot be prevented you either get them or not regardless of what you put on your skin - but</li>

<li> I started using this when I was a little over 20 weeks...</li>
<li> at 33 weeks I have 2 small stretch marks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil and a home made combination of EVOO and castor oil at least once per day.</li>
<li> However, shipping was so slow that it took 2 weeks to receive the oil (and I was without, during that time period).</li>
<li> I am in my 2nd trimester, and this oil literally lasted me a few weeks :(</li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t be bothered putting it on last night and lay in bed with my belly skin feeling so tight and horrible</li>
<li> but it could have been MUCH worse.</li>
<li> So don&#x27;t waste your time with this stuff :(</li>

    <li> I used this oil throughout my pregnancy on my breasts, belly, and thighs. It had such a nice light scent and is free of chemicals. It left my skin so soft and 8 months after giving birth, I am completely stretch mark free.  I still use it on my skin and in the dryest weather I&#x27;ve even used it on my face. When our baby&#x27;s skin felt like it needed a little extra moisture, I used it on his sensitive skin as well. I love this oil!</li>

I just ordered my 3rd bottle and am due in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because it is natural high quality oils that nourish my skin and so far have prevented any stretchmarks (i have heard from other moms that stretch-marks cannot be prevented you either get them or not regardless of what you put on your skin - but either way I tried to help my skin as much as I could)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have a strong smell and does not absorb super fast but I think this is why it moisturises so well - it lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my thighs etc to try and minimize the look of old stretchmarks from when I was a teenager and I must say it works! I am  almost certain if i use it every day and really massage it in my thighs my old stretchmarks will not only be minimized but will almost disappear.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil when my tummy started to show and so far no stretch marks (now 36 weeks along).  It smells great too!</li>
    <li> This oil has a nice smell and moisturizes my skin very well. It can get a bit messy to apply, so just be careful when applying.</li>

    <li> This is the only pregnancy oil/cream/lotion that works for me. Helps with the itching that comes along with stretching skin during pregnancy. I used it during my first pregnancy (alternating, daily, with Palmer&#x27;s) and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark. I ran out of this oil during my 2nd pregnancy and ordered some from Vitacost on Amazon, due to the lower cost. However, shipping was so slow that it took 2 weeks to receive the oil (and I was without, during that time period). If I get stretch marks because I was waiting on this oil to arrive, and wasn&#x27;t able to use it for a few weeks, I blame Vitacost! Haha. Kidding (sort of). When I run out, I&#x27;ll just go to a store and buy it, full price or not.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil a soon as I found out I was pregnant because I was terrified of getting stretch marks. I used it religiously throughout my pregnancy (3 times a day, everyday) And I thought I was in the clear until I got to about 32 weeks. I started to notice stretch marks appearing on my belly and thighs under the skin, but I kept using this product hoping it would prevent more from appearing.....it didn&#x27;t. I still got quite a bit of stretch marks but it could have been MUCH worse. I will probably continue to use this product in hopes that it will help my stretch marks heal /:</li>
    <li> I still got stretch marks, but I know it couldn&#x27;t expect a miracle. The smell the oil has is nice and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
    <li> i swear by this oil and have recommended it to many of my friends. i started using it when i was 6 months pregnant and ended up using it until i delivered. NOT A SINGLE STRETCH MARK! even though most of the people i talk to contribute me not having stretch marks to my gens, I think it&#x27;s the oil that actually helped.</li>
    <li> Nine months, and still no stretch mark. My friend says she didn&#x27;t get any using this oil either. I just put some on after shower, once a day. I think this product really works :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Couldn&#x27;t be bothered putting it on last night and lay in bed with my belly skin feeling so tight and horrible I had to get up and put it on after all.  This is my second pregnancy. I used this oil on my first and did NOT get stretch marks anywhere I put this oil.  They say it&#x27;s mostly genetic - whether or not you get stretch marks - but I have had stretch marks before (just from growing too fast) and I got tiny stretch marks last pregnancy on places I did not put the oil, i.e. hips and boobs.  But NO STRETCH MARKS on my belly where I put this oil. This time around I&#x27;m making damn sure I am putting it not only on my stretch mark free belly but also any other parts that may be getting larger. This stuff works!!  Love the feel (tried others that made me feel like my belly skin couldn&#x27;t breathe and had to wash off after 5 mins) and the smell! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I received package promptly from seller. Great fragrance! Some synthetic perfume smells make me cringe... I prefer natural, subtle and earthy fragrances. I love weleda products. A little Pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought two for my friends who got pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these after long research.&lt;br /&gt;And my friends really love it!!</li>
    <li> It might be weird though because I don&#x27;t have a uterus or any of the appropriate plumbing for being pregnant, whatevs.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Even when some people expect wonder, where there is no such a thing, this works as much as possible. I like the smell and the skin feeling after using the oil.</li>
    <li> I am still pregnant so its&#x27; ability to prevent stretch marks on me, is yet to be proven. BUT, I can say that it smells so nice and although it is an oil, it isn&#x27;t greasy at all! I love how it is absorbed into the skin right away and does not stain clothes like some oils can.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample while touring a hospital for delivery and my husband has been rubbing it on my belly every night. We&#x27;ve quickly gone through the sample and will be purchasing a full bottle. It helps alleviate itching, smells nice, and rubs in well. Plus, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> I love this belly oil. I&#x27;ve been using it my entire pregnancy and I&#x27;m now almost 37 weeks. I have yet to see a stretch mark and the smell of the oil is so lovely. I&#x27;ll update my review after I deliver but I honestly think it&#x27;s helped big time in preventing stretch marks so far. Also the sea buckthorn body lotion is great. I use that right before I get dressed since it&#x27;s less oily than the other (although the belly oil soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all)</li>
    <li> This product has a interesting, non-feminine scent. However, it works very well. No stretch marks for baby one and I am currently using it for the second pregnancy. It is nice as well that you can use the leftover after baby and for baby massages as well.</li>
    <li> This oil helps my itchy pregnancy belly skin so much! Love that its not super greasy and leaves my skin feeling light with a delicate scent.</li>
    <li> I love it! Fast drying and a perfect pregnancy oil</li>
    <li> I started using this when I was a little over 20 weeks... It works very well a now I&#x27;m at 39 weeks with no stretch marks.  I also alternated using this with the belly tummy honey.  It also helps with itching when your belly starts to stretch!</li>
    <li> Smells so good and feel great in my skin , is very easy to wear&lt;br /&gt;perfect for massajes , come on time</li>
    <li> I was convinced the oil would work for preventing stretch marks..... I am in my 2nd trimester, and this oil literally lasted me a few weeks :( DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It will last you 3 weeks the most especially using 2x a day and on your belly and breasts. I tried using sparingly but didn&#x27;t last at all and when you are pregnant you need to apply generously to moisturize and prevent the stretch marks... So don&#x27;t waste your time with this stuff :(</li>
    <li> It smells lovely and it soaks in fairly quickly. I&#x27;ve been using this oil and a home made combination of EVOO and castor oil at least once per day. My stomach doesn&#x27;t have any stretch marks but I&#x27;m pretty much covered everywhere else ;( Point being: It doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m going to keep searching for the &amp;#34;miracle oil&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> awesome product! No stretch marks my whole pregancy!</li>
    <li> 好用，值得购买  very good worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Was a gift to a pregnant friend who says it the best stuff she&#x27;s found to rub on her belly and excellent for massage. Smells so good!</li>
    <li> I do like this oil, smells great, feels nice, absorbs quickly. It helped with itching also. But it&#x27;s not miracle product and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;I used religiously and now, at 33 weeks I have 2 small stretch marks. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I used this oil through the entire pregnancy and I liked it a lot. I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks, but the best thing about it is the smell, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but nice and subtle!</li>
