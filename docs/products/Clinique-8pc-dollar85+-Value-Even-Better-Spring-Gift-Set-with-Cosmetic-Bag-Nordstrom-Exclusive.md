    <li> Wonderful stuff,  love it!</li>
    <li> I love getting Clinique samples so I can &amp;#34;try before I buy.&amp;#34; It makes dollar sense to do this because you are not wasting money on full sized (and full priced) products.   The samples in several Clinique offers are wonderful. I use a lot of Clinique products because they are good quality and really help with my skin care.   This 8-piece sampler has such a range of products for the Clinique newbie to try. It really offers a lot of variety so that you not only can clean and moisturize your face but also, then, use the makeup that is enclosed including eye shadow, mascara and lipstick. Then there is the makeup remover to take it all off, so you really can go from start to finish with this one samples bag offer!

    <li> I spent a couple of hours comparing all of the cosmetic gift sets on Amazon to determine which one was both packed with products, and at a lower cost. This Clinique 8-piece set has the most bang for the buck, and it matches my needs perfectly. I have never used Clinique products, and have been an Este Lauder girl since I was a teen many, many years ago (thanks to Grandma). I am pleasantly surprised with the performance I&#x27;ve found in this Clinique set, and have found a new line of \\&quot;go to\\&quot; products for my cosmetic and beauty needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed when I opened the package and revealed much larger product sizes and an oversized cosmetic bag than anticipated. All of the products are very large. They are close to full size except perhaps the eye circle corrector, and a slightly smaller mascara. All of the products are fresh, smell wonderful and they each have become part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing lotion is a facial lotion that is for very dry to dry combination skin. It is non-scented, absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy shine like some facial moisturizers. I have found this lotion particularly useful since the weather just drastically changed and I&#x27;ve begun to see some dry facial peeling. This lotion immediately has cured the dryness, and refreshed my skin giving it a youthful tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another one of my faves in this set is the rinse-off eye makeup solvent. I have never used such a simple makeup remover in my life. It even removes mascara in seconds. Speaking of mascara, this mascara is the best! My eyes are very sensitive, and I typically purchase hypoallergenic mascara to avoid crying for hours from the itch of regular mascaras. This Clinique mascara has no scent, and has not caused a problem for my allergy eyes. It glides on so smooth and thick, with absolutely no clumping, and no further need for a second coat. It leaves my lashes looking long and beautiful. It is lash luscious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark eye circle corrector is what I was looking forward to the most since I am of mostly Italian heritage, and have inherited dark circles. The tube of this corrector is very small at just .1 ounce, and if not used sparingly will only last for a few uses. I managed to finagle about 8-9 uses out of it. The cream itself is wonderful feeling, and is a tan colored cream that is absorbed by the skin. I wish I had more of this, and will probably purchase a full size tube because this was not enough to reveal any significant results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do not have spots on my hands, I decided to use the dark spot hand cream on my eyes since the circle corrector ran out so quickly. The dark spot cream is in a much larger tube, and less is required to cover more skin. This cream is amazing, and has literally lightened my circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow and lipstick are colors that will look great on any skin shade or tone. The lipstick&#x27;s color is \\&quot;Raspberry Glace\\&quot;, and the eyeshadow colors are a very light silver, very light purplish pink, and purple. I wear the lipstick and the very light silver eyeshadow daily. I cover the eyeshadow with a light flakey glitter powder eyeshadow to add more dimensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this set is the best deal of all the cosmetic gift sets available today, and am back to purchase another one.
