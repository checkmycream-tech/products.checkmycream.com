<li> It&#x27;s not as sharp and crisp as the Pro-Mate</li>
<li> They are not sharp at all as I had always heard</li>
<li> If you are seeking a professional edger blade that will give you or your customers a razor sharp edge-up</li>
<li> Not Worth it, Waste of Money, had to get them Sharpen and Adjusted and still didn&#x27;t cut right.</li>
<li> Not professional quality as advertised.</li>
<li> Right out the box they cut poorly.</li>
<li> A steady hand is needed when cutting near soft skin.</li>
<li> I have been using it, it seems sharp but in not totally sure the motion arm engages the blade completely.</li>
<li> As expected from aftermarket part</li>
<li> Cuts sharp, crispy line ups without irritating the skin (straight out of the package).</li>
<li> There were some bad reviews about the Pro-Mate on Amazon but most of those reviews came from people that probably don&#x27;t even understand how to cut hair and get frustrated easily.</li>
<li> The blade came already adjusted for a close and sharp line up.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking to get that razor sharp line (think Steve Harvey or Jamie Foxx), this is the trimmer to get.</li>
<li> it came verry sharp.  </li>
<li> it dose not bite The skin And its Cutz close to razor sharp</li>
<li> Can give a descent front edge up, but not useful on the face or neck.</li>
<li> The blade is very sharp</li>
<li> They are very sharp but did not cut as close as the Andis Outliner blades that came with my trimmer.</li>
<li> They also make less noise , this blade saves tons of time by not having to keep going over and over a line you made on a clients head.</li>
<li> the blades are very sharp and can mess your face up if you have your blades</li>
<li> It still has a little room to adjust the blade even closer but after trying it out there was no need to.</li>
<li> Money wasted.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure if they should have been sharpened.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Smooth and sharp stay cool</li>
    <li> It was not set right. It should be.</li>
    <li> Its good for balding but not for lining. The blade is easy to install and with the pre-groved edge it will take the guess out of gaping your blade. On the other hand you will not be able to adjust for extra sharpness</li>
    <li> I bought it with some reluctance. Fortunately, they work tremendously. If you&#x27;re looking to get that razor sharp line (think Steve Harvey or Jamie Foxx), this is the trimmer to get. I do not recommend these for shaving, however. the blades are very sharp and can mess your face up if you have your blades zero gapped. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The pro-mate blades are amazon and really gives you a crispy edge up finish. I recommend this product to all barbers, especially up-coming barbers.</li>
    <li> Very good blade. Cuts close.</li>
    <li> this blade is doing me wonders. All of my outlines are coming out perfect. I would choose another blade for anything. Keeps up the good work</li>
    <li> I used these on both a Andis Style liner and Style liner II. They stay relative cool which can be a concern they arrived on time and sharp ready to use with minimal adjustment required. I can keep a crisp line with these..</li>
    <li> If you are seeking a professional edger blade that will give you or your customers a razor sharp edge-up the this is a must have item. Its the only blade i use personally and i recommend this product to everyone professional or novice user....</li>
    <li> Blade is not as described!!! Money wasted.</li>
    <li> These blades are just okay. I purchased them to shave my facial hair. They are very sharp but did not cut as close as the Andis Outliner blades that came with my trimmer. A closer  look at the blades will reveal the difference in length of the teeth resulting in not as close a cut. In addition, these blades left my face feeling ruff and gave me razor bumps. They may work well for edging but not for shaving facial hair. I have went back to the factory Andis Outliner blades which are shaving me as good as ever. I will always use the Andis Outliner blades from now on.</li>
    <li> Most barbers on youtube think they have some kind skill when it comes to adjusting their liners (trimmers) From my own experience I believe that the Pro-Mate Blade is a lot easier to use than the Andis T-Outliner Blade. The Andis T-Outliner Blade lasts about 5 haircuts. It&#x27;s not as sharp and crisp as the Pro-Mate Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for the edited audio at the end. Youtube&#x27;s copyrights had to make me change the song at the end since it has some copyrighted content. The original song I put is by Rakim \\&quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Back\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did I hear about the Pro-Mate Blade?&lt;br /&gt;Well from watching videos from Cakenisrandy. He likes to use his andis t-outliners with the pro-mate blade. I also watched a Pro-Mate youtube commercial and decided that I wanted to test them out. It&#x27;s my 2nd Pro-Mate Blade that I bought on Amazon and it does a great job. There were some bad reviews about the Pro-Mate on Amazon but most of those reviews came from people that probably don&#x27;t even understand how to cut hair and get frustrated easily.</li>
    <li> Awesome blade came in a timely manner i love them</li>
    <li> I bought this particular blade about 2 months ago to fit a brand new pair of Andis styliner II. Right out the box they cut poorly. Very disappointed. They are not sharp at all as I had always heard&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; PRO-MATE &amp;#34; blades would cut. You have to go over lines on the hook corners of the temple of the head and constantly run the blades back and forth on the person corner edge up to get a OK line. I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud blade or if this is how the blades just are. 1 star.</li>
    <li> The regular Andis blade u gotta go to the Clipper Tech and get&#x27;em sharpen n set rite for them to hit but this Pro-Mate blade hitting rite out the pack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The blade came already adjusted for a close and sharp line up. It still has a little room to adjust the blade even closer but after trying it out there was no need to. Cuts sharp, crispy line ups without irritating the skin (straight out of the package). The blade was as described; brand new in manufacturers packaging. And delivered in about four days.</li>
    <li> These cut pretty well. Nothing spectacular. I used them straight out the package so I&#x27;m not sure if they should have been sharpened.Not  abig difference over traditional Andis clipper blade.</li>
    <li> way better with these blades. its like a new clipper, there ready out the box, theres no need to change setting</li>
    <li> After using The Andis t outline blade for 4 years now And The New deep tooth t shaped Blade i decited to try out The sqare promate Blade And i was verry impresd out The box it came zero gaped for close out lineing And detail trimming  work. Is excelnt it dose not bite The skin And its Cutz close to razor sharp i even oderd a second one thats how much i loved it And of course again right out The package it came verry sharp.  I use this Blade for shape ups on clients with smaller forheads And kids And detailing beard work im verry pleasd with this Blade And recomend u all to try it. Think out Side The box And try something diffrent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As for The promate t outliner Blade it was garbage it snaged hair And wouldent cut that great But The sqaurw Blade blow The promate t Blade out The Water forshure u wont regret it.</li>
    <li> The blade is very sharp</li>
    <li> Got it 3 days after I made the purchase and it works as described very happy with the purchase. It doesn&#x27;t get hot that fast as the one that comes with your machine.</li>
    <li> I just bought this promate blade recently , let me tell you they&#x27;re amazing . Honestly even better than the original blades on the Andis outlinner. It leaves a clean sharp cut that any barber is looking for . They also make less noise , this blade saves tons of time by not having to keep going over and over a line you made on a clients head. This blade is something you won&#x27;t regret buying</li>
    <li> it is a beautiful thing</li>
    <li> Original Andis blades are better.</li>
    <li> I received a t-blade in the square edge blade package.  I have been using it, it seems sharp but in not totally sure the motion arm engages the blade completely.</li>
    <li> As expected from aftermarket part</li>
    <li> Not Worth it, Waste of Money, had to get them Sharpen and Adjusted and still didn&#x27;t cut right.</li>
    <li> This blade is better than the original blade and works well for a line up. I use it for me and my kids however their skin is a little more tender than mine is and it cuts sometimes. A steady hand is needed when cutting near soft skin.</li>
    <li> Not professional quality as advertised. Can give a descent front edge up, but not useful on the face or neck.</li>
