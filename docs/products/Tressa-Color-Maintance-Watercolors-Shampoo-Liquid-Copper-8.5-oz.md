      <li>Glad I discovered this brand!  </li>

      <li>Thrilled with Everything about Order.</li>
      <li>I honestly could not believe how well they worked.</li>
      <li>Also purchased the Warm Spice.  </li>
      <li>and it looked nice</li>
      <li>Exceptional &amp; I love the Alerts on My Phone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This product is great for extending the time in between full colors.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping.</li>
      <li>By far the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in years!</li>
      <li>Easy to rinse out, does NOT stain tub at all!  </li>
      <li>Looks good and helps keep color so fresh!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I have used Tressa Watercolors shampoo for a couple of years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used any of the colors outside of the reds but all the reds are wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love the Tressa product line.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly with my coppery color and helps my color last.</li>
      <li>LOVE this.</li>
      <li>I tried Quantum Riveting Reds shampoo, but it did little-to-nothing for me.</li>
      <li>I waited three or more days to wash my hair, and I used this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the purple Tressa Color Maintenance Shampoo before, purchased from my salon,and was pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have darker auburn hair and wanted to use this to bring out more copper tones.</li>
      <li>I have gotten compliments using both products :)</li>
      <li>I love Tressa Watercolors Shampoos to extend the time between salon colors.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this would look in a deeper red hair, but it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for a copper-orange!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many and this is the one.  </li>
      <li>My hair looked shiny and healthy but it didn&#x27;t seem to have a change of color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ladies, you&#x27;re better off mixing shades of Manic Panic or Pravana Vivids with conditioner to deposit color instead of this stuff.</li>
      <li>is more of a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Most shampoos tell you to wash, rinse and repeat anyways</li>
      <li>If I try to lather it in my hands before putting it in my hair, most of it ends up in the tub.</li>
      <li>I mix liquid copper and fluid fire and it comes out as the perfect match for my hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is ok.</li>
      <li>I used to always use the Warm Spice for my strawberry blonde hair, which I LOVED!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Props for making my hair feel smooth and shiny, but I clearly haven&#x27;t mastered the art of color depositing shampoo yet and getting some pinkish streaks isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
      <li>love my enhanced color, it looks natural and my hair feels great.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get a good lather.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other color depositing shampoos and like this one the best.  </li>
      <li>that fades out very quickly.</li>
      <li>This has been the best product so far, I use it with the Davines copper conditioner and they work very well</li>
      <li>I  have used Watercolors for years &amp; strongly recommend them to anyone needing a color boost or looking to play with color without a drastic change.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This color depositing shampoo really does the trick. Red is so hard to maintain, but this helps. It sucks I cant use this anymore because of my highlights, but it really kept the color vibrant when I was able to use it. Dont be afraid of the bright red color of the shampoo it is not like a temporary color at all.</li>
    <li> I used to always use the Warm Spice for my strawberry blonde hair, which I LOVED! It is very very subtle, but if you shampoo twice in one shower it still gives a very natural, noticeable difference. I hadn&#x27;t used it for a long time (just got busy &amp; forgot to re-order) &amp; my hair got sun bleached a very light blonde from spending so much time in the sun. This time for a little more oomph I decided to buy the Liquid Copper along with Warm Spice &amp; mix the 2~ I used it 3 times in one shower for an immediate color pay off. Still subtle but definitely gave me my ginger back :) doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as long as I use a lot of conditioner after. I  have used Watercolors for years &amp; strongly recommend them to anyone needing a color boost or looking to play with color without a drastic change. ***Ps I did NOT have any of the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; issues that other users spoke of with Liquid Copper, even with my blonde hair. But I have had my hair turn BRIGHT PINK in the past with the Fluid Fire shade lol, so my advice to anyone new to these is to go slow at first, or do a test strand. But they do wash out relatively fast if you stop shampooing with them, so no need to be too worried about any &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> I use this product in combination with a red-color-depositing conditioner.  Between the two, my red looks just as vibrant as when I colored a few weeks ago.  I use twice for intense results.</li>
    <li> This really does help prolong the color of my hair, I dye it a color called red fire and I mix this with another color in this line called fluid fire. Allows me to go 8 weeks without having to touch up my color, at 8 weeks my color still looks bright it&#x27;s just my roots are showing. Otherwise I would think I could prolong dying it even longer. I use it about once a week, wet hair then I squeeze out as much water as possible, apply all over and let it sit for about 20 mins, then rinse and deep condition. Love this shampoo, a must have for red hair.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I recently tried going red after 5 years of being a blonde. Right after I would dye my hair, it would almost be a burgundy color (which was too dark for me) and then fade to a beautiful, natural red/auburn shade by the fifth day, which would sadly only last me less than a week. Within ten days of dying my hair, it would fade to a dull, strawberry blonde that stayed until I re-dyed it 6 weeks later. I tried Quantum Riveting Reds shampoo, but it did little-to-nothing for me. I was about to give up on being a redhead, until thankfully, I stumbled upon this! It gives my hair color like no other, and it LASTS! I wash my hair every day, go tanning, and it STILL keeps that beautiful, red/auburn shade week after week! I do mix it 4:1 with the Fluid Fire, also by Tressa Watercolors, just to give it an extra tint of red, and nothing has ever kept my hair color better. I should add that it has stained my tub and a couple of my towels, but it&#x27;s nothing that bleach and a good wash won&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> I keep my hair a mixture of all over bright red color, and have a copper woven throughout with foils, it takes about 4 hours to do because of the length, so I am always on the lookout for things to help keep the fade to a minimum. I have tried everything, from j.frieda products to the pantene, and even the quantum \\&quot;riveting reds\\&quot; collection, and this Tressa product is the only thing that really, really works. I usually lather up twice with it and let it soak in good while I finish my shower, seriously guys this is the only way to go if you want to keep your red from going down the drain!!</li>
    <li> Turned my hair a disgusting color red. NOT AT ALL what I was hoping for. PLUS there is ALCOHOL in it! If you know anything about colored hair it&#x27;s that you use products WITHOUT ALCOHOL!!!</li>
    <li> Works good.  Stains my bathtub.  But it comes off with a good scrub.</li>
    <li> Have natural strawberry blonde hair and dark copper in my bangs. Didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my color though.</li>
    <li> The BEST color-depositing shampoo on the market and the price is always fantastic.  I dye my hair various colors of copper red and red has a bad habit of fading, but not with this stuff!  I use it every 2nd or 3rd wash (depending on how long its been since I last colored my hair) and it keep it looking like I just dyed it.....seriously...sometimes even more vibrant.  Sometimes I mix the Liquid Copper and Fluid Fire together.  I wash and let the shampoo sit in my hair while I finish my shower...usually about 5-10 minutes and then rinse, followed by a good conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried Pureology, Redken and other high end (AKA expensive) color-depositing shampoos and never would see much of a deposit.  Tressa is hands down the best!</li>
    <li> Horrible! Pink, pink, looks cheap and terrible. I have a coppery strawberry blondish hair and wanted to keep the copper vibrant. My hair is pink,  and I hope it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I have naturally red hair that isn&#x27;t as vibrant as I wish it was. I have been an avid Aveda user and use the madder root shampoo and conditioner. There is no color deposit in the shampoo. The color in the conditioner is high pay off - first time you use it, you get results. However, the color is fake red - not a coppery natural red color. I didn&#x27;t want to dye my hair but wanted to enhance the color I already have. So i purchased Davine&#x27;s Alchemic in Copper  Shampoo and Conditioner and Tressa Watercolors Shampoo in Liquid Copper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I hate the feeling of the Davine&#x27;s shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t suds up  the way I expect shampoo to suds and my hair gets tangled as I wash. But the Davine&#x27;s conditioner makes up for everything! Seriously the best conditioner I have ever used. Tressa Watercolors Shampoo is wonderful and feels great in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for color pay off - it is not a one use color option. The first few times i washed my hair i only used Davine&#x27;s. My hair looked shiny and healthy but it didn&#x27;t seem to have a change of color. It was about 4 washes in when I saw a slight difference. Then I decided to wash first with the Davine&#x27;s shampoo, then the Tressa Watercolors, then the Davine&#x27;s conditioner - this is a win! Most shampoos tell you to wash, rinse and repeat anyways so I just wash twice. I lather the shampoos for at least 2 minutes and leave the conditioner in for at least 5. I have tried skipping the Davine&#x27;s shampoo but the color payoff isn&#x27;t as good - I&#x27;m telling you, the three together are where it&#x27;s at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my enhanced color, it looks natural and my hair feels great. And on days I don&#x27;t have time to spend a ton of time washing and conditioning, I use my Aveda madder root shampoo to  gently care for my new color.</li>
    <li> Very gel like, low suds, and tough to get out of the bottle. Makes it a hassle.</li>
    <li> this product gives my hair some color &amp; vibrance after each washing I use it as my second wash!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I never saw any difference.</li>
    <li> This is not copper in any way, but makes your hair pink. It also will stain your bathtub or shower immediately. Would not purchase this again. Very expensive and I wanted copper effects, not pink.</li>
    <li> Thrilled with Everything about Order. Product Easy to Find on Amazon, Pricing Reasonable, Delivery Time Exceptional &amp; I love the Alerts on My Phone.&lt;br /&gt;This is Reason I&#x27;m getting Closer to  doing ALL Shopping Online</li>
    <li> I have dark hair and have noticed that the ends of my hair absorb the color nicely. This product is great for extending the time in between full colors.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> works great between colors!</li>
    <li> I have been blonde my whole life, just dyed my hair a copper red and after my first wash I realized how hard it would be to maintain this color. I started using Tressa Watercolors Shampoo in Liquid Copper pretty much immediately in combination with Davines Alchemic Copper Conditioner. I definitely notice a difference in the vibrancy of my color after I used this. This color, unlike Fluid Fire, does not seem to stain my hands, nails or bathtub. I did think my hair was getting a little too orange, so I started using Fluid Fire once in a while as well.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels clean, shiny, and pretty well moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is now my second time using this product in this color and while it definitely works in the color depositing department, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m crazy about the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural redhead (as in, I&#x27;ve never colored my hair, ever) and I&#x27;m now just a little closer to strawberry blonde than I would like, so I bought this color and the Warm Spice. Warm Spice seemed to just add shine and warmth (don&#x27;t get me wrong, that&#x27;s great!) so I decided to see if this would add a little more red and some vibrancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely adds red to the point that I see why people are saying it&#x27;s pink. It&#x27;s not a very natural orange-red, definitely more artificial looking. And what&#x27;s driving me nuts is how uneven the color is - somehow it only added color to random streaks on top of my head even though I coated my hair evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Props for making my hair feel smooth and shiny, but I clearly haven&#x27;t mastered the art of color depositing shampoo yet and getting some pinkish streaks isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
    <li> really works to keep colored hair fresh looking</li>
    <li> I went to the salon and had my hair professionally done. I waited three or more days to wash my hair, and I used this product. Awful! Not only did it strip the color out of my hair, but it left purple streaks in it. I shook it up very well before using it, and it didn&#x27;t help. Save your money and invest in the Riveting Red line. Those products actually WORK. However, this vendor provided fast shipping, so any other products for them will be received quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month. I have dyed copper hair (Goldwell 9RG, I believe) that fades out very quickly. With this, although it didn&#x27;t preserve the original color, it didn&#x27;t fade as much. I agree that it did actually add a little bit of a pinkish tinge to the orange, which I&#x27;m okay with. I don&#x27;t know how this would look in a deeper red hair, but it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for a copper-orange!  It&#x27;s not too hard on my hair, and I follow it up with L&#x27;Oreal deep conditioner (in the yellow jar). My hair is notorious for tangling, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse since I started using the color-depositing shampoo, which I consider a win.  I use this shampoo every day/every other day, and don&#x27;t alternate it out with other shampoo. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s very runny. If I try to lather it in my hands before putting it in my hair, most of it ends up in the tub. I&#x27;ve started squeezing it into my palm and then slapping it onto the top of my head right away to prevent this. I&#x27;ll keep using this brand, though I might try a different color at some point.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is ok. It lathers well, smells fine, and is subtle at changing color. However, I would say it&#x27;s more bright red, than copper.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product to help boost my haircolor between visits to the salon, and I totally think I have a winner with Tressa Watercolors in Copper. The shampoo itself definitely is a bit of a different texture than your run of the mill shampoo. I haven&#x27;t had too much of the drying issue that other reviewers have mentioned, and the dying isn&#x27;t too bad if you&#x27;ve used other products (Davines comes to  mind). I was AMAZED at how fast this arrived from the shipper as well- I think I recieved this within two days. Definitely will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I am about the worst candidate for dying my hair red. I am very active and outdoorsy which means my hair quickly fades from the sunlight and showering. I dye my hair a bright auburn color and have tried this product as well as the Tressa Molten Bronze shampoo for color maintenance. Both products are good for different reasons. If you are looking for a more subtle, natural color, Molten Bronze is better.  The color it deposits gives your hair a hint of ginger. This product is less natural looking but much brighter and more noticeable. It leaves a red/orange color (see pics). I would recommend either product, it just depends on what you are looking for- subtle/natural or bright. I have gotten compliments using both products :)</li>
    <li> I use this color mixed with Molten Bronze and it helps maintain the brightness of my red hair.  I have light auburn hair with copper highlights and this especially works with the copper streaks.  I use every other time I wash my hair.  If I use every time, I get more of a crayon effect than I like, but every other wash maintains the color well and lets me color less.  I put it in my hair and let it sit for a few moments, wash out, than use a heavy conditioner for colored hair and it works nicely.  If you use a lower quality conditioner this shampoo can be a bit drying.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a standalone color or on colors other than red tones.</li>
    <li> You would think that more &amp;#34;color depositing&amp;#34; shampoos, which are typically for color-treated hair, would be sulfate free. This is the only one I was able to find. It deposits an insane amount of color and does not strip your hair. Cleanses well and does not leave any kind of sticky residue behind, unlike some other sulfate free shampoos on the market. I love this item and have ordered a 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and it is incredible.  Red hair color is hard to keep rich and vibrant, but this shampoo make it very easy to keep the color good from one visit to my hairdresser to the next.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I think this is going to seriously decrease the frequency of me retouching my color, which means in the long run my hair will be much healthier. It has a great copper hue if that&#x27;s the reddish tome you are going for. When you put it on it feels very smooth unlike many other shampoos, which is probably due to it being sulfate free. My only warning is be careful not to get any in your eyes, it does burn a bit.</li>
    <li> Did a very nice job of refreshing my color.</li>
    <li> This is not copper, it&#x27;s magenta. I dabbed a little on my skin and decided I would not be putting it on my head and run the risk of having pink hair. I love the same shampoo in Warm Spice, though. It&#x27;s a perfect light copper shade!</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it promised! My hair is vibrant with this shampoo. This is really helping me extend the life of my copper red that normally dulls out after the first wash. I will be using this product again!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend any of the watercolor shampoos to anyone with color treated hair. I am a cosmetologist and know that some colors fade faster than others, that is especially the case with red hair. I use this shampoo to help in between colors to help my hair stay vibrant</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. They no longer make the other color depositing shampoos I once used. I use to use the Aveda custom made blends from the salon. I am happy with this as an alternative. I have been purchasing it now for two years and hate to run out. It keeps my red fresh and more vibrant. If you color red, I do think this is a must have for extended upkeep.</li>
    <li> This is something I would recommend you dilute slightly with your own preferred shampoo, because otherwise, you&#x27;re going to get, sort of Bozo the Clown red. So unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, the diluted color works very nicely for a more natural red enhancement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really indifferent about this product. It deposits color, but it&#x27;s not as orange as I expected something that included the word &amp;#34;copper&amp;#34; to be. I added it to some pink hair dye to even out my base color before I dyed it copper and it turned the color a neon red-pink. I put the copper on top and it turned into a rich red copper. I kept using it for a month and it turned my copper color red. A month later I decided to henna my red and I used the shampoo over that and it turned from a gorgeous orange to a weird pinkish orange. I usually leave the color in for about 3 minutes. It does kinda dry my hair out which I noticed when I switched from garnier fructis damage control to the Radiant Red shampoo where I use a lot less conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the Tressa product line. They help keep the red in my hair much longer than the &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; shampoo. A must have especially for redheads</li>
    <li> This shampoo is worth the money spent on it, it extends the salon colour between visits to the colourist. I recommend a good conditioner, however. Just follow as per the package directions for pleasing results.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Everyone knows how red fades. This is my saving grace. The more you use it, the more that deposits in your hair and it is vibrant and keeps your fresh look! The shampoo does have a fairly strange smell but not unpleasant. My hair is brown so remember it enhances your color but won&#x27;t conceal your roots.  I have been using Watercolors for over 5 years and have always been ecstatic with the boost it gives between dyes. I&#x27;ve never used any of the colors outside of the reds but all the reds are wonderful.</li>
    <li> This truly does work. I perm my hair every once and a while which brings out the red in my hair a bit more. This really enhances it. Make sure to shampoo the product thoroughly through your hair or else you won&#x27;t get consistent color throughout.</li>
    <li> I have  natural red hair and  my hair has started to fade over the years . I love this shampoo! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I love Tressa Watercolors Shampoos to extend the time between salon colors.  I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;gone gray&amp;#34; redhead, and the color fades so quickly.  This not only extends the color, but also adds manageability.  I usually use &amp;#34;Molton Bronze&amp;#34;, but am more pleased with mixing it with &amp;#34;Liquid Copper&amp;#34;.  I was very happy to find this on Amazon Prime as my hairdresser no longer sells it.</li>
    <li> I mix the two colors to get the exact color I want.  Each one by itself is fine but this works best for me and has for years.  I&#x27;ll be using it forever I think.  It lasts quite a long time and doesn&#x27;t require much each shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the purple Tressa Color Maintenance Shampoo before, purchased from my salon,and was pleased with it. I ordered this color sight unseen and probably should have ordered the Fluid Fire instead (my hair is a rather un-natural shade of Cherry Red). This one has a very bright orange tinge to it and I almost feel as though it makes my hair lighter, although I know that&#x27;s likely not the case. That being said, I can&#x27;t deduct any stars for my misstep because it really does extend the length I can go between salon appointments and it definitely keeps my color looking fresh for far longer than normal.</li>
    <li> I used this product the first day I received it, I was optimistic but ready to be let down. I’m glad to report it worked remarkably well!!! I did the double wash as suggested on the bottle for and extra oomph (cuz I wasn’t expecting much : / ) and I got amazing color, though I will just do the one wash next time.  Honestly does deposit color back into dulling hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Yes, the shampoo is pink.  It is not pink in my hair. I like to keep my red a fiery, bright, in your face red.  This shampoo is amazing. It deposits quite a lot of color, in my experience.  I started off with a red that was fading slightly, but this shampoo has really revitalized it.  I don&#x27;t find it to be drying, but I use a good conditioner after.  In my hair, it leaves an extremely bright, coppery red/orange tint that I just love. If I wanted natural looking hair, I would not use the color I use. I start off with London Luxe Runway Red and use this shampoo to keep that same &amp;#34;Jessica Rabbit Red&amp;#34; color. I have gotten more compliments on my hair color using this than I did with the Tressa Fluid Fire. I am sold.</li>
    <li> Not only preserves color, but enhances it. The only red shampoo I found that worked.</li>
    <li> Great to keep your color between colors!</li>
    <li> The color looks fantastic and it stays in even when using my regular shampoo. I&#x27;m amazed by how great it looks! No problems with staining in the tub or on hands. By far the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in years!</li>
    <li> Works and has kept my hair red. Beautiful color. I&#x27;m naturally a blonde so its tried to fade but this has done a great job of keeping it red. I do have to use it every day though.</li>
    <li> Glad I discovered this brand!  A little bit applied to soaking wet hair produces a LOT of lather.  I keep it in my hair while I shower and try to keep it on for at least 7 minutes.  Easy to rinse out, does NOT stain tub at all!  Does NOT stain clothing either.  And I use a conditioner after I rinse this out.    It leaves a nice, rich, slight intensity to my auburn/copper colored hair.  Absolutely LOVE this!  I use it twice a week (sometimes 3 times a week).  It provides some shine, color and added dimension to my hair.  Looks good and helps keep color so fresh!  It&#x27;s not a permanent color but it absolutely helps colored hair without changing it drastically.  BEAUTIFUL addition to my hair care!  This bottle will last about 6 months.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks and have about 85% left in bottle.  So really... probably last more than 6 months.    Also purchased the Warm Spice.  LOVE BOTH!  Sometimes I mix them and then apply.  Again, takes VERY little to produce results and provide much lather.  The results are not drastic.  So don&#x27;t be afraid to use this brand. It won&#x27;t completely mess with your current color. Just helps revive the colors.  LOVE this line!!    EDIT UPDATE 9/22/14:  I&#x27;ve seen some reviews about this turning hair pink or purple.  Not sure what that&#x27;s about...  I&#x27;ve never had that happen.  And I don&#x27;t \\&quot;dilute\\&quot; this shampoo at all.  It&#x27;s THE best color-enhancer I&#x27;ve found!  And no, it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my hair, it simply adds dimension and a richness to my red/copper that I color myself, usually using the Revlon 3D.  Works beautifully!</li>
    <li> I love this! I bought it a few weeks ago to hopefully keep my copper color hair from fading. I have been battling fading red hair for about 6 months now, since it is not naturally red. I had platinum blonde hair for years, and decided to try copper red, which was extremely hard to keep from fading within the first wash. Using this product, my hair actually looks more red and more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; than right after the salon visit! I let it sit in my hair for about 5 minutes in the shower and then wash it out. Works wonderful! No more fading!</li>
    <li> It deposits color alright. Being a natural redhead I thought it would give my color a boost... I got a pinky orange color in my lighter natural highlights... I&#x27;m thinking maybe this is meant for people with actual dyed red hair, judging on the color of the shampoo which is a bright red rather than a copper color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead but the older I get the blonder my hair gets. I&#x27;ve started using L&#x27;Oreal 9GR Light Reddish Blonde but wanted something to extend those applications and keep my color vibrant. I purchased Liquid Copper, did a test strand and it looked nice so I went ahead and applied to my hair, lathered well and left on for 10 mins. It&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL!!! It turned it a light copper which is a little darker than my strawberry blonde but it looks very natural and left my hair soft and healthy. My color now looks like it did in my late teens, early 20&#x27;s and I LOVE it! Going forward I&#x27;ll leave it on for just a few minutes at the time and adjust my times and how often I use it as needed. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Works well to keep my hair bright; however I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has red dye in it. Prefer a more natural made product.</li>
    <li> I determined that I was allergic to this product. I&#x27;d take the warning seriously to test it out on a small spot.</li>
    <li> I have natural red hair, but it is getting lighter, especially in the summer. I thought I would try this to see if it could make my hair darker. It did not work at all, not even a little bit. The only thing it did was dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> My red-ish copper hair color doesn&#x27;t last too long (for some reason instead of getting lighter it fades to some weird shade of brown) and I have to look for a million things to keep the color alive. This has been the best product so far, I use it with the Davines copper conditioner and they work very well together.&lt;br /&gt;I used it with gloves at the beginning thinking it would stain my hands but it doesn&#x27;t. Great product :)</li>
    <li> Item as Described! Fast Shipping! thanks!</li>
    <li> Best color depositing shampoo for the $$</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a lovely copper color, but I think a little too light for what I wanted - I&#x27;ve already purchased Fluid Fire to help deepen it a bit. It is mildly drying - expect knots in the shower, but if you use a bunch of conditioner right after it doesn&#x27;t affect it too much. It lathers like crazy despite the lack of sulfates. I don&#x27;t have any oil issues, but I don&#x27;t use any products with silicones, and if you do and use a sulfate free shampoo your hair is probably going to end up oily. It deposits a good amount of color, though I recommend leaving it in longer than it says on the bottle if your hair is a bit darker. I didn&#x27;t experience any staining of the shower or my hands. Overall a very nice product, just a little too light for me, and I&#x27;ll be remedying that soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I had copper hair, under the recommendation of numerous friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise surprise, it&#x27;s expensive and it sucks, at least in Liquid Copper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this, I expected an orange/red pigmented shampoo as is described. What I got was something vaguely reddish-pink. I tried it several times, and each time my hair got progressively more and more pink. My previously beautiful, and natural looking red, turned an awful shade of salmon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, you&#x27;re better off mixing shades of Manic Panic or Pravana Vivids with conditioner to deposit color instead of this stuff. At least you&#x27;ll deposit the correct undertone that way.</li>
    <li> I thought Copper would imply more of an orange, but the shampoo is bright red. I had partially grown out blond highlights, and after one use, they were fluorescent pink. I&#x27;m talking REALLY bright pink. Not at all what I intended, but its sort of fun, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive, it smells like those scented markers from the 80s. It rinses really clear and doesn&#x27;t bleed. I am going to get the Cocoa one and see if it tones down the hot pink.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. wish it were easier to purchase and a bit cheaper though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my 8RC color from being completely gone every two weeks.  It does help some, but I can&#x27;t use it full strength without looking kind of pink, rather than copper.  I mix it half and half in the shower and it helps, but I still have to refresh my color more frequently than I&#x27;d like.  Still, I&#x27;m not totally blond in two weeks, so...victory?</li>
    <li> I have naturally red hair that has faded over the years so I was looking for something to brighten it up. A stylist friend recommended this and stated it was so strong I should split it with regular shampoo. I decided to just go for it and wash without mixing and noticed NO change. The next time I washed twice as the bottle suggests if you want a more noticeable difference... again no change at all. It lathers well and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get a good lather. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on regular shampoo so this definitely isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many and this is the one.  Don&#x27;t look any further.  Blending with other reds from this line works too.  My color never fades now!</li>
    <li> Work great helps color last longe</li>
    <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
    <li> One of the best ways to keep dyed red hair staying red.  I mix Liquid Copper with Fluid Fire.  It&#x27;s perfect for me. :)</li>
    <li> I love this!! It allows me to go 8 weeks between coloring! I will never use another shampoo again!!</li>
    <li> This is a great Product. It really keeps my red color and highlights bright. I am so glad my hairstylist recommended it! I am on a budget and can&#x27;t afford very frequent professional color.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair a bright strawberry blonde. Any type of red color is hard to maintain due to fading. These shampoos are a life saver! They leave behind enough color to make my hair look bright and fresh even weeks after I dyed it. I honestly could not believe how well they worked. I had tried many other color saving hair products in the past and none of them seemed to do much. But the watercolor shampoos are great! I mix liquid copper and fluid fire and it comes out as the perfect match for my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am naturally a brunette and told my stylist I wanted to go &amp;#34;stereotypical Irish redhead, red&amp;#34;. I love being red, but it fades really bad and by the time I get it re-done, it&#x27;s faded to strawberry blonde. I&#x27;ve been looking on and off for a year for a color-depositing shampoo to extend the life of my color, and Tressa is it. Reasonably priced, and the Liquid Copper turned out to be just the color for me. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It can&#x27;t stop my dark roots from showing, but it can keep me &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; until I return to the salon. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have a difficult time finding this color locally so I was so excited to find it for such a reasonable price. It works perfectly with my coppery color and helps my color last.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AS IT KEEP MY RED HAIR COLOR LOOKING  FRESH AND INTENSE ALL THE TIME. NO MORE FADE!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other color depositing shampoos and like this one the best.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair as others have and the color is very natural looking.  I have naturally red hair that I was dying blond for a while and am now trying to grow my natural color back out.  This is helping keeping the natural part and dyed part looking more blended.  Will probably keep purchasing this even after all the dyed part is grown out as it brightens up my natural color too.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference like I thought I would. I also purchased Fluid Fire and it works very well except for the color is more of a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; red. I was really hoping for more with this color.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommend this to keep my hair looking good between touch-ups. Works great I love my red hair!</li>
    <li> I have highlighted blonde hair and my stylist suggested this shampoo to add a reddish tint once in a while that washes out after a few shampoos with regular product. I have used it twice so far and I think it would show better results if I left it on longer. No regrets but no really excellent results either.</li>
    <li> I have darker auburn hair and wanted to use this to bring out more copper tones. It&#x27;s okay. Not as vibrant as I&#x27;d like it to be. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair too much like other shampoos either, which is nice.</li>
    <li> This keeps your red color red!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and absolutely love it! Instantly brightens my hair and allows me to got at least 2 months between dyes, which is unheard of for red hair dye. The liquid copper is my favorite for a more realistic red.</li>
    <li> I sincerely hope mine is a defect, but I&#x27;m disappointed by the packaging.  My bottle leaks pretty significantly, even when I make sure the lid is closed tight.  Now, half the product I paid for is washed down the drain (literally, it leaked out) and my tub is stained because I didn&#x27;t catch the leak until the next morning.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be willing to purchase again because of it.</li>
    <li> Like most chemical dyes this caused burns to my scalp! :( owch going back to henna glazing However, everyone if you have never had an allergy to chem dyes this is a really really nice product :D</li>
    <li> I have used Tressa Watercolors shampoo for a couple of years and love it.  However, I ordered 2 from this seller and both bottles the shampoo was thin and watery.  Clearly the product had been watered down.  I should&#x27;ve returned but did not, but I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
