      <li>Works really good.  </li>
      <li>I just rinse this thing off and it&#x27;s good to go again.</li>
      <li>Revlon continues to make some of the best grooming products available.</li>
      <li>It is still a good product nonetheless.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to drive all over another city looking for a good nail file.</li>
      <li>Revelon always had a good nail filer.</li>
      <li>Was very pleased to find them</li>
      <li>This file is dirt cheap and works great.  </li>
      <li>I  have always liked Revlon files.</li>
      <li>Handle is nice as well.</li>
      <li>I would rate this product as the best tool to do manicure work, It is very well made and east to use to maintain fingernails and toe nails.</li>
      <li>Handy .</li>
      <li>This file works fine for my purposes, I was looking for a folding file, but couldn&#x27;t find one, so this is a good substitute.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this kind of nail file for many years.</li>
      <li>If you want something that will also smooth your nails, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this nail file, although it is good at shaping.</li>
      <li>This one so far is the best I have ever had.</li>
      <li>I liked it better.  </li>
      <li>This is great and just the right size to keep in my purse.</li>

      <li>I would be getting more of these when I have no use for this one anymore</li>
      <li>The Reason for 3 STARS is because , Revlon has been making this file for years now , but Neither is The Packaging nor the product , appealing.</li>
      <li>Have used this for years and love it.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it - for sure.</li>
      <li>so so much better</li>
      <li>I love to use this on my nails.</li>
      <li>My original has been in use for over 3 years!</li>
      <li>description and picture show  fine and shaping sides to file.</li>
      <li>and my wife said that works fine.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an excellent little file for the price.</li>
      <li>I thought it was priced correctly and it is very sturdy and handy while filing nails.</li>
      <li>I was so glad I saw this on Amazon and bought it right away.</li>
      <li>Original item no longer available.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the original Revlon file with the 2 grades.</li>
      <li>The abrasive surface removes material quickly, doesn&#x27;t clog and appears durable but still leaves a smooth finish.</li>
      <li>My nails are pristine and clean.</li>
      <li>does its intended job, nothing special.  </li>
      <li>The item is of high quality in my standards for the cheap price because it does what a file does plus the tip cleans safely without puncturing skin.</li>
      <li>Look for another file this one is only good for one week</li>
      <li>This is the third nail file that I have owned and this is definitely the best.</li>
      <li>Brand new and not as good as the old one I threw away.</li>
      <li>Great little tool.</li>
      <li>A very high quality product, rare these days because so many products made in China are really crappy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much too smooth.  </li>
      <li>its kind of short.  </li>
      <li>Item came on time and as seller described and is worth the price paid.</li>
      <li>This one is definitely made more cheaply.</li>
      <li>these would be good for filing rough edges off of aluminum!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sick of companies that have a good product changing things to make a couple more pennies a sale in profit, and ruining what made them good buys in the first place.</li>
      <li>This item is just the right size for use and travel.</li>
      <li>I live in rural America, and can&#x27;t find a good metal file anywhere.</li>
      <li>, I go through these quickly, and loose them a lot, which is why I am so so glad that I find these on here on the subscribe and save option, which saves me a lot of money, and I know that I will always have them.</li>
      <li>exactly as described.</li>
      <li>but I have not been able to find it anywhere of recent.)  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed in terms of emery filers.</li>
      <li>this is well worth the reasonable price...</li>
      <li>I love the long version of this file and like to keep them in spots all over my house and in purses for when a ragged nail appears.</li>
      <li>They seem to be too flat, this one is nice and rough like a fine sandpaper</li>
      <li>bought these because I have had revlon metal files in the past that were lovely and fine.  </li>
      <li>The compact one with the rounded end might be a valid alternative to the ones I keep in my purse, but I really, really want the long ones to become widely available again!</li>
      <li>What I especially like is its compact size; easy to carry and works well.</li>
      <li>this is the same normal file that we all have, and most of us it is a must have, and I always have to have and use one of these</li>
      <li>very portable.</li>
      <li>Emeryl file is very durable.</li>
      <li>well made... holding up really well...</li>
      <li>Much shorter and nothing to show me which is shaping side or finishing side</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>This brand is very dependable.</li>
      <li>wicked fast</li>
      <li>highly recommended!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really let my nails grow</li>
      <li>One side is almost smooth the touch while the other side is just slightly more gritty.</li>
      <li>I broke my handle off my last original Revlon file, so I went and picked up one of these.</li>
      <li>They file smoothly and precisely and last a long time.</li>
      <li>My 10 year old one had more filing power left on it than this one has as a new one.</li>
      <li>This one is ok, but not worth the price IMO.</li>
      <li>After the first use I noticed it was nearly worn out.  </li>
      <li>This nail file is highly responsive to pressure, and has the capability to file a lot of nail quickly, or smooth out a minor nick or snag, without damaging the finish of a buff or polish.  </li>
      <li>Very good nail file, many of the ones I have got in the past are not coarse enough to file down my nails.</li>
      <li>I had an older model file that was advertised as a &amp;#34;diamond file&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>but when I do, I need to decent file.</li>
      <li>I did not receive the file pictured but rather a cheap unbranded version.</li>
      <li>I have some old Revlon &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; files that a much finer grit &amp; do not tear, rip or shred my nails.  </li>
      <li>I suppose this file is the tool for the job in case you&#x27;re looking for a tool that you can use to soften wooden or cardboard or plastic edges or pretty much anything a lot stronger than your damn</li>
      <li>About 2 weeks ago I bought a new one to have at the office.  </li>
      <li>I was looking at the reviews because I wanted to buy new Revlon files - my files that I bought two years ago</li>
      <li>This file has a rough edge while the old one had a smooth edge which I prefer.  </li>
      <li>This is great for quickly fixing snags especially for thick nails because there is no fine grit side.good and affordable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have thin nails.  I have some old Revlon &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; files that a much finer grit &amp; do not tear, rip or shred my nails.  The new Revlon files complete chew up my nails.</li>
    <li> This is the third nail file that I have owned and this is definitely the best. It is especially useful on tough toe nails.</li>
    <li> Works great, lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Revelon always had a good nail filer. These last quite long too! I keep buying these because my neice keeps taking mine.</li>
    <li> Not the nail filer in the picture, and a really bad one, does not worth even the low price! Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It does everything that a diamond cut file would do.</li>
    <li> exactly as described. Works great and convenient! buy a few have them in different places if needed! would recommend to friends</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT QUALITY, NOT THE CRAP THAT &amp;#34;EVERYBODY ELSE IS SELLING those don&#x27;t file your nails</li>
    <li> I love to use this on my nails. don&#x27;t really let my nails grow but when I do, I need to decent file. This one so far is the best I have ever had. Its small and compact and just what I need. I would be getting more of these when I have no use for this one anymore</li>
    <li> I was expecting the original Revlon file with the 2 grades. It is still a good product nonetheless. It definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought this in July 2013. After a couple of uses one side became almost completely flat. However, the other side is still usable after several months. Go figure ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just a guy who needs a nail file in his travel bag, and one in the house.  I don&#x27;t pay a lot of attention to my nails, just need to file down the rough edges after clipping them.  This file works fine for my purposes, I was looking for a folding file, but couldn&#x27;t find one, so this is a good substitute.  The file is coarse enough so that it files down the nail rough spots very quickly, just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love the long version of this file and like to keep them in spots all over my house and in purses for when a ragged nail appears. They file smoothly and precisely and last a long time. I am now having a difficult time finding the long ones which are great for storing upright in pencil cups and toothbrush holders.  The short pointed ones that I can find locally don&#x27;t seem to work quite as well (the gentle side is not as gentle as in the long ones I have) and the point is too sharp for inside purses or, I fear, for getting through airport security. The compact one with the rounded end might be a valid alternative to the ones I keep in my purse, but I really, really want the long ones to become widely available again!</li>
    <li> When i bought this- the picture showed the typical Revlon rounded edge emery board style- they have since changed the picture. Either way, to clarify, it is POINTED- and very sharp looking. For those of us that want the rounded edge one we&#x27;ve had for years, this isn&#x27;t it!</li>
    <li> The picture is not correct, it is pointed. However, that is what I wanted and it&#x27;s an excellent little file for the price.</li>
    <li> Lots of negative reviews, but I can&#x27;t figure out why.  This file is dirt cheap and works great.  It files your nails down wicked fast yet it doesn&#x27;t leave them rough (like the coarse side of an emery board does).  I&#x27;ve ordered a spare to keep at work for when I get stuck with a rough nail or sharp corner.  I haven&#x27;t used mine a lot, but there&#x27;s no sign at all of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> does its intended job, nothing special.  I am disappointed in its length.  I thought it would be longer.  its kind of short.  but for the price, it works and does what its supposed to do.  no real complaints.  just average feeling about it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the the same metal Revlon nail file for 40 years.  About 2 weeks ago I bought a new one to have at the office.  After the first use I noticed it was nearly worn out.  After the second use there is no more roughness left at all on one side.  It&#x27;s like my nails ground off the metal roughness.  I had to double check to see if it said Revlon on the side.  It does, but it does not look like my old one at all.  Something has changed in the quality of these files.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed in terms of emery filers. I was so glad I saw this on Amazon and bought it right away. I thought it was priced correctly and it is very sturdy and handy while filing nails. I had a similar one before, not from Revlon, but another local brand and the handle broke so was redundant. I was sad, as it is hard to find such filers locally with proper handle, the available ones look cheap and dont last long. Very happy and satisfied with my purchase! Go for it!</li>
    <li> What you see is not what you get.  Sorely disappointed in what I got!  Much shorter and nothing to show me which is shaping side or finishing side and I HATE that.</li>
    <li> The United States is being screwed with CHINEESE junk.  The old Revlon nail file with one side shaping and the other for finishng is no more.  Sad state of affairs.</li>
    <li> Good Filer, seems build with good materials, the roughness does has not yet gone off. very portable. Has an attractive look.</li>
    <li> The item is of high quality in my standards for the cheap price because it does what a file does plus the tip cleans safely without puncturing skin.</li>
    <li> This compact nail file does what a nail file should do. What I especially like is its compact size; easy to carry and works well.</li>
    <li> I prefer the metal files over emery boards. This is great and just the right size to keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> I live in rural America, and can&#x27;t find a good metal file anywhere. I  have always liked Revlon files. Wish I could find one with a cover on it, though.</li>
    <li> Works really good.  Water resistant.  Last long time.</li>
    <li> A very high quality product, rare these days because so many products made in China are really crappy.</li>
    <li> The file files like a file should.  The only problem is I keep losing them. Not great to escape jail cells and  prisons, but keeps your nails nicely filed</li>
    <li> I really hate my nails to get too long, and I hate filing them, so this file works pretty well to keep that in check. I wish it were even a little more coarse so it would file down even faster. I&#x27;m a guy, so..</li>
    <li> While the construction of this emery file is sturdy enough, I find that the grit on either side is just not enough. One side is almost smooth the touch while the other side is just slightly more gritty. It takes a long time to file nails down with this file. I will be looking for a better (read: grittier) metal file as I am tired of buying disposable cardboard files.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the file pictured but rather a cheap unbranded version. The file I received has the same pattern on each side and does not work well.</li>
    <li> This nail file is highly responsive to pressure, and has the capability to file a lot of nail quickly, or smooth out a minor nick or snag, without damaging the finish of a buff or polish.  This is the second time I have bought this file, and it is for a gift.  My original has been in use for over 3 years!</li>
    <li> nice size to take with you anywhere -  nice smooth edge - works great - i have ordered  4 so far  - thank you for no shipping costs -  have told friends - and given to co-workers</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made, but one side is hardly rough enough to be a file.  It&#x27;s much too smooth.  At least it has one good side though it certainly is annoying when you go to use it and you realize you&#x27;re on the dull side and have to flip it over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I&#x27;ve had this thing for roughly 3 years now and it&#x27;s held up well to almost daily use.  I really only use one side of it, due to the issue I described above where one side is too smooth, and it&#x27;s still not showing signs of wear.  I&#x27;d buy it again-- but i&#x27;d secretly hope that I get one with 2 functional sides instead of just one -- even though it still works just as well with only 1 side.</li>
    <li> Revlon continues to make some of the best grooming products available. Bought this one to replace one that was at least 10 years old and started showing some wear.  As usual the service was prompt and packaged well. Using Amazon again saved me time and gas money and aggravation.</li>
    <li> Very good nail file, many of the ones I have got in the past are not coarse enough to file down my nails. They seem to be too flat, this one is nice and rough like a fine sandpaper so it gets the job done. Handle is nice as well.</li>
    <li> I do not think this product was made by Revlon. The picture has a red picture on it like the files I have been using. The files I received have no such marking. The file simply does not file the nails. An inferior product and is too long to handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this kind of nail file for many years. I&#x27;ve always kept at least 3 on hand but over the years have lost and not been able to replace because where I usually buy them they were no longer sold. Was very pleased to find them and I didn&#x27;t have to drive all over another city looking for a good nail file.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand all of my life and seem to have a hard time finding them in stores.  Still the best.</li>
    <li> yay now i can properly maintain my finger nails! honestly i always hated the files on the back of clippers so i just bought this and its so  so so much better</li>
    <li> Emeryl file is very durable. This brand is very dependable. I recommend this to any pedicurist/ manicurist. Kepps nails neat.</li>
    <li> this is well worth the reasonable price... well made... holding up really well... definitely recommend this for purchase... would buy again</li>
    <li> This item is just the right size for use and travel. Works very well. The abrasive surface removes material quickly, doesn&#x27;t clog and appears durable but still leaves a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> From the other reviews I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to have 2 sides. one for finishing and one for shaping but it did! Great price point too!</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because as a female this is a item we all require to have on us at all times. A female never knows when she will need to touch up her nails. I was way past due with changing my previous filer and this one is above and beyond better that the one I purchased previously. Item came on time and as seller described and is worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> I have always purchased revlon nail files and this was as reliable as I expected.  Yes, I wild recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I suppose this file is the tool for the job in case you&#x27;re looking for a tool that you can use to soften wooden or cardboard or plastic edges or pretty much anything a lot stronger than your damn fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do not like this file because it is way too rough. I have to say I think it&#x27;s well built.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> This is great for quickly fixing snags especially for thick nails because there is no fine grit side.good and affordable.</li>
    <li> Handy . Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I broke my handle off my last original Revlon file, so I went and picked up one of these. (were they always made in China?) This thing is garbage. Brand new and not as good as the old one I threw away. Can barely file any length off, it&#x27;s not very gritty, and made my nails jagged to boot. Will be looking for a different brand. I&#x27;m sick of companies that have a good product changing things to make a couple more pennies a sale in profit, and ruining what made them good buys in the first place.</li>
    <li> The image and written description for this item was false. It was shown and described as a 6\\&quot; long file with a rounded tip and marked sides. I received a 5\\&quot; long file with a pointed end and no side markings. Very disappointed and will never purchase from this seller again. Also received no response to my complaint to this seller.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT AS PICTURED SO I RETURNED IT.  I WANTED A METAL EMERY FILE WITH A PLASTIC HANDLE AND A ROUNDED HEAD.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old one had more filing power left on it than this one has as a new one.</li>
    <li> I would rate this product as the best tool to do manicure work, It is very well made and east to use to maintain fingernails and toe nails. I plan to purchase additional file for all my bathrooms. Great little tool.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Service.</li>
    <li> description and picture show  fine and shaping sides to file. received same coarse grit on both sides. not as described.</li>
    <li> The item I received was not the advertised item.  The one I wanted (and that is advertised) has both a finishing side and a shaping side.  The one they are now sending only has one texture on both sides and it seems to be the shaping texture.  It can leave your nails with somewhat rough edges.  I&#x27;m guessing Revlon has discontinued the advertised product.  If you want something that will also smooth your nails, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this nail file, although it is good at shaping.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the tortoise handled nail file.  It does NOT file.  It is WAY OVER priced.  Original item no longer available.</li>
    <li> this is the same normal file that we all have, and most of us it is a must have, and I always have to have and use one of these, I go through these quickly, and loose them a lot, which is why I am so so glad that I find these on here on the subscribe and save option, which saves me a lot of money, and I know that I will always have them. no problems with receiving them or with packaging! highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This file is very small.  I&#x27;m not picky about the filing products I use so I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy when I bought it.  It has a handle and it works.  That&#x27;s all I was looking for in this file and that&#x27;s all I got.</li>
    <li> It was a gift, When I asked if it works and my wife said that works fine. There&#x27;s a lot of problems with the conventional lime, also they get lost, but this not.. very good</li>
    <li> I would prefer a longer file as these are a bit short for me - but I haven&#x27;t found any longer ones recently (though Revlon USED to make a longer one years ago - but I have not been able to find it anywhere of recent.)  But this &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; version is very effective at the task of filing nails! - It definitely does the job well and I would recommend it - for sure.</li>
    <li> I had an older model file that was advertised as a &amp;#34;diamond file&amp;#34;. I liked it better.  This file has a rough edge while the old one had a smooth edge which I prefer.  This one is ok, but not worth the price IMO.</li>
    <li> bought these because I have had revlon metal files in the past that were lovely and fine.  these would be good for filing rough edges off of aluminum!</li>
    <li> I have several Revlon files, rounded 6-inch and pointed 4-inch, that I have been using for up to 30 years. I bought a new one in July 2012 and it is NOT the same product they made until recently. The filing surface has come off the file after one use; it did not adhere to the metal file and the file is now smooth on both sides and useless! I can&#x27;t believe Revlon is selling this product with their name on it.</li>
    <li> Great file but the old ones had a shaping side and a finishing side.This one both sides were the same.</li>
    <li> A little too thick. I have an older Revlon that I wanted to replace, though there wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it beyond looking old. This one is definitely made more cheaply. It works fine, but it&#x27;s a little too thick for my comfort.</li>
    <li> Too small, thought it was going to be bigger.</li>
    <li> Use has served my purposes</li>
    <li> I used them for like a week and they crapped out. Look for another file this one is only good for one week</li>
    <li> Basic but does the job well.</li>
    <li> My nails are pristine and clean. I just rinse this thing off and it&#x27;s good to go again. No nails are a match for its beveled metal edges or tightly coiled grip!</li>
    <li> I was looking at the reviews because I wanted to buy new Revlon files - my files that I bought two years ago have completely lost their texture. I have always bought Revlon, for 60 years - but will change to another brand based on the reviews. I thought my files&#x27; wearing out so quickly was a fluke, but evidently not.</li>
    <li> The Reason for 3 STARS is because , Revlon has been making this file for years now , but Neither is The Packaging nor the product , appealing. It has the same Staid Colour and Shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The File Itself does good work , but is not anything exceptional !</li>
