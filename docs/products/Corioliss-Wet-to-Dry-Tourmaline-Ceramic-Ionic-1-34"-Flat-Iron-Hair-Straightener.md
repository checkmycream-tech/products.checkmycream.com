      <li>I also like that the switch is located on the bottom side of the top handle, so</li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron I have EVER had!  </li>
      <li>Best thing about it is you don&#x27;t have to wait until your hair is completely dry.</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot, but ended up giving it away as a gift to my aunt because she liked it so much.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think this product is the original, I bough an original 4 years ago, I paid $275 but is was worthy.</li>

      <li>Will never use any other, hair are so shiny and beautiful.</li>
      <li>Now, I am not young and cutesy, but my hair is amazing!  </li>
      <li>3) Full ceramic plates.  </li>
      <li>I switched to Sedu Revolution 1-inch, which is a dream come true.  </li>
      <li>Nice but takes too many passes to dry hair.</li>
      <li>So far can say it is a good product timely shipping and reasonable</li>
      <li>This is so much faster and easier than drying first and then straightening, and it gives a better result.</li>
      <li>it is just as good as some twice the price, it has only one heat setting which is fine because I have thick hair, it is sooo much better than the cheapy irons!</li>
      <li>Amazing Wet/dry Flat Iron.</li>
      <li>but if you use this straightener, you have straight hair until you wash it again!</li>
      <li>I first purchased this item in June 2012.</li>
      <li>After reading about products online, I found have a solid ceramic plate is better than coated plates as they don&#x27;t wear away.  </li>
      <li>I love this flat iron no damage</li>
      <li>You HAVE to use the wet to dry first and your hair needs to be damp and you will get amazing results!  </li>
      <li>I love that it will dry damp hair!</li>
      <li>But it hasn&#x27;t been too much of an issue with me.  </li>
      <li>(I also use Straight and Style by Keune)</li>
      <li>I decided to stop using chemicals in my hair 4 years ago and it really does the job of straightening my hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s heat the whole time I straightening my hair.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I also like that this product heats up fast and seems to hold</li>
      <li>Heats up very quickly and can use on damp hair, although I really prefer it on dry.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This Wet to Dry iron sounded like a great time-saver, drying and straightening at the same time -- but it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Sedu Revolution is worth the extra money.  </li>
      <li>It last me 4 years and my hair was silky shiny and pretty with my new item</li>
      <li>My daughter has one and it has lasted about 4 years so far!</li>
      <li>I had the older version of the Corioliss, but this one is larger and much smoooooooooother when I iron my hair.  </li>
      <li>had one before from different vendor lasted more than 4 years, will see how long this one last.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was surprised at the positive reviews, but I guess everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
      <li>It works so well and lasts so long that one time, about three or four days in, I decided to use hot rollers for some soft curl and the curl did not stay in!</li>
      <li>Large size surface (3/4\\&quot; or larger)</li>
      <li>I only have to wash my hair every 2-3 days because it is so dry,so the straight hair lasts.  </li>
      <li>Also, to save time in the morning as I go to work very early and don&#x27;t feel like spending an hour to get ready, I wash my hair the night before and let it dry somewhat while I sleep.  </li>
      <li>I really like this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>My last flat iron had coated plates and they wore away quickly even though the flat iron still worked, which then started to fry my hair without any protection on the plates.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally straight anyway, I actually cannot get it to hold curl unless I use an entire can of hairspray so my hair doesn&#x27;t move at all.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft now and very straight (no more waves or frizz).  </li>
      <li>My hair is softer and straightens much faster than any other flat iron I have used.</li>
      <li>The reason I use a flat iron is if I just let my hair air dry, I get waves in just a couple spots of my hair, nothing that looks nice as it&#x27;s not all over, just random spots.  </li>

<li> I tried to take a shortcut and only use the regular Corioliss flat iron, and within a couple washes the frizz came back.  </li>
<li> And the result is coarse, frizzy flat hair.</li>

<li> I had a friend who bought a Ping flat iron that was $125.  </li>

<li> I tried to several methods with this iron -- drying my hair from sopping wet, from towel-dried and from damp, with heat-protectant spray and without, and the result is always the same -- a coarse, frizzy, and damaged-looking head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is clunky to use; I have dropped or nearly dropped it several times and also burned myself a few times.  </li>
<li> Love this crazy thing</li>
<li> as I have long hair.  </li>
<li> So, I ALWAYS USE THE WET TO DRY, FOLLOWED BY THE REGULAR CORIOLISS</li>
<li> The temperature is to low, it doesn&#x27;t dry wet hair.</li>
<li> I usually get my hair done in 15 minutes in the morning, which is quicker than my old flat iron that took about 25 minutes.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It takes as long, or longer, to dry my hair with this iron as it did to blow it dry.</li>
<li> 2) Can be used for wet-to-dry, as I have thick hair and don&#x27;t like taking the time to dry my hair completely before using a flat iron.  </li>
<li> When I use this wet to dry followed by the regular flat iron the next day, there is NO MORE FRIZZ in my hair, even when it is humid (and it gets humid in Texas!).  </li>
<li> Total Waste of money.</li>
<li> Hair can&#x27;t be just out of the shower wet, you need to towel dry or let air dry a little</li>
<li> I have long, thick, fine-textured curly-puffy hair that I usually blow dry and then straighten with a regular Coriolis flat-iron.  </li>
<li> for hair types, other than having lots of hair, I don&#x27;t really have difficult hair to straighten.  </li>
<li> only negative (which is why I gave it 4-star) is that you cannot control the heat setting.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s about two inches down from my shoulders.</li>
<li> Hair near the scalp is impossible to dry with this flat iron.</li>
<li> I was trying to replace the previous corioliss iron I had that after 8 years gave out on me.</li>
<li> &quot; - Black]]  </li>
<li> I have to keep trying it used it a few times.</li>
<li> Disappointed  --- I returned this item as it was NOT dual voltage and would only work if I was in Europe with a European outlet.</li>
<li> I had tried Chi and had used one for years, but have never experienced this type of result.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. It straightens wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t take more than 25 minutes to do my hair and it&#x27;s about two inches down from my shoulders. Second time buying it though.</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for just over a month. I love it! My hair looks and feels great after using it. Definitely worth the (excellent) price!</li>
    <li> This is so much faster and easier than drying first and then straightening, and it gives a better result. It works so well and lasts so long that one time, about three or four days in, I decided to use hot rollers for some soft curl and the curl did not stay in! My hair has a lot of body and the curl from hot rollers usually lasts for days but if you use this straightener, you have straight hair until you wash it again! Use some good styling product with it that is made for heat--I use Chi and it leaves my hair very soft. Love this crazy thing and so glad I found it and purchased it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron no damage it is dual voltage, everything is great my haor is sleek and shiny and smooth. I take it everywhere I go</li>
    <li> This works way better than the chi I had for 2 years before it quit working! My hair is softer and straightens much faster than any other flat iron I have used. My daughter has one and it has lasted about 4 years so far! That is the reason I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  I had 3 things I wanted in a flat iron.  1) Large size surface (3/4\\&quot; or larger) as I have long hair.  2) Can be used for wet-to-dry, as I have thick hair and don&#x27;t like taking the time to dry my hair completely before using a flat iron.  3) Full ceramic plates.  After reading about products online, I found have a solid ceramic plate is better than coated plates as they don&#x27;t wear away.  My last flat iron had coated plates and they wore away quickly even though the flat iron still worked, which then started to fry my hair without any protection on the plates.  I also like that this product heats up fast and seems to hold it&#x27;s heat the whole time I straightening my hair.  So another positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative (which is why I gave it 4-star) is that you cannot control the heat setting.  There is an on/off switch and that&#x27;s it.  But it hasn&#x27;t been too much of an issue with me.  I also like that the switch is located on the bottom side of the top handle, so while using the flat iron, you&#x27;re not hitting the switch and turning it off (like I do with my curling iron that I use on my bangs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hair types, other than having lots of hair, I don&#x27;t really have difficult hair to straighten.  My hair is naturally straight anyway, I actually cannot get it to hold curl unless I use an entire can of hairspray so my hair doesn&#x27;t move at all.  The reason I use a flat iron is if I just let my hair air dry, I get waves in just a couple spots of my hair, nothing that looks nice as it&#x27;s not all over, just random spots.  Also, to save time in the morning as I go to work very early and don&#x27;t feel like spending an hour to get ready, I wash my hair the night before and let it dry somewhat while I sleep.  This helps with drying the rest of my hair in the morning and making it looks nicer.  I usually get my hair done in 15 minutes in the morning, which is quicker than my old flat iron that took about 25 minutes.  I would definitely buy this flat iron again.</li>
    <li> Bought it in 2012 an it still works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing Wet/dry Flat Iron. Works very well. Best thing about it is you don&#x27;t have to wait until your hair is completely dry. Time saver for sure.</li>
    <li> love this iron! it is just as good as some twice the price, it has only one heat setting which is fine because I have thick hair, it is sooo much better than the cheapy irons!</li>
    <li> great item only wish you&#x27;d had a control temperature switch</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. I was trying to replace the previous corioliss iron I had that after 8 years gave out on me. Completely opposite of what I had. Wish I could return it. I emailed the company but never got a response back. Total Waste of money.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it and gets complements on her hair everytime she uses it. She says it takes about twenty min to do.</li>
    <li> ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AND GOT A EUROPEAN CORD - DOES THIS NOT COME WITH US PLUGS??! ! NOTHING STATES ON DESCRIPTION REGARDING POWER CORD!!</li>
    <li> This Corioliss straightening iron does not have an adjustable heat setting.  It is clunky to use; I have dropped or nearly dropped it several times and also burned myself a few times.  I switched to Sedu Revolution 1-inch, which is a dream come true.  [[ASIN:B003AJLQ4W Sedu Revolution Tourmaline Ionic Styling Iron 1\\&quot; - Black]]  You only have to run it through your hair once, and the result is noticeably straighter than the Corioliss.  Also the Sedu does not catch on the hair EVER!  The Sedu Revolution is worth the extra money.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So far can say it is a good product timely shipping and reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I had one before from different vendor lasted more than 4 years, will see how long this one last. Will let you know</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have EVER had!  People thought I had a Brazilian blow-out!  (I also use Straight and Style by Keune) My co-workers were amazed at how my hair looked.  No, I don&#x27;t work for Corioliss and had never heard of it till my beautician used it on my hair.  I am an 8th grade teacher, and my students gave me sooooo many compliments (even the boys noticed, lol!).  Now, I am not young and cutesy, but my hair is amazing!  When I use this wet to dry followed by the regular flat iron the next day, there is NO MORE FRIZZ in my hair, even when it is humid (and it gets humid in Texas!).  I had tried Chi and had used one for years, but have never experienced this type of result.  You HAVE to use the wet to dry first and your hair needs to be damp and you will get amazing results!  My hair is so soft now and very straight (no more waves or frizz).  I tried to take a shortcut and only use the regular Corioliss flat iron, and within a couple washes the frizz came back.  So, I ALWAYS USE THE WET TO DRY, FOLLOWED BY THE REGULAR CORIOLISS THE NEXT MORNING.  I only have to wash my hair every 2-3 days because it is so dry,so the straight hair lasts.  NOW, ONE MORE THING, I USE STRAIGHT AND STYLE BY KEUNE AFTER EACH wash (hold factor 10) and with both products I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER WITH MY HAIR!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had the older version of the Corioliss, but this one is larger and much smoooooooooother when I iron my hair.  Heats up very quickly and can use on damp hair, although I really prefer it on dry.  It smooths my hair wonderfully.  For this price, it is a bargain.  I had a friend who bought a Ping flat iron that was $125.  I loved it, but this one is every bit as good as that one... and honestly, I could not tell the difference.  Mine was $38!  Do the math!</li>
    <li> The temperature is to low, it doesn&#x27;t dry wet hair. Hair near the scalp is impossible to dry with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Nice but takes too many passes to dry hair. I have to keep trying it used it a few times.</li>
    <li> My hair is super thick and this works as long as I section it out into 1/4 inch sections.  I love that it will dry damp hair!</li>
    <li> It was in great condition and this is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this item in June 2012. I liked it a lot, but ended up giving it away as a gift to my aunt because she liked it so much. I purchased it again almost 1.5 years later, but am only giving four stars because this time the item did not come with the heat-resistant storage pouch.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, fine-textured curly-puffy hair that I usually blow dry and then straighten with a regular Coriolis flat-iron.  This Wet to Dry iron sounded like a great time-saver, drying and straightening at the same time -- but it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes as long, or longer, to dry my hair with this iron as it did to blow it dry. And the result is coarse, frizzy flat hair. I tried to several methods with this iron -- drying my hair from sopping wet, from towel-dried and from damp, with heat-protectant spray and without, and the result is always the same -- a coarse, frizzy, and damaged-looking head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the positive reviews, but I guess everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
    <li> Disappointed  --- I returned this item as it was NOT dual voltage and would only work if I was in Europe with a European outlet. Maybe it was suppose to come with a DUAL voltage adapter, but mine did not</li>
    <li> I have been using my corioliss for many many years and love it. Just stopped heating up properly, I think life ended. Just got this one and love my iron. Will never use any other, hair are so shiny and beautiful. I always get compliments on my hair. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this product is the original, I bough an original 4 years ago, I paid $275 but is was worthy. It last me 4 years and my hair was silky shiny and pretty with my new item I don&#x27;t get the same results.</li>
    <li> I love how sstraight my hair gets with this iron.  I decided to stop using chemicals in my hair 4 years ago and it really does the job of straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> Hair can&#x27;t be just out of the shower wet, you need to towel dry or let air dry a little but it does work and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage your hair, a lot of steam though when you do use it.</li>
    <li> wish it had a temp. control</li>
    <li> Perfect item for my hair</li>
    <li> good item, I find I still need to blow dry my hair a bit before I use this straightener to get the best results.</li>
