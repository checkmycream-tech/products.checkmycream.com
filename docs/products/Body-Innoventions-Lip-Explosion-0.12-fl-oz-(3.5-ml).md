      <li>It does go on smoothly, it feels nice on the lips and does add a bit of color, though.  </li>
      <li>my lips look fabulous!</li>
      <li>It is nothing more than a roll on lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>bummer for sure.</li>

      <li>It does exactly as it states!!  </li>
      <li>It smells good and looks good, but the lip plumping is very little to none with a sligth tingle sensation.</li>
      <li>I have reasonably full lips</li>
      <li>It may work OK if there is absolutely nothing on your lips -- no residue from anything else.  </li>
      <li>Its definitely worth the price but to improve it</li>
      <li>This was my first try for a lip plumper, and so far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I did not see any more volume in my lips, but they look nice and it last several hours.  </li>
      <li>Save your money and buy the cheap stuff it works just as good if not better!</li>
      <li>This stings quite a bit at first</li>
      <li>Overall, I am pleased with the product and the price.</li>
      <li>When I first took this out of the package it was just in a tube, no box like shown on the page.</li>
      <li>I first wrote a review that was glowing about this product.  </li>
      <li>but it definitely plumps your lips even more and turns them reddish.</li>
      <li>What I have found is that it wears off pretty fast -- within 20 mins.  </li>
      <li>thanks for your Rapid deliveryservice.</li>
      <li>It feels like it&#x27;s working on my lips, but it doesn&#x27;t make my lips look that much fuller.  </li>
      <li>It really burned my lips.  </li>
      <li>Makes my lips look soft and plump right away.</li>
      <li>It is so much better than other application brushes that I have used.</li>
      <li>Overall, not a bad product.  </li>
      <li>, I added a few drops of 100% essential cinnamon oil (about $5) to the gloss (which is light pink and smells very good initially).</li>
      <li>I like it, arrived brand new, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>After I put it on and noticed nothing at all, I thought I&#x27;d try putting it on just half my lips to make sure....</li>
      <li>It looks real natural.</li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t any plumping action that I can tell.  </li>
      <li>Be sure let dry completely prior to putting on lipstick..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of a pretty pale pink</li>
      <li>My only thing is that I&#x27;m not used to wearing lip gloss, and you can certainly feel it on your lips.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is just old?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen it other places for a higher price, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay the higher prices for the minor results.</li>
      <li>But this tube is a pretty poppy pink</li>
      <li>no other complaints.   </li>
      <li>but I had a problem, it came in a big container with barely anything in it!!!</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have for the tubing is that you cannot \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; out all the product and get the full use of the tube.</li>

<li> so if you are looking for extreme plumping action than this might not work for you.</li>
<li> So much gets wasted!</li>
<li> It was somewhat disappointing because i love Lip Explosion</li>
<li> However, I have not seen any other company offer such a thing, either.</li>
<li> and if my lips are dry or something, but had no plumping effect.  </li>
<li> When I had bought it in the past it was clear.</li>
<li> and it leaves a very dark red line on the outer lip line region.......  </li>
<li> What I didn&#x27;t expect is the pink color.</li>
<li> It just really is not a \\&quot;lip</li>
<li> Plus the pale pink coloring of the gloss is just enough to add a little something to my lips.</li>
<li> I used to use Two Faced Lip Injection Extreme, but that product makes my lips feel like they are on fire......</li>
<li> Other than that.....</li>
<li> This item does not work as other reviewers claim.</li>
<li> but this seemed to plump the lips a little bit but only for a few hours.</li>
<li> not worth nay amount of money.</li>
<li> and I notice it is down to seven dollars today.</li>
<li> It provides average shine that lasts maybe 5-10 minutes and has a slight cooling sensation that lasts maybe a minute.</li>
<li> it gives me the tingle of sephoras lip venom in a larger container for half the price!!!  </li>
<li> Would give half a star if I could.</li>
<li> My lips don&#x27;t look like duck beaks, but they look slightly fuller, and less dehydrated.</li>
<li> :(  It goes to show you cannot get quality for cheap.</li>
<li> I paid $13 for an average lip gloss I could&#x27;ve gotten at Wal-Mart for $2!</li>
<li> What a waste of money.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> It was a waste of money for me.  </li>
<li> The color looked pink in the tube so I was skeptical.</li>
<li> There was no stinging uncomfortable feeling other people have experianced.</li>
<li> not good</li>
<li> I have thin lips</li>
<li> Thin, greasy, and makes you look like you&#x27;ve been eating fried chicken.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s gooey and useless.  </li>
<li> I figured it was another disappointing product and got up to look in the mirror.</li>
<li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
<li> This is dangerous stuff!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item is by far one of the best lip plumpers out there!!! I recommend it to all. Havent found a better product for lip plumping!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cinnamon liquid, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I have thin lips and I have never used a lip plumper before but this seemed to plump the lips a little bit but only for a few hours. Its definitely worth the price but to improve it, I added a few drops of 100% essential cinnamon oil (about $5) to the gloss (which is light pink and smells very good initially). This stings quite a bit at first but it definitely plumps your lips even more and turns them reddish. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I first wrote a review that was glowing about this product.  It may work OK if there is absolutely nothing on your lips -- no residue from anything else.  What I have found is that it wears off pretty fast -- within 20 mins.  There really isn&#x27;t any plumping action that I can tell.  It does go on smoothly, it feels nice on the lips and does add a bit of color, though.  It just really is not a \\&quot;lip exploder\\&quot; by any means.</li>
    <li> This item does not work as other reviewers claim. Is it tingly? yes does it plump - not at all. Save your money and buy the cheap stuff it works just as good if not better!</li>
    <li> I paid $13 for an average lip gloss I could&#x27;ve gotten at Wal-Mart for $2! It DOES NOT PLUMP even the slightest! It provides average shine that lasts maybe 5-10 minutes and has a slight cooling sensation that lasts maybe a minute. After I put it on and noticed nothing at all, I thought I&#x27;d try putting it on just half my lips to make sure....still nothing. No plumping what so ever. I could get the same effect if I put Carmex or even olive oil on my lips. I got totally scammed! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works as a great lip gloss.  It smells good and looks good, but the lip plumping is very little to none with a sligth tingle sensation.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this lip plumper to me.  It feels like it&#x27;s working on my lips, but it doesn&#x27;t make my lips look that much fuller.  Overall, not a bad product.  I&#x27;ve seen it other places for a higher price, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay the higher prices for the minor results.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! definatley would use and recommend it but I had a problem, it came in a big container with barely anything in it!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I bought it at Costco. The lip explosion I ordered from Brandname Beauty does not work anywhere as well at the Costco product. It was somewhat disappointing because i love Lip Explosion but this product was not in the box it is sold in. And the bottle is different. it does not plump my lips.    Maybe it is just old? I think i paid thirty six dollars for one bottle at Costco. here i only paid nine dollars and I notice it is down to seven dollars today.:(  It goes to show you cannot get quality for cheap. Lesson learned  !   The company did however offer to refund me but they sold the product cheap an paid for the packing and mailing. I do not believe in contributing to a companies loss. So yes they offered me this option for a refund twice and they where very nice about it. :) customer happy !</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  It&#x27;s gooey and useless.  What a waste of money.  I have better results in cinnamon extract.</li>
    <li> I love this Lip Explosion. It does exactly as it states!!  I immediately noticed a difference in my lips as soon as I applied the product. It actually made my lips look like they did when I was in my twenties. I am 65 now and with the help of this product, I look almost as good as I did 40 years ago! Believe it or not!![[ASIN:B000CRCS6A Body Innoventions Lip Explosion, 0.12 fl oz (3.5 ml)]]</li>
    <li> This was my first try for a lip plumper, and so far I&#x27;m satisfied. My lips don&#x27;t look like duck beaks, but they look slightly fuller, and less dehydrated. There was no stinging uncomfortable feeling other people have experianced. My only thing is that I&#x27;m not used to wearing lip gloss, and you can certainly feel it on your lips. I was disapointed that the packaging doesn&#x27;t match the picture, all you get is the tube and wand. The color looks natural on my lips and the scent is pleasant.</li>
    <li> When I first took this out of the package it was just in a tube, no box like shown on the page. The color looked pink in the tube so I was skeptical. I put it on and there was no stickiness, or gloopy residue like most glosses and plumpers. I sat at my computer to wait for the burn or sting and there was nothing. I figured it was another disappointing product and got up to look in the mirror. To my surprise my lips were  blush red now and plumper. There was just no sting involved in it. And the red isnt red like a lipstick- its like if you bit your lip. It looks real natural. I&#x27;ve just gone and ordered a 2nd one to have around</li>
    <li> what&#x27;s in this stuff, gunpowder?  It really burned my lips.  It was a waste of money for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff a couple of years ago and then could not find it anywhere. Forgot about it, remembered, and decided to look on Amazon. It still works the same. About 5 minutes after I put it on my lips are much larger and smoother. What I didn&#x27;t expect is the pink color. When I had bought it in the past it was clear. But this tube is a pretty poppy pink and I love it!! I put Benefit Benetint on my lips and then glossed with this stuff. Super Sexy Sweet Lips! get some.</li>
    <li> nothing happened. no lip plumping, no anything... bummer for sure. not worth nay amount of money. buyer beware. not good</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It is nothing more than a roll on lip gloss.  Does nothing at all. I used the entire lip gloss up and no change in fuller lips.  Gives the feeling it works becaues it tingles, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love lip explosion! it gives me the tingle of sephoras lip venom in a larger container for half the price!!!  IT SHIPPED IN 2 OR 3 DAYS! my lips look fabulous! i was weary about buying this product because it was so inexpensive but you DEFINITELY GET A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!</li>
    <li> I used to use Two Faced Lip Injection Extreme, but that product makes my lips feel like they are on fire......and it leaves a very dark red line on the outer lip line region.......  With that said, I like this Body Innovations Lip Explosion because it tingles but does not BURN, and it smells pleasant. Plus the pale pink coloring of the gloss is just enough to add a little something to my lips. I also like the consistency of the gloss because it is not too sticky or gooey. The plumping is moderate so if you are looking for extreme plumping action than this might not work for you. I have reasonably full lips so this is just enough to expand what I already have.   Overall, I am pleased with the product and the price. I love the application wand! It is so much better than other application brushes that I have used. The only complaint I have for the tubing is that you cannot \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; out all the product and get the full use of the tube. I wish that they would make a \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; tube for that reason. So much gets wasted! However, I have not seen any other company offer such a thing, either. Other than that.....no other complaints.   I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> This is dangerous stuff!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything.  it&#x27;s kind of a pretty pale pink and if my lips are dry or something, but had no plumping effect.  And I know some products work as I&#x27;m continuing with them, instead.</li>
    <li> I did not see any more volume in my lips, but they look nice and it last several hours.  I liked it.</li>
    <li> Save your money! This stuff has the plumping capabilities of Vaseline.Is a good lip gloss, for about 3 minutes. Thin, greasy, and makes you look like you&#x27;ve been eating fried chicken.Zero plumping, zero points from me! Would give half a star if I could.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips look soft and plump right away. I get tons of compliments and I don&#x27;t have to wear anything else on my lips!</li>
    <li> I like it, arrived brand new, fast delivery., product does plump my already big lips, it smooths out the lines around my top lip, and Lipstick goes on perfect.. Be sure let dry completely prior to putting on lipstick..</li>
    <li> Very good product.  thanks for your Rapid deliveryservice.</li>
    <li> I really liked it alot it made your lips tingle and look fuller.After awhile you have to reapply but its nice</li>
