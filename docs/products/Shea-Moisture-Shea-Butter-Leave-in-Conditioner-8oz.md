<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My haur is 4b-c african anerican and this keeps my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of the reviews that said the smell was too strong for this hair conditioner because it had so many other good reviews; however, if you dislike scented hand creams, do not purchase this product. It seriously gave me a headache because the smell is so strong! Flowery sweet smell&#x27; yikes! On the other hand, if you like strong flowery smells this product could be just for you.</li>
    <li> I am currently deployed in the desert where the temperatures go beyond 120 degrees.  I have type 4a/b/c hair.  The extreme heat takes moisture from all hair types hair quickly, but especially those with type 4 hair.  Even applying moisture several times per day and infusing my vegetable glycerine, aloe vera gel, and water mix, my hair still manages to be dry by the end of the day.  I have been using this product for almost one day, so my rating is not entirely accurate, but I have noticed that the moisture has been retained in my hair.  I plan to use this product 3-4 times daily along with vegetable glycerine, aloe vera gel, and bottled water in a spray pump to see if I can maintain moisture for the remainder of my travel (about 3 months).  I will re-post after one month.</li>
    <li> The Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner is second to none! I applied this product to my wet hair, after a co-wash. My hair curled up like never before! My hair was soft, pliable and the smell was yummy. This leave in moisturizer will replace my Kinky Curly Knot Today! This is a staple product for sure. I HIGHLY recommend you at least TRY it! I can&#x27;t stop gazing at my pretty curly hair!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best leave in conditioner that actually moisturizes my hair!  I put this on right before bed when I twist up my hair and go to sleep on it.  The next day it is still moisturized as well as through out the day!  Very little is needed.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for natural hair.  I have 4a/4b hair and this leave-in leaves my hair very soft.  I also use the Giovanni leave-in and I like it, but I believe this is better.</li>
    <li> After using other Shea Moisture products, I was excited to give this product a try. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing or provides enough slip that I would like to have in a leave in, but it does have really good natural ingredients. When I use this product, I will use just a little drop of a another leave-in conditioner with more slip (Curl Junkie Smoothing LI or Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful Hair Nectar) just so it&#x27;s easier to work through my hair. If you like a lot of slip from a leave in then this is not for you. The ingredients does give this LI a decent advantage so if you are truly sticking to all organic/vegan products then this may be the LI for you. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> THIS LEAVE IN IS JUST OK..IT IS VERY THICK AND SMELLS GOOD, BUT I&#x27;M SURE I COULD FIND A BETTER LEAVE IN THE WILL MAKE MY HAIR EXTREMLY SOFT.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love shea moisture shea butter! It is a bit thick...well very thick but you don&#x27;t need much! It immediately moisturized my hair and soften it beyond recognition! I have 4b hair, thick full, kinky hair and it made for a wonderful moisturizing conditioning. I personally still use kinky curly  knot today to detangle my hair, but it dries my hair, so to replenish my hair, i use this leave in conditioner and it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the product... It&#x27;s super thick and heavy and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair (very, very thick, natural, curly hair)... I&#x27;ve only used it once since my purchase, don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m going to use it again but if I do I&#x27;ll have to thin it quite a bit...</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. My expectations were much higher based off of the reviews. Its very sticky like pink lotion. Its helpful when I want to pull my hair into a ponytail or smooth my edges but too heavy for an every day leave-in conditioner. It tends to leave white streaks of product in my hair.</li>
    <li> I was quite excited when I bought this product after reading all the reviews.  I was first surprised to see how very thick it was when I put it in my hands.  I rubbed it to smooth it out and put it through my hair.  I didn&#x27;t like it.  It was still too thick and didn&#x27;t glide on my hair (by the way, I have natural African hair with a keratin process).  After I let my hair dry, I did my usual flat iron routine and my hair seemed like a feather which I didn&#x27;t like.  I tried the product out 2 more times before I decided it was time to stop use when my hair kept getting frizzy and I was getting flyaways.  I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work. It seemed to do nothing for my hair and worse, so I&#x27;m gonna try another product (Wen) and see how that goes.  Really wish I could have liked it but not for me at all.</li>
    <li> I have read a lot of reviews on this product and I have say that it does make my hair soft and moisture.  I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> I had the hardest time getting the conditioner out. Forget turning it upside down while you wash your hair hoping it would be at the top when time to use - NOT.... The conditioner was ok - just the hassle getting it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in Conditioner. I may not care for the shampoo, but I use this conditioner DAILY. It keeps my hair nourished and I believe it aids in my hair growth too.</li>
    <li> I have very dry 4C natural hair and this product really keeps it moisturized.  Believe me I have tried and wasted a lot of money on other products that didn&#x27;t work. This is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different prodcuts out there since I decided to go natural. This is a much better product than a lot of the products that cost twice as much! I could see a big difference the first time I used it. One application of this conditioner and people were asking what I did different. I have only been using it a few days now and my hair is soft and managable. I used it to do two strand twists and they came out great. My son has a much more managable hair type than mine and he is growing his hair out right now. I put some on his hair and it looked very good. It was very shiny and very healthy looking. I will be looking for a larger bottle or jar because this is a very good product and now I know I will have to share with my son. :) I will definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I was amazed that it smelled so good, pleasant and not overbearing and everyone complimented me on it. Its a great moisturizer and yes, a little goes a long way. I like the fact that this was made with natural ingredients. My hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down. My friends (both black and white) loved it too. Its great to put on you hair before it is flat ironed. I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It calms the frizzies down a little, but kinda leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair dull looking.  I&#x27;ll use is a little longer and see what happens.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing though!</li>
    <li> I am glad that I can get this online as NO store in my area has this product.  I have found other Shea Moisture products, but can never find this leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> It was an ok product.  I was really going by the other reviews, and have a natural hair style, not a perm.  It did make it soft. Though I wont purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition, Brand New.  No leaks during shipping.  I am happy with my purchase.  I recommend Shea Moisture products, I trust their great ingredients.  This one is very thick, it will last me for months because it is so thick and creamy.  I like to apply it into wet hair or else water it down some in order to distribute it really well.  I have thick long almost waist long hair.  When I run out I plan to buy again using Amazon.</li>
    <li> ive never taken the time to review anything...this product is awesome if you have 3c curls and dont want them to look like u put any gel or any oil in them...BUT the curls look tame and frizz free. Can also use before blowdrying...awesome! it doesnt leave any white residue in my hair...so maybe people were using too much. Good stuff! Buy!</li>
    <li> There are some that prefer this formula of Shea Moisture and those who like the newer lines better. I am of the latter. This conditioner is too soft to me. I like a bit more stickiness and butter feel to my daily products but this one can be sticky though at the wrong time. When you are done applying there is a residue. I do not care for the smell. I do use this often though as well as their newer stuff. However, this one is good for steam treatments.</li>
    <li> I purchased Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner because a previous reviewer had stated this conditioner had worked well on her relaxed hair. While I&#x27;m glad it worked well for her, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many of my fellow relaxed-haired sisters know, it&#x27;s hard to maintain moisture when your hair is being exposed to harsh straitening chemicals every few months. So I was hoping this product would do the trick, especially with all the sparkling reviews. However, while I didn&#x27;t have an overly negative experience, I think my search will continue for the \\&quot;perfect conditioner\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- It smells great. It&#x27;s nice and thick, covering each strand of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Left a residue on my hair; residue turned gooky over time which then turned flaky and was hard to wash out. Left hair slightly stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this product may work well for other women, it&#x27;s just not for me. Good luck ladies!</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about this conditioner. You might as well use mayonaise in your hair. This product is not necessary for anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my 4b hair and on my bi-racial son&#x27;s curly mane!  It gives hair a healthy sheen and makes it soft and manageable! It also appears to have none of the generic ingredients that many of the other hair care products have in them!</li>
    <li> I have a crew cut and my skin is so dry and when ever I run my hand over it thre would be lots of dry skin like dandruf come out.  Now my scalp looks and feels great.  I definately want more.</li>
    <li> I would recommend using this as a styler rather than a leave in. It is very thick. I really like it for my twist outs. It leaves my hair very soft and I have thick coarse hair. Giving it a 4 because it is a little difficult to get out the bottle but I plan to purchase a plastic jar to put it in.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night when I twist up my hair. The next day my hair is defined and feels soft all day.  It even makes my hair easier to comb.  This is one of my new staples for my personal hair care.  Plus, it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> If you have super dry hair and need a sealant to lock in moisture, this is an awesome product to buy. It&#x27;s very thick and adds plenty of volume to your hair. I have naturally dry and thick, kinky hair, so I bought the product hoping it would add moisture to my hair. It acted more as a sealant on my hair though, and the extra volume I really didn&#x27;t need. I eventually gave it to a friend who has naturally dry but thin curly hair, and it works wonderfully as a moisturizer on her hair. So I would say if you like to experiment, buy the leave-in and see how it works on your hair.</li>
    <li> As far as detangling, I&#x27;m not sure this is the greatest but it is very moisturizing.  I used it as a leave-in and also as a styler for my 2-strand twists.  It does the job but I think I will save it for the winter.  Thats just how thick it is.  In the summer, for me, a thick leave-in is not needed.</li>
    <li> Being a new comer to the natural look (1 and half years now) I wanted my hair to look healthy and non-frizzy (dry). This product gives me both. Used weekly as a leave-in conditioner between washes &amp; as the leave-in mosturizer after washing I much say I am extremely happy! It leaves my hair silky smoothe and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I recommend it to everyone who ask me how do I care for my kinky curls.</li>
    <li> Smells great and really moisturizes my hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair moisturizer I have ever used!  I have been natural for five years and have had my hair colored on occasion.  Unfortunately, the color changed the texture of my hair and not in a good way.  My hair was extremely dry from midway through the length of my hair down to the ends.  After three weeks of using this product (sometimes with Long Aid Curl Activator Gel), my colored hair is as soft as the new growth!  I put the moisturizer on my hair at night and tie my hair up in a scarf before bed and wake up to extremely soft and manageable hair.. This product is now a staple in my hair care product collection!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful for my dry hair.  It has been a constant battle to retain moisture in my hair and I am always having to add product by mid day.  This product does exactly what it promises and keeps my hair moisturized all day. It is really thick and very difficult to get out and should probably be in a tub or jar instead of a bottle.  A little goes a long way.  I love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a creamy leave in conditioner for my tightly coiled chem free hair, to add to my regular weekly shampoo regimen.  I don&#x27;t like spray leave ins and thought this might add to the moisture and soften..I think my hair just doesn&#x27;t like shea butter.  I&#x27;ve tried a few shea butter products, and outside of my shampoo that I LOVE...most shea butter products leave my hair feeling stiff as if there is too much product on my hair.  So, I won&#x27;t purchase this again..and I think the shipping is a bit much too.  With that said, if you love shea butter, this is VERY rich and heavy and might be for you.  it DOES SMELL GREAT!! I actually had to add water to it and that made a huge difference for me.  Over all..I like it for what its supposed to do, smells good, my hair just doesn&#x27;t respond well.  if anyone has any suggestions for a good cream based leave in...please let me know.    Kisses!!! xoxo</li>
    <li> I have fine, 2a wavy hair. Spreading just a dab of this leave-in through the ends of my hair really helps with frizz and static, especially in the winter. I also really like the smell. As others have said, it&#x27;s a sweet banana/coconut scent.  However, keep in mind that the claims on the bottle and product description are typical industry marketing gimmicks to get you to buy. Hair is dead. It is impossible to \\&quot;heal and repair\\&quot; something that is dead, so the added vitamins are not going to do anything. A lot of hair-care products like to make claims like this, but unfortunately damaged hair is not that simple to fix. If you have damaged hair, all you can do is get it cut off and let new hair grow in. Get the nutrients for strong, healthy looking hair from the foods you eat, not by slathering on hair products.  That said, it&#x27;s still a fine leave-in conditioner, and not a bad price. The ingredients are much better than most main-stream brands. I like to switch it up though, so I may or may not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have twin biracial daughters with two different curl types .This is the only product I have found to keep their curls moisturize and beautiful all day, and trust me I have tried many. With this product their curls don&#x27;t get frizzy and their hair is not greasy.  LOVE THIS STUFF. I spritz with water first,use product then seal with light oil sometimes.:-)</li>
    <li> I actually bought mine from a beauty supply store in my neighborhood, but it works great. It defines my natural 4a, coffee-stirrer sized curls, moisturizes, and stays for the whole day. It was recommended by the ladies at the forum in Naturallycurly.com. I used it with Fantasia IC gel and Long aid curl activator. Next day, all I do is reapply a little bit, and spray my homemade (jojoba oil, glycerin, and water) mixture all over my hair with a spray bottle.     Just make sure your hair likes Shea Butter, because for some people it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT my hair is so soft to the touch</li>
    <li> I became a product junkie looking for products that would soften my hair after washing because it would often get extremely dry and brittle, and nothing seemed to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL THE SEARCH IS OVER!!&lt;br /&gt;This product does wonders it makes your hair really soft and last over a period of time. I will definitely be purchasing more of this. Only thing is this is REALLY thick but it will definitely do the trick</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading rave reviews from Curly Nikki on her blog.  This product is really good.  A little goes a long way.  I used it after I washed and conditioned my hair.  I parted my hair in sections and applied to each section.  I braided my hair and let it air dry.  My hair was so soft once it dried.  This will be a product staple from now on.</li>
    <li> I love Shea Moisture&#x27;s products, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this particular leave in conditioner. I usually use leave in conditioner after my shampoos, followed by a little shea butter and IC Fantasia Gel. I think of leave in conditioners imparting moisture and softness to my hair. Shea Moisture&#x27;s leave-in isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like. In fact, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between using the shea butter/IC Fantasia Gel combination and this product.     The only advantage maybe, to using the Shea Moisture combo is that you get most of the active ingredients found in the shea/IC Gel combo in one jar(glycerin --a humectant, shea butter, coca butter and aloe vera gel) in one jar, as opposed to using two separate ones. That in itself can be time and money-saving for some. And it does have a terrific smell!    For my 4a/4b hair, I&#x27;ll still rely on Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot Today for easy detangling and optimal softness (this product is not sold at Amazon.com). I can immediately tell the difference when I put this leave in on my hair (and when it dries) compared to the Shea Moisture brand.    I gave this product three stars instead of two for several reasons. First, the ingredients are still good. Second, for some, it might be convenient to get all ingredients in one. Third, I still like many Shea Moisture brand products. Just not this product. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.    Ingredients: Shea Butter, Deionized Water, Herbal Complex, Panthenol, Centromonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cocoa Butter, Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love. Full of moisture!</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair a few days ago. The intent was to see if it would detangle her very thick and curly hair. While it wasn&#x27;t successful in that aspect, it has done wonders for her hair as a daily moisturizing agent. I apply as I am doing her hair in the morning and it keeps her hair shiny, moisturized, and in place all day. If you have very dry and coarse hair, this product is a must for you!</li>
    <li> This product smells good, however it leaves a coating on my 4A/4B curls. The leave in is so thick that I had to unscrew the top off and squeeze pretty hard for it to come out of the bottle. However it is not greasy but ,it did not help me retain moisture but made my hair feel a tad crunchy with a film. I gave it three stars because of the natural ingredients and smell. Maybe it will work for someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> didnt really provide much moisture; which is the only reason I purchased the shea mix instead of basic shea butter;</li>
    <li> Lovely delicious buttery creamy vanilla smell, nice creamy product, excellent for moisturizing my hair without making it look oily. I focus on moisturizing my ends, then other parts of my hair. It gives my hair a beautiful, soft, moisturizing feel and look. Love that it does NOT have a bunch of bad chemicals in it! Thanks for offering this! I plan to repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars because when i putthe product in my hair it left a white film on my hair. After about 5 minutes the product actually penetrated into my hair shaft and left it insanely SOFT! I used this product after doing my aphoogee protein treatment. It made my hair feel wonderful. I will be buying more of this leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> It took a little while for this product to actually penetrate my hair, but when it finally did my hair remained moisturized for an entire day. I use this as a leave-in sometimes, but I like it more as a moisturizer on dry hair... I think it penetrates more that way. But yeah, this is definitely a keeper. It&#x27;s not exactly amazing (compared to my other moisturizers) but it gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy. A little goes a looong way here.</li>
    <li> I generally love Shea Moisture products. I use their curl mousse, deep moisture masque, moisturizing lotion, moisturizing spray, shampoo and conditioner. Having said that, the leave-in conditioner didn&#x27;t work for me. I love the smell and the texture, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my hair. I use it as part of my LOC routine, but the conditioner dries in large, visible white flakes that make my hair look dirty when I JUST washed. I tried three different times with the same result regardless of the quantity I used (lots, a quarter size, a dime size, etc.). Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll have to try something else.</li>
    <li> My number 1 all time favorite conditioner.  I have been using this product for 7 years and have not strayed from it yet.  It is thick and rich. My hair is always soft</li>
    <li> I was looking for a leave-in condish that was all natural, with shea butter &amp; wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily. I have very fine type 4B hair that&#x27;s relaxed. This is one of the best leav-in moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s very thick which I like and smells great! And best of all it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine relaxed hair down. I use this as a daily moisturizer and I love it! Makes my hair soft &amp; very moistuized. This works well for african american relaxed hair, I found this in my local beauty supply store &amp; I brough 3 at once because like the others said, it can be hard to find in stores. Overally, great product &amp; I would def recommend this product! :-)</li>
    <li> Product came exactly as ordered. It was in perfect condition, and it arrived quickly. Will definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have been using shea moisture hair products since March/April time frame and I absolutely love their products!  I go between the Raw Shea Butter line, the African Black Soap line, and I use the Curl Enhancing Smoothie as well.  There is only product that I know for sure that I will not buy from them again (Curl Hibiscus Spray), but I recently decided to try this leave conditioner.  I have used twice so far and all I can it is the best moisturizer ever!  It softens my strands without build up and it stays soft!  This works even better than the smoothie and I love that it is all natural with limited ingredients.  I have been telling my natural friends all about this product.  This is a must try and a must buy!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a great smell, however it is thick if you plan on leaving it on the hair as recommended.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to write a brief review. This conditioner is really well on my natural hair.  It leaves it pretty soft and manageable all throughout the day.  This is fabulous for the ladies that like to wear the \\&quot;Wash &amp; Go\\&quot; style because after applying water to the hair and then putting this conditioner on it the effect is really nice! When I started using this on my edges, which let&#x27;s be honest are not always easy for us natural sisters to maintain, my hair didn&#x27;t even need a headband to cover up those roots!  They actually made the natural curl pattern have a nice wet look to it.  This conditioner really penetrates the hair. I am a customer for life.  I am so proud of my edges and my hair after this stuff is applied. The Shea Moisture line has never failed me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of thsi product!&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I wish this came in a bigger size, I would definitely buy it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about two months since I&#x27;ve had this, and I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly to preserve it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a creamy, thick...cream that goes on so well and rubs in fairly quickly. Works well with other products and lends a healthy glow and bounciness to hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have 4a-b hair and its so wonderful! It makes my hair feel so light and airy, in fact when I wear my fro out with this shea Butter in, the wind and breeze blows my hair around, it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
    <li> can someone tell me if this contains any kind of alcohol? or parabens?im looking for something all natural,if this does contain alcohol,does anyone have any suggestions to alcohol free products?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. But it&#x27;s a little pricey for the size. But it is great for detangling. However it comes up short when it comes to moisturizing my hair. My hair does not feel soft, it feels a little dry the day after. But it&#x27;s better than the moisturizer I used so far. Still on the quest for the right moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all about the ingredients. Nothing added but what you need. May be a bit thick for people with thinner hair but for everyone with thick lions mane like me then this is a great product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like you put residual product in your hair. Big fan.</li>
    <li> The only thing that keeps my daughters hair from being tanglely and helps her curls!! Also has a very nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the regular conditioner too</li>
    <li> This is a good leave in product because it has natural ingredients and the first ingredient is Shea Butter. I have course hair and I typically use all natural hair oils. It is heavy so I tend to use it the week that I am going to shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> I want to love this stuff and I do, but the only con to this stuff is sometimes It leaves white flakes that lok like small dandruff and I have to take a damp towel and wipe some of it. Other than that it is very moisturizing for my 4c hair and makes it soft and it&#x27;s not greasy. It is thick so put the bottle upside down so it&#x27;s easier to get out, it is almost as thick as Aubrey organics conditioners. I used qhemet biologics leave in and it was wonderful but expensive this is a great alternative and  it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  I will probably repurchase, but still look for something that doesn&#x27;t leave the residue.</li>
    <li> My go to before this was kinky curly knot today. I happen to see this and my inner product junkie decided to try it.  I love...hair is soft, its really thick and can be hard to get out of the bottle, but a little goes a long way.  Since it has some great natural oils I put this on damp hair and I\\&quot;m done. Great for detangling.  No greasy feeling after using it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER.  I HAVE 4B/4C HAIR AND SOME PRODUCTS I CAN PUT IN MY HAIR IT JUST SUCKS THE MOISTURIZER UP AND STILL LOOKS DRY.  THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT FOR MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> A little thick the leave in. It has a great smell and I am excited to see what effects it will have on my  hair. I am a black woman with natural hair. I am using it as a part of my Kimmaytube&#x27;s leave in conditioner, so we will see!!!</li>
    <li> I love this. It smell good and strengthens my hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product.  Hair felt and smelled great.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, however it does not moisturize my hair as much as I thought it would. That said, I do like the lightness of it because I do not want anything oily or greasey and this is not. I also love the fact that it is a leave in conditioner. I will continue to use this product until I find something that has more moisture, but is not oily or greasey.</li>
    <li> Best product for hair I&#x27;ve used in years. Love the way it curls, strengthens and gives body to my hair.</li>
    <li> I guess this stuff detangles fine but, for something \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, it stinks to high heaven. It has the strongest fake cherry scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled. Just horrible. Had to wash my pillow cases to get rid of the super strong smell.</li>
    <li> I have used this product recently and I must say that in this cold weather, my hair feels great! I like to keep it simple. I have been natural for about 5 years, and I have used all the products under the sun that appear to be all natural. This product stands out among the best! It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and it has all of the ingredients in it that my hair needs. The ingredients are all natural, and safe for my hair. I also tested the pH, and it is at around 5 (very good).  I use it along with some more essential oils for my scalp, and it makes my hair very shiny and soft. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews I read. In my opinion its a good product, one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it flakes sometimes which causes build. I have natural 4b hair so washing can be a hassle sometimes, especially when its out of routine. I&#x27;ve learned to only use this product on a braid out or twist out to avoid flaking. This product leaves my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized for days at a time and it dramatically reduces frizz. Maybe I&#x27;m at fault but this product is not for a wash n go but I would recommend it. Btw it smells good too :?)</li>
    <li> Wish it was cheaper, but it definitely works.</li>
    <li> I got this product because my grandson has very curly hair that is simply gorgeous. Unfortunately, it was a nightmare to brush in the morning and after nap, plus would look rather dry and frizzed at the end of the day. I simply apply a small amount of this product to his hair after a shampoo and it stays in for a couple of days. The hair just needs a light misting with water and the tangles comb out easily. It doesn&#x27;t leave his hair looking oily and he no longer looks frizzy, even after nap! Yayy!</li>
    <li> good product left my 4c hair super moisturized ..smells really good is very thick so i mix with water then apply to hair</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter, however I am heart broken that this product did not work for me. Yes it did moisturize and detangled my curly thick hair, but at the price of having dandruff the next day. I really really wanted this product to work, but unforgivably my scalp was not having it. I have many other Shea butter items in my hair regime so I was completely surprised how I had so much dandruff with this product. (This has nothing to do with the seller..my item came perfectly fine.)</li>
    <li> This is great for when your hair is at a medium or long length. My hair takes this product in well and it leaves it moisturized for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> Did not provide the results as expected, made hair dry and left buildup.</li>
    <li> Works well on my kids hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for the past year and I absolutly love it!!! It makes my hair sooooo soft. I like to apply it at night before I go to bed and wrap my hair. When I wake up in the morning its so soft. The smell is wonderful too. I highly recommend this product!!! Its great for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I put it in my baby&#x27;s long curly hair after washing, and it made the daily brushings noticeably easier! I then diluted a bit of the conditioner with water and put it in the spray bottle to use on my straight very long hair to help with detangling. It works great too! I find the smell a bit too strong, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Great leave but shea moisture have other great leave ins now such as shea moisture coconut and hibiscus, extra moisture, Jamaican castor oil and yucca boabob. Shea moisture have great products.</li>
    <li> Maybe my taste has changed since the first time I used this product. It&#x27;s a little greasier than I remembered but I do believed I liked that before. This is more for once or twice a week usage instead of a daily like I used to. But I will order it again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the pitfalls, delivery was fast and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> This is not only good for naturals... It is good for relaxed hair. I have not had a relaxer in five months, but it works well for the straight hair. It leaves my hair soft and nourished. And it smells good. Not like shea butter... more like a fruity smell. I would recommend this to anyone with African/African American hair.</li>
    <li> This leave in is AMAZING!!! My hair is color treated, thick &amp; dry!! My hair loves this conditioner it absorbs very well &amp; my Denmen brush glides through easily!! Must have!!</li>
    <li> If you go natural with you hair this is the product to buy. However it should work on weaves too. Don&#x27;t wait get moisturizer  Can&#x27;t live without it. Get it right now homies!!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair so soft and moist. It is thick and worth the money. It is affordable and I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> my hair was very dry after coloring n shampooing .. This helped me so much. It works great !!</li>
    <li> I have coarse wavy hair that never seems to have that smooth moisturized look even after running a flat iron thru it.  Until I tried this!!  I finally have a smooth finish with nice healthy ends.  My only caution - a little goes a long way.  I used too much my first time and it looked a bit greasy.  Now I just use a bit and focus it on the bottom half of my hair.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is increadible!  I use it daily to style my natural hair. . . .which is more curly than nappy.  It&#x27;s not too oily, but it is THICK so I suggest you leave the bottle inverted on your counter or in the cupboard. I have experienced NO oily build up on my hair in between washings while using this product. I have been looking for this conditioner since I 1st used at my sister&#x27;s house. Kudos to the seller for making this product available for purchase on Amazon!  It is impossible to find this leave-in conditioner ANYWHERE in a beauty supply store!</li>
    <li> My 4b/c hair loves this stuff, this is probably the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my hair super soft and moisturized all day. I work in a very hot, humid environment so it is hard to believe my hair is this soft. Usually when I wear my hair in a bun, I add an edge control to my edges, but for this leave in conditioner all I do is wet my edges, mix this product with a little bit of eccostyler gel and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> LOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT. MY HAIR IS SO SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my locks. Made them soft and smelled great.  Enough product to moisturizer for a month and a half.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read about this product, but detest waiting for new products to arrive to try out (I  like to wear my new shoes out the store), so I&#x27;d been procrastinating on ordering it from a hair products site. After placing an order for several items on Amazon, it occurred to me that I could also order the conditioner and wait for all of my new toys at the same time. Anyway ... it was worth the wait. As other reviews have mentioned, the product is very thick, so it requires thinning with the palms of your hands before applying. I was pleasantly surprised by the slight hold it gave my curls after drying, making it a good wash and go styler, if I don&#x27;t want a very defined look. I&#x27;ve also been using it for soft-hold twist-outs. Because of the thickness, it&#x27;s not as easily absorbed as I like my leave-ins, but I also use it as a styling product, which I don&#x27;t do with others. I also like the fact that it has a mild scent.</li>
    <li> I use this when my hair is wet, and it&#x27;s amaaaazing. I tried it on dry hair, it was just meh. Not bad, but it didn&#x27;t do the job as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3c/4a combination hair, and I need moisturizing almost all the time. It doesn&#x27;t give me hold, so I still have to put in a gel, but for you, maybe it will work. Makes my hair smell fantastic, and I like using it in combination with leave-in hair conditioner and coconut oil. Makes my hair really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing, I wish it came in bigger containers! But it&#x27;s affordable so I just buy more than one. I guess it&#x27;s easier to store two smaller containers than just one bulky one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 28 2014: Okay so I&#x27;ve been using it every other day, and now that my hair is getting more moisturized it has a hold, and it stays nice and soft. No more gel for me! Updated from 4 to 5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It makes my hair feel so very soft! I highly recommend to anyone! and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Smell is terrible.  I think it was old and got a rancid odor.</li>
    <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a nickel sized amount of this product on damp hair, smoothing it in well, then follow with a dab of coconut oil. Doing this gives instant shine/sheen to the hair, and I believe the dampness helps spread the product well. It seems to melt into my hair with no problems, no film, and no flakiness. The moisturizing properties of this, however, only lasts for 1-2 days at best. I currently alternate this leave in with another one I own, only because I&#x27;m trying to use them both up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like bubble gum to me. It&#x27;s a pretty loud scent, too, which unfortunately is common of all Shea Moisture products and something I truly dislike about the line. It is thick and creamy, and the more you use it the more you have to shake the bottle to get it out. I don&#x27;t think that the bottle is practical for when you&#x27;re almost out of product. When it&#x27;s low I might have to dilute it with water in order to get the last bit out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well for me for a day or two but in saying that, I don&#x27;t think it is a hair necessity for me. I also think it is overpriced and difficult to find. I can only buy it from the African shop locally or here on amazon for $10-12. Also, thick hair like myself has to use a lot of product, and since it doesn&#x27;t fully moisturize you have to use it more often, so one will run out of product fairly quickly. I think if it were priced $5-8 it would be much more worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of these reasons I give the product an overall 3/5.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for hair. Keeps hair smelling great too. One of my favorite brand of shea butter product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Words cant describe how much I LOVE this product!I use this product EVERYDAY.  I wash  my hair everyday and afterwards put the Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave In Conditioner in with another product while my hair is dripping wet and it makes my hair feel soft and manageable.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if this product is ever discontinued!  I LOVE IT SO!</li>
    <li> I noticed a change already! Having natural hair isn&#x27;t as hard as people say. You just have to stick with it and find the right product. I can&#x27;t quite tell what type of hair I have, I know its in the 4 realm, but this made it super soft on the first try! I also purchased Motions Naturally You, Define My Curls and Hydrate My Curls. I used both last night and my curls are looking great!</li>
    <li> I love this!! I have thick and course hair.  The other watery leave-ins do nothing for my hair, but this product keep my hair soft and touchable.</li>
    <li> this is really good my curls are more defined and since I have a 4c hair texture that can be very hard to acheive but this product realy moisturizes, And smells amazing will buy more</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time it&#x27;s wonderful for curly hair. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I absoultely, positively, love this product. It is the best thing that has ever happened to my hair. First just let me explain that I had relaxed, coarse, dry, brittle hair. Notice the use of the word \\&quot;had\\&quot;. This product is my new found baby. It makes my hair soft and silky. I clipped my ends the day before I put it in and still have no new split ends to date.(by the way split ends were a chronic problem for my hair) This stuff smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling coated. I am surely going to buy the rest of this line of products. My hair loves this stuff. I have been using it apporximately three months and cant wait to get my relaxer to see all my new growth.( i relax every 12 weeks) If you have any issues with dry hair I suggest you give it a try. I promise you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
    <li> This product really didn&#x27;t do well with my hair. For the price it cost I expected it to do something, but it did nothing. I was trying to use other shea butter leave in conditioners just to try it out in my hair, besides the normal cantu shea butter that I usually use on my hair. Thus, my hair is like 4b through out and in only in the back of my head and front middle portions are 4a-3c hair type. Nevertheless, this product did well in those sections of my hair but didn nothing for the more cottony, thicker parts. I will not be purchasing this product again. I only tried it as an experiment. I will continue to stick with Cantu Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully on my biracial sons&#x27; curls so that I can comb through them!  I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well.  One son has course hair and the other fine ringlets.  This product allows me to comb out the ringlets and finger through the more course locks easily.  I love the Shea Moisture line of products for their hair.</li>
    <li> This Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioner is amazing.  It really defines my curls and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles of the Shea Butter.  Disappointed...did not work...  I have very dry hair.  Applied it as directed, but did not do anything.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described, prompt delivery and well-packaged!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Shea Moisture but this leave in was disappointing. It&#x27;s so thick that its difficult to dispense from the bottle. I got frizzy but soft hair with this product. I combined it with my fav gel and didn&#x27;t achieve my usual definition (I have thick curly hair) but Im sure it&#x27;ll be fine for people doing twist outs etc., I can definitely see now why its not sold with their products in stores.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is the best thing I have found for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I also bought the remington tangle tamer and with this conditioner, tangles come right out.  This conditioner is the perfect moisture balance...not too heavy or too light.  Great smell and I plan to use this for life!!!!!</li>
    <li> After spending way to much money trying difference products and still ending up with hard dry hair, I stumbled upon this product on YouTube. It leaves my hair soooooooo soft, nothing else has even come close. I love it so much, I just ordered another bottle. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got a recommendation of this product from reading Her Best Hair blog.  Tia said this leave-in was a great investment. Well, I have tried it and I too agree.  Just like she mentioned in her blog it was thick, creamy and gave my tresses all the moisture it needed.  It also smells yummy. Plus, you really don&#x27;t have to use much with this product. I took a half dollar size amount and I mixed it with Aloe Vera gel.  That will absolutely make it stretch. For the price it is definately worth a try.</li>
    <li> Expensive for the amount of product you get and the product is just ok. Nothing spectacular. I do love this brand though and some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This thing  really works for my 4C dry hair</li>
    <li> My hair looked a mess with this conditioner.  I had no curl definition.  I gave this product away to my sister.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have a horrible time with my hair especially in the winter months and in hot, humid seasons: my hair was either frizzy or full of static cling...so basically my hair was an unmanagable mess all the time.  This really helped me.  I only need a tiny bit and comb in, and it helps my hair stay in place, no frizz and no weird static cling.  I hardly need any hair spray either which is nice because before I would have to cake it on in order to tame it.  This dries really nice and makes my hair feel soft and managable.  It&#x27;s great for me because it&#x27;s fast and easy to use and I just quickly run it through my hair in the mornings.  This makes me so happy because finally I can run my hands through my hair and it&#x27;s soft and not full of hair spray product, which would keep it hard and brittle feeling.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t fully review this because she is too lazy and I have to hound her down to put it on her hair. But when I do, i can most definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have 4a natural hair and it has taken me months to find a leave in conditioner that would moisturize my hair without leaving it sticky. I can go a day or two without moisturizing. My hair is so soft. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that the product is hard to get out. You have to shake it real hard in order to get the product out.</li>
    <li> I am always confused on hair type but i am probably whatever the highest 4 rating would be. My hair is very tightly coiled and is very difficult to add true moisture to it without having it feel coated or sticky. My hair is also fine eventhough so tightly coiled so finding the right products can be a challenge. This produce makes my hair so very silky soft. It doesnt feel oily, sticky, dry or crunchy. it makes it soft, touchable and very, very managable. My hair is a little shorter than shoulder lenghth and i am able to come through it with ease with this product. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really soft</li>
    <li> get this product if you have dry natural hair, it really works! have not had much luck with leave in conditioners until I tried this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  I mix with my oils and it is perfect.  Have been using for years.  Can&#x27;t stop.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I actually stopped using it for a good while until I got desperate and decided to use it again to help style and moisturize my hair. It did restore the moisture in my hairafter I had made the mistake of using a shampoo that stripped my hair dry. Nice scent. It&#x27;s just too thick (especially to be packaged in a,bottle rather than a jar). It would leave a white residue in my hair because it&#x27;s too thick. Had to add water to half the bottle to get it to be more useful and manageable.</li>
    <li> Este leave solo me lo puedo poner en la punta del pelo por que si me lo pongo en el resto me lo engrasa, aparte de eso huele como a goma de mascar y bastante fuerte.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TO SAY THIS PRODUCT IS ACTUALLY GOOD ,IT DETANGLES VERY WELL, IT MOISTURIZES GREAT, IT MAKES MY HAIR SOFT BUT IT MAKES MY HAIR LOOK DULL AND DRY, SO I ADD GRAPESEED OIL AND COCONUT OIL AND SOME WATER WITH A LITTLE OF THIS CONDITIONER  IN A SPRAY BOTTLE AND THAT SEEMS TO HELP AS FAR AS LOOKING MOISTURIZED. .(I SPRAY MY SCALP AND HAIR RUB IN, IT&#x27;S EASIER THIS WAY FOR ME).</li>
    <li> great stuff ..it soften the hair.good texture. i would recommend to a friend.worth the money... good product. i would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister who has thick and straight hair about 6\\&quot; below shoulder level. She first used on damp hair but no improvement. Then on dry hair but never looked as expected. No smoothness. According to reviews, it should look good on thick hair but I feel her hair is worse than before after using this product. I really do not know whether the quantity she applies is not enough but she uses about 1-2 teaspoonfuls at a time and twice a week. Can anyone suggest what has gone wrong?</li>
    <li> I started a new hair regiment and in the past 2 months my hair is looking and feeling AMAZING. I give partial credit to my leave-in conditioner. Since I started using my hair feels so much softer and moisturized! Thanks to this product I can air dry my hair without it tangling up and over drying. I am rocking my twists, afros, and other natural styles like nobody&#x27;s business lol.  This is what I want to use for my daughters&#x27; hair when I have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;1 year later and I am still in love with this product. Just ordered a bottle for my younger sister today :-)</li>
    <li> The scent is divine, and it leaves my 4b/c hair smooth and soft. I will buy it again. It&#x27;s now my staple leave-in.</li>
    <li> Shea moisture can&#x27;t do no wrong in my eyes</li>
    <li> Different hair takes different to products. When i first received this product i was excited to try it. when i got it and tried it for the first time, i liked it . It smells like bananas and coconuts. when i put it in my hair and let it sit in my hair by the end of the day it was a bit dry. my hair just needs more moisture than others. will i purchase this again ? NO. theres more products out there that do better than what this does. i&#x27;ll continue to make my own concoctions. :) lol</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I use shea butter on my skin and in my hair so when I see a product with She in it, I must try it. I can&#x27;t really explain why it did not work for me. The product smells great and pretty thick which is what I look for in a leave in, but when I used it a few times I had no luck.</li>
    <li> This stuff is SO THICK I can&#x27;t even squeeze it out of the bottle....LOL</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the product, it came w/in a reasonable amt of time, but as everyone as says def hard to squeeze out the bottle--I use this for my 4c hair--twist out, flat out, braid out and bantu knots--natural for the past 4yrs--I actually use the whole line of Shea products for my hair..I just love the whole line itself, but this was on product tht the store never sold or had--so of course I decided to look on Amazon and BOOM their it was.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for those with dry hair!!  I use it as a deep conditioner and as a leave in.  It leaves my hair soft!!</li>
    <li> I love that the conditioner contains all natural ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair but overall, it&#x27;s ok!!!!</li>
    <li> Its a lot thicker than I expected, almost like a heavy cream. I do love it because it is extremely moisturizing and has my hair feeling really soft and I have natural, thick, 4b curly hair. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger once the hair dries. I&#x27;d probably purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to love this product but i don&#x27;t. It smells amazing but that&#x27;s about it, it does absolutely nothing for my hair, nothing. so i ended up just using it to make my hair smell good on days I needed to wash my hair but wouldn&#x27;t have time and I wear a hat at work due to working with food, so no one would really see my hair anyway.</li>
    <li> this stuff works so good to lock in moisture it last for days.</li>
    <li> I can easily say this is a good product. It does the job as far as moisturize but you have to keep at it. Nevertheless i am African and my mane is course and thick, so i have a line of products including this to keep the rawness of my mane fresh. Does the job on a 6/10 scale for me. Personally speaking.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it. I have tried almost everything. Because of menopause my hair was dry and brittle at the crown. I tried all sorts of products including leaving in conditioner. My hair has totally transformed. I buy a lot of  products on Amazon and rarely leave a review but I did on this one because I figured lots of women are dealing with this and our hair is our crown of beauty. I will be ordering two more bottles today. This along with DHT blocker will restore my hair. My hair has not broken since I&#x27;ve used it!.</li>
    <li> I have tried many leave ins and recently started using Shea Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner because it works wonders on my 2c3a curly hair. It needs the extra moisture and seems to really love Shea butter. After using this leave in, my curls were in beautiful soft clump of curls. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a lot of the moisture. Smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Shea Moisture.</li>
    <li> I love all Shea Moisture products and this one is no different..Great leave in conditioner especially for natural hair.  Smells nice and a little goes a long way..Wish it came in bigger size.</li>
    <li> Love this in my hair made it soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> Idk. I was excited when I received it but as I was rubbing it in my hands to put it in my hair there were white hard particles in it. Plus it leaves a white residue so you have to rub It in really good. I can&#x27;t say if it actually did anything for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I normally use either Kinky Curly KT or the Shea Moisture Raw Restorative condish available at Target as my leave ins. Like both, but neither does much for detangling. This condish made detangling a breeze, it went very quick &amp; easy. It is super thick &amp; hard to get out of bottle but the results are worth it. I&#x27;m a 4b natural, this stuff made my hair very soft, it melts into the hair. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly! I have only been able to use it once since I received it (yesterday). I did use it in conjunction with another product so I cannot attest to what it does on it&#x27;s own but my hair was very soft when I took down my twist out the next day.</li>
    <li> This product not only makes your hair feel wonderful, it smells GREAT!! It is thick too so a little goes a long way. I love it!! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my curly hair.  Keeps it manageable and shiny.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and always come back</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so silky and smooth, the smell is wonderfully fragrant but not overwhelming, It is not a heavy product at all. Perfect for my 4c hair which needs all of the moisture it can take. I buy several every few months as a little goes a long ways. Definitely a must buy for all of those thirsty curly haired heads looking for a product to provide smooth and shine.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is great for the TWA that needs a fresh scent, moisture, and defined curls. Please use another product to define the curl. To finish my look I use &#x27;shea moisture smoothie&#x27; and &#x27;taliah wajiid curl sealer&#x27;. All these products are available through AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I have way too much hair. I wish products like these came in large bulk containers. These little 5 ounce and 8 ounce bottles aint cuttin it.</li>
    <li> I am African American and I have natural 4b/c hair. Love love love this product on it. It makes it so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> i like the way this product feels on my natural hair, the order came really fast, I will order again.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this leave in conditioner is way too heavy .  It weights my hair down.  Prop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very!!! !!!! Heavy !</li>
    <li> Very thick and makes my hair smell nice</li>
    <li> I thought this product was a bit pricey but I suffer from dry hair so I was willing to try it. This is my first time trying a shea moisture product and I am pleased. My hair felt so soft after using this and it continues to work almost 2 months later. This leave in also smells good. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Smells good left my afro textured hair moisturized for a while great for mixed textures tho.</li>
    <li> Very Moisturizing. Good for ladies with hair that dries out easily!</li>
    <li> I got allergic reaction when I used Shea Moisture Organic &amp; Aloe Thikening Growth Milk because it has Grape seed oil.Grape seed oil has so many side effects, I&#x27;d like grape seed oil to be eliminated from the formula.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Where have this product been all my life! This leave in conditiner worked well on dry strands. My hair is richly moisturized and feels great.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, but the only problem is that the leave-in is really thick. The type of botte that it is in makes it very hard to squeeze out and it becomes a little time consuming. Other than that, the leave-in mositurizes well and locks in moisture for a long use.</li>
    <li> Love it! It makes my hair so soft and moist. Also it smells delicious!! Its perfect for my natural hair. Even though it is creamy and have white residue, it soak in hair pretty quickly</li>
    <li> It smells really good but it does not moisturize my hair well.  I will use once i grow more natural hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on the review of a naturalista on YouTube (napturallycurly).  I don&#x27;t pay much attention to hair types, but I&#x27;d say my hair is a mixture of the 4s.  I love the way it smelled but didn&#x27;t like it straight from the bottle (much too much too thick).  I then tried it with my \\&quot;Kimmaytube\\&quot; leave-in conditioner and it works GREAT!  The aloe vera juice and oils make it a little bit thinner - but its still thicker than the leave-in I used with Giovanni&#x27;s conditioner.  I only have to use it once or twice a week at the most.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s sold here on amazon, but I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> maybe my hair is protein sensitive but this leave in made my hair tangled but its decent.</li>
    <li> A lot of people love this as a leave in, but it didn&#x27;t really do much for me. It seems to be too thick, and it seems like I have to use more than I would like.</li>
    <li> Good Ingredients and all great product but this expires in a couple months!!</li>
    <li> This product smells great and makes my hair soft and manageable. I have ordered product again and highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is hard to find.  I used it one time and then could not find it anymore.  I liked it so much that I kept the bottle. Unlike most leave conditioners that are water based this one is not and this one reason why I like it.  Your hair is already wet so this oil based helps to lock in the moisture.</li>
    <li> it is a good conditioner a little to thick for me and hard to get it all out of the bottle but u could just add water and shake it up to get the rest out, look for Organic conditioners and a filtered shower head for a true clean and healthy experience for your hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product leaves hair soft. I would recommend to others. It&#x27;s thick and smells really good. Great product for dry hair.</li>
    <li> If you like shea moisture products then you will love this. I love how soft my hair feels. It keeps moisture but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this leave-in on my natural 4b/4c hair. I really like the texture and the smell. Also, I find that the ingredients work for my hair type. When I have used this product on my damp hair, it dried fuzzy and a little crisper than I liked and I had to add olive oil or camelia oil to reseal my ends. However, when I want to hydrate my tresses in the morning before work, this leave-in works great. So, I would recommend using it on dry hair or freshly spritzed hair as opposed to hair that has just been washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave a film on the hair at all and absorbs pretty well. But, if you have extremely dry hair, like me, you will need to add something to it to get a moisturizing effect that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product along with many of the other Shea Moisture products. I only knocked it down a star because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be thick or saturating enough for extremely dense or coarse hair after a thorough washing.</li>
    <li> Love it so much.  Will be a part of my routine!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and how it moisturizes my hair. The product does however leave white residual. overtime, I have come to know how to overcome that, I just extra rub my hair and after about 2-3 hours, my hair looks ok. I have 4c hair type and therefore, moisture and softness is extra important and this product does just that. I have tried many and nothing worked better like this. I must say it is annoying trying to get the lotion out of the bottle. They could have just use an open container!</li>
    <li> Just started using it!!! It&#x27;s Okay...</li>
    <li> I use this Leave in Conditioner as the cream in my L.O.C method to moisturizing my natural hair. It keeps my hair shiny and healthy and i can definetly see a negitive change when i go too long without it. I&#x27;ve been ordering it for months now. It has a mild smell and a white creamy feel to it. So glad my mother encouraged me to try it.</li>
    <li> I got this because I was looking for a leave in conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t leave a build-up. Unfortunately this product is horrible at leaving a buildup in my hair &amp; doesn&#x27;t absorb very well. However, it is very good if you are doing your own pedicures; it leaves the skin on my feet after a pedicure very soft &amp; smooth. Who would&#x27;ve thought using a leave in conditioner for pedicure lotion?!</li>
    <li> Online is the only place that I can find this leave-in. It works great on my hair. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells good. It makes my usually dry and sometimes brittle hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that it is really thick and doesn&#x27;t easily come out of the bottle. Different bottling/packaging would be more user friendly.</li>
    <li> great product, It made my hair soft and you can use it everyday a little goes along way and If you like volume on that hair after a twist out this will give it to you!!!</li>
    <li> Hola hola!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im a Dominican Girl that just go natural 1 month ago. I did my big chop on July 27th, 2012 and from then my journey for moustorizer began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week has been really crazy triyng so many diferent products, until I found Shea Butter leave in. I bought it on August 2nd and the first day I didnt like it, it felt so thick on my hand and I just put it asida. Last week, I try this product for the first time and OMG my hear is getting so soft and moistourize that now im using this leaving everysingle day. I need to wait a couple more week to see the really efect of this product but so far is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: I just spray my short hair in the morning with a little bit of filter water, apply the shea butter leave in and seal the hair with my favourite olive oil :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you have veeeeeeery dry hair, like mine that sometimes feel like a carpet, you can give it a try, and not only once but a few time so you can see the diferent results. It is what im doing now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps!&lt;br /&gt;Stephany</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days. Very thick compared to other squeeze bottle products. The aroma is delicious (for lack of a better term). My hair feels \\&quot;sturdier\\&quot; and seems to remain in place as in fewer if any \\&quot;fly always\\&quot; or stray hairs doing their own thing. I&#x27;m African American. My girlfriend is Chinese and loves this product as well. I actually returned to Amazon to order her a bottle. She has silky black waist length hair where I have short coarse hair yet we both are enjoying this product. I&#x27;ve used two other Shea Butter products before but this one seems to be of better quality. There may be others that are better suited for various hair types but eventually you have to decide which one is worth taking a chance on. This one is definitely worth a try. Due to the recent drop in temperature running the heat in my house dries out my scalp which then leads to itching. My hope is this product will help to keep my scalp \\&quot;less dry\\&quot; as well as my hair. Jury is still out on the scalp aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the thickness I place this product one step below a paste one would normally find in a jar vs a squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If need be I may try heating the cream to make it less thick before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When nearing empty I plan to cut the bottle open to access the remaining cream that I imagine will not make its way to the squeeze port. However, submerging the bottle in hot water for a few minutes may also do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I remember to do so I&#x27;ll update this write up after I&#x27;ve used the product for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice daily and I am ejoying the results. My hair feels softer than it has in the past and there is zero residue from this product. My scalp does still itch a little but no where nearly as bad as it normally itches during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp no longer itches after prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 5/20/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has become my favorite conditioner! I will keep my rating at 4 Stars only because I have not been exposed to enough variety to compare this product too. I have tried a few other conditioners before but not enough to claim this is the best one out there for the price. I think it is but I defer to those with more experience than myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now store the bottle either completely upside down or at least angled down toward the cap because of the thickness of the cream. Seems to work.</li>
    <li> I am an African American female with course hair.  This did a super job at moisturizing my hair!  I will certainly use it for many yrs and buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love this product, its thick, and can be used everyday.  I&#x27;ve tried other leave in conditioners and this is the best.  You won&#x27;t be disapponted.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner ever. I heard this conditioner was being discontinued so I have been stocking up. It leaves my hair soft, detangled and naturally curly!</li>
    <li> I placed the order on 12/1/2012 and it arrived today 12/4/2012. I had ordered 1 bottle a week ago and it worked wonders on my natural type 4b hair. It has just enough emollients without making my hair to oily/greasy and weighed-down. I was originally using a product from  \\&quot;As I Am - Naturally\\&quot; - but it didn&#x27;t have enough oil for my hair type. Both product lines are excellent - you just have to try different products to see which works for your hair. It is  not a one-size-fits all kind of situation.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel worse leaving it in.  Even with using the slightest amount. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell either.</li>
    <li> So if you don&#x27;t have the full SM line then you may have a problem with this product. And this is coming from someone who loves SM products. I did A SM protein treatment before using this leave in conditioner and my hair was already dry and this conditioner gave me no moisture at all !!!!!! My hair was completely striped and the next day after drying it was really flaky. So it needed to be rewashed. I got this product because I saw it  used in a YouTube video that combined this product,castor oil, and another leave in conditioner which seemed to make a really good leave in treatment. (video will be linked below) [...] While this is just my opinion I still love there products you just have to find a way to make them work for your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff and I need it because it is so dry where I live. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells wonderful and make my hair super soft. I put it in right after a wash and then later in the week for extra moisture. Its not thick and not watery however if you put too much in it does leave product in. so you either have to really rub it into your hair/scalp or eye how much you need. But I am def ordering more!!</li>
    <li> Great product i use it on my daugther as well.  I use to mix multiple oils and creams after a wash, this product contains all in one plus!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for those that are trying to go from relaxer to a natural.This was my problem before i bought it ,my hair was comming out by the hand full from being over proessed ,dry and very damaged,i found this stuff at target one day and bought the whole line for dry damange hair ,,,i got more then what i was looking for ,the next day after one shampoo and leave in. i went to comb my hair and no breskage i was amazed .women who have relaxed their hair all know the problems we face when we try to let it grow out,but with shea moisture my problem was sloved ..i love this stuff</li>
    <li> I bought this to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; my hair. After years of using henna (because I&#x27;m a hair donor and cannot use chemical dyes), my hair has become rough, gnarly, &amp;#34;like piano wire&amp;#34; (according to a friend), and basically untouchable. I stopped using henna and started using another chemical-free dye; so far so good as far as that goes... but I needed something to LEAVE IN to help my hair to soften, look and feel touchable, and above all... HELP ME WITH FRIZZ and help my beautiful spiral curls have the &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; they used to have. Right now, they only have &amp;#34;uggggh&amp;#34;, no &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used this after my bi-weekly washing. I can&#x27;t just wash and go (no curly-girl can), so I put my hair into my usual braided updo. Next day, unfurled the hair, combed out... was HOPING that this stuff would do something with my curls and also, feel SOFT. Well, it didn&#x27;t. Felt kinda sticky and rough and left a weird film on my hands. I tried it again w/ the next wash, used LESS product - because &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; as so many on here have said! It worked a LITTLE better; my curls looked more natural and my hair felt softer. But that feeling didn&#x27;t last long. It weighed my hair down and my hair still felt rough (that weird film).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it because it SMELLS MARVELOUS (hubby was freebasing my hair all night on this stuff; he adores the smell, and so do I). And because I adore Shea Moisture&#x27;s products - I use their shampoo and conditioner, which is why I turned to them for a leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just my hair being a turd due to overuse of henna (maybe my cuticle is too rough and I need a super exotic $5,000 conditioner before THIS conditioner will work? Who knows?)... because I adore Shea Moisture so much! If my hair stops being a turd and this indeed turns out to be a 5-star, and my piano wire rough weird hair becomes soft and beautiful and touchable again... I&#x27;ll be back...</li>
    <li> I thought that I loved this product, but after about a month, a horrible itchy sensation took over my scalp. An ACV mixed with tea tree and water rinse was required to restore my scalp. I discontinued use immediately.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using shea moisture and so far I really like it. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and my hair does not shed like it use to.</li>
    <li> I love Shea moisture products. The shea butter is very moisturizing.  Its very thick and creamy and smells so good...Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Product leaves my hair so soft.  My hair is much more manageable now.  love the feel of my hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Shea Moisture.  I wish it was sold in stores.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying....I have the most nappiest most kinky hair anyone could ever have, it doesn;t get any worst than my hair, I&#x27;m Jamaican American and I have a medium afro du. I have used a few products these past few months and I finally researched whats good for natural hair after having so many products make my hair more dry and brittle and unmanageable I came to this leave in conditioner, Dr. Miracles leave in conditioner destroyed my texture and made my hair hard to manage but this one was great, I washed it with the Shea Butter Shampoo plus Conditioner and After wards put this stuff and did two stand twist, woke up this morning and undid twist and let&#x27;s just say it stretched my curls, made them soft and manageable and my hair feels so good! I love this product, yes it&#x27;s alittle pricey but well worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I heard great reviews so I decided to try. For my hair, as well as my child&#x27;s hair, it didn&#x27;t do much, if anything. Our hair actually feels very dry after using the product. We both have hair fine, curly hair.</li>
    <li> The smell is great! It does wonders to my hair. Defines my curls and my hair easily absorbs it. I love it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> product came on time.  when used with coconut oil, it provides a good moisture base for the eco styler styling gel.  hair is well moisturized and has a nice sheen-would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this as shea butter is so moisturizing, but it is so heavy it is unusable. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This was creamy and rich, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair and it leaves me a bit itchy</li>
    <li> Anything by SheaMoisture is great!</li>
    <li> After I applied it to my skin it took awhile for it to soak in but it left my skin feeling very very soft and it locked in the moisture.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it much, my hair still tangles</li>
    <li> Loooooveeee it a thousand times!!!!! Love the smell and the way it leaves my hair!! I am going to buy anpther one really soon. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly - not Afro hair but as close as a white woman can get to Afro hair. It&#x27;s also dry, color-treated, frizzy, gray (without the color-treatment), so I&#x27;m in a constant battle to keep it moisture and under control. Very expensive hair, in other words. I can&#x27;t just walk into a drug store and buy the shelf stuff. Plus, I try to use as many products as possible without all the nasty chemicals and paraben and preservatives, etc. This meets all my criteria and works. It adds plenty of moisture. Those of you who don&#x27;t have my problem hair, tho, might not be as happy. It IS shea butter-based and if your hair tends toward oily or even normal, you will probably look like your hair&#x27;s greasy. My hair can absorb a LOT of moisture and never show greasiness.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it is not on any of the store shelves in my area.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> The final step in my Shea Moisture routine. It does a wonderful job of controlling frizzies &amp; moisturizing chemically treated hair.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product at all.  I didn&#x27;t find it moisturizing at all to my thick, mid-back length, natural 3c - 4a african American hair. Disappointed that I have another product that didn&#x27;t work as promised to try and use up.</li>
    <li> First time using this product really really love the smell. And yes I will purchase again, love the way my hair feels with it</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Product review: Smells like heaven! But I&#x27;m still not impressed by this product. I have dry, category 4 type hair. It did nothing to hydrate or detangle. I found if I used it with tons of water, it will somewhat soften but not worth trying again :-( Disappointed because I really wanted this to be my staple.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this conditioner left my hair shiny and moisturized - that&#x27;s the good news. The bad news is that the scent is overpowering - like all day overpowering. It actually gave me a headache. If this company would make an unscented conditioner, I&#x27;d buy it, but until then I&#x27;m sticking with Mixed Chicks.</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a curly hair and I LOVE this leave-in (&amp; all other shea moisture products); just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
    <li> the bottle is a bit hard so it&#x27;s a bit taxing to squeeze the product out but i guess its good for my biceps lol lol. it smells great tho.</li>
    <li> This product is all natural and does a great job nourishing my hair. From others&#x27; experience, this product doesn&#x27;t do well with longer hair becasue it makes the hair tangled.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Shea Moisture products (skin &amp; hair)  and was really happy to find this leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products. I have natural afro textured hair and need to seal in the moisture to keep my hair moisturized. This product leaves white residue when mixed with oils.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product for my 2b hair that tames frizz and defines waves. This product worked ok for me when I used the right amount. Too little and my hair was still frizzy, too much and my hair was weighed down. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell either, so I will continue looking.</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t feel like this is a leave in conditioner with the residue and what not. It just doesn&#x27;t feel like an actual conditioner. It seems to make my hair somewhat softer but not much. I think it just depends on what type of hair your have and mine is 3c mixed with 4a I think.</li>
    <li> This is very rich and thick.  My hair loves it!  I wish I can find this product at my local beauty supply store, but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves your hair feeling soft, light, and moisturized without it being too oily. Love the fact that it&#x27;s an all natural product and doesn&#x27;t strip nutrients away from your hair. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
