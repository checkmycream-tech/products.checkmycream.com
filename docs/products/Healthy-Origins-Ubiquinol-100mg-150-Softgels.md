<li> my cardiovascular health-heart-energy etc.-I believe that has helped and improved my kidney blood test results that seem to have gone bad when I went on statin drugs for my high cholesterol as some are saying that statin drugs reduce coq10 levels in the body and have adverse effects on the kidneys/bad kidney blood test results which I am a believer in!!!</li>

<li> Ubiquinol is a recommended supplement to take to offset the effects of statins medications - which are not necessarily good for you.  </li>

    <li> This is an amazing product for better health.  The top of the line of CoQ10 products offered out there.  I have&lt;br /&gt;MVP and have had angina and other palpitations etc from it.  This product eliminates all those symptoms.  And if you are on Statin drugs this product is a must!</li>
    <li> Best Stuff Ever.  If you take statins and are over 40, read up on this stuff and use it.  You will have more energy, honest!</li>
    <li> Seems to help us. I like that it&#x27;s GMO free.</li>
    <li> Several years ago our doctor advised that we take Ubiquinol... I have Lupus and it has great reviews for well over 20 years and it also is highly recommended for keeping your heart healthy..  This pills are easy to swallow and very easy to order on Amazon, not to mention the price is great.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this forever and will continue to do so.  Great price for the ubiquinol version.  I do test my levels so i know it works.</li>
    <li> My husband takes this supplement and he is very pleased with the results.  He has more energy and feels better.  Buying through Amazon is great.  It saves a lot of time by just ordering online. We are very pleased.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine.  But they&#x27;ve stored it wrong or something, because all the capsules have gotten stuck together.  You have to take something like a screwdriver to get them apart.  This is the 3rd bottle I&#x27;ve gotten like this, so I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Order was as expected on time.</li>
    <li> It took forever to receive this product so don&#x27;t order it from this supplier if you are in any sort of a rush.  Otherwise it seems ok.  Maybe a little pricey but I expected to receive it sooner. I would not order again from this place.</li>
    <li> Excellent brand and I appreciate that they carry more than 60 capsules meaning I don&#x27;t have to order so often.</li>
    <li> Ubiquinol is a recommended supplement to take to offset the effects of statins medications - which are not necessarily good for you.  Research them on line. But, if one is prescribed a statin drug for cholesterol, ubiquinol is the recommended supplement. Better CoQ10.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick and with no problems.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for some time now two years? something like that I would say.  Works great if you have sinuses that get congested in winter. Take it twice a day and it clears me up.  I of course take it for the cardio healing qualities.</li>
    <li> My husband takes a statin and ubiquinol is important to supplement especially for him, and it seems to help his lab numbers.  I like what&#x27;s IN the added ingredients as well as what IS NOT.  Healthy Origins is a great brand and a semi-reasonable price. So glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> Ubiquinol is, from my point of view, a step-up from Co-Q-10. Healthy Origins 100 mg.,150 softgels though expensive for me is a good product and as long as I&#x27;m able, I will buy it. This Ubiquinol is a great help to my asthma problems and is good for many other physical maladies. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and it seems to be a good product. I have not used it long enough to tell if it will do me any good</li>
    <li> Great ubiquinol, better absorbed than standard CoQ10. Easy to swallow gel caps &amp; best price I found. Prime shipping is a big plus!</li>
    <li> Great product which has helped lower my LDL count below 100.</li>
    <li> This product one of the more healthier Ubiquinol products on the market....natural and soy free. A great economy price makes this product very competitive.</li>
    <li> Works wonders ! Essential for Senior Citizens.</li>
    <li> This high strength ubiquinol was recommended by a nutritionist friend to help with high cholesterol.&lt;br /&gt;Very good value when bought in bulk from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for about a month and I think is a good product even though I can not really feel a difference.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TOO!  BEST PRODUCT I CAN FIND FOR THE MONEY!</li>
    <li> Healthy Origins CO Q10 user....found the whole Ubiquinol vs Ubiquione comparison confusing as I have taken Kaneka CO Q10 for many years.  Here is an article written by Meghan Lyons MS, from Nature Made, that cleared up much of the confusion for me;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Nature Made, we are always engaged with the conversations people are having about CoQ10, and have taken particular notice to one that is causing quite a bit of confusion: the ubiquinone vs. ubiquinol debate. Recently, some people have been describing ubiquinone—the form of CoQ10 that has been available for years—as inferior now that a new form, ubiquinol, has emerged. We’ve seen a lot of conflicting and misleading information on this debate and hope to shed a little light on the real story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Quick Review of CoQ10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a fat-soluble nutrient produced naturally by our bodies. Found in every cell in the body, CoQ10 is concentrated in organs that require the most energy — such as the heart, liver, muscles and kidneys. CoQ10 is concentrated in these organs because it is essential to the process of producing cellular energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ubiquinone vs. Ubiquinol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the body, CoQ10 exists either in its oxidized form, ubiquinone, or in its reduced form, ubiquinol. When oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone) is used by the body, it transforms and becomes ubiquinol. In the same way, reduced CoQ10 (ubiquinol) becomes ubiquinone when it carries out its role in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To better understand how this works, let’s take a look at CoQ10 and cellular energy production. CoQ10 is found inside the powerhouses of the cell called the mitochondria, the site where energy production occurs. It acts as an electron acceptor or donor in the chain of reactions that lead to energy production. When oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone) accepts an electron from another molecule in the chain, it becomes reduced (ubiquinol) and when reduced CoQ10 (ubiquinol) donates an electron, it becomes oxidized (ubiquinone). Maintaining this state of equilibrium is how the body benefits from CoQ10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoQ10 Supplements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of what form of CoQ10 you take as a supplement, the body is able to convert the consumed form to the other form as needed. In other words, if you take a reduced CoQ10 supplement (ubiquinol), the body can convert the reduced CoQ10 (ubiquinol) to the oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone) and vice versa. This conversion takes place to maintain a state of equilibrium between reduced CoQ10 (ubiquinol) and oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unquestionably, both forms—ubiquinone and ubiquinol—are effective and essential to important pathways in the body, and in states of need, either form can be reduced or oxidized to form the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you purchase CoQ10 keep the following points in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Both CoQ10 forms—ubiquinone and ubiquinol—are important, effective and do great things for your body&lt;br /&gt;• The body is extremely intelligent and is capable of turning one form of CoQ10 into the other as needed&lt;br /&gt;• Feel great that you are choosing such a important supplement for your health&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: http://www.naturemade.com/resource-center/articles-and-videos/heart-health/understanding-coq10-ubiquinone-vs-ubiquinol#sthash.dyeCAAQS.dpufxidized (ubiquinone).

    <li> If you want this product in any reasonable time, do not order from this Amazon supplier. First, they took 6 days to ship the product. At this point I was given an invalid tracking number. It took them 4 days to respond to this issue. At this point they gave me a new tracking number for the product that was shipped that same day (10 days after the initial order). It is now 12 days since the original order and I still haven&#x27;t received the package. I would never buy from this Amazon supplier again.</li>
    <li> I believe a great product (the already &#x27;advanced useable&#x27; form of coq10) for my cardiovascular health-heart-energy etc.-I believe that has helped and improved my kidney blood test results that seem to have gone bad when I went on statin drugs for my high cholesterol as some are saying that statin drugs reduce coq10 levels in the body and have adverse effects on the kidneys/bad kidney blood test results which I am a believer in!!!</li>
    <li> Soy-free products can be so hard to find - this is a great item with zero soy.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be of very good quality as much as you can tell from just taking a supplement.  I am out and need to reorder now.</li>
    <li> This is a good brand and Consumer Lab rated this high.  I only get this if I can get it on sale because it is so expensive.</li>
    <li> I seem more alert and memory is better, don&#x27;t know if it effects BP or anything else but this product has gotten great reviews elswhere</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and find it satisfactory.</li>
    <li> We live in a small town with high prices and not much of a selection so I appreciate the wide variety of products and brands offered through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great for heart health as well as gum health...a must for those over 40!  Ubiquinol is far superior to ubiquinone.</li>
    <li> I just feel a lot better when I&#x27;m taking this item. It is very easy to swallow. I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
    <li> Excellent health benefits</li>
    <li> Good product has received, thank you amazon</li>
    <li> This product has supplied an efficient and easy way to maintain the recommended levels of CoQ10 in the liver while taking statin drugs for high LDL cholesterol. Thus far my lab test results have come back indicating that there has been no deterioration of my liver function after three months of taking statin drugs. The packaging insuring the safety of the product was excellent and it arrived on the date promised by Amazon.</li>
    <li> Found to be one of the best brands of Ubiquinol.</li>
