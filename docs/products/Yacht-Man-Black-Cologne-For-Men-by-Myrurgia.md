      <li>Enjoy and happy sniffing.</li>
      <li>nice scent but does not last...quickly evaporates.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nice quality.</li>
      <li>NICE LOVE</li>
      <li>The Red version, for me, is the best.  </li>
      <li>it is an aphrodisiac :) you will love this on your man.</li>
      <li>There are others that may be better for you</li>
      <li>i will buy more for him just so i can sniff him all day.:)</li>
      <li>I am 100% satisfied from the seller</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really recommend it to anyone who wants the best perfume and you will like it to have that</li>
      <li>better buy those cheap perfumes from the convinient stores..</li>
      <li>bottle looks cheap .</li>
      <li>No bad good for after a shower but not as strong as the red bottle.recommend for a night smell after a shower.</li>
      <li>is right!</li>
      <li>It lasts a very long time and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>the scent doesn&#x27;t fade too quickly either.</li>
      <li>I also ordered the YM Red and that smells pretty good</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!.I would recommend this cologne for everybody!!</li>
      <li>It is a nice smell,  but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
      <li>Nice scent I brought the Red and Metal..</li>
      <li>Smell very good and last a long time</li>
      <li>Nice dark scent at a fantastic price.</li>
      <li>THIS WOULD BE VERY PERFERT!..</li>
      <li>I will spend more money on name brands next time.</li>
      <li>Light not heavy but may experience spray/pump issues with aggressive use.</li>
      <li>After trying Yacht Man Red, I expected to like more of the EDT&#x27;s in their line, but this makes me doubt it and not want to buy more.</li>
      <li>If you want an inexpensive cologne and need something that will fade in 30 minutes or less - or want something to use as a light car air freshener - this would be fine.  </li>
      <li>Each is very distinctive and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I did like Black better than Red because it was slightly more masculine when I could smell it.  </li>
      <li>sprays better than Black.  </li>
      <li>have the blue and red also, both are nice but same quality.</li>
      <li>pleasant, container tough to open.  </li>
      <li>price is very low and the quality is very high.</li>
      <li>Buying the whole set cost less than the cologne I had been using, so I was willing to take a chance.  </li>
      <li>this spray smells good but is does not last that long I like calone that last all day and this one does not it only last half the day</li>
      <li>If you want a more complex and manly scent, grab a bottle of Yacht Man Blue or Metal.</li>
      <li>I own all of the yachtman collection and this ranks in at number 2 behind Yachtman Red.</li>
      <li>Not a bad scent - less cloying on me than the Yacht Man Red -</li>
      <li>There simply wasn&#x27;t enough of the herbal notes to give it any kind of oomph on me - Red, at least, will stay with you for a few hours, even if I don&#x27;t really dig the fruity scent of Red.  </li>
      <li>last as long as the high priced&lt;br /&gt;stuff</li>
      <li>It is hard to beat this scent for such a super low price.</li>

<li> The price is certainly right at less than $10, but it has little or no fragrance.  </li>
<li> What is there in the form of scent does not last long at all.</li>
<li> but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
<li> order five different items of yacht man at the same time and all same waste of money</li>
<li> I bought the Yacht Man black and also the blue.  </li>
<li> It is presented in the heavy glass canister flask with flip-top lid just like the entire collection.</li>
<li> I like ALL of the other Yacht Man</li>
<li> The scent of Black is so mild that it is hard to discern while it&#x27;s still wet on the skin, and within minutes after applying, it&#x27;s difficult to detect it at all.  </li>
<li> Sillage is average and longevity is 4-5 hours for a couple sprays.</li>
<li> I agree with what some of the reviewers had to say about Yacht Man Black.  </li>
<li> Black Yacht Man Toilette Spray&lt;br</li>
<li> now the black.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s less expensive than a lot of other similar colognes and</li>
<li> , it is like sprying water and it is a waste of money</li>
<li> - don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> However it is very weak can barely smell it.  </li>
<li> This smells absolutely horrible and I strongly recommend against purchasing it.</li>
<li> so now I hardly ware it at all.</li>
<li> smell was so bad</li>
<li> It smells horrible (like tin-water and bug spray).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Stuffs great price too all man</li>
    <li> It literally has no scent - maybe a bit of OFF! bug spray but that&#x27;s it - don&#x27;t waste your money.  I also ordered the YM Red and that smells pretty good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I will spend more money on name brands next time.</li>
    <li> It is a nice smell,  but it doesn&#x27;t last all day. I am amazed by the price.</li>
    <li> otimo product I recommend.</li>
    <li> this spray smells good but is does not last that long I like calone that last all day and this one does not it only last half the day and then you can not smell it at all so now I hardly ware it at all.</li>
    <li> Great addition to the Yacht Man Family of scents. Light not heavy but may experience spray/pump issues with aggressive use.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne quite a bit. It&#x27;s less expensive than a lot of other similar colognes and the scent doesn&#x27;t fade too quickly either.</li>
    <li> Nice scent I brought the Red and Metal..now the black.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the high priced&lt;br /&gt;stuff or it would be 5 stars. Makes a&lt;br /&gt;really great gift that doesn&#x27;t cost a&lt;br /&gt;fortune.</li>
    <li> Good smelling inexpensive cologne.  There are others that may be better for you but it is neutral enough that anyone can where it</li>
    <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last even a minute. i do not like it at all, it is like sprying water and it is a waste of money</li>
    <li> I agree with what some of the reviewers had to say about Yacht Man Black.  The price is certainly right at less than $10, but it has little or no fragrance.  I wanted to buy a cologne that didn&#x27;t bankrupt me, and not knowing what any of the Yacht Man colognes smelled like, I bought one of each.  Buying the whole set cost less than the cologne I had been using, so I was willing to take a chance.  I like ALL of the other Yacht Man sprays better than Black.  The scent of Black is so mild that it is hard to discern while it&#x27;s still wet on the skin, and within minutes after applying, it&#x27;s difficult to detect it at all.  The Red version, for me, is the best.  It lasts a very long time and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really recommend it to anyone who wants the best perfume and you will like it to have that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my Purchase of Myrurgia  Black Yacht Man Toilette Spray&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Very Satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> severely affecting my health&lt;br /&gt;Please contact the provider&lt;br /&gt;ASK&lt;br /&gt;at this moment that product I&lt;br /&gt;produced&lt;br /&gt;fever, shortness of breath&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Scent wont even last for an hour..better buy those cheap perfumes from the convinient stores..order five different items of yacht man at the same time and all same waste of money..dont buy!</li>
    <li> It smell good but you have to use a lot in order to smell it, and the scent do not last.</li>
    <li> nice scent but does not last...quickly evaporates.&lt;br /&gt;I have the blue and red also, both are nice but same quality.</li>
    <li> pleasant, container tough to open.  Thanks</li>
    <li> It smells horrible (like tin-water and bug spray). After trying Yacht Man Red, I expected to like more of the EDT&#x27;s in their line, but this makes me doubt it and not want to buy more. This smells absolutely horrible and I strongly recommend against purchasing it. Get Red instead.</li>
    <li> I did not like the perfume is a good perfume and I did not I recommend to friends and  family and friends</li>
    <li> It was a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> No bad good for after a shower but not as strong as the red bottle.recommend for a night smell after a shower.</li>
    <li> it is an aphrodisiac :) you will love this on your man. coy oh boy. i will buy more for him just so i can sniff him all day.:)</li>
    <li> Was one of the worste I ever bought&lt;br /&gt;The smell was so bad&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to not pay this proucdet</li>
    <li> Smell very good and last a long time</li>
    <li> its fragrance is not mu good</li>
    <li> Nice quality. I am 100% satisfied from the seller</li>
    <li> I like it! Nice bottle, Good item for good prize!!! Fast delivery!.I would recommend this cologne for everybody!! Ans I have to add that size is right!</li>
    <li> I have the entire set. Each is very distinctive and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very low and the quality is very high.</li>
    <li> Not a bad scent - less cloying on me than the Yacht Man Red - but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  There simply wasn&#x27;t enough of the herbal notes to give it any kind of oomph on me - Red, at least, will stay with you for a few hours, even if I don&#x27;t really dig the fruity scent of Red.  I did like Black better than Red because it was slightly more masculine when I could smell it.  If you want an inexpensive cologne and need something that will fade in 30 minutes or less - or want something to use as a light car air freshener - this would be fine.  If you want a more complex and manly scent, grab a bottle of Yacht Man Blue or Metal.</li>
    <li> i like it very good buy</li>
    <li> The Price was good. But it smells like rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks cheap . I&#x27;m not at all pleased! Rip off</li>
    <li> Notes of basil, thyme, lily, iris and a touch of woody pepper. Nice dark scent at a fantastic price. I own all of the yachtman collection and this ranks in at number 2 behind Yachtman Red. Sillage is average and longevity is 4-5 hours for a couple sprays.It is presented in the heavy glass canister flask with flip-top lid just like the entire collection. It is hard to beat this scent for such a super low price. Enjoy and happy sniffing.</li>
    <li> Fragrance was good.  Dispensing bottle did not work. Had to transfer to another bottle.  The same happenedhappened WIT the second bottle.</li>
    <li> FOR THE PRICE AND FOR A GIFT TO A FRIEND OR RELATIVE THIS WOULD BE VERY PERFERT!..i GOT THIS FOR A RELATIVE AND HE LOVED IT!!</li>
    <li> Smells great! My husband loved it.</li>
    <li> This is going to be a Christmas gift - but I like the smell when I&#x27;ve seen it in a store!</li>
    <li> I bought the Yacht Man black and also the blue.  I like the scent.  However it is very weak can barely smell it.  What is there in the form of scent does not last long at all.</li>
    <li> I like this smell !!!!</li>
    <li> The scent is almost unbearable. In addition upon opening the box the plastic lid and spray tip were off and in the box. I know it isn&#x27;t however it appears to be used.</li>
    <li> NICE LOVE THE SMELL I WEAR THIS ONE TO WORK ALWAYS</li>
