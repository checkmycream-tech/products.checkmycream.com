<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 6 months but I don&#x27;t see any improvement to my under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Used for years. Best product fond</li>
    <li> Work good. I use it at night.  Not the best stuff though</li>
    <li> Feels good going on and the bottle lasts along time, but I cannot really say I had any positive results with this product.</li>
    <li> Apply this just before sleeping and if your results are like mine you&#x27;ll see a noticeable reduction of puffiness under the eyes by morning. The results weren&#x27;t easy to see the first two or three times I tried the serum. Since then it has worked great. I&#x27;ll be continuing to use this product, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> I am not seeing a lot of results after a couple of weeks, so I&#x27;m not yet sold on this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, helps with lines, wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
    <li> Great product for men who have wrinkles and dark circles under their eyes...it dies have to be used every day for best results.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and leaves a cool feeling. A little goes a long way. This should last you for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for 3 months now and zero results</li>
    <li> Only Clarins for Men will do. I have tried the rest and this is the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok as a moisturizer but it didn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles or bags.  Not buying again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and much more reasonably priced than similar products.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well with Clarins Men&#x27;s eye line reducer.</li>
    <li> Reduction of bags around eye is noticeable. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Seems to tighten the skin so I guess it&#x27;s working.  Things have been a bit hectic here so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it as regularly as I want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of natural solutions however I have found this to be the best in removing fine lines.</li>
    <li> It is a piece of awesome. Not too oily and not stinging. Moist for a whole day. I like it.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working very well.  No dramatic changes, but feels good going on and keep my eyes from drying out between applications. (This review written by Bun&#x27;s Husband)</li>
    <li> Great for dark and tired circles, buy it, great product..</li>
    <li> I just finished using it and I didn&#x27;t see any difference. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommended for that reason. You can give it a try, it might work for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks.  I&#x27;m checking it out.  It appears to be helpful.  I&#x27;ll continue using it.  Thanks, Nick</li>
    <li> Good product - still looking for something else</li>
