      <li>Excellent product, perfect to use in the tanning beds.  </li>
      <li>Does what they are supposed to and very happy with purchase.</li>

      <li>: sun tanning is a great way to make vitamin D. stay healthy!</li>
      <li>I got bright neon coral colored ones.</li>
      <li>Comes with no protective case, otherwise a good product.</li>
      <li>good product and price</li>
      <li>But whatever, they get the job done and are a good size and shape.</li>
      <li>Love these for sitting in the sun!</li>
      <li>We both attached our own elastic cord, and BOTH broke when we put them on at the tanning salon.</li>
      <li>easy to use too!  </li>
      <li>So if they would allow you to chose color I wouldn&#x27;t have any complaints :)</li>
      <li>Pleased with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>I love these . . .</li>
      <li>Perhaps after more use the plastic on the nose will soften a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great price</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to choose the color</li>
      <li>comes with elastic to tie on, can fit to your own head.</li>
      <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The product is as described, and works fine.  </li>
      <li>they seems to work fine</li>
      <li>Black would have been absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>They dig in to my eye sockets and I haven&#x27;t found a way to adjust them that will make them comfortable.  </li>
      <li>However, these just didn&#x27;t fit my face.</li>
      <li>The elastic is cheap and you have to tie it on yourself.</li>
      <li>Because of the color ORANGE any light feels like your eyes are being cooked.</li>
      <li>The goggles light up</li>
      <li>I bought these to use with a handheld LED light therapy skin tool.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t conform to your face and uv light enters in from the sides putting your eyes at risk. .</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get to pick my color, they sent my neon orange, which I thought looked kinda cool...</li>
      <li>a orange flash light is being held against your eye, If these were black they would work great.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much !</li>
      <li>Normally these are sold in a plastic box (case) but for the $ savings, no box is ok.</li>
      <li>it doesnt fit very well, hurts the side os your head if you force it..</li>
      <li>Nice basic goggles to help protect your eyes.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning.</li>
      <li>so you cant purchase it alone but its worth it</li>
      <li>does the job and is exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>First, they pinched my nose bridge.  </li>
      <li>except they came to me in a fluorescent orange color, which makes too much light for my sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in the least bit sensitive to bright light but with these on, I couldn&#x27;t stand the brightness.</li>
      <li>They are okay, the green doesn&#x27;t seem to block the light out very well though.</li>
      <li>thanks Buddy</li>
      <li>The neon orange actually brightens the light in the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>Very disatisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>seem to keep the light out while doing a facial but still need to put cotton pads underneath.</li>
      <li>and I got the really cute neon pink ones, but they are so bright once in the beds that their worse than not having any at all.</li>
      <li>I ended up wrapping mine with duct tape to keep the light out, they are a bit bulkier now but at least they&#x27;re usable and they don&#x27;t magnify the light anymore.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these to anyone using standing tanning beds.</li>
      <li>They work fine for blocking out the tanning rays, my only complaint is that the bridge of the nose isn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
      <li>The Eye Shields were fine but arrived in a package covered in pink stuff.  </li>
      <li>wondeful even though they are pink i have sayed money and they work fine</li>
      <li>It is what it says it is, Works great, haven&#x27;t gone color blind yet from using them in the tanning bed</li>
      <li>There is nothing fantastic about them, just your average tanning goggles.</li>
      <li>Work ok as a shield, but the bridge is too small for my face.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t fit on eyes without holding down</li>
      <li>A had called other places for these goggles and was told I would need to  buy a full case if I wanted them, but.</li>
      <li>Whoever designed these, CLEARLY didn&#x27;t use them.</li>
      <li>I got these in blue, a totally normal color, and had no problems attaching the string or anything.  </li>
      <li>was earlier than expected :) and what i had ordered, same as the more expensive goggles..</li>

<li> I got these in blue, a totally normal color, and had no problems attaching the string or anything.  </li>
<li> was earlier than expected :) and what i had ordered, same as the more expensive goggles..</li>
<li> I got these at a random color selection, I got hot pink, which was what I really wanted.</li>
<li> I guess the only thing I was not a fan of was you can&#x27;t pick your color-me of course wanting pink.</li>
<li> It comes undone soemtimes if you don&#x27;t knot it tight enough.</li>
<li> Even with my eyes closed</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a guy and got pink</li>
<li> It is such stiff plastic, that it hurts my face when its tight.</li>
<li> it was worse than looking directly at the sun.</li>
<li> Maybe a dried pink lotion.  </li>
<li> I managed to bend the plastic to make the nose bridge wider, but then they wouldn&#x27;t stay down on the outer edge of my eyes unless I tightened the string so much they dug into my eye sockets (extremely uncomfortable).  </li>
<li> They do protect and they keep down the sunglasses look by not making you look like a raccoon after tanning.</li>
<li> I know they weren&#x27;t expensive, but I at least expected them to not break the first use.</li>
<li> This product does not block the sun unless it is really tight.</li>
<li> I now take thick cotton squares (like for makeup removal) and lay those over my eyes first (rendering the holes in these useless).</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to mess up tanning googles, my only complaint is they don&#x27;t come with the elastic band.</li>
<li> Of course, I got green.</li>
<li> Were a little too small, seemed like child size</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> They are also hard plastic and comes with tie on elastic.</li>
<li> I have used these goggles numerous times, and no matter what I do or how I wear these goggles, they are very uncomfortable for me across the bridge of my nose.</li>
<li> This was one of the less expensive one I could find.</li>
<li> They arrived broken.</li>
<li> These are hard plastic, they don&#x27;t bend to your face very uncomfortable.</li>
<li> This product is just useless...</li>
<li> oh well, it does say random color.</li>
<li> what can go wrong...</li>
<li> Without having the band fastened overly tight, these feel terrible.  </li>

    <li> Comes with no protective case, otherwise a good product.</li>
    <li> I got these in blue, a totally normal color, and had no problems attaching the string or anything.  However, these just didn&#x27;t fit my face. First, they pinched my nose bridge.  I managed to bend the plastic to make the nose bridge wider, but then they wouldn&#x27;t stay down on the outer edge of my eyes unless I tightened the string so much they dug into my eye sockets (extremely uncomfortable).  I ended up giving them to a friend with smaller features and she likes them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, perfect to use in the tanning beds.  easy to use too!  I highly recommend these to anyone using standing tanning beds.</li>
    <li> They are sun tan goggles. Good price, fast shipping. Wish I could pick a color. Of course, I got green. You do have to attach the elastic string yourself. Not a big deal. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> A had called other places for these goggles and was told I would need to  buy a full case if I wanted them, but. HERE I got what I wanted and they are great goggles thanks Buddy</li>
    <li> Because of the color ORANGE any light feels like your eyes are being cooked. The goggles light up and it&#x27;s like a orange flash light is being held against your eye, If these were black they would work great.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is, Works great, haven&#x27;t gone color blind yet from using them in the tanning bed</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t conform to your face and uv light enters in from the sides putting your eyes at risk. . Very disatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Work ok as a shield, but the bridge is too small for my face.</li>
    <li> Buy your tanning goggles from your tanning salon.  These are hard plastic, they don&#x27;t bend to your face very uncomfortable. They are now my back up pair just in case I misplace mine.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted received it in very short time.  Thank you very much !</li>
    <li> The product is as described, and works fine.  There is nothing fantastic about them, just your average tanning goggles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to mess up tanning googles, my only complaint is they don&#x27;t come with the elastic band. My gym only had stand up beds do I have to squint to keep them on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and got pink but oh well, it does say random color. They work fine for blocking out the tanning rays, my only complaint is that the bridge of the nose isn&#x27;t very comfortable. Perhaps after more use the plastic on the nose will soften a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I downgraded my review by two stars. I have used these goggles numerous times, and no matter what I do or how I wear these goggles, they are very uncomfortable for me across the bridge of my nose.</li>
    <li> all i can say is.. i wouldn&#x27;t have bought this in person</li>
    <li> This product is just useless... it doesnt fit very well, hurts the side os your head if you force it.. I used only once then threw it away. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> what can go wrong... they work in the sun and tanning booth.</li>
    <li> does the job and is exactly as described.  Pleased with this purchase.  Comes with elastic string not attached, so you can place it where it fits best.</li>
    <li> Normally these are sold in a plastic box (case) but for the $ savings, no box is ok. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: sun tanning is a great way to make vitamin D. stay healthy!</li>
    <li> good product and price</li>
    <li> I bought 2. One for me and one for a friend I went tanning with. We both attached our own elastic cord, and BOTH broke when we put them on at the tanning salon. I know they weren&#x27;t expensive, but I at least expected them to not break the first use.</li>
    <li> They arrived broken. It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning.</li>
    <li> I love these . . . except they came to me in a fluorescent orange color, which makes too much light for my sensitive eyes.  Black would have been absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price but I wasn&#x27;t able to choose the color and I got the really cute neon pink ones, but they are so bright once in the beds that their worse than not having any at all. So if they would allow you to chose color I wouldn&#x27;t have any complaints :)</li>
    <li> This product does not block the sun unless it is really tight. It is such stiff plastic, that it hurts my face when its tight.</li>
    <li> I got bright neon coral colored ones. comes with elastic to tie on, can fit to your own head. Blocks out rays from tanning beds.</li>
    <li> Love these for sitting in the sun!</li>
    <li> they seems to work fine</li>
    <li> seem to keep the light out while doing a facial but still need to put cotton pads underneath.</li>
    <li> The elastic is cheap and you have to tie it on yourself. It comes undone soemtimes if you don&#x27;t knot it tight enough. I would buy these again though.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These do what they are meant to do.</li>
    <li> wondeful even though they are pink i have sayed money and they work fine</li>
    <li> Were a little too small, seemed like child size</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for laying out at the beach, they are also for tanning but I don&#x27;t do tanning beds. I got these at a random color selection, I got hot pink, which was what I really wanted. They are also hard plastic and comes with tie on elastic.</li>
    <li> They are okay, the green doesn&#x27;t seem to block the light out very well though.</li>
    <li> was earlier than expected :) and what i had ordered, same as the more expensive goggles.. this is an add on item so you cant purchase it alone but its worth it</li>
    <li> Needed eye protection in tanning bed. This was one of the less expensive one I could find. Does what they are supposed to and very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fit on eyes without holding down</li>

    <li> The Eye Shields were fine but arrived in a package covered in pink stuff.  Maybe a dried pink lotion.  It was gross.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to pick my color, they sent my neon orange, which I thought looked kinda cool... UNTIL I used them in the tanning beds! Whoever designed these, CLEARLY didn&#x27;t use them. The neon orange actually brightens the light in the tanning bed. I&#x27;m not in the least bit sensitive to bright light but with these on, I couldn&#x27;t stand the brightness. Even with my eyes closed it was worse than looking directly at the sun. I couldn&#x27;t keep them on, I had to take the off. I ended up wrapping mine with duct tape to keep the light out, they are a bit bulkier now but at least they&#x27;re usable and they don&#x27;t magnify the light anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with a handheld LED light therapy skin tool.  Without having the band fastened overly tight, these feel terrible.
