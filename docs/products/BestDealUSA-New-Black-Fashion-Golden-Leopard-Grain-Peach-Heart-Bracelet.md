      <li>I am quite excited to give this to my daughter as a gift.</li>
      <li>A gift for someone special</li>
      <li>I was getting ready for church and decided to wear this bracelet and it wouldn&#x27;t fit around my around wrist..</li>
      <li>It was worth the amount that I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>Def worth what i paid</li>
      <li>The material is not what i expected but is good.</li>
      <li>It is fun and feminine.</li>
      <li>I recieved it pretty quick after placing my order.  </li>
      <li>right they twist on your wrist</li>
      <li>The price is right</li>
      <li>A lot like plastic, but what can you expect, right?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute, but the material was a lot different than I thought it was going to be.</li>
      <li>Its really pretty when you get it in the mail.</li>

      <li>The quality of the bracelet is not made very well.</li>
      <li>When i received this bracelet one of the charms fell off and caused the whole bracelet to break it couldn&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
      <li>so I only buy from sites that offer free or very low prices.</li>
      <li>Cute little bracelet !</li>
      <li>Looks a little cheap..like Dime store merchandise..but it is easy to wear.</li>

      <li>I was surprised when my package came in 8 days before it was supposed to.</li>
      <li>cute little bracelet a little tighter than my others also unique little bows if not put on</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s  been three months and I still haven&#x27;t gotten it. I was excited when I ordered it but disappointed when it hadn&#x27;t arrived in two months</li>
    <li> Hi To whom it may concern Its not that I hate this item this item is not for an aldut it do not fit around my wrist.  Is this item for a little girl?  Then it should be with the childen items.I was getting ready for church and decided to wear this bracelet and it wouldn&#x27;t fit around my around wrist..</li>
    <li> When i received this bracelet one of the charms fell off and caused the whole bracelet to break it couldn&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
    <li> I love it!! It is beautiful....super nice!!! however, as soon as put it on one of the hearts fell off!! I was able to paste back, so I&#x27;ll keep just because it is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Very cute and very affordable i would buy this again</li>
    <li> Cute little bracelet ! I love it ! It&#x27;s been a year or so that I bought it ! Hasn&#x27;t broke yet and hoping of course it won&#x27;t ! Hehe:-)</li>
    <li> I love the width of this bracelet ! I thought that it would be chunky and big, but it is not ! It&#x27;s thin and the charms are placed appropriately !</li>
    <li> Very delicate and rusts easily. Metal smell makes me nauseous</li>
    <li> It was beautiful but it was a little big! Wish there was an adjustable latch. But it looked similar to the picture.</li>
    <li> Item was a gift and m cousin loved it No problems what so ever :)  wish you guys could sell more like this.</li>
    <li> Cute bracelet, but you get what you pay for. This has to be the cheapest bracelet on the planet. If I could, I would give it no stars.</li>
    <li> It arrived a lot faster then i expected. The material is not what i expected but is good. It is made very poorly and all the charms look cheap. It is very light and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Very pretty charm bracelet! Fits great.. looks great my only problem ive had is that to fasten it you put the bar throw the circle and when i would put on a coat it sometimes would fall off.</li>
    <li> I was well pleased with this bracelet. Its really pretty when you get it in the mail. It looks better in person then it did on my computer.  I will buy more from this company.  kg</li>
    <li> Ok, yes it&#x27;s an inexpensive bracelet.It&#x27;s not supposed to be luxury quality. I&#x27;m rating it for what it is. It&#x27;s cute. Up close, yes it looks it&#x27;s price but if you just want something fun and cute than buy it and don&#x27;t give a **** what others think. It looks great next to my rose gold tone watch and it doesn&#x27;t make too much noise. It&#x27;s very lightweight and fits my average wrist.You can always hang it on a hanbag or keychain if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Very cute! The price is right and I enjoy wearing this makes a great gift Have A Great Day All!</li>

    <li> I had to wait almost a month and a half before I even got it. And when I finally got it in the mail it was already broken on one of the heart charms.
