### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>My hair &amp; scalp have NEVER felt this good!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave buildup, smells great, and is safer than the detanglers with lots of chemicals.</li>
      <li>It smells great, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
      <li>looking for a wholesome company who proudly use certified fair trade ingredients and support gender equality and community empowerment</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable, and doesn&#x27;t have stuff in it that isn&#x27;t good for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had really good experiences with alaffia before.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and gave it a good try.</li>
      <li>Made my hair shiny and cleaned also smells great love coconut</li>
      <li>Conditioning power is not that great - honestly I&#x27;m having better luck with diluted apple cider vinegar as a conditioner instead.  </li>
      <li>What can be better than that?!</li>
      <li>This worked AMAZING for my hair/scalp.</li>
      <li>Now I just use it to polish my boots (works great to buff out scratches and clean off dirt</li>
      <li>I enthusiastically recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for pleasantly scented light conditioning with no buildup nor toxic ingredients.</li>
      <li>Give it more than one chance and you will love it!</li>
      <li>Feeling obliged, I decided I should write a thorough review on how, when and why I fell in love with this amazing conditioner and serve this stuff the justice that it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Not getting better</li>
      <li>: I brush my hair before I shower, and then comb through it while i have conditioner in, but I couldn&#x27;t comb through this without creating more tangles.</li>
      <li>There are plenty of better choices out there.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I made sure to read reviews before I tried the product</li>
      <li>I also love the leave in curl conditoner that goes with this product line.</li>
      <li>I might have better results with my hair if I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner at all.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>It looks more shiny and all around feels better.</li>
      <li>It keeps my scalp healthy.</li>
      <li>Seriously, I love how this stuff smells.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to being able to feel my conditioners coating my hair, and with this one I can&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I concluded that I wanted to try one of their conditioners to see if I would be equally as pleased.</li>
      <li>This is a unique and amazing product.</li>
      <li>The price is higher hear on Amazon, but if I come across the conditioner at a good price again</li>
      <li>air dry my hair is beautiful!</li>
      <li>another reviewer mentioned, it rinses clean from my hair very easily</li>
      <li>When I first used this conditioner I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it.  </li>
      <li>If you are use to chemical based product on your hair, you may not like this because it will not lay on top of your hair the way you are familiar.</li>
      <li>I have curly, fine, 3c/4a hair (if you follow the hair typing system).  </li>
      <li>So my strands feel smooth and hold the water in my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair was shinier and frizz free.</li>
      <li>and there is where my eyes confirmed my hands.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this out.</li>
      <li>This product was the right combo of a good price and a product I could live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily I use light Moroccan Oil on my hair after a shower so that seemed to make up for the lack of conditioning.  </li>
      <li>You have to re-train your brain to not associate lather with how clean your hair is getting.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even able to do a decent job detangling with it (though I probably detangle easier with the Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish Spa conditioner, which is a great conditioner, and the kind of thick, creamy conditioner I&#x27;m used</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like much (because it has no artificial fragrances, which is good,) and it doesn&#x27;t look like much (no coloring either,)</li>
      <li>Coconut Super Hydrating Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Coconut Super Hydrating Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am definitely not pleased with their conditioner, but I did buy it with their body wash version, and that stuff is incredible.</li>
      <li>Normally I just have straight hair but with these products I get great natural waves!</li>
      <li>my hair soaks it all up, barely any left to rinse out and has a great light scent</li>
      <li>It was only a year ago when I chose to finally walk away from the chemicals for good, and I began seeking the optimum regimen to keep my curls soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I was used to more natural products and still had to work with this conditioner</li>
      <li>I skimmed through the ingredients and decided that it would be worth a try.</li>
      <li>This stuff, however, felt like it immediately absorbed into my hair and scalp, it went nowhere.</li>
      <li>Better than the natures gate jojoba system I first tried when I started switching over to natural</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing that I find fascinating about this conditioner is that, because it washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, my hair has started naturally curling.</li>
      <li>I end up with large clumps of hair on my comb or brush--even the day after I wash and condition!</li>
      <li>I also got this at the area health food store because I felt it was a good deal, especially since it is derived from all natural products.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent, and I love the rest of the Everyday Coconut line, but this was a dud for us.</li>
      <li>I bought it from my local organic grocery store, and fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>I had results after the first shampooing/conditioning.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was trying to avoid by going all-natural.</li>
      <li>I had tried many conditioners, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I learned about the importance of using paraben and silicone-free conditioners.</li>
      <li>It will not disappoint if you give it enough time to work its magic.  </li>
      <li>We all have varying hair types and so many combinations mixed with your scalp condition.</li>
      <li>I love the entire system.</li>
      <li>If you want your hair to smell nice, but don&#x27;t care if the conditioner you pay for has any other practical use, this may be the product for you.</li>
      <li>So I was perusing around Amazon, when suddenly I got the urge to see how much Amazon sold my absolute favorite hair product for.</li>
      <li>The first time i used this, I used a lot of it because it really felt like my hair was just soaking it up.</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy with this product &amp; highly recommend that you give it a try for at least a week or two before passing judgement.  </li>
      <li>Even though it may seem like a bargain in the large economy size, it takes a lot of conditioner to achieve nominal results.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve found that the Alafia Beautiful Curls leave-in conditioner, made by the same company under a different brand name, does the same thing).  </li>
      <li>I have loooong, thick, FINE hair, and I just couldn&#x27;t find something satisfying.</li>
      <li>I purchased it on sale at Whole Foods for about $6.99.  </li>
      <li>As much as I wanted to like this conditioner, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
      <li>and this doesn&#x27;t help me comb through it very well.</li>
      <li>You have to really spread it fast.</li>
      <li>I think both the shampoo and conditioner for this brand is very misunderstood.</li>
      <li>However, even in large amounts it doesn&#x27;t do much detangling, so for my family of people with thick, tangly hair, it doesn&#x27;t work very well, kind of defeats the purpose of using conditioner at all.</li>
      <li>I would use coconut oil to moisturize my hair at least once a week but could not find a shampoo or conditioner that would keep it soft, shiny &amp; (more importantly) keep my scalp from itching so much while in between moisturizings.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d tried making my own stuff in the past (vinegar,  baking soda, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, etc.)</li>
      <li>I say \\&quot;unique\\&quot; because it is very natural and pure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;One more thing, before I forget, one of the main things I like about this conditioner is that it lays my cuticle down.  </li>
      <li>had tried Shea Moisture previously and was insanely in love with their Purification Masque.</li>
      <li>me start by saying that I have incredibly thick, curly hair (picture the princess from Brave, but blonde)</li>
      <li>After three uses my fine long hair has become soft, shiny and bouncy!</li>
      <li>It worked for me right away, but others may have a different timeline for this product to really take hold.</li>
      <li>I think this shampoo and conditioner, as with all shampoo and conditioner, depends highly on your hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather either, despite the claim of a \\&quot;luxurious lather,\\&quot; but what can you expect out of a natural</li>
      <li>A quart for ten bucks was worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>(so you associate the lather with your hair getting clean), to a sulfate free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather (or only lathers a little).  </li>
      <li>I was attracted to this product by its relatively natural ingredients; it contained less alcohol than other brands, and it smelled pleasantly like almonds.</li>
      <li>so when I use conditioner I usually have to use a significant amount to really cover my whole head.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think that means I necessarily have to use more of this than other conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Other reviews mention that they feel this conditioner disappears and indeed I believe that rather than applying a mask that sits on top of the hair, this conditiner actually absorbs the moisture into the hair!</li>
      <li>It feels gross at first put these shampoos and conditioners in your hair.</li>
      <li>(and I&#x27;ve used more than one type of leave-in following this conditioner), because my hair is soft and conditioned with no residue to interact with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But if you continue to use this product, it will eventually cleanse all of the nasty chems out and you will eventually end up with beautiful soft, shinny and healthy hair.</li>
      <li>The first few times I used this conditioner, my hair seemed to suck it right up and was straw-like.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I enthusiastically recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for pleasantly scented light conditioning with no buildup nor toxic ingredients. However, even in large amounts it doesn&#x27;t do much detangling, so for my family of people with thick, tangly hair, it doesn&#x27;t work very well, kind of defeats the purpose of using conditioner at all. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but that&#x27;s about it.  I really wanted to like this and bought it with the Everyday Coconut Super Hydrating Shampoo.  The conditioner was very thin and it took a lot of conditioner to coat my shoulder length hair.  Even when it seemed like I was overconditioning, my hair was dry and brittle.  When it dried, it looked like straw and wouldn&#x27;t style.  I gave it 2 weeks before I gave up.  Since the bottle was so large, I have over half a bottle left.  I&#x27;ll keep it to use as shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a curly girl with type 4A hair.  I am natural and have been co-washing for the last few years.  This is one of my favorite conditioners.  It&#x27;s affordable, and doesn&#x27;t have stuff in it that isn&#x27;t good for my hair.  It makes my hair so soft and manageable.  I was sad when I couldn&#x27;t find this conditioner in Target, but redeemed when I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I also water it down in a spray bottle (9 parts water 1 part conditioner) and use it daily for a detangler and moisture spray on my kids hair (also natural 3A-3B curl pattern).  It doesn&#x27;t leave buildup, smells great, and is safer than the detanglers with lots of chemicals.</li>
    <li> This conditioner helps me take care of my hair. It keeps my scalp healthy. I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Coconut Super Hydrating Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Love their shampoo...love that its all natural...unfortunately its not at all hydrating. Actually my hair felt like straw. I read the reviews and gave it a good try. Tried 5 times. Not getting better and I feel like it  might cause damage trying to comb through. Like I say I want to like this but I cannot. I hope I can return at least one since I bought two.</li>
    <li> As I said in my review for the shampoo, the key for this shampoo and conditioner is to give your hair time to adjust to a new, less harsh formula. The first few times I used this conditioner, my hair seemed to suck it right up and was straw-like.  I did notice that it didn&#x27;t leave a gross film on my hands like regular conditioner did, though, and it washed out of my hair without having to stand in the shower for 10 minutes.  After a couple of weeks, it took less conditioner and my hair was soft as it was with traditional conditioners.  I often use this conditioner after swimming, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with tangling or dryness that often happens from chlorine.  One thing I do, though, is brush through my hair in the shower after putting the conditioner in and then leave it sit for a few minutes before washing out.  Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I find fascinating about this conditioner is that, because it washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, my hair has started naturally curling. I&#x27;ll take this conditioner over name brands any day, especially given the fact the name brands changed the natural state of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a unique and amazing product. I say \\&quot;unique\\&quot; because it is very natural and pure. It does not simply coat the hair with wax and silicone as other \\&quot;normal\\&quot; product does. If you are use to chemical based product on your hair, you may not like this because it will not lay on top of your hair the way you are familiar. But if you continue to use this product, it will eventually cleanse all of the nasty chems out and you will eventually end up with beautiful soft, shinny and healthy hair. I was used to more natural products and still had to work with this conditioner and it&#x27;s shampoo before I understood what it is doing. Other reviews mention that they feel this conditioner disappears and indeed I believe that rather than applying a mask that sits on top of the hair, this conditiner actually absorbs the moisture into the hair! What can be better than that?! After a few uses, I felt more moisture while it was wet. When my hair dries it is always softer than before. After three uses my fine long hair has become soft, shiny and bouncy! It helped my dry ends, which I thought I might have to cut! Now I don&#x27;t have to!. Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews scare you away from this product. Give it more than one chance and you will love it! I only use the shampoo every other week and use the Conditioner Only on the off week. I also love the leave in curl conditoner that goes with this product line. I mix it with water and spray it on, then scrunch to create curl. Normally I just have straight hair but with these products I get great natural waves! I love the entire system.</li>
    <li> When I first used this conditioner I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it.  It&#x27;s a thinner consistency than I expected and i&#x27;m used to thick conditioners.  I have curly, fine, 3c/4a hair (if you follow the hair typing system).  I&#x27;ve tried this conditioner two main ways: as a pre-shampoo treatment and as a regular post-shampoo conditioner.  I like it both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is that it absorbs into the hair immediately (I&#x27;ve found that the Alafia Beautiful Curls leave-in conditioner, made by the same company under a different brand name, does the same thing).  So I do end up using a generous amount of product.  But I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to being able to feel my conditioners coating my hair, and with this one I can&#x27;t.  But I don&#x27;t think that means I necessarily have to use more of this than other conditioners.  I think it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to how this makes my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare getting used to this conditioner with going from a sulfate shampoo that lathers a lot (so you associate the lather with your hair getting clean), to a sulfate free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather (or only lathers a little).  You have to re-train your brain to not associate lather with how clean your hair is getting.  And with this conditioner, I have to re-train my brain to stop basing how conditioned my hair is getting with how thick and creamy a conditioner feels on my hair.  Because this everyday shea coconut conditioner actually leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I&#x27;m even able to do a decent job detangling with it (though I probably detangle easier with the Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish Spa conditioner, which is a great conditioner, and the kind of thick, creamy conditioner I&#x27;m used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer mentioned, it rinses clean from my hair very easily and I even think I could use this conditioner as a leave-in if I wanted.  But I usually don&#x27;t like to use rinse out conditioners as leave-ins.  Also, I too leave the conditioner to siton my hair awhile.  I use a conditioning cap and let it sit on my hair for at least 30 minutes before rinsing it out.  I do this with all of my conditioners and I think it especially helps when using this one.  I also think it helps my hair respond well to any leave-in conditioner I follow up with (and I&#x27;ve used more than one type of leave-in following this conditioner), because my hair is soft and conditioned with no residue to interact with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, before I forget, one of the main things I like about this conditioner is that it lays my cuticle down.  So my strands feel smooth and hold the water in my hair.  I purchased it on sale at Whole Foods for about $6.99.  I only got one bottle, b/c I didn&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d like it.  For that price I wish I&#x27;d gotten a second one.  The price is higher hear on Amazon, but if I come across the conditioner at a good price again I&#x27;d repurchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because there&#x27;s a learning curve with this conditioner.  It soaks into the hair very fast and it takes trial and error to figure out the amount you need to use (without using too much and wasting the product, or using too little and under conditioning the hair).  Also, having read the negative reviews, I can say that I see why this conditioner wouldn&#x27;t be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.  I can see how it wouldn&#x27;t provide enough conditioning for someone with thicker hair than I have.</li>
    <li> Seems to just disappear into my hair like water.</li>
    <li> This cream rinse works well with the Alaffia Everyday Coconut shampoo. It is lightweight conditioner that does not weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> I think both the shampoo and conditioner for this brand is very misunderstood. I made sure to read reviews before I tried the product and I saw someone say it&#x27;s something you have to get use to and wait 2 weeks to see results. I had results after the first shampooing/conditioning. I think this shampoo and conditioner, as with all shampoo and conditioner, depends highly on your hair. This worked AMAZING for my hair/scalp. We all have varying hair types and so many combinations mixed with your scalp condition. I tend to have very sensitive dry skin along with very sensitive dry hair. My hair is straight as a board and always has been, tons of split ends, and very thin and boring. The conditioner is hard to put in at first. You have to really spread it fast. It feels gross at first put these shampoos and conditioners in your hair. It does feel as if it is drying and stripping your hair, but after I let me hair air dry my hair is beautiful! For two days! My hair tends to get really greasy towards the top, but the ends stay dry and ugly. It all looks the same now. My hair feels softer and thicker. It looks more shiny and all around feels better. It detangles WAY easier. I get less tangles even after sleeping. When it does tangle it&#x27;s brushed out easier than before. My hair is less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a little past my shoulder and all I had to use was 1 1/2 pumps of each. Again it is hard to get use to putting this in your hair at first, you just have to play with it and take your time. I held it in one hand and spread into sections with the other. It helped some. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Give this stuff a chance.  It will not disappoint if you give it enough time to work its magic.  I had (notice past tense) very dry hair &amp; scalp.  I would use coconut oil to moisturize my hair at least once a week but could not find a shampoo or conditioner that would keep it soft, shiny &amp; (more importantly) keep my scalp from itching so much while in between moisturizings.  I gave this product a try (along with the shampoo that goes with it).  My hair &amp; scalp have NEVER felt this good!  I did not have the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; hair effect that some have posted about but that could be because I was already using the coconut oil in my hair so there was some moisture there already.  I actually bought through VitaCost as it is quite a bit cheaper that way.  I am extremely happy with this product &amp; highly recommend that you give it a try for at least a week or two before passing judgement.  It worked for me right away, but others may have a different timeline for this product to really take hold.</li>
    <li> Does dry out scalp badly.</li>
    <li> Yikes.  As much as I wanted to like this conditioner, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  After weeks of use, my hair became dry and dull.  It didn&#x27;t help moisturize my hair at all.  Putting it on felt like not putting anything on at all, and I felt like I was losing a lot of hair.  I have about 1/4 left of this bottle, and will not be using it.  I have wavy, long, semi-thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like what this brand stands for, but will not be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> I was a little psyched out after reading the reviews but the guy at Whole Body told me he didn&#x27;t recall seeing any returns.  A quart for ten bucks was worth a shot.  I used enough product and my curls didn&#x27;t need their usual gel/lotion combo.  My hair was shinier and frizz free.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo but was disappointed in the conditioner.  I have curly hair and need lots of conditioner this doesnt give me what I need.  I will continue to order the shampoo but wont be reordering the conditioner.  I am using it on my child now its fine for straight thin hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair shiny and cleaned also smells great love coconut</li>
    <li> Both my conditioner and shampoo leaked a lot because the lids were not screwed on tightly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews unless a product is truly terrible or exceptional. This conditioner is the worst conditioner I have ever used.  The first time I used it, it left my hair so gummy, dry, dull and unmanageable, I was sure I&#x27;d forgotten to rinse it out.  I rinse and rinse, but to no avail.  The coordinating shampoo is also awful and dries out my hair.  The texture of my hair after using either one separately or together is the worst it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner on sale at a local health food store. I was attracted to this product by its relatively natural ingredients; it contained less alcohol than other brands, and it smelled pleasantly like almonds. I bought it at the same time I got the Everyday Coconut Super Hydrating Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, relatively straight, thick, but fine hair. When evaluating a conditioner, I want it to do three things: It should make my hair soft, shiny and manageable. This conditioner fails on all three counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Contrary to the product name, this \\&quot;Hydrating Conditioner\\&quot; does not restore the natural oils or seal the hair shafts after the coconut shampoo has stripped them dry. It leaves my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair feeling like straw--much like a day in a chlorinated swimming pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) My usually glossy hair is left looking dull and lifeless. Only the parts that are heat-treated with my curling iron look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Rather than separate the strands of hair, this conditioner makes them tangle and knot. I end up with large clumps of hair on my comb or brush--even the day after I wash and condition! I don&#x27;t have so much \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; strands coming loose from my braids, but the tackiness of the hair makes it hard to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have oily hair or use hot rollers or a curling iron to style your hair, this is not a good product to use. Even though it may seem like a bargain in the large economy size, it takes a lot of conditioner to achieve nominal results. There are plenty of better choices out there.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to smell nice, but don&#x27;t care if the conditioner you pay for has any other practical use, this may be the product for you. Seriously, I love how this stuff smells. But when I bought a conditioner, I expected it to work as a conditioner. I might have better results with my hair if I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner at all. Every time I step out of the shower, my hair is a wonderful-smelling matted mess. I do have waist-length hair, but it still shouldn&#x27;t take me an hour to comb through and detangle, especially after using a conditioner. Even when being careful, it&#x27;s hard not to break hairs when combing through. I paid $11 for my bottle, and I&#x27;d hate to throw away money, but then again, every time I use it, it makes me want to shave my head.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $9 each at EarthFare, hoping to avoid the chemicals and sulfates of other products. I&#x27;d tried making my own stuff in the past (vinegar,  baking soda, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, etc.) but it never worked. I have loooong, thick, FINE hair, and I just couldn&#x27;t find something satisfying. This product was the right combo of a good price and a product I could live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like much (because it has no artificial fragrances, which is good,) and it doesn&#x27;t look like much (no coloring either,) but I guess that&#x27;s what you should expect. It doesn&#x27;t really lather either, despite the claim of a \\&quot;luxurious lather,\\&quot; but what can you expect out of a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my hair, and kinda-sorta conditions it. I still have to rub a tiiiiny bit of coconut oil in my hair after I get out of the shower, but other than that once my hair is dry it&#x27;s soft and shiny. So I guess this stuff did it&#x27;s job, and sans crazy chemicals at that!</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and this doesn&#x27;t help me comb through it very well. The smell is minimal. I&#x27;m going to add some essential oil.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for my somewhat coarse, wavy hair, and left my toddler&#x27;s hair stringy but didn&#x27;t get the tangles out. Took a ton of product to saturate hair also. I love the scent, and I love the rest of the Everyday Coconut line, but this was a dud for us.</li>
    <li> my hair soaks it all up, barely any left to rinse out and has a great light scent</li>
    <li> So I was perusing around Amazon, when suddenly I got the urge to see how much Amazon sold my absolute favorite hair product for. Once I found it and was shocked to see the 3 star overall rating. I began to read through the reviews on this product and was amazed how few positive reactions this item had. Feeling obliged, I decided I should write a thorough review on how, when and why I fell in love with this amazing conditioner and serve this stuff the justice that it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past five years, I&#x27;ve had an &amp;#34;on again, off again&amp;#34; relationship with my thick, natural hair. It was only a year ago when I chose to finally walk away from the chemicals for good, and I began seeking the optimum regimen to keep my curls soft and moisturized. I had tried many conditioners, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I learned about the importance of using paraben and silicone-free conditioners. As I began to educate myself, I made the commitment to find an all natural conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried Shea Moisture previously and was insanely in love with their Purification Masque. I concluded that I wanted to try one of their conditioners to see if I would be equally as pleased. It was on this day that I went to Target seeking Shea Moisture, and left with Everyday Coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovered only by accident, [and by &amp;#34;accident&amp;#34;, I literally mean I accidently wandered down the Natural Beauty aisle at Target and ran into the Everyday Coconut conditioner while I was looking for a Shea Moisture conditioner.] I skimmed through the ingredients and decided that it would be worth a try. When I got home that evening, I treated my hair to a homemade avocado mask and used the Everyday Coconut conditioner to wash the mask out. Once I rinsed it all out in the shower, I ran my fingers through my hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and defined my curls felt. Eager to assess, I hurried to a mirror and there is where my eyes confirmed my hands. My hair was noticeablyhydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since that day, I have been a die-hard fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this conditioner to anyone who is:&lt;br /&gt;1. looking for an all-natural conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;2. looking for a coconut conditioner [if you are looking for a coconut shampoo, I recommend Curly Wurly from LUSH Cosmetics.]&lt;br /&gt;3. looking for a conditioner with a thin consistency, and lots of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;4. looking for a versatile conditioner, being as though this conditioner can also be in a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;5. looking for a wholesome company who proudly use certified fair trade ingredients and support gender equality and community empowerment co-ops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons? Not everyone&#x27;s experience with this product will be identical to mine and whoever sells this on Amazon is over-charging. * This item prices for no more than $10 at Target and Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this out. I bought it from my local organic grocery store, and fell in love with the scent. I had simultaneously run out of my argon oil spray, and was hoping this would be hydrating enough that I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy another bottle of argon oil. WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that I have incredibly thick, curly hair (picture the princess from Brave, but blonde) so when I use conditioner I usually have to use a significant amount to really cover my whole head. This stuff, however, felt like it immediately absorbed into my hair and scalp, it went nowhere. I had to keep applying it like spot treatment, rather than just lathering it up. I think I used a little less than a quarter of the bottle just in my first attempt to shower.(Note: I brush my hair before I shower, and then comb through it while i have conditioner in, but I couldn&#x27;t comb through this without creating more tangles. So I just washed it out.) When I rinsed it out, my hair felt soft and silky like you expect. Literally a few minutes later, my hair felt like straw. It was also clumped together and matted, I had to pull the stands apart. When my hair dried, (air-dry without any other product so I could evaluate this stuff)it felt like the product hadn&#x27;t been rinsed all the way. It felt like I had a film of product on my hair and scalp, that made me look like I needed another shower. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid by going all-natural. I am definitely not pleased with their conditioner, but I did buy it with their body wash version, and that stuff is incredible. My skin feels smooth as a baby after, and even without moisturizer my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out later.</li>
    <li> The new formulation is a big disappointment. It left my hair dry and my son&#x27;s hair so tangled that I couldnt brush it. We have been buying this product for 2 years. It seems they changed the formula when they changed the packaging. I wont buy it again too bad we really liked the old one</li>
    <li> I also got this at the area health food store because I felt it was a good deal, especially since it is derived from all natural products.  Definitely does not hydrate.  The name is such a mystery!  Luckily I use light Moroccan Oil on my hair after a shower so that seemed to make up for the lack of conditioning.  Not sure if I should just chuck it or return - I will go back to using Avalon Organics!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence with this one.  I&#x27;ve had really good experiences with alaffia before. Tried the shampoo and conditioner and was like oh no, as one poster said...it felt like straw. BUT my hair did feel like it dried softer than ever before, without additional product too.  I&#x27;ve been sticking with it bc if other reviewers. It doesn&#x27;t feel ultra hydrating at all, but it does dry really soft. Better than the natures gate jojoba system I first tried when I started switching over to natural</li>
    <li> I love it.  I like the natural products in them.  I have thick hair and children with thick and very thin  hair.  Works well for both kids and me.  It softens our thick hair and my children with thin silky hair, it makes both hair types very manageable and easy to untangle. I must say, I do put a generous amounts and allow it to deep condition.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings on this.  Conditioning power is not that great - honestly I&#x27;m having better luck with diluted apple cider vinegar as a conditioner instead.  The coconut conditioner unfortunately leaves a residue in my hair with repeated use.  I ended up using it on my dog for a while until I switched over to apple cider vinegar for him too.  Now I just use it to polish my boots (works great to buff out scratches and clean off dirt gently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only upside is it has minimal harmful chemicals compared to big name brands and even Trader Joe&#x27;s brands.  Only harmful chemical in this one appears to be a preservative, which is absolutely necessary if you are going to sell a liquid item (to prevent mold growth).</li>
    <li> The first time i used this, I used a lot of it because it really felt like my hair was just soaking it up. My hair still tends to feel like that after washing and putting this stuff in but I&#x27;ve learned that I don&#x27;t need to. I&#x27;ll let it sit in my hair while I wash and when I rinse my hair I feel the difference and my hair is much softer than before, not to mention that when my hair dries it isn&#x27;t dry and is instead soft and quite silky.</li>
