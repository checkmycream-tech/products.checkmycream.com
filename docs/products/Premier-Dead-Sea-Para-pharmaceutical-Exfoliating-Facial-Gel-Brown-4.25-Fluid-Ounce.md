<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an exfoliating gel which I use as a cleanser because ir cleanse and at the same time it removes cells. I love it for my skin looks super.</li>
    <li> I have used Premier products for some time now and have always been very satisfied with the quality. They are all quite pricey if you purchase them at a specialty kiosk at the mall (as many Amazon customers including myself seem to have originally done before discovering this well kept secret online!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is gentle yet very effective. It scrubs, thoroughly cleans, dissolves oil, and washes off clean w/ no residue, odor, or residual dryness. Leaves your skin soft and very clean. Great for combination skin. Definitely plan to continue using it. I now usually order 2 to save on shipping costs since I know I&#x27;ll use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 now, and I have had acne since I was 13 or something. Throughout the years, I tried several products, at least three of those strong skin treatments with support of dermatologists, and several others of the ones you can find at your local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;However, this one is the best I found so far. It&#x27;s very dense, so it lasts a LOT. I use it regularly, once a week, and it has helped my skin improve a lot. It&#x27;s not too strong, it does not make my skin, which is very sensitive, itch or hurt, and it still feels clean and fresh after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it&#x27;s not gonna solve all your problems. You still have to use sunscreen, moisturizer, eat healthy etc etc, but for a exfoliant it&#x27;s both effective and soft at the same time.</li>
    <li> I came across this product at a mall kiosk and decided to buy it. I used it for around 2 years and loved it. It left my skin feeling super clean and smooth. I thought I had found the perfect cleanser. Now I have completely changed my mind. After 2 years my cheeks, once the smoothest and clearest part of my face, slowly started getting tiny bumps and felt rough. Others said they couldn&#x27;t see it but I think everyone can agree that when it&#x27;s your face, you notice everything! Not only that, after I washed my face, the cleanser that once made my face feel smooth, now felt really dry and tight. I felt horrible. I had wasted my time and money. I missed touching my cheeks and feeling how smooth they were. I needed to find a different cleanser.     The past several months I have been getting into eating healthier and using natural, organic products. I started researching organic cleansers and found one from Made from Earth. I was skeptical at first because it was cheap for an organic product (8oz for $15.99), but I gave it a try. The cleanser feels like you&#x27;re washing your face with lotion (doesn&#x27;t lather or have exfoliating beads), which most people are not used to, but your face definitely feels clean afterward. I bought the cleanser back in September, around 5 months ago, and I can see and feel my face getting smoother, hopefully it will continue doing so. I wish I could use their body wash and shampoo &amp; conditioner, but they are, like most of their products, expensive (the cleanser is probably the best deal). I don&#x27;t work for the company or anything, I simply don&#x27;t want people experiencing what I did. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Best facial clense ever. Makes your skin feel real good when you use it before bed time and wake up with soft skin. Never broke out using this.  2nd time buying this. One of the best facial products &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave ur skin dry.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a tube from a vendor at a mall, paying a small fortune.  The gel works beautifully so I researched it and bought the next tube from somewhere in Israel online.  Finding it on Amazon for a fraction of the cost has been great.  This gel keeps my face clean and smooth and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I really like it... Is not a miracle but is the only product that works on my skin and I tried everything. Since I&#x27;ve been using this the people ask me what Im I putting on my skin that looks different.</li>
    <li> Great productd; would order again</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the best thing I have found for my teen&#x27;s skin. The kiosk is no longer at our mall so I searched online and was happy to find it here on Amazon. The price is MUCH better than anywhere else.  This product lasts a long time and does not irritate the skin. I highly recommend it! Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased my item some time ago allready and still havent received my product nor heared from them.   I tried to call customer service, but there is no phone number offered for that.I dont know if I will ever receive the product... It is a lesson to learn when we get cheap and dont purchase from official website.</li>
    <li> I normally use Dermanew on my skin as an exfoliator and I love it but I thought I would give this a try as the price was one third of what I pay for the Dermanew.  It works beautifully on my skin and leaves it feeling soft and ultra smooth.  It does just as good a job and for a whole lot less...always a good thing...and I get more product for my money and it lasts a long time as I only need to use a small dollop of product...another plus!</li>
    <li> I have already purchased this at the mall a year ago after a girl from the Ukraine convinced me to buy it, I had paid well over 19.99 at the time and could not find it anywhere until now, Thank you amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fantastic and for the price its being sold at right now its really a steal! If you want real results at a budget price this is PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells great.  Although gritty texture, feels good to face &amp; neck when applied.   Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh after use.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it cleans your face and exfoliates all at the same time. I recomended it to all my friends</li>
    <li> I use this product to wash my face every day and it&#x27;s amazing how my skin has improved. My face feels smooth and fresh, not dried anymore, and even black heads have disappeared. The texture of this product is like a moisturizer, and you can tell that it is made with fine natural ingredients of high quality. Thank you, Premier Dead Sea for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I NEVER received my item purchased in June 2010, it&#x27;s now August 2010.  I would not recommend this company as it is a con.  This company is not located in the U.S. and they never responded to any emails regarding my product.</li>
    <li> Product smells great but a little harsh on my skin. Feels like sand paper rubbing across my face. Maybe not a good product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this products in conbination with acne products ...really like it...totally removes the dead skin cells....definitely moisturize after use</li>
    <li> Excellent facial cleanser and exfoliation product all in one. Never would have been able to afford it if it wasn&#x27;t for Amazon. It&#x27;s the real deal and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff a while ago in the mall, and it just didnt do a thing as far as i could tell. Absolutly nothing. although i finished half of the bottle just because it smells really good.(:</li>
    <li> This is a great product, have been using it for more than a year, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing gel. I started use it last spring, and my skin significantly improved. But this is the first time I bought it on amazon, and the gel only fills 5/6 of the container. It could be just normal, but I do not remember what it was like last time. So if you can always buy the full container, pay attention to this.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is the first exfoliating gel that leaves my skin smooth and soft.  Most of these type of products tend to dry out my skin, but this one seems to manage to avoid that. It rinses off easily too.  I like to alternate this with the Premier Dead Sea Milk Cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have loved Premier Dead Sea products for a long time.  This Exfoliating Facial Gel is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Good products lasted me a very long time</li>
    <li> I tried this product at a mall so I decided to come home and order my own. My face feels real good after use.</li>
    <li> Its a bit TOO heavy for me.  Can only use this product once in a while.  I use this  more when skin feels very dried out.  Depends on your skin type</li>
    <li> I am 46 and still have acne. I am allergic to acne products containing salicylic acid (which is most of them!). Due to my age, I also need a cleanser that is hydrating. I am so grateful that I have found this product! I use it everyday and finally my skin is clear and soft. The exfoliating apricot seeds are very small and fine. They do not irritate my skin compared to other cleansers such as St. Ives. In addition, the cleanser is somehow non-greasy, although it contains a variety of oils. Now that I know Amazon sells this product at such a reasonable price, I will be purchasing it here from now on. I hope this review has been helpful to others who suffer with adult acne.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in Spain and loved it.  Looked for it online and luckily found it.  Makes my skin so soft and younger looking.  I highly recommend this for your face.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Para-Pharmaceutical Exfoliating Facial Gel, Brown, 4.4-Fluid Ounce.  This product is wonderful to use but I am concerned that people aren&#x27;t getting the excellent skin care treatment they deserve.  Be sure this is delivered to you with all packaging untouched, including the sealed plastic wrap over the box it is delivered in and the protection seal in place and not tampered with.  If some of the Gel is missing it has been opened and handed off to you with the dishonest claim that it is new, packaged properly and ready to use. If you smell any &#x27;off&#x27; smells, it isn&#x27;t good for your skin. Send it back!!</li>
    <li> I always buy this product on a regular basis. I would not hesitate to purchase the product again. This product is great.</li>
    <li> The item arrived as promised</li>
    <li> The product is great! My only problem is that my original purchase was at a kiosk &amp; I was PROMISED there were no nut oils in any of the Dead Sea products!! When I was home &amp; put glasses on, it had ALMOND OIL, my highest allergy!! Even on-line when I checked ingredients, almond oil WAS NOT LISTED!!! I can not use the products I bought because of this!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  After using it I love the way my face feels.  The dead sea mineral bring a glow to my face.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing facial scrub..You can see the difference from your first use. My face looked so clean, bright and soft.</li>
    <li> Ships to US Territories and APO/FPO addresses. Excellent!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT EXFOLIATING my skyn feel soft I love it.Highly recommended  my skyn is sensible this product is perfect .Im glad I bought and tried.</li>
    <li> I use the entire premier care collection.  this scrub is great!  I use it a few times a week.  it really cleanses the skin.</li>
    <li> On the positive side it has a lovely feel to it, however there are too few particles to really polish my skin so I think there are better options out there that really work and are much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Great everyday gentle scrub.</li>
    <li> I thought this stuff was pretty good, but my sister in law loved it when she tried mine. I may get this for all the women in my life for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We love this product and keep it in stock in our house at all times. We love the other Premier products as well. Using it daily makes all the difference. We highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff....cleans and smooths imperfections!</li>
    <li> Great facial exfoliating gel. Isn&#x27;t too harsh like some products on the market, really have gotten the best results from this product. Only use it twice a week and it love it!</li>
    <li> Be aware, it contains parabens&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should probably ask the sellers of cosmetics especially to disclose the ingredients of their products, that would be fair for customers and they would actually take the decision to buy a certain products knowing what is the most important thing about : what it contains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone could check the safety of the cosmetics here : [...]</li>
    <li> I use it once or twice every 3 months. It keeps me feeling good after so much time shaving... I would recommend this product to my closest friends and family...</li>
    <li> This actually works. Great product from Israel (Dead Sea). It cleared my dry skin but I still keep using it.</li>
    <li> First bought this product at the mall, for me one tube lasted about a year. This was the first face skin care product I&#x27;d used besides proactive (didn&#x27;t work), along with a water-based moisturizer by the Onsen brand (with a skin peel I never used, and they were expensive, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle, and doesn&#x27;t linger around which is good. My best time to use it is after shaving, as it soothes razor burn, and seems to prevent any shaving-related acne. I&#x27;ll just let it sit for a few minutes before washing it off, not sure what it is, but after shaving it feels great. I follow up currently with the Nourishing Cream \\&quot;For Men\\&quot; also from Premier. It&#x27;s a bit too oily, but okay in the winter. For the summer I&#x27;m still looking for a good water-based lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product. Definitely useful.</li>
    <li> No different than other products.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  My 22 year old son uses it daily to help with acne.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute new favorite. This cleanser does not dry out my skin and leaves my skin so clean and clear!</li>
    <li> This stuff works AWWEESOOMMMEEE! My boyfreind told me about this product, so I figured I&#x27;d try it!! You only put a lil drop to use on your face and it goes a LONG WAY. I love how deep down it gets to clean my face. This bottle will last a looooooooooong time. The \\&quot;sand grit\\&quot;  stuff doesnt dissolve really fast like other facial cleansers do. You can wash forever and still have the \\&quot;sand grit\\&quot; still working to clean your face. And after your done, ur face feels so SMOOTH AND CLEAN and my husband loves how my face feels.. so thanks to my boyfreind.I use like every 4 days. Try it. I know you&#x27;ll love it!! I know I do and I love my boyfreind  Curt too........mmmmmmm lol</li>
    <li> I was very glad to find this on Amazon, because where I first purchased this was no longer selling it. I have weird skin &amp; this is the only face wash that has stopped breakouts and improved my skin quality, Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff scrubs so well. And weirdly enough, it feels like it&#x27;s doing a much bettter job when I scrub with my bare fingers, instead of with the washcloth. My skin is so smooth, foundation when I put on my face looks way smoother now and like don&#x27;t need concealer. Won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> After a guy forced me to buy this product at the mall, he literally was in my face... I needed an exfoliater so I stuck around to hear him out. I paid 25 bucks for it, took it home, tried it out, and honestly it doesn&#x27;t make a difference for me. It feels nice right after you wash it off, but other than that... I didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference in my face. I would probably pay no more than 7-10 bucks for this product. Its way too overpriced; its has like sand it or something? It;s just a decent product.</li>
    <li> This was not the product I was looking for. I tried it anyway. I didn&#x27;t like the odor/fragrance/scent of it and I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of my skin after I used it. I was looking for the Deep Sea Cosmetics brand which I love!</li>
    <li> Different packaging and different scent from the genuine one i purchased earlier.</li>
    <li> It is gentle but still cleans well.  It is better than any other exfoliating product I have used.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have used Dead Sea products for some time. I love all of their products. I understand what part of the world it&#x27;s coming from and it takes some time to get here, but it is well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Works on my face really well. Leaves my skin feeling fresh and new.</li>
    <li> this is a good product. It makes your face feel good. It was shipped at a timely speed.it is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Everything as expected! Perfect</li>
    <li> Works better for me than any other facial brand soap or scrub. This order was well received and i am planning to order more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and still suffer from acne.  It&#x27;s most like I have to have a pimple some where on my face at all times.  I have tried everything, ProActiv, Clinque, all those store bought products, home remedies and nothing worked as quickly and effectively as this.  I found it in my boyfriend&#x27;s closet, and have thanked him every day since.&lt;br /&gt;I have oil/dry skin, so it&#x27;s complicated.  This wash works for both my dry and oily areas.  I have noticed now when I get a pimple if I just rub a little extra in that area the redness and swelling of the pimple go down in about 24 hours.  It is important to use it 2x a day, especially with my oily skin. It&#x27;s not a soap so you won&#x27;t have to worry about drying out your skin from overuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product.....I am just praying that my skin doesn&#x27;t get use to it and stop working :(&lt;br /&gt;#fairskinproblems</li>
    <li> This is a repeat buy! My daugther also loves this product so I bought her two more containers for Christmas.</li>
    <li> My skin is Oily/Combo and it is very difficult to find something that will work for longer than a week, because of whatever reason other products stop being effective soon after I begin using them. One of the karts at my local mall carries this, and after trying it(and using all of it) for $65 I decided to look on Amazon. You can tell after the second day that this works, makes my skin feel amazingly soft and its not too rough of an exfoliant, but you can tell that it is there. Overall, if you have troubled skin I would suggest this!</li>
    <li> When I first got this product, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. All I wanted was the dead sea facial mud, so this was in the &amp;#34;combo&amp;#34; package together. However, after trying it on myself and my husband, we both think this is a great weekly product to smooth out the skin. One thing I have a comment on, after talking to my facialist and dermatologst is the possible trace amount of &amp;#34;cortisone&amp;#34; in this line of products. There has been increased usage of cortisone in all the cosmetic products in the market place to achieve dramatic result, so for those of you that are not suitable for it, don&#x27;t tempt yourself to use it.</li>
    <li> works fine I have oily skin and it helps clean my face very well.That is all I have to say</li>
    <li> Great product, it made a noticeable difference in tgr dark spots around my forehead</li>
    <li> Super seller!!! Very happy!!!</li>
    <li> It only takes a small amount to feel as if you have had an expensive facial.  I use it twice a week...but sometimes sneak in another time during the week.</li>
    <li> its ok&lt;br /&gt;i like a scrub with alittle more roughness, the price is good but as a scrub its ok</li>
    <li> premier products are fantastic, i like this one compared to other brands. my face feel refreshed and clean. the price is also fantastic</li>
    <li> Love the product my skin us sensitive and this is awesome for me...</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Microscopic scrubbing beads are few and far between.  I&#x27;m sticking with my Boots no. 7 microdermabrasion scrub.  Won&#x27;t buy this again. this item had to be backordered, so my order was split in two and I didn&#x27;t receive it until after I had returned from a trip.</li>
    <li> I use this product once a week for more than three years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just great, removing the dead skin cells and unclogging the pores, thus preventing any \\&quot;inflammation\\&quot; on your face. Smells very nice too. Only small amount is needed, so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfying. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Used it before but paid waaay more at the mall. 5 stars all the way around.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago and it really helped my skin from acne and hirutism issues.  It feels like this batch or formula has changed.  I have not noticed much of a difference in my skin that I had before.  I will not be reording this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now.  I first purchased it from a fancy boutique and it was pricy.  I fell in love with the product and searched on line for it.  This product will make your skin look radient.  A little dab goes a long way. This is a favorite among my beauty products.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for this product to become available again on Amazon.com.  It&#x27;s a great product because it&#x27;s two in one--exfoliation and cleansing.  The price on Amazon is much better than at the kiosks in the malls.  This tube lasts almost a year because I use it only every other day.  Rinses cleanly and skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I was a proactive user and had a lot of side effects.  It did take the acne away but to keep it away I had to keep using it and it caused dark spots, dry patches and everything else a chemical wash will do over time. I heard about this product with the pink extringent and the problematic acne mask and I am so happy!  My skin has never been softer, no acne and no side effects.  This is all natural stuff, not chemicals and you can see the glow on your skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, feels very great on the face.</li>
    <li> This gel works great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Mild esfoliate, like product.</li>
    <li> If you want a great cleanser and a exfoliating gel, you must get this. This is a two in one cleanser that saves you time as well as money.&lt;br /&gt;Want to make sure you have removed all of your make up? Make sure you use this. It is excellent for removing make up in areas that are hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This is not my first time using this product but my first time purchasing from Amazon. I would highly recommend this product. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the EXACT PRODUCT they sell at Kiosks in the Malls for $50-70!! This facial scrub I&#x27;ve used for years, and I&#x27;m telling a TRUE story....I believe it&#x27;s what makes people argue that I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I TELL them I am!</li>
    <li> Do not like the Premier product here.  Does not do anything. This scrub is not any good. Doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> arrived on time  I like this product it leaves my skin so soft  you would really like it too this company products are above the others try them</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I received excellent customer service from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really like how my skin feels after I use this exfoliator!  Also, it doesn&#x27;t see to bother my skin in any way or make it feel dry afterwards.  Very nice product!  Glad it is for sale here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Para-pharmaceutical exfoliating Facial Gel is fantastic.  I bought this is a local mall but felt it was over priced.  The sales clerk did give me a deal.  I bought the eye serum, which is wonderful and she gave me a deal for the facial gel and a mud bar.  This was a decision I made on the spur of the moment.  I loved this Premier product.  I then found the eye serum and the wonderful exfoliating gel on line at Amazon.  I always use Amazon.  They are consisting professional in helping you get products for yourself and for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was sent to me from Isreal.  Larry Barr is a very nice man.  I got a good deal, much better than the local mall.  I will definitely recommend this scrub for all facial types.  I have combo skin.  I&#x27;m in my early 60s, but tend to take card of my skin.  People compliment on my youthful look.  Try this gel and Premier products.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million different things and nothing has ever helped my acne.  This is the one product that wasn&#x27;t too harsh and actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just used it once in the morning and once at night and within a few uses, there is improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will use it for years and years.</li>
    <li> Normally, I wait at least a month to review a product, but I&#x27;m so astounded with this product that I have to review after using it ONCE! Let me start by saying that I have combination skin. I have extremely dry skin around my mouth and oily skin on my cheeks and nose with large pores. I&#x27;ve tried many products for combination skin, but like EVERY other product out there, it either leaves my cheeks greasy or around my mouth dry. My main issue is my large pores that are very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin routine consists of washing my cheeks, forehead and nose with a pore refining exfoliator. Then use a wash cloth to scrub my nose because it&#x27;s prone to black heads. I avoid washing around my mouth with anything other than water because it&#x27;s so dry. When I dry my face, I&#x27;ll scrub lightly on my nose again with a towel. I then use toner on my cheeks, nose and forehead, again avoiding around my mouth. Then I moisturize my face. After that, I moisturize around my mouth again and sometimes put lotion on that spot if it&#x27;s still too dry. After letting it dry, I&#x27;ll put on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that you know the crazy routine I go through, let me tell you that the only thing I changed was the exfoliator. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I bought it, but this is not made with soap. I have shampoo like that for my pets (soap-less shampoo) but it never even crossed my mind that they can do that with cleansers and exfoliators. I thought it was perfect, I NEED something that doesn&#x27;t have soap! This time I washed my entire face with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never felt my face so clean before! I mean, I do at home facials and use masks, but I have never felt it like THIS! Usually after washing my face, I can feel right away that around my mouth is dry. I didn&#x27;t feel that this time, at least not nearly as badly. I also didn&#x27;t feel the need to scrub my nose with the towel. I did the toner, as usual. This time when I moisturized, I only had to do around my mouth ONCE! And my cheeks didn&#x27;t look greasy, like it actually did the day before. My skin was so even, it was glowing. It improved the appearance of my pores so much that if I didn&#x27;t know better, I would&#x27;ve thought I was wearing makeup. I actually sat there and stared at my skin because I couldn&#x27;t believe the transformation of my pores. Seriously, I went from orange peel to almost normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so impressed with this product, it&#x27;s almost like they made it specifically with me in mind. I couldn&#x27;t dream of anything more perfect for my skin. I actually forgot how much I paid for it and saw that I actually pay just as much for my other exfoliator that is specifically intended to improve the appearance of pores. That exfoliator does a fraction of the performance this does. And it smells so good! I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more for people with large pores and combination skin!greasy, like it actually did the day before. My skin was so even, it was glowing.

    <li> PDS Para-pharmacetical Exfoliating Facial Gel not only exfoliates my facial skin, it also makes my face feels clean, smooth, and good after use. I have had my doubts about this product after an encounter with kiosks at the mall and questioned their product authenticity which led me to online searching. I found that kiosks at the mall would vend these products for a higher price in contrast to purchasing these online. Not only did I save time, I also saved my facial quality! This product is legit.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected! I love this face scrub!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Makes your face feel smooth and wonderful Love Premier and Gratiae.</li>
    <li> great exfoliator, cleans skin well and balanced. gentle yet effective on oily skin. helps clean pores well, steam your face first for best results</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now.  I love it!  I use it before shaving.  Combined with the Premiere Dead Sea Men&#x27;s Shave Gel,I get a great shave!  However,due to lack of,American,resellers and availability I may be forced to find a different product!  This is too bad because I really like this product!  I would continue using it if I can find it at a reasonable price from an,American,reseller.</li>
    <li> Have sensitive skin and have looked high and low for the perfect facial cleanser? Look no damn more. Not only does this stuff have your face smelling like strawberries BUT it only helps treat acne and leaves your face looking and feeling softer and smoother than a babies bottom. REAL TALK.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is gentle enough for regular use and leaves your face very clean. The product smells excellent as well. Everything arrived quickly and everything was as expected.</li>
    <li> it rily works..clears up my pimple marks rily quick. and smells so good. It doesnt leave burning sensation on the face</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. My skin is soft, vibrant, and it does NOT dry  out my skin. Helps vlear and prevent breakouts.</li>
