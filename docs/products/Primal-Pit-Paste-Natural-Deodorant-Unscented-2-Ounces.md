      <li>The shipping did not work out for us, but the product is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s truly amazing.  </li>
      <li>I started making my own organic deodorant</li>
      <li>but it hasn&#x27;t always liked me.</li>
      <li>I bought this unscented kind, but I just ordered the lavender one.</li>
      <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>This is THE best natural deodorant EVER!</li>
      <li>Best all natural deodorant on the market.  </li>
      <li>This is the BEST natural deodorant I have tried</li>
      <li>At first, it seemed to work beautifully.</li>
      <li>Best natural deodorant I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Once, I told her this, she liked it much better.</li>
      <li>By far the best product I have tried.</li>
      <li>Primal Pit Paste was rated higher by Amazon customers than the Primal Pit Stick, so I ordered the paste, and I have been happy with it since day one.</li>
      <li>That being said, the product works great and is the best natural deodorant that I have found, aside from North Coast Naturals  which is not sold where I live.</li>
      <li>I switched to another popular brand which was fine for awhile</li>
      <li>homemade versions have done a better job.</li>
      <li>stop worrying about the pretty packaging &amp; use more effective ingredients!  </li>
      <li>I enjoy natural products and this product works great!</li>
      <li>But I am sure that it will work for others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also better than any store bought product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many and this one is the top.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Despite that, I have already ordered more.</li>
      <li>Love the odor control.</li>
      <li>I love that there are  no chemicals in the paste.</li>
      <li>This stuff works better than the poison we&#x27;ve all put under our arms for years.</li>
      <li>I love Primal Pit paste.  </li>
      <li>I truly love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fought of the stank during my toughest workouts, most stressful days, and the summer temps of Phoenix.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>I probably go through one jar every 3 months or so), but have mostly solved that problem by ordering 2 jars at a time.</li>
      <li>This is just okay.</li>
      <li>It is non scented  too which I love.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone will react differently to it, but I am very happy with it and love the unscented version</li>
      <li>/&gt;Caveat to all of this: It is the nature of my job to sweat, then not, then sweat some more, then not...  </li>
      <li>I make a version at home that works way better.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not worried about it :)</li>
      <li>After this, I use it and it works better than I would have ever thought.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also converted many of my friends to it as well.</li>
      <li>I love it and have order two more!I would recommend to everyone and will keep buying.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>do wish there was more in each bottle.</li>
      <li>We were very excited to try this.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s good!</li>
      <li>For over 20 years, I used natural salt rock crystal which worked beautifully with my chemistry.</li>
      <li>--it&#x27;s unscented, which is great for people who are sensitive to these things.</li>
      <li>The absolute best natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>Found one called Crystal (purple lid) seems to work the best so far and much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Great list of ingredients, but not as effective as expected.</li>
      <li>I tried the strong unscented paste in the jar and although it took about a week for the redness to subside, it worked *</li>
      <li>and i have strong odor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this product.  It was messy and oily.  Maybe I&#x27;m just used to regular deodorant though.  May give it another chance.</li>
    <li> This is just okay. I have developed a rash I was trying to clear up and making my own didn&#x27;t seem to work, this ddn&#x27;t work better than making my own so I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I do not understand the negative reviews that I&#x27;ve read about this product. This  is my second jar and I love it! I am a senior women who has tried/used more different deodorants than I can name and this product is the best ever. When applied there is no residue and never any white marks or stains on clothing. A little bit goes a long way so I wonder if people who were unhappy were simply using too much of the paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a natural product I was hesitant about how effective it would be; however, that was put to rest after one week of use.  I love that there are  no chemicals in the paste.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  I used to sweat through my shirts even in the winter, not to mention when it&#x27;s hot outside.  Since I started using Pit Paste a few weeks ago, I haven&#x27;t sweat through one shirt.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than regular deodorant but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Good product works well.  I also use Trullys.</li>
    <li> I use only natural deodorant and have tried many. Some work a little and others not at all!  This stuff is a little pricey, but...IT WORKS!!! Try it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but this stuff is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and when I moved to a subtropical island, things went painfully stinky. The Pit Paste doesn&#x27;t irritate at all and there is NO smell even 10 hours later. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I liked it since it is all natural. But I have highly sensitive skin, and developed a rash from it...and had to stop using it. But I am sure that it will work for others.</li>
    <li> It works for a little while but doesn&#x27;t work all day.  I&#x27;m not always home to reapply and I want something that will at least get me through about 6-8 hours of the day.  This lasts for about 3-4 hours.  It doesn&#x27;t help with sweating either.</li>
    <li> Stops body odour and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, i love this product!</li>
    <li> Stuff works great. Best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that I&#x27;ve found, really the only one that works.</li>
    <li> By far the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m happiest with the unscented in the jar, I do have slight reactions (itchy) if I use the lavender or patchouli. The other scents did not work well for me, just those two, I tried samplers of all the other scents. And, honestly, the unscented keeps the oders at bay just as well if not better than the scents. I also prefer the jar to the stick as the stuff in the stick tends to be harder. I&#x27;ll just put a pea sized amount of this under each arm, wait 15 seconds and then spread it around after it&#x27;s melted. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for 4 months now and am a total convert. I&#x27;ve also converted many of my friends to it as well.</li>
    <li> I mix a tiny bit of my favorite scented oil in it to have my own scent. Best natural deodorant I have ever used. Even after a 5K race, I still didn&#x27;t smell!</li>
    <li> It really works! My daughter who does a lot of sports is now using it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past year.  Never any problems with it!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and this is by far the best.  It&#x27;s also better than any store bought product.  A little goes a long way and it keeps the stink away.</li>
    <li> My husband has always sweat through his shirts year-round (yes, even in winter!!) and has tried every deodorant out there. The day he started using Primal Pit Paste he has has zero sweat stains and smells great! He uses the unscented. This stuff is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful with this product, as I always am when I try (truly) natural deodorants.  Alas, for me, this ultimately didn&#x27;t work.  It seemed great for 2 days re: odor control, but then it didn&#x27;t, plus it rashed up my arm pits.  I still used it longer thinking things would change, but they didn&#x27;t, and by then my pits were on fire and itching, so I had to move on.  Deodorant is truly the last self-care item I cannot seem to get a good natural replacement for, BUT... My husband really likes this most of the time.  Sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for him, but most of the time it does, esp now in the cold months, so we&#x27;ll see next summer. Do not expect wetness protection from this.  We didn&#x27;t b/c we know that naturals don&#x27;t really do that.  It provided some due to the baking soda, but it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect it to perform like a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; antiperspirant in that regard.  The ingredients in those products are largely what most of us are trying to avoid with a natural product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat to all of this: It is the nature of my job to sweat, then not, then sweat some more, then not...  That would challenge any product, natural or not.  So keep in mind my lack of success could be due to this.  It do feel like this, and any product in this category, is always worth a try as finding one that works for you would remove a daily dose of yuck-o chemicals from your body.  My search continues...</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Works great!  However,  after one use the container fell off of the dresser abs can no longer be used. Glass pieces in the jar</li>
    <li> I just received my first jar of PPP last week and so far I LOVE it!!!!  I got the regular strength unscented and it is by far the BEST deodorant I have ever used - natural or regular brands.  I love that it contains all natural ingredients and noticed that I hardly perspire even though it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant.  I definitely recommend this.  Totally 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Not all that great. This isn&#x27;t the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s the first that burned my skin! When people say you go through a detox period, that&#x27;s a lie. The baking soda in the product burns the skin around your underarms even though it&#x27;s only applied to the armpits! I would be at work and could feel my armpits burning! Thats not normal. After the burning, it would itch so I would have to go someone and hide just to scratch my underarms for some relief but it was so bad. I also got a rash. After about 2 weeks I used an anti itch ointment which really helped and switched back to my old natural deodorant. After the itching, and rash went away and my skin healed I used the product again and put the anti-itch ointment around the skin close to my armpits and it was fine. Now I use coconut oil before I use this product. This product works but to a limit, it works for maybe half the day and when I&#x27;m not very active. It&#x27;s the winter right now so I hardly sweat but I don&#x27;t think it will hold up in the summer time. The only reason I use it is because I can&#x27;t get a refund but this product has TOO MUCH baking soda that it BURNS you, and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin! You have been warned! I would suggest making this product and using less baking soda.</li>
    <li> This is the first all natural deodorant where I didn&#x27;t stay feeling sticky.  It actually worked like my regular deodorant.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I have also tried practically everything out there.  :(  I was hopeful about this one.  I purchased the unscented, as I didn&#x27;t want to risk reacting to essential oils or other scent.  This was only a small step up from using nothing at all.  Didn&#x27;t really work, and I am using it in the winter, even when not physically active.  I had used it for about 2 months.  On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t give me a raw red rash, like pure baking soda does, or a homemade formula with baking soda in it.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deoderant I&#x27;ve tried that works without giving me a terrible rash. Been using the orange\vanilla, now trying out the unscented. So far it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  used this only a few times but here in the south, with its legendary  humidity, IT WORKED  and no stinky  armpits!</li>
    <li> I really really like this paste!  I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks now and it actually works!  I live in Florida and it is now the &#x27;winter&#x27; season, but we still get to about 85 degrees (F) as our highs; and I must say, I do sweat if I go for a walk ( I do tend to naturally walk fast for some reason).  Also, when I was doing a bit of heavy lifting in the home; I also started to sweat.  I think the product says you WILL sweat because that is natural and that&#x27;s kinda what you want; but the fantastic thing is, it does not smell bad at all.  I am using the lavender scented one and I do smell a slight odor after having it on after 24 hrs (even the few times I did sweat), but like I said, it is very very slight.  You&#x27;d probably have to walk up to me and stick your nose under my armpit to smell it - LOL!!!  Anyways, this product gets two thumbs up for being the ONLY natural product that works for me - though I&#x27;ve only tried one other so far (-the crystal...ha ha..that was a joke!  It did NOT work for me at all!).  I love Primal Pit paste.  Now, I have ordered their new lip balm to try it out with my next batch of pit paste which is a complete set of the samples to see if I&#x27;d prefer any other scents of this awesome pit paste because this is what I&#x27;ll be sticking with.  Happy customer!</li>
    <li> Day 2 of wearing this and I&#x27;m impressed. Although I did sweat a little bit, I didn&#x27;t mind because I didn&#x27;t detect any odor. This is way better than any other natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> When mine arrived it was already rancid. Since that doesn&#x27;t say much about its shelf-life, I decided not to reorder. I opted to try Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant instead, and have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much out of this stuff, but I was pleasantly surprised. I have a pretty active lifestyle. When I am not wearing body armor or heavy gear, I am probably hanging from a wall somewhere. On a recent hiking trip, I smeared some on before I left and the next day I was still tolerable on the return car trip. The true test is the fact my wife has not complained about me stinking. I didn&#x27;t experience any adjustment period as some others have. I do seem to use less now for the same level of result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there was more in each bottle. Mine was only half full. Despite that, I have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> Having not really used deodorant for well over a year ( I know, I know... ),  I decided it was time to try something new before the Hot TX Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to support local so this influenced my decision here.  After a few months I am still happy with this product.  Take note that this is NOT an antiperspirant... those are terrible for you.</li>
    <li> My detox lasted a week. I had to reapply 2-3 times those days. Tenderness and swelling was enough proof for me to never go back. After this, I use it and it works better than I would have ever thought. I have 3 friends on it now.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who has severe hyperhidrosis. He has tried every anti perspirent under the sun. Primal paste says keeps him dry and odor free! He even goes bike riding for hours and comes back smelling great. He&#x27;s shocked and won&#x27;t buy anything else but this. Great knowing that it&#x27;s toxic and aluminum free! Thank you primal paste for such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> It does what it promises! I love it and have order two more!I would recommend to everyone and will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I have tried every natural deodorant out there, and this is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that works well. I have the unscented kind, and it has a weird kind of plastic-y smell to it. I also find that it leaves dark marks under my armpits, but for as good as it works...it is worth it to me!</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. I&#x27;ve also tried the lavender and citrus &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;. This works great. I was very unhappy with the other natural brands. I find that this controls the odor just as good as any deodorant. If you find you need to reapply by the afternoon, a little extra will take care of it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Great list of ingredients, but not as effective as expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered unscented and received Patchouli. Not my thing. That being said, the product works great and is the best natural deodorant that I have found, aside from North Coast Naturals  which is not sold where I live.</li>
    <li> Coolest hygiene product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. Couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. Go mankind !!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me as an odor fighter. Bummer, because I wanted to like it and love that it&#x27;s all natural. Clearly it works for other people, so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> It worked great until I broke out from it...😢</li>
    <li> This is the only all natural deoderant I have ever used that actually works!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this for several reasons, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. First, I have very sensitive skin, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the change from a traditional antiperspirant to a natural deodorant would affect my skin. I have been using it for 2 months, and have had no reaction whatsoever. I&#x27;m still a bit shocked at that, and wondering if it is yet to come, but so far, so good. I was also hesitant to switch because I hate to sweat. Well, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I have found that it&#x27;s really not so bad. I mean I still sweat a lot, but I don&#x27;t feel much of a difference. I wish I liked the stick version of the pit paste because it is definitely more convenient, but I personally prefer the jar. The stick is just a little too sticky for me (no pun intended). Even though the jar is more of a hassle to apply, it is much smoother and soaks in with no sticky residue. My husband was even willing to try it, and he says it works better than his traditional store bought deodorant.</li>
    <li> Rash inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to update, it&#x27;s been several weeks and I still have a horrible rash.  It just will not go away.</li>
    <li> I used to use old spice deodorant for the longest time, then I started getting rashes for some reason. So I switched through many different deodorant types to avoid using something my body doesn&#x27;t like. &#x27;t i&#x27;ve tried all sorts of natural deodorant like geo deo, crystal stick, spray and roll on, toms natural and many others. This deodorant was different to put on because you just have to rub it into your hair and around your pit. It feels weird at first, but I love it! I smell great all day and I haven&#x27;t had a rash. Been using it 5 days so far! It does smell a little funny, i think that is due to the arrow root in the mix.</li>
    <li> Works great. No irritation like other deodorants, natural or otherwise. No fragrance added. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a natural alternative to chemical deodorants, or that have been irritated by other natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> I really like using something natural and pure. It like using the strongest unscented paste to help during the summer months.</li>
    <li> Was a little hesitant but am happy to report that this does in fact work for me!  Love the all natural aspect - very comforting.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  No odor, no residue, no color. Perfect for everyday use. I did not expect it to work so well and so happy that it does. I tried one other natural deodorant and had to keep reapplying throughout the day. This one only needs to go on once. Completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> FINALLY! A deodorant that works for me!  I have been looking for something that works for years and spent so much money on protects that seem to never work. This does!  I still sweat, but not as much as other deodorants Ive tried. But best of all, no more sweaty man stench!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and most either don&#x27;t work or even exacerbate odor.  To my surprise this stuff really works!  I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks now and had no problems.  I didn&#x27;t even have the irritation some people seem to.  I use the regular unscented and it works for about 13 -14 hours.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t stand up to a work out, but I&#x27;ve reapplied a small amount just before working out and had no problems.  If it continues to work this well I&#x27;m definitely switching to ppp permanently.</li>
    <li> I have tried a multitude of natural deodorants but for some reason they always made me stink more! lol  This one is the ONLY natural deodorant that actually works. It is non scented  too which I love.  Great product!</li>
    <li> For over 20 years, I used natural salt rock crystal which worked beautifully with my chemistry. That is, until I had a hair test that showed high levels of aluminum. Apparently ammonium alum stores in the body just like the store-bought deodorants. So, after much research, I came upon Pit Paste. At first, it seemed to work beautifully. Then, it made me smell like nobody&#x27;s business. I&#x27;ve never been a particularly stinky person, and this was so nasty sweet foul smelling - I had to quit. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where folks had rashes, etc. during the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; period from store-bought. Since I haven&#x27;t used those since I was a teen, that can&#x27;t be the cause. Really bummed as I bought 2 of them, which will now go in the trash.</li>
    <li> Actually works! No stinky pits halfway through the day, or overpowering &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent to mask the BO!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands of natural deodorants and Primal Pit Paste puts them ALL to shame. This stuff is fantastic! It&#x27;s fought of the stank during my toughest workouts, most stressful days, and the summer temps of Phoenix. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the paste wishes I would have got her a scented lavender, that will be our next purchase,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shower every day. There, I said it on the Web, which means everyone in the world now knows the truth. But the truth is that I can use this once in the morning and go two days without reapplying. Those days are of course the ones where I am not at the gym, but doing my momma-stuff around the house. I can&#x27;t wait to try the scented kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get a fifth star because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but maybe I will change my vote in a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the directions say use a &amp;#34;pea-sized&amp;#34; portion. And they are correct. Any extra and it just gets stuck to my hands.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a subscribe and save option for this product!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Been searching for a long time trying to find a natural alternative to the toxic antiperspirant.... I think I&#x27;ve tried most of the other natural deodorants available on the market and they just don&#x27;t work for me.  Primal last all day, even in 100+ temps.</li>
    <li> In an effort to move away from deodorants with aluminum, I decided to look for deodorants that dealt with pit stink rather than blocking sweat from happening. Sweat happens. I&#x27;ve come to terms with it living in the armpit of California, however, I don&#x27;t want to smell like I live in the armpit of California. Tried this product and quickly moved on to other aluminum-free deodorants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants and this one is THE BOMB! The only one I use for my active life of working in health care and athletic adventures.</li>
    <li> I always hated the over the counter deodorants, they make my clothes smell, and after a few hours it is like I have not used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item just removes the smell sometimes for a day and sometimes for two. It has no noticeable smell, does not transfer to my clothes and I do no have to use much, I get a little as possible on my finger and after applying it, the smell from under arm disappears and I do not smell anything for the entire day, no matter how hot it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, It Works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian</li>
    <li> Burned my armpit area..has tea tree oil in it..I guess I am sensitive to that</li>
    <li> I so wanted this to work.  Unfortunately for me, it did not.  I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the packaging to begin with.  The jar seemed to be an easy way to get bacteria in, even though I extracted the product with a clean cotton swab or mini scoop.  But I had such a tough time finding an unscented deodorant that I still wanted to give it a try.  It worked for about 3 days just fine (using it on clean underarms twice a day), but then slowly started to work less and less.  I feel like I smelled worse than if I was wearing nothing.  Then the rash came.  I know other reviewers mentioned this.  Also, the lymph nodes in my underarms swelled up.  As soon as I stopped using this, the rash and swelling went away.  I guess this just wasn&#x27;t for me!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about this stuff. Its definetly different than main stream antiperspirants. But now that I really gave it time and a chance I dont think I would ever go back!!! I have also tried the scented, also pleasant. I would use the tips on the primal paste website to limit irritation when first converting.</li>
    <li> I like Primal Pit Paste but it hasn&#x27;t always liked me. Despite using the lavender and /or lemongrass versions for 6+ months, my armpits typically became reddened,  discolored, and the skin actually peeled regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primal Pit Paste appeals to me for several reasons (organic, no aluminum,  controls odor, easy to apply) so I persevered. I contacted the manufacturer and they suggested the unscented version. The redness and skin peeling has greatly decreased. I&#x27;m hoping that the unscented version ends up being my forever deoderant.</li>
    <li> I started using this product because regular deodorant started giving me a bump under one of my arms. I also like it because it contains no chemicals. I’m not a heavy “sweater” but found this product effective even in the summer. You will still sweat with this product, but it still help stop the smell. Consistency is not smooth like commercial deodorant. It is a bit grainy but not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  We&#x27;ve been off antiperspirants and regular deodorants for many years now and have experimented with A LOT of different natural options.  None of them even came close to how great Primal Pit Paste works!  We use one drop of Young Living Purification oil under each arm and then apply this paste.  I am being serious when I say that even my husband has no BO at all!  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Primal Pit Paste is amazing. They are very helpful with any questions that you even have.&lt;br /&gt;I even ordered a little soon and needed to delay my order, so I emailed them asking them if they could hold off sending it by a week and they did, then gave me no trouble whatsoever filling my order then sending it out to me!&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great, goes on nicely and stays on all day and wipes off easily!&lt;br /&gt;All you need is a dab!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many all natural deodorants looking for one that works. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Found one called Crystal (purple lid) seems to work the best so far and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the natural deodorants and only one other brand worked for me. If I weren&#x27;t so lazy, I&#x27;d make it myself, I have all the ingredients in my kitchen. It&#x27;s just easier to click a couple of buttons and get it in the mail. My husband loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried natural deodorant before...you need to put it on clean pits. I had a friend who said it didn&#x27;t work but that&#x27;s because she was putting fresh deodorant on stinky pits. Once, I told her this, she liked it much better.</li>
    <li> I enjoy natural products and this product works great! I am a young man who is physically active. I do about 30-40min of pure cardio and i sweat a ton. I can go nearly all day without any smell but usually by the time i get home from a long workout i can just barely smell myself. This is a good thing because that means this deodorant last as long as some of those unnatural and unhealthy deodorants. I enjoy the unscented because it doesnt clash or mask the smell of my body wash or on the weekends my cologne. The quantity seems really low once you initially set your eyes on it but its been 3 weeks and im half way through. So it looks like it will last me about 1 1/2 - 2 months which isnt bad. Overall i will definitely recommend and order again once im out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I am using a natural deodorant! I have always bought the strongest available store bought deodorant and every time my mom would suggest a natural alternative I would roll my eyes. I exercise every day and wear a lot of tank tops in the summer-- I definitely did not want to stink (who does?!). But then my regular deodorant started to give me a rash. I switched to another popular brand which was fine for awhile but then I started to get a rash again.&lt;br /&gt;Around this same time, I started to reevaluate a lot of the products I was using. Products full of chemicals, parabens, heavy metals. Yikes. Why didn&#x27;t I consider this earlier?&lt;br /&gt;My mom just mentioned she received a sample of this product in something else she ordered and it worked great. I read the reviews and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It does work great! I am shocked! Sometimes after a workout if you would literally stick your nose in my armpit, it might have a slight oder. But really, no one sticks their nose in my armpit so I&#x27;m not worried about it :)&lt;br /&gt;I might order the strong version next time to see if that might work a little better but I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I first bought this on Dec 20, 2014 and alternating using it with Old Spice deodorant (Old Spice on workout days) because I didn&#x27;t trust it for when I really sweat.  Eventually, the Old Spice ran out and I have used this all the time.  It has performed amazingly!  I waited until the Texas summer to see how it held up before reviewing and it keeps me odor-free even in outdoor 100+ degree workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to have a &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; period  and it did tingle a little at first, but that doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.  No rashes either.  I&#x27;m sure everyone will react differently to it, but I am very happy with it and love the unscented version so it doesn&#x27;t clash with cologne.</li>
    <li> The shipping did not work out for us, but the product is AMAZING. It actually works, without harmful chemicals and toxins.  Previously used Herban Cowboy but it never fully kept body odor at bay towards later part of day or high stress situations.  Primal Pit Paste does all that, it is easy to apply, truly vegan, very natural, and affordable compared to other natural deodorants.  Only suggestion: go to company website first and read FAQs if a new user.  Go Primal, and if you are like me, you won&#x27;t ever go back to anything else!</li>
    <li> It took a few days for my body to adjust to it. Now I can go over a day in hot conditions without sweating and stinking! This stuff is awesome!!</li>
    <li> This actually works for about 18-24 hours. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of natural deodorants and they basically do nothing or irritate the car out of your pits. This paste gave me no irritation and it keeps my pits fresh for most of the day. Not bad.</li>
    <li> Returning this is on my to-do list. It did not prevent body odor for me at all after a one-week trial.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews, which convinced me to try this.  It lasts a long time - I am only on my second jar - and it truly works.  I&#x27;ve tried the salt stone, natural deodorants sold at health food stores, and so on, so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.  But this stuff is the best; I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found, the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling...spicy....at the end of the day. BUT the price I paid through amazon, 15.95, is Twice what you can get it for on the primal paste website. Onus is on me for not doing preliminary comparison shopping - I got so used to amazon being the best deal I got lazy. So definitely buy the paste....just not here.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! This is THE best natural deodorant EVER! It seems like it&#x27;s also antiperspirant because it&#x27;s summer time and since I&#x27;ve used PPP, my pits are nice and dry. The only thing thought is that since the product is natural and potent, it&#x27;s starting to turn my armpits a dark color. The PPP website does have an FAQ on what to do if the product is doing that and if it&#x27;s irritating the skin. Other than my pits turning dark, this stuff keeps me dry.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST natural deodorant I have tried and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Not impressed for the money I spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now. Love the odor control. By far the best product I have tried. But now I&#x27;ve had a rash for 2 months. I see others have said the same.. I really dint want to stop using it but my armpits are a wreck!</li>
    <li> While not perfect, this is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found thus far!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have normal skin, so my skin can bare different products. I dont use products with questionable ingredients in them. So when I came across this recommended natural  deodorant from CloudyApples on youtube, I had to try it! When I first starting using the primal paste, my armpits took a few days to adjust because i developed a slight irritation. But nothing to be concerned of. Fast foward a couple weeks later and I no longer has any under-arm odor! I workout and have found this product to work 2/5 on stench. But everyday use definitely is a 5/5.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product at a trade show and I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s natural and it actually works! I&#x27;ve tried non-aluminum deodorants in the past, but none were as effective as this. and it doesn&#x27;t just mask odor with a different fragrance--it&#x27;s unscented, which is great for people who are sensitive to these things.</li>
    <li> We were very excited to try this.  Didn&#x27;t work for stressed manager husband.  Felt like it made him stink worse than just not wearing any deodorant.  Ten year old hated the &amp;#34;sandy&amp;#34; texture and the &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell.  Active homemaker didn&#x27;t like the chemical repellent smell or the fact that it didn&#x27;t control B.O.  Very disappointed.  We&#x27;ll move on to something else.</li>
    <li> I would put no stars for this crap but I guess things aren&#x27;t ever supposed to suck as bad as it did. the scent is weak and the rash it leaves hurts and burns. Talked to multipe customer service reps and they are all rude and very unhelpful. I will never buy this product or anything else they make. I will not support this company and how rude and careless they are, and if I were you I would not suppport them either. Worst experience I&#x27;ve had with organic products and customer service.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Doesn&#x27;t keep the smell at bay. I make a version at home that works way better.</li>
    <li> This product is inconsistent. The first jar I bought was great, but the second jar gave me a rash. I changed back to my deodorant stone.</li>
    <li> I really hate giving this a poor review.  While it did a great job keeping the funk away all day, it gave me a nasty rash.  I stopped for a week, then tried again with same results.  A few weeks later I tried one more time and that evening my pits were red.  Back to searching for one that can last as long as this one.</li>
    <li> Works good.  Pricey but I was too busy and lazy to make my own.</li>
    <li> Addicted to this stuff, works surprisingly well!</li>
    <li> I have Primal Pit Paste in the Unscented, Lavender and Lemongrass scents. Of the three, the Lavender is my personal favorite. The Unscented works splendidly, it just smells like baking soda and the other ingredients is all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a true natural deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried wella, but this stuff really works. I&#x27;m very happy about it.</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful after reading a review from one of my favorite healthy divas.  She loves it, but it did nothing for me.  Still had sweat BO pits.  Can&#x27;t get away with that in the deep south in the summer.  I also experienced a painful rash.  Still on the hunt for a good replacement from my aluminum laddened Secret that really works.</li>
    <li> I used to use Secret anti-perspirant mainly to stop odor, &amp; it was very effective. About a year ago I started living a Primal/Paleo/organic life, and stopped using Secret. I started making my own organic deodorant but I had to use it twice a day (once in the morning and again mid-day) and before bedtime for it to be effective against odor &amp; that was inconvenient. Primal Pit Paste was rated higher by Amazon customers than the Primal Pit Stick, so I ordered the paste, and I have been happy with it since day one. I use it exactly as directed--be sure to read the label. I use it once after showering in the morning and it lasts all day and all night. I can even shower at night, put it on right after showering, and no odor through the night, no odor all the next day, and no odor through the next evening. The consistency is easy to use, and feels comfortable on the skin: not gritty, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t take a long time to dry, etc.  I will most definitely continue to buy it &amp; use it.</li>
    <li> This works well, it took a period to fully kick in when switching from using regular aluminum deodorant/antiperspirant.  Note, this is not an antiperspirant nor is it meant to be, it is solely a deodorant. Everyone&#x27;s body is different, it took mine about a month or so for the sweating to get under control. For the first month and a half I had to either more frequently apply or apply about double the recommended pea size. I could&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; version but I already had this so worked with it. Now I use the regular amount, co-workers, friends, family (that aren&#x27;t afraid of speaking up) have not made any comments, and my noise is very sensitive, so it appears to be working great! I may considering giving one of their scented products a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the aluminum in &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirant is really bad for you, if it is, there are millions of people essentially poisoning themselves, but since this product gets the job done, I figured why not go with a natural approach?</li>
    <li> This works great! It doesn&#x27;t prevent sweat, but prevents any sort of odor.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m sensitive to baking soda because this product left big tender red spots under my armpits. Not the products fault, I just wasn&#x27;t aware.</li>
    <li> smh.  I used this product &amp; within 12 hrs, I was &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;  stop worrying about the pretty packaging &amp; use more effective ingredients!  I&#x27;m so disappointed...homemade versions have done a better job.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and works way better than unhealthy traditional deodorant. Small jar goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Your Pitts won&#x27;t smell and it&#x27;s better for your body!</li>
    <li> It smells a bit strange when I wear it, so I don&#x27;t put it on too often.</li>
    <li> I am a sweaty betty, and have even used prescription antiperspirant in the past. Eventually I decided it was time to give a more natural approach a try (previous attempts with Tom&#x27;s of Maine, the crystal stick, etc., did nothing for me, either sweat or odor-wise.). I tried the strong unscented paste in the jar and although it took about a week for the redness to subside, it worked *great*.  No odor and it even kept me fairly dry. I only wish they sold a 4 oz jar so I would not have to order so often (that&#x27;s relative. I probably go through one jar every 3 months or so), but have mostly solved that problem by ordering 2 jars at a time.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  Here is a tip though, so does just dusting some baking soda on your armpits. I will use this with my dress clothes but use baking soda for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Best all natural deodorant on the market.  I live in south Texas, where it&#x27;s humid and hot all the time.  Last all day, no stink during my after work workout.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than the poison we&#x27;ve all put under our arms for years. I have really offensive BO, and this deodorant does the job. I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants, and I like this one the best.</li>
    <li> good all natural product. helps with odor and some sweat... but it does allow you to sweat. If you are looking for an easy to use all natural deoderant, this would work. if you sweat and want to avoid that, this is not right for you.</li>
    <li> I just want to warn everyone that if you&#x27;ve never used a natural deodorant, and have been using regular antiperspirants/deodorants for many years, there WILL be a detox period. I had no clue about this, and the first time I applied the Pit Paste, I had a crazy breakout, almost acne-like. It was horrible, and it hurt and itched. I did some research and found out that this is completely normal. The biggest suggestion was to not apply any kind of deodorant, clean really well, and sweat! So this is what I did. I didn&#x27;t shave, didn&#x27;t apply deodorant or anything, cleaned very well, and exercised to get those sweat glands working! Finally, after almost 3 weeks, my pits had cleared up almost all the way, enough that I could shave. Then the next day I applied the Pit Paste, and it is amazing! I&#x27;ve had no more problems with breakouts, and there is no smell! (And trust me, during those 3 weeks, there was a very nasty smell!) I bought this unscented kind, but I just ordered the lavender one. The unscented is fine, but I think I will enjoy having a scent, similar to my past deodorants (minus all the nasty ingredients!). Bottom line, just push through the detox period-it will be worth it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after noticing my regular antiperspirants were not working anymore. I was skeptical since other natural products hadn&#x27;t worked for me in the past (others smelled good but underarms always felt wet). This really keeps me dry &amp; no funky smells.</li>
    <li> This will last probably half way through the day for me.  I noticed while it held off on smell, I perspired more than usual using it.</li>
    <li> I have never had a deodorant work so well before.  This is amazing and actually works.  I&#x27;ve used many different brands and scents and nothing have come close.  Because this is unscented I couldn&#x27;t see how it would hide any body odor but it&#x27;s truly amazing.  It allows me to sweat and the baking soda neutralizes the odors coming from your body allowing you to naturally detox.  I will keep purchasing it because it&#x27;s been a big life change for me and I love it.  I hope to see bigger containers in the future because I go through it fast and it&#x27;s expensive.  I used their stick of this and it doesnt spread on well.  I&#x27;d rather smear it on with this.</li>
    <li> The first week I used this I needed to use another deoderant by the afternoon.  My body adjusted quickly though and it&#x27;s all I need all day.  The only other issue is that the paste leaves a film on your hands after applying.  I finally started using a spoon I got from Orange Leaf and it makes a great applicator. lol</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff. Kinda odd to put on cause I just use my finger and if my nails are too long I get some of it left behind. But it&#x27;s not sticky, the scented ones aren&#x27;t too strong, it masks the b.o. extremely well, and is easy to apply and take off! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So this stuff is amazing i had not showered for  3 days cause i was very sick and boy i did not even stink!!!! Paste is easy quick to apply prefer over stick where you lose the end, this jar paste u get every last drop. I used it for frew months b4 realizing the rash was not from razors but this deodorant. im soo soo bummed its the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried and i have strong odor. back to my herbal clear sport stick (no more rash after few days).</li>
    <li> I have tried them ALL and nothing was working!  Over a year of salt crystals, toms deodorant .. you name it, I tried it and I was starting to think chemical free deodorants just don&#x27;t work... Fellow IIN grads (holistic health coaching school I attended) thankfully shared their success with this product... and voila! I found my deodorant! I got it back in October and still have half a jar left after daily application.. sometimes twice daily on gym days.. and I&#x27;ve used more then a pea sized amount ;)</li>
    <li> The absolute best natural deodorant. I swear by this. I&#x27;ve tried so many and this one is the top.</li>
