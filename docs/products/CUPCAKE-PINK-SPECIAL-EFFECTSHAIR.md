      <li>It&#x27;s a thicker hair dye than I was used to, but it was easy to apply.</li>
      <li>it works well and its easy to get.  </li>
      <li>My friend is a great hair dresser who does crazy awesome color.</li>
      <li>the cupcake is a littlw light for my taste</li>
      <li>, I used a cheap one).</li>
      <li>This is the only brand that I found this to work with, but the color is great.</li>
      <li>Cupcake pink is sooo insanely BRIGHT it almost glows during the day!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a bright, light pink.</li>
      <li>the picture is my head when I used special effects</li>
      <li>Again I&#x27;m sure this is just a result of the pastel look I&#x27;m going for and probably wouldn&#x27;t be true for those dyeing straight from the bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this wouldn&#x27;t be the case for someone going for the color straight from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the color but it fades too damn fast.</li>
      <li>Very nice product came faster than expected...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a 4 / 5 because of how quickly the color is fading this time around.</li>
      <li>and they ship quickly.</li>
      <li>(I have dyed my hair successfully using other brands and have never had this issue.)</li>
      <li>and when it&#x27;s time to wash it out my color is fresh and pretty!</li>
      <li>The bight neon color, which I loved, slowly faded to a lovely pastel</li>
      <li>I have not tried Cupcake Pink on its own, but found that Atomic Pink was more of a darker magenta; this blend is, to me, the perfect pink.  </li>
      <li>I imagine that it would look great on white hair that has been toned to a complete white-blonde, though&lt;br</li>
      <li>ECONOMICAL</li>
      <li>This is a bright pink!</li>
      <li>loooooove Special Effects so much ;0;</li>
      <li>I had my hair professionally bleached and dyed a pastel and peachy shade of pink and loved it, but because it was so light</li>
      <li>I dyed my hair almost three weeks ago, and it&#x27;s still very vibrant!</li>
      <li>I used Cupcake Pink from SE about two years ago and LOVED the how bright the initial color was on my platinum blonde hair.</li>
      <li>I am normally a fan of Special Effects Hair color.</li>
      <li>I used tonwaxh my hair daily, and it was still just as bright as a fresh dye, two weeks later.</li>
      <li>But it really works!</li>
      <li>i love this product because it actually works</li>
      <li>i used it about a decade ago when i first started dyeing my hair then stopped when my area stopped carrying it in store.</li>
      <li>This is for true PINK LOVERS!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>If you want a bright pink I recommend Atomic Pink because it covers faded colors perfectly and does last an entire month.</li>
      <li>&quot; handy at all times, especially if you have nice sheets or pale towels.</li>
      <li>Special Effects is my favorite brand at this point and my wife uses this color regularly and only needs to re-apply when her roots grow out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, but not a pastel pink...</li>
      <li>It also makes my hair very soft and healthy because of the deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought this might have been because I dyed it over an old color, but when I put this color on my sister&#x27;s freshly bleached hair</li>
      <li>I sooo can&#x27;t wait till I bleach my whole head</li>
      <li>Bought atomic pink, diluted it and it has much better    1.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more of a bubblegum type of pink.</li>
      <li>It also faded really fast.</li>
      <li>The intensity lasted about two days then faded fast, even though I used a shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>hair is an auburn red color, and even though this is a light color, it turned up vibrant and pink on top of my real hair color.</li>
      <li>I found it was cheapest to buy on amazon and and many other places I would need to use her cosmetology license.</li>
      <li>It stays in my hair better than any other semi-permanent dyes.</li>
      <li>That is the way it is with all Special Effects dyes that I have used, but this one was especially thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cupcake Pink and Atomic Pink are probably the best pink dyes ever made!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Much longer lasting than most dyes, especially things like punky colors/manic panic, etc.</li>
      <li>Best brand of dye for &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; , wild or crazy</li>
      <li>Most of my hair has been dyed black for years.  </li>
      <li>and it is not as vibrant</li>
      <li>The color is vibrant and stays forever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bleached my hair to a light yellow, with some spots that ended up a little darker yellow. I applied this dye and the color turned out AWFUL. You could clearly see where it was a little darker and my whole head was a nasty orange pink. I imagine that it would look great on white hair that has been toned to a complete white-blonde, though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advantage of this dye is that it is basically zero mess. The dye is so translucent that it can&#x27;t stain your skin or any hard surfaces. It is very thick, though. You will need to mix it with water in the bowl to even be able to spread it on your hair. That is the way it is with all Special Effects dyes that I have used, but this one was especially thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you anything about staying power, because I put Manic Panic Hot Hot Pink over it the next day.</li>
    <li> Used exactly as according to package, dye washed out immediately, leaving absolutely no color. (I have dyed my hair successfully using other brands and have never had this issue.)</li>
    <li> OMG! Cupcake pink is sooo insanely BRIGHT it almost glows during the day! &#x3D;) I dyed some blonde human hair extensions of mine with it earlier today and WOW its very pink almost a HOT PINK! but not quite...sooo pretty tho hardly any of the product came out of the extensions after I washed it at all so the color deffinatly sticks very good! &#x3D;) its always best to leave it in 10 mins longer for better results tho...and dose amazing on bleach blonde hair... I sooo can&#x27;t wait till I bleach my whole head blonde cuz I plan on dying my whole head with this sucker! &#x3D;) I LOVE GOOD BUY! This is for true PINK LOVERS!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I used Cupcake Pink from SE about two years ago and LOVED the how bright the initial color was on my platinum blonde hair. The bight neon color, which I loved, slowly faded to a lovely pastel pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around the initial color seems to be a muted pink on my platinum blonde hair, though it is still fading to a lovely pastel color. The fade also seems to be happening faster this time around. I was my hair every 3 days in cold water. I may have had a bad batch, but still prefer SP pink above other brands. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a 4 / 5 because of how quickly the color is fading this time around.</li>
    <li> Cupcake does turn a salmon color if your hair is not bleached far enough out and you don&#x27;t keep reapplying.  Bought atomic pink, diluted it and it has much better    1. Staying power  2. Pink pigment  3. ECONOMICAL</li>
    <li> This is the longest lasting vibrant dye line I&#x27;ve found, and it makes the hair shiny and conditioned. Doesn&#x27;t itch while it&#x27;s on like some others do either. Really does last about 3 weeks washing every day, as opposed to 10-14 days like others.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time, alot longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. I have it in my hair as we speak.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dye to do my bangs/streaks three times. In fact, it&#x27;s been the same bottle and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year. It still works just as well as the day I got it! I love that!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is an auburn red color, and even though this is a light color, it turned up vibrant and pink on top of my real hair color. My hair is sometimes difficult to dye without bleaching, so I will keep buy Special Effects&#x27; products. It stays in my hair better than any other semi-permanent dyes.</li>
    <li> This item is okay. The intensity lasted about two days then faded fast, even though I used a shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Colors are brighter and last longer when compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Great product and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
    <li> Cupcake pink color puts in work. 2 months till it started to fade. Best hair dye I&#x27;ve seen... results may vary. &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s pink. It&#x27;s not hot pink, so don&#x27;t be deceived by the picture. It&#x27;s more of a bright, light pink. Almost like a cotton candy. If you want a hot pink color, use the Atomic Pink instead.</li>
    <li> I had only heard about this product on YouTube because no stores carry it in store.  3 years ago when I use to dye all my hair pink as an 8th grader in middle school and now i&#x27;m a senior in high school now and have platinum hair every since 9th grade with pink underneath.. I have used all types of pink hair dyes!  I know my stuff when it comes to pink hair dye. SOOO I used manic panic first time in cotton candy pink and it SUCKS hate it. so I tired SPLAT in the color pink(they sell SPLAT at Walgreens for $8) it works well and its easy to get.  then I heard amazing things about this dye on YouTube so I had to try it. its a plant based dye which means its not hard on your hair. I had to get 2 bottles of dye for my hair that it just passed my boobs when I did all my hair pink. it stayed in for a very long time the color is what I expected it to be. I just wish they sold this at stores because its not convenient when you have to buy it online if you have to maintain the color.  I would recommend it for sure. the picture is my head when I used special effects</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! My daughter has washed her hair in hot water for over almost 2 weeks and her hair is still pink.</li>
    <li> I am normally a fan of Special Effects Hair color. This is the only dye I use and I get a lot of compliments on it for my bright hair color which people say doesn&#x27;t fade (I normally redye my hair once a month and it looks good). But this particular color is weak. I can normally put a new color over an old color at the end of the month as long as they are similar. In this way I change from red to orange to pink and back without any problem. My hair is also short, so I normally don&#x27;t use up a lot of hair dye and can make a bottle last me more than half a year. Yet I ended up using nearly an entire bottle of cupcake pink in one go because it didn&#x27;t cover my month old orange hair well and I ended up with a salmon color rather than the pink I wanted. It also faded really fast. I thought this might have been because I dyed it over an old color, but when I put this color on my sister&#x27;s freshly bleached hair it also wasn&#x27;t that saturated and didn&#x27;t last well. If you want a bright pink I recommend Atomic Pink because it covers faded colors perfectly and does last an entire month. Plus it glows under black light, which is just an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I had my hair professionally bleached and dyed a pastel and peachy shade of pink and loved it, but because it was so light it faded to almost blonde after the first wash. Since then I&#x27;ve mixed a little bit of Cupcake Pink into my conditioner and now every time I shower I just leave the diluted dye/conditioner mixture in my hair for a half hour or so and when it&#x27;s time to wash it out my color is fresh and pretty! It also makes my hair very soft and healthy because of the deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has lasted me a long time because I have been diluting it so much. Also, because it is diluted each re-dyeing only lasts until the next wash, so it&#x27;s a bit high maintenance. I&#x27;m sure this wouldn&#x27;t be the case for someone going for the color straight from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to note on the color is that although it is pink there are a lot of peachy undertones, especially where the bleaching was not as thorough. Again I&#x27;m sure this is just a result of the pastel look I&#x27;m going for and probably wouldn&#x27;t be true for those dyeing straight from the bottle. Personally I love this look but if you want a purer pastel pink you would have to look into bleaching almost to white.</li>
    <li> I love the color but it fades too damn fast.</li>
    <li> I ordered this years ago and never reviewed it, but I just wanted to say this is the best dye I have ever used. The color is vibrant and stays forever. I used tonwaxh my hair daily, and it was still just as bright as a fresh dye, two weeks later. It took about two months for it to fade before it was light enough to use a different color.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. On my bleached hair it lasted 6 weeks with minimal fading and lasted 12 before I truly needed to refresh it. Best pink ever!</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful colour! It&#x27;s very light, but not a pastel pink...it&#x27;s more of a bubblegum type of pink. I dyed my hair almost three weeks ago, and it&#x27;s still very vibrant! However, your hair must be a pale blonde for the true colour to show. Some bits of my hair were a little too dark and now they&#x27;ve turned into a salmon pink and in some places a gross looking pink that looks like it has been dipped in soy sauce....</li>
    <li> I used this product to dye my hair for the 3 Day 60 mile walk in Seattle.  Got lots of good comments about the color.  I would buy this product again for the next 3 Day event.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thicker hair dye than I was used to, but it was easy to apply. I left it on for 2 hours instead of 30 minutes, and the color came out awesome. Not quite sure yet how durable it is through washing, but definitely satisfied with the color!</li>
    <li> Much longer lasting than most dyes, especially things like punky colors/manic panic, etc. Special Effects is my favorite brand at this point and my wife uses this color regularly and only needs to re-apply when her roots grow out.</li>
    <li> Most of my hair has been dyed black for years.  After bleaching a large section of it 4 times the lightest it got was a pale orange.  A blend of roughly half Cupcake Pink and half Atomic Pink covered that sickly orange completely and the pink section is VIBRANT pink.  Absolutely beautiful.  Almost every time I go somewhere someone compliments my hair.  Just today I got a compliment at the grocery - it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks (and 4 nights of ocean tides) and it&#x27;s still VIBRANT pink.  I have not tried Cupcake Pink on its own, but found that Atomic Pink was more of a darker magenta; this blend is, to me, the perfect pink.  Not baby pink and not near-red.    Special Effects is the only not-found-in-nature hair color I use; I&#x27;ve used a handful of their colors in the last 2-3 years.  Their colors are long lasting (for weird semi-permanent colors, anyway) and don&#x27;t ruin or otherwise dry out hair.  The only time I recolor my hair is when the roots need coloring, not because the color has faded, although to be on the safe side I do pull the color down to the ends.  The colors do continue bleeding color for days and days, so keep a \\&quot;hair dye towel\\&quot; handy at all times, especially if you have nice sheets or pale towels. Be diligent about wearing rubber gloves lest you have funny-colored hands, too. The Manic Panic I used several years ago doesn&#x27;t remotely compare for lasting power, and it&#x27;s such a right pain to color a weird color that having it last awhile is quite important in my book. Fatal Impact packages them well so the colors don&#x27;t leak out and they ship quickly.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair dye brand! lasts for months!</li>
    <li> never going back to manic panic! lasts at least 2x longer and i love that it comes in a tube, not a tub.</li>
    <li> Awesome. My friend is a great hair dresser who does crazy awesome color. I wanted a light pink , almost cotton candy pink and she told me to get special effects in cupcake pink. This is a bright pink! She explained to put a small amount of the dye in the mixing bowl and dilute it with a white colored conditioner(any, I used a cheap one). Mix it until i get the color i want my hair in the bowl. She promised that I would have the color in bowl on my hair. My hair is bleached, but still that is hard to believe. But it really works! This is the only brand that I found this to work with, but the color is great. Love this brand now. Best brand of dye for &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; , wild or crazy colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I found it was cheapest to buy on amazon and and many other places I would need to use her cosmetology license.</li>
    <li> I thought this color would be perfect for me, and it was, so no complaints there. It was simple, easy, and harsh chemical free so I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER;&lt;br /&gt;It took multiple tries to apply it over my already bleached hair. It took a total of three tries, even then the color didn&#x27;t take, so, I am not fully satisfied with my purchese.</li>
    <li> This colour lasts forever. I got lots of compliments on it, even from girls at the salon and I dyed my hair myself. I mixed this with the blue colour as well and it makes a nice light purple. The bottle lasts a while too, I have dyed pieces of my hair with this twice and still have half the bottle.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manor, and I was pleased with the packaging. I would purchase this product again from this retailer.</li>
    <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve purchased other Special Effects hair dye and have been absolutely pleased.  Cupcake pink did not live up to my expectations.  This color is very pale on my naturally dirty-blonde (now bleached) hair.  The color came out like a baby girl pink and quickly fades.  Not much rinses out in the prelim rinse which gave me hope, and it didn&#x27;t stain my skin as other colors have.  Unfortunately, I find I have to redye it every week to hold any color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a vivid pink that lasts - use Atomic Pink.  If you are using this on bleached hair, I recommend bleaching down to pure white otherwise any blonde or brassy undertones will take over.  It was also not strong enough a color to go over my natural roots on the retouches.</li>
    <li> this was the color and the other colors i used to get the same color as arianna grande and it turned out so good i love this product because it actually works</li>
    <li> Nice color, and easy to use.  A little messy, but when used with Atomic Pink, I got some kick butt highlights.</li>
    <li> without a doubt, the best dye company on the planet. i used it about a decade ago when i first started dyeing my hair then stopped when my area stopped carrying it in store. for about 3 years i bounced between manic panic and color ion brilliance, which stained like crazy, bled out of the shower for at least 6 washes, and had to be re-dyed once a month to maintain a pretty color. with manic panic cupcake, i tone it down with dye:conditioner ratio of 2:1 and mainting a pretty pastel pink that takes 2 months to fade to an even, paler pastel pink. i have two bottles that will probably last me an entire year and, believe me, i am never going to use anything else again.</li>
    <li> I wanted peek-a-boo pink streaks for the summer (nursing school doesn&#x27;t allow fun hair) and I had tried the manic panic brand first and that washed out extremely fast (even with bleaching prior to applying pink). I found this brand on Amazon and it had good reviews, so I decided to try it. I&#x27;m glad I took the chance! It&#x27;s been over a month since using this brand and the color is still noticeable! There is fading and it is not as vibrant but that is to be expected! Im just happy it lasted through more than 2 washes!</li>
    <li> Special Effects is always a great hairdye.  I think next time I&#x27;ll try a more pigmented pink (just due to the level of pre-bleaching I did on my hair).</li>
    <li> meh. Okay so I got the package pretty quick-which is great! but the twisty top part of the bottle where the color would dispense or come out of, had green tape wrapped around the lid. and I thought that was weird. I twisted off the top to look inside at the color and the &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; was broke or removed and it looks like maybe someone had tested the color or something and I don&#x27;t like that at all. I feel like I received a return or something and I feel uncomfortable that there is no seal to the bottle because who knows if it was tampered with...correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but do all special effects bottles come with green tape wrapped around the top and no safety seal?</li>
    <li> its okay not that great</li>
    <li> Very nice product came faster than expected... the cupcake is a littlw light for my taste but it is very pink and lasts a while</li>
    <li> Cupcake Pink and Atomic Pink are probably the best pink dyes ever made!&lt;br /&gt;I loooooove Special Effects so much ;0;</li>
