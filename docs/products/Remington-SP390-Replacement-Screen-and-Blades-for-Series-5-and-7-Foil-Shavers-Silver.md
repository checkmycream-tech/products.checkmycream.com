<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT REPLACEMENT. GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> first set didn&#x27;t work properly, the second set has been installed &amp; seems to be okay</li>
    <li> When I use this replacement set of blades and screen I can immediately tell a huge difference in the way my razor performs!  I love the feel of new blades!</li>
    <li> Best price I could find but still high</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly.  The arrived quickly just like all Amazon products do.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed</li>
    <li> Great service and exactly what I ordered. My electric shaver is good for another few years (I hope)! Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> fit is perfect, should have changed them long time ago, wish i could find a good blade oil to make them last longer.</li>
    <li> everthing was designed just right. Install was simple.</li>
    <li> Did not work quite as well as the original ones that came with my razor</li>
    <li> The Remington replacement parts order was accurate and received ahead of schedule.  I will use this vendor again!  Thanks for the great service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for years and I&#x27;ve been happy with them.  This replacement blade and screen is a perfect \\&quot;tune up\\&quot; to a tired shaver.  I always replace the blades and screen together every couple of months.  It&#x27;s easy to do and restores that smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for my razor which means I get a great shave once again. Reasonable priced and fast shipping ! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back in a year or so .</li>
    <li> Accurate description and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Nothing against the vendor or the product... but you want a review, so I gotta share my mistake. The screens were for a different shaver and I tried to make it work. Thus, I didn&#x27;t want to pursue returning it because it wouldn&#x27;t be fair. Advice is to be sure of the model of your own shaver before ordering. Ultimately, I just purchased a three head set from my local Fry&#x27;s store. For a few bucks more, I got three foils and three cutters. A great deal!</li>
    <li> These Remington replacement cutters and screen are easy to replace and very comfortable.  Be sure to replace them often, especially the screen.  I find that I often don&#x27;t replace my screens until I hate my shaver because it&#x27;s very slowly become excruciatingly uncomfortable.  The change is so gradual, I forget that I ever had a comfortable shave from it.  If your screen is old, the comfort difference with a new one is like night and day!    On the downside, immediately upon changing both the cutters and the screen, I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting nearly as close and quick of a shave.  I guess this is because the new screen is thicker than the worn screen (although I really thought I got a closer shave with the original screen, even when it was brand new).  But the greatly improved comfort level is more than worth it.  Don&#x27;t torture yourself with a worn-out screen!    UPDATE: As some other reviewers have experienced, I&#x27;ve had trouble with this screen staying in place on my shaver (F5790).  After just a couple of weeks, it started periodically popping off, and after less than two months, I had to tape it in place to keep it on.  Major hassle. I&#x27;ve downgraded the rating from four stars to one because of this.</li>
    <li> Only last about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I bought my 3 head razor from Walmart and when it came time to replace the heads, they were nowhere to be found. walmart,target, nowhere I could find so I looked online and refused to buy them from walmart sence they sold me the shaver but don&#x27;t carry the blades. stupid!! Amazon was the best price and shiped for free with the 5-6 day shiping but they still got to me in 2 days not counting the night I ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;  I have had 2 norelco electric razors and both would pull beard and jam on my beard. I&#x27;m 58 and have always had a thick beard. This remington 3 header shaves easy,close as a razor and only cost 13.00 to replace where the norelco cost 36.00$ !!!!&lt;br /&gt; It is worth ordering them online and being happy. I advise having a backup set ready at hand because when these wear out they go in one day, and can hurt.&lt;br /&gt;  Defenityly order these they work great and are remington blades. Don&#x27;t buy the 2 head just because you can replace them from the store. these are better.</li>
    <li> the product i purchased was exactly as described and arrived promptly,good work amazon i will be buying from you again</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly. My only concern with the razor is that the cutting head doesn&#x27;t last very long (about two months on the first one and the heads are not covered by the warranty). I still like the shaver since it shaves closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, replaced broken screen &amp; shaver works like new. Great seller would reccomend.</li>
    <li> Just like the originals. No problems. Shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> it was what I needed exactly. I am happy. L.M.</li>
    <li> It was just fine Thank you</li>
    <li> Surprise!  It comes with the screens already installed in a replacement plastic head!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good replacement</li>
    <li> After searching all over Las Vegas or replacement blades for a NEWER electric razor (about 1 year old), I finally gave up and ordered them through Amazon.  I have always been a \\&quot;tactile\\&quot; shopper, but more and more I am forgoing the drama of \\&quot;in store\\&quot; shopping and opting for mail order......especially if the shipping is free or minimal.</li>
    <li> These Remington screens and cutters work great!  And, the price is much cheaper than I can get them locally(when I can find them).  For some reason, they are not available in most retail stores.  I keep a spare set at home and with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and blade set brought the performance of the shaver back to &amp;#34;like new.&amp;#34; I will buy this set again the next time a replacement is needed.</li>
    <li> Ahhh..... the feel of a great shave. Had my remington for 3 years now. Still like new..... so why buy another??? Thank you and will come back for more replacement blades soon.</li>
    <li> good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Thank God. I was lost without my buzzer. Excellent replacement pack for my buzzer. I am smooth again !!!  Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Most other sites charge up to twice as much. As these screens wear out frequently, it is a real deal!</li>
    <li> This item arrived in good time and sealed in OEM pack. Item matches exactly the blade set that came with my shaver.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!!!!</li>
    <li> bought before, very satisfied</li>
    <li> The screen needed to be replaced., This set is the right replacement .I decided to get the blades too. The price was good.</li>
    <li> The screen arrived quickly and was just what my husband ordered.  This made him very happy.  Now he can shave in comfort.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that I can buy the blades. The screen of my old one was all wear. I could use no more. But now with the new blades work very well.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and awesome product</li>
    <li> These replacements fit perfect and work perfect for what they are. I just hate remington shavers. dont blame the replacements though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old screen and blades.  I replaced both of them.  I however got shocked when shaving my face because it doesn&#x27;t shave at all, just a little bit.  I&#x27;m totally disappointed.  I planed to return this product.  I highly recommend not to buy this product.  HP</li>
    <li> Blades and screen work very well. One of the cutters comes off when you want to remove screen so have to keep putting back on.</li>
    <li> I received the screens and blades at the end of Feb.  It is now May 31st and one of the three screens has worn through...&lt;br /&gt;So now I have to order a full set and keep the spare parts around to replace the others that wear out.</li>
    <li> I always have trouble finding replacement parts for razors.  Amazon is a good spot to find the parts I need.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly and do the job smartly.</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Need to replace these every few months. Excellent price and quality. I order 2 at a time so I need to order when I replace again.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades do not fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;The foil head fits loosely, is made poorly&lt;br /&gt;and the blades pop off of the stems very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Actually cut myself twice with this replacement.&lt;br /&gt;The original razor was a good deal and shaved well.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to buy a new razor to replace it.</li>
    <li> I received my goods in good order and condition. The goods ordered and received were exactly what I wanted. The advertised product was accurate. I had no problem at all in ordering the goods.</li>
    <li> It is always nice to be able to find replacement screen and blades for a power razor, because this prevents me from buying a whole new razor, especially when my original razor is still in good working order. The replacement screen and blades is a good product, the performance of this product works just as well as the original screen and blades in my power razor.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, good price, quick delivery, new product.  No hassles.  Perfect!  Al.</li>
    <li> It was easy to locate the correct replacement for the Remington shaver blades and screen. They arrived quickly and were in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Worked well - much less expensive than at the normal discount store chains... Would buy again and recommend for your Remington shaver...</li>
    <li> Factory replacements you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Shaver works like new.</li>
    <li> This replacement screen and blades were designed for my Remington razor so there were no problems in having it fit the shaver.  One suggestion I learned from the company representative was to make sure all the shaving debris is removed from around the edges of the shaver where the screen fits in or else it will not seat properly and the screen will wear out faster.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find the shaver foil and new blades in the Amazon selection. Ordering was easy and I received the goods within 3 days. It was easy and convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d dropped my shaver and wrecked one of the screens. Couldn&#x27;t find the replacement screens in town so I ordered them here. They work great. :)</li>
    <li> Nice to get replacement parts so easily !!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to switch out, good quality, perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Remington replacement is great.  I wear out the tin on the razor and it&#x27;s cheaper to purchase the new blades and tin rather than purchasing a new razor.  I do love the razor but I do wish I could just buy tins between blade changes.</li>
    <li> Box was crushed. The contents not damaged.</li>
    <li> Product works but does not lock into place properly. Often unlocks itself.   Dissappointed the original foils lasted only afew months.  Great Shave but if it becomes necesssary to replace foils &amp; blades every three months its not worth the price of the shaver or replacement.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for razor,shipped on time,a good value!I liked the fact that this is a factory replacement for this razor</li>
    <li> They work as intended and I have had no problems with them. I will order again when the time comes</li>
    <li> Great replacement razors</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these replacements for my father twice-- the screen keeps developing small tears in it. It&#x27;s great while it&#x27;s new, but&lt;br /&gt;a) why is the screen so easily damaged? b) why is the replacement so expensive relative to the price of the shaver? c) why can&#x27;t you simply buy a replacement screen without having to purchase blades... maybe a screen alone would cost less. This is the last time he&#x27;ll be replacing the screen. The next time, he&#x27;ll get a new shaver-- and likely not where this keeps happening.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these replacements in retail stores once or twice a year anyway.  This is the same product I used to buy at a much better price.  I will continue to buy them as needed.</li>
    <li> Works very good as good as OE blades &amp; screen</li>
    <li> very good product and arrived ahead of estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Everything OK as expected</li>
    <li> The service was prompt and reliable; however, I found that I could have obtained the same replacement screen and blades by ordering them online and picking the parts up at Walmart for nearly $6 less, tax included.</li>
    <li> Wanting to \\&quot;Buy Locally\\&quot; I searched 5 different stores including Wal-Mart and couldn&#x27;t find this product. Amazon had it and at a price that allowed me to purchase 2 each, giving me a backup.</li>
    <li> I have replaced blades 3 or 4 times.  Probably should replace razor.  Beginning not to notice big difference in shave.  Inexpensive way to go but 4th or 5th set may be trying extend life of razor too long.</li>
    <li> Saved the shaver from the heap of old headless beard cutters</li>
    <li> Served perfectly , my Reminton returned to life ... do not hesitate to replace the respuesto will have a machine again!</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase. The product came as promised. I would use this vender again. I would recomend this product and vender.</li>
    <li> The replacement screens only lasted 7 months. I thought I&#x27;d get at least a year out of them. I have a very light beard and use minimal pressure. not the quality of Braun.</li>
    <li> My bought the trimmers frm walmart, but of course they didnt sell the replacements blades.  So I decided to try my trusty site \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;. And Yes! It lead me straight to what he needed  and more!</li>
    <li> blades are what my husband uses on his razer</li>
    <li> perfect--can&#x27;t buy these blades at the store.  They arrived quickly!!!  Thanks.  ---sam</li>
    <li> They were exactly what i expected them to be. They work great!!!!</li>
    <li> When I replaced the old screen and blades to my husbands Remington razor, the trimmer stopped working for some reason.  It worked great before I replaced the old parts with the new.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
    <li> This is simply a replacement part to have on hand for my elecric razor!!!!!!!!  I get tired of the requests for reviews.  Especially for something as ridiculous as this.</li>
    <li> It works good and it really mows the whiskers into dust. Next year I&#x27;ll order another one. It was delivered really fast.</li>
    <li> my personal review&lt;br /&gt;so far so good it works and does its job&lt;br /&gt;only issue the quality of the product is poor&lt;br /&gt;but works as it is&lt;br /&gt;but I don&#x27;t know how far it will last</li>
    <li> Product was perfect fit replacement part.... But a little pricey I thought...</li>
    <li> Replacements works just as they do when you first get your shaver,don&#x27;t try to stretch the foils and shavers life,change at the recommended time.</li>
    <li> As expected, cheaper than a new razor.... Barely!</li>
    <li> I have restored the old shaver back to its original state.  Easy to install and use.  An outstanding value considering the cost of an shaver.</li>
    <li> The kit had more than I needed and cost was a little high. The quality of the materials and service was good.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find the Remington SP390 Replacement kit on Amazon. I have always bought this kit directly form Remington, but not anymore! The replacement kit is almost $10.00 cheaper from Amazon for the same item. I like the replacement kit, a good product, and the supplier was quick with filling the order, and at a big savings, so what more could you ask for!</li>
    <li> Easy to install and get the shaver back up and working. It&#x27;s great to have the electric shaver back in working order.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a client who&#x27;s shaver head looked just terrible.  Everything fit well and we have not had any issues with the razor since its installation.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my F5790.  Includes, blades, screen and housing.</li>
    <li> Especially when the broken screen on the old one no longer scratches my face.  After reading all the reviews, I became convinced that the plastic cover might actually latch on somehow (I gave up on it long ago). And sure enough, it does - such a poor design though.  So, when protected, maybe this replacement will last longer than the original did.</li>
    <li> Perfectly engineered, manufactured and fairly priced. Shipped and delivered exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Woks and much cheaper than new</li>
    <li> works well although the foils do wear thin in a relative short time and have to be replaced quite often</li>
    <li> Fit my Remington F570 perfectly and made it shave like new</li>
    <li> What do you say about replacement blades for a Remington?  Heck, they work!.  Delivery was fast and the new blades provide a clean shave.  Actually, since I&#x27;ve decided to grow a beard, I won&#x27;t have to shave but a few small areas of my face.  These should last for years!</li>
    <li> It prevented me from spending more money on a new electric razor. Now my Remington is like new. Good deal</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the original that came with the razor.  Maybe it needs a break-in period and will do better as time goes on.  Adequate for the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My Remington F5790 shaver developed a hole in mesh foil cover/guard about 6 mos after purchase. I bought the replacement kit (mesh and new vibrating blades} and installed the mesh first over old blades. Operation caused the mesh to rise up and separate from shaver body. Decided to replace blades also but same thing happened. To shave I have to hold down the mesh cover to keep it from rising up and allow it to cut at all let alone properly. Convinced that replacement kit was produced incorrectly in size and the mesh does not fit tightly enough to hold on to shaver as required. A quality control problem or incorrect specs given to foreign manufacturer. In any event it is a defective product. I noticed others had same problem when I read reviews before buying. But I felt that these were likely anomalies. Now I think it is likely the norm.</li>
    <li> The triple blade action and microscreen give me a closer shave than with a razor but without the cuts and burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to find these locally. Amazon and Spectrum got them to me quickly.</li>
    <li> It inevitably happens; you are shaving and there&#x27;s a rip in the microfoil so your face looks like you ran through the rose bushes.  Why run around all over town looking for Remingtion replacement screen and blades?  Item works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I got the product faster then i imagined. The product itself is unfourtunately a requirement for the model i have since it&#x27;s really a piece of junk, badly designed and flimsy.</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve seen in a long time for a set of replacement cutters and foil. Fit perfect and I&#x27;m back up and shaving.</li>
    <li> Made my razor new again.</li>
    <li> This is my third set of replacement blades for the razor. For some strange reason the foil randomly pops up and off.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised &amp; even with shipping cheaper than Wal-Mart</li>
    <li> Never lied this razor but the new head seems to work well now. Makes me think I had a factory duff from the start</li>
    <li> direct fit, little different mold, but they&#x27;re fine.  Bought two spares, one for mine, one for my teenage son.  Easy to change out.  Triple microscreen is better than the dual</li>
    <li> You cant find these in the usual stores, so whats the point of buying the razor and then having to trash it because you cant find replacement screens?  I bought a couple from the remington website, until I tried Amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised the price was significantly lower than remington and the delivery was fast.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> works like original equipment !</li>
    <li> Fits exactly and works flawlessly with my electric shaver. Just replace the inner 3 cutters and the screen and your done.</li>
    <li> Received item as advertised.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades are just fine. They work like the originals for the most part.  The screen feels a little better, and as expected, they take a little bit of run time to break in.  The delivery time was really fast, and the price was good.  Only wish they would seat a little bit better, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem after I switched the blades around.</li>
    <li> Yes, if you are trying to find replacement blade units for any small appliance (such as a shaver), you best buy the brand name. Then the  purchase will be a success and you&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Amazon does a great job  providing all the pertinent info for you to compare your needs with the product info. Sometimes a model number is not enough. A good image always helps.</li>
    <li> It was very fast and easy to use this replacement kit. Razor now performs like new. Extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Blades worked as expected. I have been looking for replacements for several months in stores to no avail. Glad to find them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades.</li>
    <li> The foil design has changed and I don&#x27;t think it delivers near as good a shave as the older type.</li>
    <li> As advertised but at a much better price than other avenues. Will purchase through here again when necessary to do so.</li>
    <li> I had my oldest Remington for 20 years! Was thi right time to by a new one! And is very nice and to use, thank You for excellent service!&lt;br /&gt;Ricardo Hirsch&lt;br /&gt;Be Happy</li>
    <li> My razor is like brand new. I have not yet experienced any of the problems with the head flying across the  bathroom that i read about before purchasing but then I haven&#x27;t had it very long- check back!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very easy to replace; My shaver is like new again I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It renewed the great performance of my electric razor.  I had accumulated a couple holes in the shaving screen which were irritating.</li>
    <li> They do a good job, but could last longer. I do like that the screens and cutters can be replaced one at a time versus all three.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the weird gap it leaves for my model even though it doesn&#x27;t impede performance and arguably makes the guard easier to remove for cleaning.  Also, I&#x27;m not too impressed with the smoothness of the guard over the one I just replaced after 2 or 3 years, but it is an improvement.</li>
    <li> The blades have lasted for over a year now. The metal screen cover for them also has held up. I found using Remington&#x27;s spray lubricant for the blades helps to reduce the tearing of the metal screen cover, which is why I had to buy these replacement blades in the first place.</li>
    <li> Not always easy to find replacement screen &amp; blades but always fin on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Arrived before projected date.  Product was as expected. would recommend product and supplier.</li>
    <li> Have ordered several of these.  Quality is good.</li>
    <li> I had one heck of a hard time trying to locate replacement blades and screen for my Remington F5790. I found these perfect replacements on Amazon for a reasonable price.  Easy to swap out with the old blades and screen.  I used compressed air from an &amp;#34;Air Duster&amp;#34; canister (used on my keyboard) to clean out the dust/powder/whiskers from the motor mechanism and now my razor shaves just like it was new again!  So far it&#x27;s been just over 6 months and these blades and screen still work like new. (I do blow out the screen and blades on a weekly basis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These are made in China but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker to me.</li>
    <li> These do not fit properly,  They pop out after a few seconds of shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product for a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> works great if you shave everyday--if i wait 3 days it won&#x27;t cut some of the longer hairs, so i finish with hand razor. For the price i&#x27;m very satisfied and and over the years this is my 5th set.</li>
    <li> yet nice buy for the price you should get one, easy to attach and not one issue at all with this</li>
    <li> This replacement screen doesn&#x27;t fit as snug as the original set so whenever I try to clean it out without removing it, it pops open a bit. Kind of annoying, but not a big deal.  So far so good.  Only have had it on for 4 months.</li>
    <li> These are the manufacturers replacements and I don&#x27;t have to hunt them down at a store or drive to find them.</li>
    <li> Second time purchased. Exactly what I want. Came quick. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> after putting in the item I needed in search bar this item came up and was sent to me but when I got it they didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Best price I could find on this, even though I really only wanted the foil screen due to my old being damaged</li>
    <li> These Remington cutters and shield are new factory original replacements and are exactly what I wanted to perk up my dull razor..</li>
    <li> On  the  one  hand, I feel comfortable  with  the  product  and  delivery  of  this.&lt;br /&gt;But.&lt;br /&gt;Just  I  think  or  wonder  if  the machine  have  a  blade  on  its  side  because  the  company  does  not  include  this  in  this  set?&lt;br /&gt;So  my  machine  is  not  in  good  condition  as  should  be  at, after  that  I  spend  money  for  this</li>
    <li> If I had to do it all over again I would just have bought a new razor. This razor new on e-bay is cheaper than the replacement blades. These that came however, work well.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Good price for replacement head &amp; screen.</li>
    <li> I usually order two of these for my husband.  He is supposed to let me know when he openes the second package.  Well he didn&#x27;t.  So he was really using a broken screen.  Ouch.  Ordered these and they came very quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t a prime member then.  Love Amazon&#x27;s shipping.</li>
    <li> It did not fit well in the machine, i have to put a tiny piece of paper to fill a space and in that way the replacement won&#x27;t get off</li>
    <li> Replacement easy to install and works well. Order received promptly also. A good buy.  JackK</li>
    <li> The screen is only as good as the razor it was made for. The razor is at best an 3-star. What am I to do, wife of 50 years gave it to me?</li>
    <li> I order this for my husband.. His screen had a small knock in it and I decided to try replacing the screen and blades instead of buying a new razor.  Now it&#x27;s like a brand new razor!</li>
    <li> Genuine replacement parts, fit and works perfectly, reasonable price compared to manufactures price. Would definitely recommend this replacement screen and blades for the Remington razor.</li>
    <li> original replacement part works fine</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Delivered quick too.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband needed at a price he was willing to pay.  It works and you can&#x27;t ask for better than that,  Believe me, making my husband happy isn&#x27;t easy but he loves the blades and screen so Remington -- GOOD WORK.</li>
    <li> My husband got this to replace his that had a small piece chip off his screen. He uses this Daly so has to replace often. The price here is as good as Walmart and it is in stock!</li>
    <li> Great product, razor works as new. This is a genuine Remington part so  guess that&#x27;s why it works so well</li>
    <li> my husband was happy that i order it for him</li>
    <li> screen ripped after a month even using Shaver Saver and I don&#x27;t use the shaver everyday</li>
    <li> Shaver is as good as new with the replacement Screen and Blades</li>
    <li> Simply put. They replaced my broken screen and older blades perfectly. No problems. The packaging looked just like the one shown here. I know a few other sellers are showing the same blades in different packages with the same numbers, but don&#x27;t know if there is any reason for that.</li>
    <li> It proved to be of good quality and performed well.  I would recommend this product for your Remington Series 5 or 7 razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased a replacement screen and blades from the Remington website, and at first they worked great, but then the screen began to pop loose such that it was just riding the blades unsecured. I finally had to tape the ends to keep it in place until I cleaned the shaver. I doubt that the replacement from Amazon would be any better. I am now opting to just get a better designed shaver rather than risk putting more money into this Remington that I am using now. I only purchased this shaver a little over a year ago. The original screen that came with the shaver never had this problem, so I think that there is a flaw in how the replacement is manufactured.</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t shave with anything except a Remington electric. He always keeps blade and screen replacements handy. Nice to be able to order them without running all over town.</li>
    <li> Great replacement to my oem original. Perfect fit for replacement. Great Price.  Eight more words needed to complete form thanks</li>
    <li> AS SOON AS I RECEIVED MY REMINGTON MY Sp390 REPLACEMENT SCREEN AND BLADES I IMMEDIATELY GOT A GREAT SHAVE . THESE BLADES ARE JUST WONDERFUL THEY GIVE A VERY CLOSE SHAVE...IM VERY HAPPY WITH IT!!</li>
    <li> this will be the third replacement head in a little over a year, I am very carful and clean after each use but never get over 5 months wear.</li>
    <li> I have purchased replacement blades and screens about 5 or 6 tiems for my eelctric razor.  Never had an issue with fit, and the razor has lasted for a few years already with no sign of stopping.</li>
    <li> Bought new razor head and it is perfect fit. Was very easy to change and really improved my shaving experiance</li>
    <li> Needed to replace my worn out screens on my Remington electric razor. Went by Wal-Mart, thinking &amp;#34;this should be a snap&amp;#34;, however they did not carry these particular replacement screes or blades. Purchased this item on Amazon, received it in two days, and I&#x27;m back shaving again.</li>
    <li> I felt like the screen fell apart rather quickly</li>
    <li> 4 months later and i have to buy another one. Not happy!</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped quick</li>
    <li> After two years, my Remington 5790 had been performing poorly despite frequent replacement of screen and blades, at great cost.  This time, the new screen and blade assembly came apart the first time I used it.  The plastic mount separated at both ends of the screen and it stung my skin.  That was the last straw... I trashed the razor and the new screen/blades I just bought, went shopping on Amazon and bought a Norelco that had good reviews.  No more Remingtons!</li>
    <li> These blade replacements are for his Remington electric shaver and he thinks they are great.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is always such a good place to buy them.</li>
    <li> I have been using my replacement blades and screen for a little over two months and the screen is already frayed and needs to be replaced. The original screen lasted for almost one year. Perhaps this one is defective? If not, this was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When I brought the issue to Amazon, they replaced my blades and screen at no cost. I was amazed by their customer service. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> As replacement parts for multiple model numbers, it fit and does the job.  However, it was not an exact match to the parts i replaced.</li>
    <li> I find these difficult to find in local stores, and expensive. It was great to be able to buy them on-line with fast device. They are great.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband needed! Fast and easy to deal with! A+++</li>
    <li> 1 of 2 packages crushed and foil damaged.</li>
    <li> Item as described...fast delivery!</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased with the cost</li>
    <li> I have had my shaver for 3 years and is working great. once, maybe twice a year I buy these blades which are no longer sold in store so I come here to buy. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have gotten screen/blade replacements several times for my Remington razor from Target, but this one I got off of Amazon was a different build, and it does not shave as well, meaning as close.  It now takes longer to shave.</li>
    <li> I believe these may have been counterfeit!</li>
    <li> I needed a new single foil and bought this set as the replacement.  It arrived a couple days early and it&#x27;s a manufacturer replacement so it fit perfectly.  I&#x27;ll buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Replacement screen is great.  Have not tried the blades.</li>
    <li> They are exactly what I need.  These blades are very difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> New blades and a new screen really improved the shave.  I like the foil razor much more than the rotary razors I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for my razor, good price too</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet--it&#x27;s a spare !</li>
    <li> Great price and you need to change these on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> One of the screens was broken.</li>
    <li> Always to expectations. Never have failed me yet. Keep up the good services. I&#x27;m running out of nice things to say...</li>
    <li> Arrived just days after I ordered it.  There were no issues or problems.  Wish life were that simple.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for and it has aided in the repair of my Remington unit to its original condition</li>
    <li> Great product. S sometimes hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> I really needed these replacement blades and screens quickly, and this seller delivered.  I know the product is reliable, and the seller is too...I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The replacement shaver screen and blades I received are exactly what I ordered at a good price and with prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> What can I say? the blades are good as usual.  They last me about 4-6 months typically.</li>
    <li> I forgot how well my shaver used to work!</li>
    <li> we received it fast, works great , thank you</li>
    <li> great replacement screen and blades!</li>
    <li> It was an exact replacement set so works like new, will definitely order another one when I need another set.</li>
    <li> I am missing an item: Remington shaver spray</li>
    <li> Good service, good price&#x27;</li>
    <li> cuts as good as when it was new</li>
    <li> another great remington product, its always good to get the original item for your shaver, taken a little longer for post then expected, but other then that the product works great.</li>
    <li> It is exactly the same as original.  Easy to replace, comfortable shave.  Hard to find in stores, so online was the best option.</li>
    <li> these probably work as well as the razor they fit onto. The reason I bought a Remington was less expensive maintenance over all. It&#x27;s not worth it. Just get a Braun and suck it up as far as the cost goes. And smile when you shave.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect, easy two in stall. would order this iteam again when needed in the near furture. Would recamend it tow a friend or family.</li>
    <li> Found this replacement on amazon, this was what I needed and cheaper then the one Remington wanted, very easy install and very happy all around.</li>
    <li> Good price. Shipped on time. Received ASAP. Happy Customer.</li>
    <li> Made my Razor like new.  I would and have suggest this to my dad and brother who have the same razor.</li>
    <li> Received the order quickly. Good customer service. Product wise I was a little disappointed. The Remington razor I have is probably 2 years old and the screen and blades lasted as long. I replaced these new screen and blades in April,6 months ago. The new screen is deteriorating already, (small holes where the screen is breaking). I quess they do not make them like they use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul R. Cribb&lt;br /&gt;ME GREETINGS LLC</li>
    <li> Perfect replacements, inexpensive and promptly delivered.</li>
    <li> Direct replacement for my razor. Dropped with in and installed without a problem, and work good as new. I probably should have bought a second set since I can&#x27;t find the replacements in stores.</li>
    <li> It is so convenient to get all stuff I have to run to the store for, online! Also the price is great!</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly - smooth surface - no issues - would recommend for others with the appropriate razor type.  Purchased two packages.</li>
    <li> The foils on this razer do not last long.  However each of the three foils can be removed separately.  This kit allows me to extend the life of the razer head by replacing one foil at a time.  I like this. I will by this produce again and again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I needed to get shaving again!was easy to fined and order.and was here in a matter of days,so I was not with out for long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased not only with the product but also the entire process.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and was very happy to find these replacement blades</li>
    <li> replacement parts fit and work exactly as expected</li>
    <li> Keep up the good work</li>
    <li> Worked fine with my razor.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED 3  SP-62s  no spSp390 !!!</li>
    <li> I looked all over for replacement screen and blades, but turned to amazon and found them at a very good price.  I am a regular buyer on amazon and they have always had what I was looking for, shipped as promised, and merchandise arrives in good shape.</li>
    <li> It is a cheap knock-off, very poorly made. The plastic frame that does not latch to the shaver. It simply does not work.</li>
    <li> made my razor like new</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised; fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Works just like the original. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are the replacement blades for my husbands razor and they are a good price at amazon. My husband really likes this razor and the blades are hard to find. I always keep a back up set as well :0)</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly, great shave.  I&#x27;m going to order another set to have for backup.  I definitely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my dad&#x27;s razor.  He was happy they arrived right in his mailbox.</li>
    <li> Arrrived when it was due to, Fitted and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and was delivered in a timely manner...</li>
    <li> Prompt service.&lt;br /&gt;Product does the job very well.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, I&#x27;m not sure if I got the wrong size or what but just working for me.</li>
    <li> Saved about $8.00 over the cost of going direct to Remmington.</li>
    <li> I love I can fix a razor rather than replace it!</li>
    <li> Direct from Amazon works great - just don&#x27;t use one of their suppliers.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, the product was all I expected, thanks</li>
    <li> Item performs as good as the original. Delivery very quick.</li>
    <li> he is very pleased. and the price was right. Is not a knock off, but the real thing and quality</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t fine one in this area so ordered online. Price was good and I can use my razor again. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly with my shaver,but the price should be a little lower but still better than replacing the whole thing?</li>
    <li> considering that I paid $53 for the whole shaver, I would&#x27;ve expected these pieces to be less than $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and, I did NOT expect the OEM carrier to break in less than 1 year !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need the foil heads, nor the new blades, but will keep them as spares...</li>
    <li> My husband needed this in order to keep his razor going. It works better than ever now that he bought this replacement part!</li>
    <li> The outside piece is lower quality than the original parts.  Everything works fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if others are available.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver for many years and getting the screens and blade at is price is the best.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and customer service.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Price was right and shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than I estimated. Installation is easy, I have done this before however. The difference in the shave is surpriseing. I guess you do not realize how bad the foil and old blades have become.</li>
    <li> It arrived with a crease in one of the screens.  So..I really bought one replacement set for the twice of two.</li>
    <li> Remington product, high quality, replacement parts.  Just too bad the razor overall is no good.  The blades seem like they&#x27;re pushed down too far and don&#x27;t seem to cut that well anymore.  Maybe just time to replace the entire razor rather than the blades and screen.</li>
    <li> Because it got worn out less then a month of having it. I think it should last longer then a month.</li>
    <li> A Great way to keep your razor performing without paying for a whole new razor!  Change the cutters every six months and the foils as needed.  Great Price and delivery time!  VERY SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> For some reason, I cannot buy the replacements from any local stores. Will be ordering more in the future to keep up my Remington razor.</li>
    <li> This product made my electric shaver work as new. I recommend it. I had to order this on line, as it was not available on the shelf in any store.</li>
    <li> This item is a great product at a really good price!</li>
    <li> Great service with good tracking of delivery. Parts were perfect fit for my shaver and shave cut is like new.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of replacement razors provided you have the razor that takes these razor blades. Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> works great.  this is the second set we ordered.  I believe the last set ordered lasted about 2 years</li>
    <li> Fit my razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find at WalMart and other B &amp; M stores. Worked perfectly - no problems in replacing old screens.</li>
    <li> The original cutter screen on My Remington sp390 developed a tiny hole after 18 months of everyday usage, and this was the most reasonably-priced replacement I could find.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shaver for a couple of years now. The shave is extremely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of shavers and this one is the most comfortable. The replacement coil and blades I ordered from Amazon made my shaver brand new again.</li>
    <li> This was the first screen and blade change for my F5790 and I was really pleased with the simplicity of the replacement, and the fact that my first shave after the change was very good.  The new screens come pre-mounted in the screen holder and need little or no &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; to give a good shave, unlike the old system of replacing individual screens, which required a week for break-in.  I must say, also, that I was pleased with the original blades and screens as they lasted almost two years.  I&#x27;m hopeful that the replacement set will last as long.  I recommend not only the F5790 shaver but it&#x27;s replacement cutter system.</li>
    <li> another $35 would have bought me a new shaver. remington and braun can sell at a discount because replacement parts are so expensive!!!</li>
    <li> Product was just what I expected. Order was filled and shipped quickly. Good bargain.</li>
    <li> The packaging was in disarray, as stated, but both of the screens and blades were as good as new crisp packaging. Great value!</li>
    <li> The only replacement blade set for my razor. Performing as expected.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades and screens were the same as the originals.  Installation is straight forward and easy.  Very smooth shave with the new parts.  Much nicer to shave now that it doesn&#x27;t feel like my razor is trying to shred my face anymore.  Couldn&#x27;t find these parts in the store.  I guess they would prefer me to just buy a new razor.  That would be like buying a new car every time you need an oil change.  These replacement parts aren&#x27;t that expensive and only took a couple of days to get here.</li>
    <li> Works! The screen tends to have a pin hole after a few months.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected and on time for a good price.</li>
    <li> The screens didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought they would.</li>
    <li> THE REPLACEMENT BLADES FOR THE REMINGTON RAZOR DID NOT GIVE AS GOOD A SHAVE AS THE ONE THAT WAS ON THE RAZOR WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY PURCHASED. I ACTUALLY GOT A SMOOTHER SHAVE WITH THE OLD USED BLADE AND AM SORRY THAT I THREW THE OLD BLADE AWAY.</li>
    <li> Perfect! can&#x27;t find at stores</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and finish. Makes my razor usable again. Only really needed the screen, but the price was right, so might as well replace the blades too.</li>
    <li> One of the better electric shavers and for the price great!</li>
    <li> It does the job. Nothing more &amp; nothing less</li>
    <li> Definitely cheaper than out in town. And the added bonus as a set made it even better. Husband loves the close and clean shave he is getting now that the parts are replaced.</li>
    <li> These  Remington  Sp390  Replacentment  Screen  and  Blades  for  Series  5  are  for  my  exsisting  shaver  and  work well ! !</li>
    <li> This is no longer carried in your Walmarts, Walgreens, Targets...  Thankful that this is available online, otherwise I would have had to purchase another Remington shaver...</li>
    <li> We had a really hard time trying to find these replacement screens at the store where we purchased the shaver, and when we looked around online, this was the best buy.  Item came on time, works perfectly, we&#x27;re very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I buy 3 at a time. Great price compared to other places and shipments on time.  Just an fyi . For some reason if I use water to clean I replace blades sooner than needed. Careful wiping brush across foil, it&#x27;s safer to blow it out. Brush will tear foil. If you take the 3 blades off  it is much easier to clean and they just snap back into place.</li>
    <li> Made the razor seem like new again. Very easy to replace.</li>
    <li> The piece that goes over my ears will start to dig into my head after longer trips to the range.  The tinted glasses scratched pretty easily so now I&#x27;m only left with the clear and yellow lenses.  Still a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the only one I use, electric razors can be a little hard on the face, but I always get a great shave from this one.</li>
    <li> not sure if the screen and blades or the shaver are the problem ... very very loud and poor shave</li>
    <li> I love my Remington and these blades work very well. Nice close shave. My only complaint is that they&#x27;re supposed to last up to 6 months but I have thick stubble and the blades never makes it past three or four months.</li>
    <li> Simple installed and it works. What else do you need?</li>
    <li> Does not fit. The only way I was able to use it without the screens popping out was to hold the assembly onto the top of the razor when in use. They will not clip into place. This ends up being extremely uncomfortable and subjects them to damage when they come off all of the time.</li>
    <li> the razor is a trifle hard to clean but the shave is excellent especially if you use a before shave lotion and new screen etc every 6-9 months</li>
    <li> The Amazon automatic delivery is very convenient , and priced a bargain</li>
    <li> replacement blades work great</li>
    <li> Excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding heads in my area, and they said they would be much more expensive if they had them.</li>
    <li> I could not get this to fit the shaver, kept coming off when I tried to use it. I should have purchase original parts for this one.</li>
    <li> Factory made parts fit perfectly and performed great!</li>
    <li> The product appears to be as advertised.  It fits nicely into the shaver and works just fine, though perhaps not quite as closely as does the corresponding Remington tilt rotary shaver.  Let&#x27;s just hope it lasts longert than the original item that came with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Timeliness and quality as expected</li>
    <li> my original review was not a positive one due to the length it took to receive the product,however I was contacted by customer service via e-mail and they were very sorry and concerned about the unfortunate delay in the shipping process.I can only as a result give them a positive review due to the fact that they resolved the shipping charges that I paid to expedite the order and as a result am  very thankful that their are companies that care about the customer.Thank you and I wish you continued success.I will be ordering again when the time deems.</li>
    <li> Had to re-use the old foil holder. The new one supplied didn&#x27;t seem to want to snap into the shaver, other than having to transfer the foils into the old holder all seemed to work well.</li>
    <li> I got it on time and it works great matched up to my shaver great! Five more words required. Add one. Got this in the mail again this is the third one I have bought from this company and it works GREAT! I WILL BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and offered a nice shave. I have been unable to find these replacement parts at any of the local chain stores, so Amazon made it easy.</li>
    <li> Arrived well ahead of promised date.  Original Remington product, so it naturally fit perfectly.  The individual foils can be removed from the replacement &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; and inserted in the current shaving head to replace a bad foil.  You don&#x27;t have to throw away good screens just because one foil is bad.  It&#x27;s too bad that Remington doesn&#x27;t sell screens only.  We buyers are paying for a plastic &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; that only serves as a transport vehicle most of the time.  I recommend you buy TWO of these items when ordering.  The shipping only went up 1 cent.  The first item ships for $4.50!</li>
    <li> I was getting frustrated with my razor. I knew I needed a new foil, but thought it wasn&#x27;t staying together. This fixed all the issues and the razor works again.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves a few times a week.  He had ordered from the same company before.  They fit his shaver just fine with no problems.  With his thick hair, the foils and blades hold up good.  Usually he gets a good 10-12 months use out of the blades before he has to replace them.  He does not clean the blades often, so I&#x27;m pretty sure he would get longer use if he cleaned them frequently.  He definitely complains when the foils crack and scratch his face.  I don&#x27;t think these blades hold up as well as the original blades.  But then again that might go back to cleaning the blades and foil.  For the price we paid, that is a whole lot cheaper than the store price if you can even find them in stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this item cause I needed it. They don&#x27;t last long,  about six months. They are also kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you need them, you need &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is a different manufacturer but slight different feeling on build.  Still fits and functions as original part.</li>
    <li> The replacement parts were very easy to install.  However, the foil carrier design differed from the original and did not completely seal the cutter chamber, unlike the original foil carrier.  This allowed hair cuttings to escape onto hands and shirt while shaving.  I removed the individual foils frpm the new carrier and inserted them into the original carrier.  They fit perfectly and the shaver is now performing OK.</li>
    <li> The biggest piece of junk.  Foil lasted just several weeks, after last one lasted just several months. Razor is terrible as well</li>
    <li> Was able to extend the life of my shaver at a reasonable cost.  This new head fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> it is exactly as advertised. more than meets expectations. I don&#x27;t care to write any more words. it is for a shaver!!</li>
    <li> These replacement screens and blades work great. I just wish they would last a little longer then what they do.</li>
    <li> excellent product, product as stated - excellent service! A+</li>
    <li> Blades &amp; screen worked very well.</li>
    <li> aEg - Great product; great price; prompt delivery; great shave</li>
    <li> The Remington Shaver and replacement blades and foils are great and just what I needed and wanted.</li>
    <li> Product came as promised and quickly.  Replacement was easy and it works as I expected.  You don&#x27;t realized how dull the old blades are until you change them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Husband was able to revamp his razor and get it working well. (Ordered a second razor for any future problems LOL)</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Was skeptical but really easy!</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;m happy with the product. it meets my expectations.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
    <li> Great replacement minus the price.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, product exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with the original blades and screen for years.  I had just got used to the old blades and just kept using them.  Well, the new blades and the screen that I really needed to replace gave me a new face, right, and a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Sizing change (thinner elements) from previous replacement blades through Amazon now yields a closer, less irritating shave&lt;br /&gt;Should maintain sharpness over a year of daily use.</li>
    <li> Excellent - works same as original</li>
    <li> I really liked it and I&#x27;m satisfied. It came very fast. It&#x27;s not the first time that I&#x27;ve bought something here and it always comes fast.</li>
    <li> I love the closer shave I got with this new blade.It is easy to install even for an old fogie like myself.</li>
    <li> good replacement blades. Much better razor than Norelco which I used for years, but replacemnts for Norelco blades became cost porhibitive and this razor wa less expensive and give a better shave.</li>
    <li> Blades get dull in 3+ months.  Need better steel and materials</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t cut as well as the original.</li>
    <li> Getting these is Just like getting the whole razor brand new again for a lot less cost. Easy to replace too</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Thanks for the quick service</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t open the package until 28-Jan-2014 and the shaver screen was torn down one side.  I would like my money back, or a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
    <li> Work fine just like I thought they wood made the razor shave like it was knew. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Remington razor, but when the razor blade had a defect, we were able to quickly find replacement blades on Amazon. This was definitely more cost-effective to replace the blades than the razor.</li>
    <li> Works fine with Remington shaver.</li>
    <li> This was quite a buy! These parts are hard to find in the retail stores, and when you do you have to pay a double price.</li>
    <li> My poor husband had tried to get a bit more life out of his razor, but his face was not happy.  Thanks to Amazon, al lis well!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my F5790!</li>
    <li> None of the stores in my area sell these. They work fine on my shaver and I plan to buy again when I need to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;These are not cheap imatations.  They are sharp and they work.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Good value</li>
    <li> Great replacement part for my razor. Perfect fit and reasonable price for much needed item. Very happy with purchase and the delivery.</li>
    <li> THE SCREEN ON THIS PRODUCT IS TRASH IT DID NOT LAST ONE WEEK I AM VERRY DISSATIFED WITH THIS .THANK YOU LARRY LUTINSKI</li>
    <li> just as the stars depict</li>
    <li> Replacing the blades and screen could not have been easier. The screen on the original shaver had developed a small hole. with this replacement system the razor is just like new.</li>
    <li> A perfect fit for my Remington, working like new again.</li>
    <li> Handling could be better,one section of the foil was damaged,I was able use one section of the old foil,otherwise it was okay.</li>
    <li> Head cover will not stay attached to razor.  Had to tape it to razor to make it stay on.</li>
    <li> Still not sure if its working optimally, nonetheless, it is exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Worked as stated, cheaper than others we looked at</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These came in perfect working order, and were easy to replace on the razor. They definitely make an older electric razor like new.</li>
    <li> one of the screens was damaged ordered 2 sets . The other one was good.</li>
    <li> Perfect as it was just what I needed.  It fits fine but the screen is a bit tougher to get off the shaver then the original currently is.  I can&#x27;t remember if the original screens were that way when new.  It is not a big deal.  I mentioned it only because I saw another reviewer had a slight difference in the way they fit as well.  Worse case would be use the original part and only replace the screen and blade as the screens do snap on/off the plastic piece.  The blades snapped on easy.  The easiest to replace Remington blades I&#x27;ve ever had so that was a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Friday afternoon.  It came in the mail the next day via Prime shipping.  That is outstanding Amazon!</li>
    <li> My husband has had this razor for 5 years and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blades worked great. Good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The parts all work but don&#x27;t fit as snug as the originals.</li>
    <li> This is the best place to find replacement blades for my husband&#x27;s razor. The price is as good as I have seen anywhere.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping and quality merchandise.  Can&#x27;t ask for much more</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what we were looking for.  The shaver now works better than ever.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy installation</li>
    <li> This product fits my razor perfectly (both the screen and the blades). The material is of good quality and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I just wish this replacement product was not so expensive; you can almost buy a new razor for the same price.</li>
    <li> I have tried several shavers and this is the least of all evils. It cuts good while it is sharp but is has little durability maintaining the sharp edge.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for about two years and I like Remington very well. This razor has three cutting heads is much faster than the two cutting heads. This razor takes the SP390. Love it</li>
    <li> Good value for very hard to find item. quick delivery. No problems</li>
    <li> I checked serial stores for this assembly and Amazon was the answer.  A quick look at the website and it was on its way and at a good price.</li>
    <li> The replacement screens and cutters bring the shaver back to it&#x27;s original condition. Same close shave I am looking for.</li>
    <li> it Worked  great and fit the shaver just as described on the package. It was very hard to open though.</li>
    <li> Nothing beat a Remington electric shaver. These blades do the job for at least a year. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I contacted the seller multiple times to explain that the foils keep popping off during use. He offered a return for an unopened and unused item. I explained again that the product was defective and how could I know this this without using it. He then made the same offer and I again explained. I am yet to get any positive response aobut getting a replacement part and have foils that keep popping off during use. I will not recommend this seller to anyone unless he finally steps up to back up his product.</li>
    <li> Two days and I had a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Ron</li>
    <li> They are replacement blades for my razor. Bought these over a year ago, so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s just showing up now to rate. They fit. They are replacement parts. Do I really need to say any more?</li>
    <li> When I recieved the item it was in original pkg and in brand new condition. I did use the shaver a few times, when I was having problems with the screen staying in place. It seems that the one side where it clicks into position has warped. Now it does not stay on and I am have to jam it on with a piece of toothpick in order for it to stay. I do not know if this will resolve my problem but I would have to say that the replcement is not as good a quality as the orginal. If someone does read this please contact me.</li>
    <li> Product is satisfactory, and meets expectations.</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and blades work very well.</li>
    <li> Makes my razor good as new.</li>
    <li> Great price  What else can I say they do what the are supposed to do they are after all only shaver blades.</li>
    <li> Package states&amp;#34; mfg&#x27;d. in PRC to Remington specifications&amp;#34;  Hogwash!  The replacement screen is a poor knockoff of the original.&lt;br /&gt;It is of much lighter construction and fails to fit the body securely.</li>
    <li> After replacing the screen and blades of my rechargeable shaver, it feels just like brand new again. It takes about a few days to adjust to the new blades but after adjusting to the blades, the shaver works like it just came out of a brand new box!</li>
    <li> product works and installed easy ..</li>
    <li> Good price and easy to  replace .</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Came in 2 days!!</li>
    <li> Great shave with new Screen and Blades.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these screens for a couple of years. They are a great replacement, the screens do not have to be transferred to the old screen holder like my previous shaver. I did notice some loss in quality in the previous replacement, I actually heard the screen break while shaving. I am hoping his screen is better.</li>
    <li> The screens work great.  Unfortunately,I can not locate the plastic head the screens mount into.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for part for some time. SATISFIED</li>
    <li> It may be easier to go out and buy a new razor rather than messing around with these replacement screens and blades.  The screen and blades are fine, it&#x27;s the plastic piece that holds the screens in place that doesn&#x27;t fit the razor correctly.  It doesn&#x27;t fit tightly enough and pops off while shaving.  I did read the previous reviews and saved the previous plastic piece, and now the razor is fine.  This is the second time I replaced the screens and didn&#x27;t have a problem the first time.  I&#x27;m not sure what has changed.</li>
    <li> On time And original part.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my razor. Great price. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Delivered early and worked as promised. Saved Money Too.</li>
    <li> The blades lasted me for 2 months , witch is a lot longer than others blades I have brought. I use this shaver to shave my face and head.&lt;br /&gt;My 2 sons also will use it ever once and a while. The blades has lasted a lot longer than others i have brought.</li>
    <li> What it was supposed to be</li>
    <li> This is the exact item that I needed.  The old one was cutting my husband&#x27;s face.  Thank you for the quick service.</li>
    <li> I could not find this item in any store at all.  I was tired of cutting my face all to pieces because my razor blade covers had holes in them from wear and tear.  I did not want to spring for a new razor when this one works perfectly.  The new blades and covers have done the job.</li>
