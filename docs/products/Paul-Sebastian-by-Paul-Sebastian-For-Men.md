<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Husband has been using this scent and likes it.  He buys this size bottle and refills a smaller size spray bottle.</li>
    <li> used a funnel to pour into a spray bottle we had. It&#x27;s not expensive, but it works well with my husbands body chemistry and smells wonderful.   Sometimes I spray it when I am missing him (he works overnight) and don&#x27;t feel guilty about wasting it.   It is a large bottle, my suggestion is to use it as a refill, like we did and enjoy. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone standing there trying to dab it on like I am assuming one is supposed to.   If you want a fragrant, refreshing cologne try this. The price is unbelievable and the quality appears to be the same as any other one we&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I product was package very good. The product was delivered on time. I have used this brand a number of years as my daughters originally gave it to me for a birthday present.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellent price!</li>
    <li> The purchase and delivery experience could not have been any better. GREAT value, GREAT service.</li>
    <li> Paul S is one one my old time favorites, a little strong on the patchuli smell, but i cut it another scent to make it milder.  Great price on a great cologne.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; been using it for years.  It&#x27;s a nice, clean scent.  I wear it almost everyday and any time of day even though it&#x27;s suggested you wear it in the evening.  Get lots of compliments.  I only wish I would had realized this was not a spray cologne which is really what I wanted.</li>
    <li> We received this product in a very timely matter without any problems. The quantity and quality is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been asked many times what colone I was wearing, and received many comlements over the years,  while wearing Paul Sebastian.  This was also a Great Price!</li>
    <li> PS is my favorite men fragrance.  Not to mention all those that have complimented my choice of fragrance!</li>
    <li> my favorite scent. came super fast too. love it</li>
    <li> I generally do not wear much cologne, because most colognes and aftershaves are so overwhelming that they are a turn off. I decided to buy this product after my girlfriend recommended it as one she liked. Now I understand why. It is not so heavy as to cause someone an alergic reaction, but is light and pleasant and seems to last all day. I would recommend this product to any man who wants to have a clean scent that isnt to heavy.</li>
    <li> I was more than satisfied with the Paul Sebastian fragrance I ordered the mens cologne via Amazon.com. This was the second time I ordered this product,via Amazon.com. This product is no longer widely carried by the local department stores. I don&#x27;t understand why not. Nonetheless, the product has been widely praised by my wife and others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but WOMEN love the smell....men hate it.  My recommendation....BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I rely on my wife of almost 48 years for many things and the selection of Cologne is just one...she really likes Paul Sebestian.  As a Eucharistic Minister at my Church (Catholic), even the Cardinal made a comment recently that he really liked my Cologne.  The cost from Amazon is the lowest ANYWHERE.....you cannot go wrong....buy more than one...that&#x27;s what I did!     ps....I like Paul Sebestian too!  DEERCHASE</li>
    <li> I stick with what I like.  I have been using PS for years.  Wife loves it.  Lasts all day and night.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for the fast shipment and quality of the Paul Sabastian Cologne. The bottle was huge. The only problem is that I thought it was the spray cologe and it wasn&#x27;t, but that was my bad. I found a spray gadget that fits the bottle and it&#x27;s all good. It will last him forever and we both LOVE IT! thanks again</li>
    <li> Great price for a real good product. Quick shipping, couldn&#x27;t be happier,</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was wearing this about 10 year ago and I asked him what it was. He told me, and I have been wearing it ever since. Has such a great fresh smell...not heavy, not feminine. Smells like no others either.    I can honestly say I have never met a woman that it didn&#x27;t like it, and have also had a numerous men ask me for the name.     This 8 ounce bottle is the best bargain anywhere. I bought a 4 ounce spray bottle a few years ago and just refill it using this size.    As far as the #1 best cologne...SURFACE BY ARAMIS. But they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Pleased with product and fulfillment of this order.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon sells this don&#x27;t buy it it seems like its a great deal, but really your paying all that money for something that you would just trash as soon as you get a whiff of it.... DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Paul Sebastian By Paul Sebastian For Men, Cologne (8 Ounces)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using PS Cologne for over 20 years. I recently ordered some from Amazon when I noticed their discounted price.The cologne arrived either over its expiration date or after it was exposed to extreme temperatures.There was a faint scent overpowered by an alcohol odor.Amazon credited my card immediately without question. Thank you Amazon. No thanks to the supplier.</li>
    <li> Smells great for my father</li>
    <li> Very strong alcohol smell, tbe box has no plastic paper sealing.</li>
    <li> ____________BUYERS BEWARE________      I RECENTLY ORDERED 2 BOTTLES OF PAUL SABASTION COLOGNE.  PRICE WAS $17.77.  WHEN THE ITEM WAS SHIPPED THE PRICE HAD JUMPED TO $21.88.  AMAZON STATED THEY HAD TO CHARGE CURRENT PRICES AT TIME OF SHIPMENT.  THEY STILL HAVE THE SAME ITEM PRICED AT $17.77 ON THEIR WEB PAGE.  WHAT IS WRONG HERE AND HOW MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for many years, and I often get compliments. To me it is somewhat spicy. It works for me so I plan to keep on using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for over 30 years and don&#x27;t plan on changing now.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of Paul Sebastian Cologne, and I was running out. The Amazon price was great, so I decided to order it. When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the bottle doesn&#x27;t have a spray, the bottle is huge. It is twice as big as the previous one that I was replacing that had cost as much elsewhere. I poured half into the spray bottle that I already had, and I still have enough for another refill.</li>
    <li> The fragrance lasts all day and is subtle not over powering when used sparingly.  The smell is a little bit dated but pleasant just the same.    The only complaint I have is the bottle I purchased is not a spray bottle but that is a result of buyer haste.  Check product description carefully if this is important to you.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT A GOOD COLOGNE AT ALL I MUST SAY THAT THIS COLOGNE IS AIMED FOR OLD MEN LIKE 60 OR SO I DON&#x27;T EVEN RECOMMEND OLD MEN TO BUY IT ITS HORRIBLE GOOD THING I TOOK A WHIFF OF IT AT A DEPARTMENT STORE BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS. I HAD IT ON MY WISH LIST FOR A WHILE BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS BUT CLEARLY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE HONEST REVIEWS, OR THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WROTE THE REVIEWS ARE OF AGE. AGAIN I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS TO A YOUNGER CROWD OR EVEN A MIDDLE AGE CROWD.</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to come from a company. The product was supposed to be new. Instead it came from an individual. The package was not sealed with cellophane as new Paul Sebastian products are packaged. The box containing the bottle of cologne was well used.I suspect the cologne was an item from someone&#x27;s home and was watered down as the fragrance was weak. I began using Paul Sebastian in the 90s but I will buy the product in a store from now on.I will not use this product since it has been compromised. I will consider the money spent for this product wasted. I would return it but don&#x27;t want to waste more money in shipping cost.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for several decades.  Both men and women constantly stop him and ask what cologne he is wearing because he smells so good.  We&#x27;ve been buying it at various stores and websites, but the Amazon price is the best one we could find, especially if you get free shipping with Prime...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t keep the women off me!  </li>
    <li> I know that most people including myself have tried all types of colonge but, Let me tell you when a friend of mine told me that his father wear&#x27;s Paul Sebastian and how good it smells i said ok, I&#x27;ll check it out! Well; that was 25 years ago. I have never been ask so much by people-WHAT IS THAT YOUR WEARING? I have had people to walk up to me and say; YOU GOT THAT PAUL ON HUH? &amp; i would just smile. Once you encounter someone wearing PAUL SABASTIAN you will be able to reconize that unique smell from anywhere on earth! Go to your store &amp; try it. Paul is my all time favorite; It&#x27;s the only colonge i wear EVERYWHERE![[ASIN:B001JDBVYG COLOGNE SPRAY 4 OZ &amp; AFTERSHAVE 4 OZ &amp; DEODORANT STICK 2.5 OZ PAUL SEBASTIAN by Paul Sebastian]]</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  I order it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!! Excellent!!</li>
    <li> The UPS driver where I use to work always had a great smelling cologne on.  I asked him what he wore and he said Paul Sebastian.  Maybe he used a different version but it definitely didn&#x27;t smell like this.  This stuff smells like something you&#x27;d buy at walgreens...in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Classic men&#x27;s colgne that never goes out of style. Subtle masculine scent that is not unisex.     The seller delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. Price was excellent for a product a really like. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just the best and at a really good price.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  Ergo, as a happily married man, it is also my favorite.  You just cannot beat the scent nor the price.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used PS for several decades now and it goes well with my body chemistry.  I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t help but rate the product 4 stars because it is an excellent value if you like Paul Sebastian...however either I was in a rush and didn&#x27;t notice that this isn&#x27;t a spray bottle or the product description didn&#x27;t mention it. So, if you need a spray bottle don&#x27;t get this one. Additionally, I also discovered that Amazon won&#x27;t process a return for cologne because it is a flammable item.</li>
    <li> Good product, worth buying - the scent faints away within 30-60 minutes though. Easily 4 or 5 stars if lasted longer</li>
    <li> Purchased 8.0 oz. bottle of Paul Sebastian cologne.  Cannot determine if it&#x27;s real or just a cheap immitation.  Based on aroma compared to remains of bottle purchased at a department store, the new bottle just doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  Don&#x27;t know how to verify authenticity of the product purchased on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my Son in law this past Christmas. He said he wasn&#x27;t familer with this product but he sure did like it</li>
    <li> Bought for my father who lives out of state for his birthday...his favorite is Paul Sebastian and I ordered this while on vacation in Mexico...when I came home I called my father who said his gift arrived before his birthday and he is estactic with the large size.</li>
    <li> I love it.  And will buy more plus recommend to all friends.&lt;br /&gt;I am always being asked what it is I am wearing that&lt;br /&gt;smells so good.</li>
    <li> I use this cologne always and get so many compliments as to \\&quot;What am I wearing?\\&quot;  Excellent scent and the price is second to none.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed the smell of this fragrance and found that this was a terrific bargain!</li>
    <li> This is real awful. No scent, nothing, may be scent of alcohol! When I opened box I knew I have a fake on my hand. I have my \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; old Paul Sebastian by Paul Sebastian for Men - 8 Ounce EAU DE COLOGNE DE LUXE\\&quot; that I bought locally from store.&lt;br /&gt;The original, real PS box has the PS Trade Mark, raised stamped on top of black box, the fake one, I mean the one I just received from Amazon, FragranceNet., has nothing, NADA.&lt;br /&gt;The original bottle, the real PS has a little felt that stops bottle from seeping and it seals the bottle, the fake one I received had nothing to seal top of bottle, or anything to prevent bottle from seeping! No wonder more than half the bottle I received, is empty!&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the black box, the PS trade Mark Stamp is all over the back, sides and top of the inside. The fake one has NOTHING. The writing on the outside, on the back, on the original, real PS is longer than the writing on the back of the fake one by 1 and 1/2 CM. This is really bad. Horrible fake. I&#x27;m willing to send pictures to document all what I listed above. This is a crime. Somebody is faking customers and making tons of money. It needs to stop. If Amazon or FragranceNet., are not aware of the fake product and all the signs I listed above, they should stop selling this product and report the person who is selling it to them to authority. I don&#x27;t like it and I don&#x27;t appreciate the fact that I bought it through Amazon, that I trust so much!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Paul Sebastian for years.  We are thankful to be able to buy it on Amazon</li>
    <li> Been using it for years,the price is great, the fragance is very subtle and the woman swoon  What elese can I say</li>
    <li> This was once given to me as a gift and I found that it was a great product so I ordered some more. Everyone comments on the great smell when I put this on.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchased this Cologne. It&#x27;s a good price and the Seller&#x27;s shipping was very good. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> My father use this EDC and he loves it, he doesn&#x27;t change this fragrance, my mom and my siblings are so happy for him, he finally finds his classic Paul Sebastian.</li>
    <li> It says splash but it is actually cologne. An 8 oz. bottle for the price I paid is an awesome buy. Retail stores were charging me 75.00 the last bottle I bought. I bought the cologne and aftershave for less for both of them. A lot less. Try 2/3 the price. I MEAN WHAT A BUY.</li>
    <li> I highly recommed  it to anyone who likes a clean and a professional smell.Next step up is,Tommy Bahama.I would still buy Paul Sebestian because it&#x27;s not over powering and it stays with you all day long.</li>
    <li> A manly scent that women seem to love it... and isn&#x27;t that all that matters? This size is meant to be a refill for a smaller bottle with a pump spray. It&#x27;s a great concept for saving money that never seems to have caught on in the rest of the fine cologne world. PS is now an older scent, which is apparently why you can now get it so inexpensively. I started wearing it back when it was a newer scent over 20 years ago... which tells you how old I am. Every few years I have to break down and shell out the buck for a smaller bottle with the pump spray.     It is not a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; scent. For a change, they aren&#x27;t BSing about the list price being $65. In the \\&quot;olden days\\&quot; I paid that price for this size bottle many a time. Try it... you won&#x27;t be sorry.     And - BTW - I have previously bought this from Amazon (and will again) and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
    <li> Great to be able to find this.</li>
    <li> [...]    outstanding!! Spicy &amp; cool scent that stays. Have been using it for years in the Florida sunshine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this but what I really meant to purchase was the cologne, not the splash.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use this up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is because it was old or if it&#x27;s because it is &amp;#34;De Luxe Splash&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the PS cologne I am used to.  It&#x27;s close enough, but I would not buy this again</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for over 15 years. Continue to get nothing but good compliments. Good body chemistry with me. As long as I get the good compliments, why change.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and I love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of cologne for a great price!</li>
    <li> Yes as you know I have placed several orders from you and will continue . This is the only cologne is the only one my husband likes</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this for 20 years and will not wear nothing else.  He never fails to get a compliment about his cologne when he wears it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have been buying this cologne for my husband for years and this has by far been the best deal.</li>
    <li> Although I love to wear Paul Sebastian, I will not buy this again.    I agree totally with E. N. LaFrance&#x27;s comment. My joy of finding such a \\&quot;bargain\\&quot; price on one of my favorite cologne&#x27;s turned into a big disappointment once it arrived.    The fragrance in this bottle does not smell nearly as robust as the bottle of Paul Sebastion that it replaced. This cologne is either very stale through aging, or it&#x27;s an imitation.     One thing I loved about my old Paul Sebastian is that the scent lasted all day and into the night. Not so with the bottle I ordered here, so my best guess is that it is truly an imitation.</li>
    <li> I have been using Paul Sebastian for over 40 years.  When I first tried it,  I received so many compliments, I knew it was the perfect fragrance for me!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Paul Sebastian for over 25 years.  It is the only men&#x27;s cologne I will wear and I am constantly getting compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 27 year old son.&lt;br /&gt;He absolutely loves this as do I.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of PS, but the splash seems to have a slightly different note than the spray does.  It seems a bit more herbal and a bit less musky.  Plus, I find it hard to put on just the right amount (not too little, not too much).</li>
    <li> Delivered early by storefront, real thing...not a rip off version of paul sebastian, which you have to be concerned about at the price i paid</li>
    <li> Paul Sebastian is my favorite cologne, as well as my wife&#x27;s favorite for me.  The price was worth it for the product, but I wish the bottle had a spray top like it does when purchased in a store.</li>
    <li> not the real cologne. faint smell does&#x27;nt last or look the same. you use 5 times the amount. would not recommend to buy. it pays to buy the real stuff from macys</li>
    <li> Introduced in 1979. Fragrance notes: aromatic spices, hints of sweet florals, citrus plus the richness of soft woods and musk. Recommended use: evening. - I recommend use - anytime - this is a nice cologne that has stood the test of time and is still fine</li>
    <li> I bought it as a Christmas present for my priest who always wears this aroma. I assume he will like it as he wears nothing else.</li>
    <li> For those who like this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was working with a man at work and I could help but notice that me smelled really good.  I asked him what he was wearing and he told me &amp;#34;Paul Sebastian.  I bought some for my husband and he has been wearing it ever since.  That was over 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite splash, and I love it!</li>
    <li> Great price, legitimate product. No sprayer, but you can carefully pour it into a spray bottle. I use the PS bottle from a previous purchase.</li>
    <li> My Dad loves this stuff, he thinks it the best. He puts it on and can fill the room with the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great product,great price,great service.!! My girlfriend really likes this, so what else can you say. If she is happy life is good.</li>
    <li> Great scent from the past just stated using it again great price</li>
    <li> This does not come with a spray on top, but it is so cheap that we buy it regularly anyway. My husband just pours it into a small spray bottle that gives him short spritzes.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  When I met my husband, he used this PS.  I make sure he has plenty on hand.  I had never come across the 8 oz before.  the 4 oz was priced at $50 at a perfume outlet.  This one takes the cake for sure.</li>
    <li> This makes a man smell like a man, not like the girly colognes they have on the market for men these days</li>
    <li> He loves it and he is so happy with the size and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the price.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the value for the size.  I really love the fragrance and it was so easy to find and order on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Though the bottle did not come with a sprayer.  I kept the old bottle and use it as a refill.  Same great quality as the smaller bottle.</li>
    <li> great quality and service</li>
    <li> Great warm and comfortable fragrance without any sharpness or &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> I get these once every few years. I have allergies and can&#x27;t always smell but it does not aggravate them and my wife likes it so I guess that all that matters.</li>
    <li> Super my friend will only wear this cologne, so I order all the time for him</li>
    <li> Excelent buy.....great splash...highly recommend ....last long time</li>
    <li> Great Cologne - Everyone comments on it&#x27;s Fragrance</li>
    <li> I got it for my boyfriend.  I don&#x27;t like strong products and this one is mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It smells very good.  One day someone asked me what I had on because she liked the scent.  I told her it had rubbed off my boyfriend!</li>
    <li> The price that I brought this cologne for was awesome.  This was a gift for my dad and he totally loved it..no complaints here.  Thanks for the fast delievery as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most manly fragrances I have ever come across.  Got this for Christmas two years ago, and didn&#x27;t realize he was running low.  Ordered on line from this seller and will certainly do so in the future!!!</li>
    <li> No more words are needed.  It speaks for itself!!  Liked by both male and females alike and just a little is all you need so your bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> i get so many complements</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great and I get compliments on it all the time. It&#x27;s fairly strong, but nothing obnoxious. Definitely a must buy.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 30 years.and it has been truly one of the best scents ever. A must buy!</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered.  It arrived in a very timely fashion.  The price was unbeatable.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Hi,  I&#x27;ve been using PS for men for over 15 + years and have always got compliments on the fragrance. Last all day, not too strong, not too week... and now with it available on Amazon.com, the best price ever!  Sincerely,  John Young</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this was a knock-off since it was so cheap, but it still smelled good so didn&#x27;t mind. It didn&#x27;t even come wrapped in plastic.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents at a great price - much cheaper than some of the other colognes that are ridiculously overpriced.</li>
    <li> The product is a good quality, sweet perfume. With great quantity that arrive since near and although away to others.</li>
    <li> Everyday idem I use and the price is right.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite so I am not surprised.  Just glad to see that I was mailed the real McCoy.</li>
    <li> My son and grandson wants this every year under the tree. They always smell great!!!</li>
    <li> Not over powering but masculine. compatible with many deodorants and women just love it. Even my X girlfriends call to say they smelled it somewhere and it reminded them of me. This is my scent.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have been using it for over ten years.  I recommend this to anyone who likes a mild scent.</li>
    <li> Women (and some men) have asked me what brand I am wearing.</li>
    <li> My husband favorite cologne at a great price.</li>
    <li> I already had this cologne from PS and I was running low. So I found this one and purchased it. It allowed me to reload my original spray bottle with plenty left! Very good price too!</li>
    <li> Such a great deal on a classic cologne! It&#x27;s not strong or overpowering. It&#x27;s long lasting and clean. My husband always gets compliments when he wears it. A wonderful value!</li>
    <li> This fragrence is exactly like the original that I bought 3 years ago. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my first Paul Sebastian purchase.  I don&#x27;t like the lime scent that many men&#x27;s colognes seem to use as their base scent.  I like Jovan Musk Oil, I used to buy Colours by Julian?, and recently I bought Stetsen.  I know, not very expensive colognes but what I prefer on my man.  I bought this unsampled by my super smeller, but I was in for a real treat!!  I love the smell of it and so does my husband.  To me, this scent is all man and very sexy.  I am not a 21-yr old though and it seems that my daughters prefer the lime scents like CK.  Go figure.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I should have known it was to good to be true.It does not smell like paul sebastian cologne at all and it only last a few seconds not worth the money.[[ASIN:B00021PKFC PAUL SEBASTIAN For Men By PAUL SEBASTIAN fragrance set]]</li>
    <li> I got twice the amount for half the price. A great price for the amount. I will get this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Same thing as sold in the department stores, just a much better price.</li>
    <li> I will be sending more orders to this seller! My friends and I usually spend the full price for Paul Sebastian, but now with this fantastic price, we will get more of this product! Thank you for selling it at this great price!</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past, but had been unable to find it for years until i checked your website</li>
    <li> My husband first got this product as a tiny little sample.  I loved it so much on him, but the bottle was so small I couldn&#x27;t even read the label.  It took me a while to figure out what it was, but I found it on eBay for a great price and bought it.  I love nuzzling my hubby&#x27;s neck when he&#x27;s wearing it.  Yummmm!</li>
    <li> I love the scent- masculine but not overpowering!  I plan to order the atomizer next for my grandson.&lt;br /&gt;I think that I shall use it too!</li>
    <li> we received both intact and just what we wanted.</li>
    <li> DIDNT KNOW THAT IT DIDNT HAVE A SPRAYER ON IT BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS JUST FINE. THANK YOU :)</li>
    <li> This fragrance is like a breath of fresh air, aww. This smells so nice I had to get it for my husband this is the only cologne I&#x27;ll buy him.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the bomb, more comments from this aftershave than any other</li>
    <li> Awesome Perfume, Great price! Doesn&#x27;t get better than this!</li>
    <li> Repeat buy for the 2nd or third time</li>
    <li> Bang for my buck. Smelled exactly how I remembered it. Timeless classic &amp; the scent of how a man should be. I bought it for my husband as part of his Xmas gift package &amp; am totally happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This cologne is basically alcohol. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it! The Best Ever!</li>
    <li> My husband gets compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> I know, scents are personal, and not everyone will like it.  However, not many years back I found mine.  Paul Sebastian has never failed to turn a women&#x27;s head in my direction.  They often will even ask, &amp;#34;What is that fantastic Cologne you are wearing?&amp;#34;  Frankly, I don&#x27;t care what the guys think, as long as the Ladies are turned on by the scent, I&#x27;m wearing it!  Yes, I&#x27;m married, and my wife is so proud of me when she sees it happen.  Yeah, I know it sounds dumb, but it does happen, and surprisingly often.  Women like this cologne.  What more do you want Fellas?  Isn&#x27;t that why you wear a Cologne?</li>
    <li> &#x27;We will buy more when we need it.  It is the only one my husband will wear.  That is it.</li>
    <li> Good product came in a good packaging. Will certainly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific deal at 8 oz for $23.99. I was in Macy&#x27;s and a 2.8 ounce bottle was $30! Such a nice classic fragrance!</li>
    <li> Amazingly low price for this great cologne splash that is usually three times the price at department stores, if you can even find it, well packaged and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with my purchases.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 20 years and never tire of it.  Amazon beat overstock.com&#x27;s price by a few dollars, and the product was much more fresh.  Sometimes I think Overstock intentionally buys older stock at a deep discount because it is not always as potent as it should be.  This purchase from Amazon was perfectly fresh in a sealed box unlike many times I&#x27;ve purchased it at Overstock which often sends it in either unsealed boxes or unboxed altogether.  My next purchase of this product will definitely be done right here!</li>
    <li> great value!  1/2 of what you pay at department stores</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wanted to try this cologne for a long time so I bought it as one of his Christmas gifts. Just a little bit of this goes a long way, and the bottle is huge. It is not a mild scent, it&#x27;s pretty strong in my opinion, but it smells amazing and unique. Unique because the scent isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34;, it smells vintage, like the kind of cologne my grandad would have worn in his day. Despite the grandpa example, it does smell wonderful, and I just love it when my boyfriend wears it. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that it would be this size as I&#x27;ve never seen it this size before.</li>
    <li> This has been my signature fragrance for more than 20 years. I have always receive numerous compliments whenever I am in the company of females for the first time, and more often then not, they make a note of the name so they can pick up a bottle for the man in their life.</li>
    <li> The best on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the 4oz spray (at another Amazon address, not this page) in the past, and it was genuine PS. I came across this 8oz. version, and thought for the price I just had to order it ($24.45 for 8oz?). Should have realized it was too good to be true. First, while the page says it&#x27;s a spray, it became a \\&quot;splash\\&quot; once it got into my cart, which I never noticed (who would?).  So, I didn&#x27;t get a spray. Secondly, it just didn&#x27;t smell like PS. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 25 years, exclusively. So I think I know the product. This one was just not right. Box was not sealed, neither was bottle. Not that that means anything, since there are plenty of legitimate reasons why there might not be any shrink-wrap, or other such seals, and still be legal. But the smell is off. I don&#x27;t know if it was watered down, adulterated, or spoiled (is that possible?). In any event, probably best to avoid this 8oz. version, at least in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Nice spicy sweet fragrance that gets lots of positive comments.</li>
    <li> love this stuff on my hubby</li>
    <li> Hard to write a review about after shave you either like it or you don&#x27;t. I like it seems to last longer than most after shave smells good to.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my stepfather for Father&#x27;s Day and he loved it.  He said the bottle was much bigger than what they sale in the stores.  I am so pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Love this sent, and at a great price</li>
    <li> What a deal on this timeless cologne.</li>
    <li> I think it smells great!!  I always get a lot of compliments when I were Paul Sebastian , for those of you that buy the 8 ounce bottle if you keep your 4 ounce spray bottle you can use a funnel and pour it into the 4 ounce</li>
    <li> Loyal to this brand for many years &amp; still get tons of compliments... scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, just right for everyday use</li>
    <li> Smells so gooooooooood</li>
    <li> This cologne splash smell does not last ,it seems like it could have been a after shave not a cologne,not to happy.</li>
    <li> the best of the best. people always ask me what cologne I am wearing and they tell me it smells really nice. I have never had a single negative response to the scent.</li>
    <li> Ordered this fir my husban but the scent was very weak</li>
    <li> I dont know how to tell expiration dates on cologne but I do feel this might be near the end of its life when received,  I very much like the product and use it so much, I can not smell it,  but constantly get compliments from women and men that it smells good.</li>
    <li> I think this works great.  It&#x27;s about half the price of the store, unless you can find a good sale on it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it doesn&#x27;t come with an atomizer, so I just poured it into two empty PS atomizer bottles I had used before.  My wife is convinced that the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ones from the store (hence only four stars), but I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t last as long, for the price just put more on, or apply it again later on.</li>
    <li> Already using this PS and it is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and he loves it. Also, it cost a lot less to buy this on Amazon than at the department store at the mall.</li>
    <li> Has always been a hit in my house.</li>
    <li> Makes my man smell so sexy.</li>
    <li> This bottle is huige and the price is just right. This is the only cologne my husband can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and I couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing this extra huge size bottle for him as a gift. It was a great price for the product size and quality.</li>
    <li> SMELLS AMAZING! AND FOR A LOW PRICE YOU CANT BEAT IT!</li>
    <li> i have been using this cologne  for 20 plus years&lt;br /&gt;getting compliments all the time&lt;br /&gt;happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
    <li> I get asked what I am wearing by lots and lots of ladies when we pass each other or just waiting in line.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery. No problems.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for years. Loves it and I do too.</li>
    <li> My husband keeps this all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a co-worker of mine who fell in love with this cologne a couple of years ago. The smell is great and the 8oz bottle is a great deal. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> Good old reliable Paul Sebastion</li>
    <li> Great product at the right price.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time user of Paul Sebastian men&#x27;s products.  This de luxe splash&lt;br /&gt;is as good as the other Paul Sebastian products I have used.  Amazon&#x27;s price was&lt;br /&gt;very reasonable for this product.</li>
    <li> this was a splash not a spray which made it too strong when applying...maybe my fault for not reading the description more closely.  the spray can be more easily controlled.</li>
</ol>
