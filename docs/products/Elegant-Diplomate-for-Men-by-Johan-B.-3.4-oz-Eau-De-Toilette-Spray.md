      <li>Thanks to amazon, I&#x27;m able to get it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Some advice go to your local Macys and ask for test strips choose your favorite Cologne and order online $33 compared to 50 some odd dollars great deal  :)</li>
      <li>This has become my new favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>This is a very light soft cologne for men, it is not a over powering smell.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and would recommend to anyone wanting a fresh and not too loud cologne.</li>
      <li>but I love 2013 , good medium long lasting .</li>
      <li>I just received this ship and sold by Amazon for $27.35, I was happy to find that this is the exact same product sold at Macy&#x27;s department store, my Eternity Summer for Men 3.4 ounce box was sealed in cellophane wrap and I knew exactly what it was suppose to smell like because I was just at the mall last night to try it on again and have tried it multiple times at the mall to be sure I would like it.</li>
      <li>Ordered it and the Cologne arrived 4 days later just In time for my date  :)  wore it to school ( lbcc ) and received a couple compliments .</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Great long lasting scent and Wife does loves it.</li>
      <li>Everyone likes the sent and its never too much in foo-foo crowds!</li>
      <li>I bought this without smelling it first having a feeling</li>
      <li>But then I tried the same one at the airport duty free shop and that wore off quickly too.</li>
      <li>This is lovely and they should offer it all the time, not just seasonally or limited edition.</li>
      <li>I also really like Eternity Aqua</li>
      <li>Smells fabolous and  stays strong all day long....</li>
      <li>My gf loves it, other women will love it, guys will ask you what it is and where they can get it.</li>
      <li>CK never disappoints,this is one i&#x27;ll keep in my collection for a while,the only way i can describe the smell is a clean sunrise on the coast.</li>
      <li>A mild to medium intensity clean, fresh cologne with strong base notes of Frangipani and pineapple - smells like sweet magnolias.</li>
      <li>Like some other comments, I have also felt that the perfume is wearing off very quickly.</li>
      <li>Definitely one worth mentioning.</li>
      <li>My only dislike is that its available only in one size.</li>
      <li>soft fresh scent is just enough for a business executive to wear.  </li>
      <li>When I sprayed this cologne it is the exact same smell.</li>
      <li>Order it from Amazon as it will be the exact same product wrapped.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderfully masculine.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s 35 years old</li>
      <li>You can wear a lot and its still a soft scent.</li>
      <li>A great fresh scent for casual everyday wear.</li>
      <li>Specs:&lt;br /&gt;Smell: fresh, pretty similar to eternity aqua but little softer&lt;br /&gt;Longevity</li>
      <li>Two of the main ingedients have been left out.</li>
      <li>other CK colognes, this one is much lighter in body.</li>
      <li>Old, I&#x27;m guessing like it has been on the shelf to long.</li>

<li> I wear this scent all year long.  </li>
<li> Nice fragrance but disappointed in lasting quality.</li>
<li> An alternate slightly longer lasting product is the [[ASIN:</li>
<li> Lasts surprisingly long for an eau de toilette spray, as the smell is literally lingering on everything he wears and every blanket he lies on!</li>
<li> Smell does not stay with you very long.</li>
<li> But the body and dry out just smells like a soap.</li>
<li> For those of you that like the summer product, the scent isn&#x27;t the same as the previous yr&#x27;s product.</li>
<li> Not much for a CK product.</li>
<li> only one of a few who will be wearing this but probably wont be.</li>
<li> The tangerine pulp (smells like they also crushed the pips!) adds a citrus fragrance and provides the cooling (ether like) along with the musk.</li>

    <li> This has become my new favorite cologne.  Everybody seems to like it on me, and I receive lots of compliments.  Very clean and light.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son for his birthday by special request!  It smells wonderfully masculine.  He&#x27;s 35 years old and it&#x27;s a really fresh smell!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance but disappointed in lasting quality. Does not seem to have any linger. Will not reorder. Not much for a CK product.</li>
    <li> This was a good price and quality purchase.  I love the scent and it was a great gift item.  Comes in original packaging.</li>
    <li> I always use eternity and this edition smell awesome. I love it and I have been using it everyday for work.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  After the holidays a couple of years ago I couldn&#x27;t find it.  Thanks to amazon, I&#x27;m able to get it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;The soft fresh scent is just enough for a business executive to wear.  Everyone likes the sent and its never too much in foo-foo crowds!</li>
    <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites so I bought it for him for Father&#x27;s Day. He was very pleased!</li>
    <li> perfect!  Great deal and great product</li>
    <li> I just received this ship and sold by Amazon for $27.35, I was happy to find that this is the exact same product sold at Macy&#x27;s department store, my Eternity Summer for Men 3.4 ounce box was sealed in cellophane wrap and I knew exactly what it was suppose to smell like because I was just at the mall last night to try it on again and have tried it multiple times at the mall to be sure I would like it. When I sprayed this cologne it is the exact same smell. This is a very light soft cologne for men, it is not a over powering smell. I spray once on my chest/neck and twice on my arms, it last all day. It&#x27;s a very nice smell. I saved a lot of money, it sells for $60.00 at Macy&#x27;s so Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent. Order it from Amazon as it will be the exact same product wrapped. I can&#x27;t say what you will get from 3rd party marketplace sellers. I also really like Eternity Aqua both are excellent colognes for men.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting scent and Wife does loves it. One of the better scents offered by Eternity. Exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> Ordered it and the Cologne arrived 4 days later just In time for my date  :)  wore it to school ( lbcc ) and received a couple compliments . Very mild , clean , and fresh smell 18-22 year olds would wear this .  Some advice go to your local Macys and ask for test strips choose your favorite Cologne and order online $33 compared to 50 some odd dollars great deal  :)</li>
    <li> i got it and it smells so good, i hope this spray is not a fake because the price is cheaper than in sephora</li>
    <li> very good my husband love cologne</li>
    <li> I amI using Calvin Klein men cologne from last 20 year they very good. I test summer 2014 at Macy&#x27;s not that impressive but I love 2013 , good medium long lasting . Cologne smell very good in day time after couple  of hours ,infact it stay with your body  and with afternoon breeze it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Amazon thinking they would not sell fake cologne.  The reality is they sold me fake Eternity Summer, and wen I tried to return it, I am not allowed too because they claim it is hazardous.  My question is, If they sent it to me why can I not send it back to them.  Sounds really shady to me. I have purchased other cologne from amazon and its been legit, but this one is nothing but water in a colored bottle.</li>
    <li> A mild to medium intensity clean, fresh cologne with strong base notes of Frangipani and pineapple - smells like sweet magnolias. The tangerine pulp (smells like they also crushed the pips!) adds a citrus fragrance and provides the cooling (ether like) along with the musk. The combination musk and woody notes provide a much needed body to the cologne - though it needs more! Woody notes are very muted and show up late in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is a casual, day cologne and would do well in a warm, slightly humid climate - a combination required to bring out the notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other CK colognes, this one is much lighter in body. An alternate slightly longer lasting product is the [[ASIN:B00803FPZO Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua Eau de Toilette Spray for Men, 6.7 Ounce]].</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne! I love the scent and would recommend to anyone wanting a fresh and not too loud cologne. Although I didn&#x27;t think it lasted all day, when I get home my kids tell me I smell good--13 hours later!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it. Lasts surprisingly long for an eau de toilette spray, as the smell is literally lingering on everything he wears and every blanket he lies on! Smells better than the newer versions of the Eternity line, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Cam just in time for Father&#x27;s  Day.  It was exactly what I ordered. My husband loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> The top smells very fresh, I love it. But the body and dry out just smells like a soap. I will not buy it.</li>
    <li> CK never disappoints,this is one i&#x27;ll keep in my collection for a while,the only way i can describe the smell is a clean sunrise on the coast.</li>
    <li> I use as a daily fragrance,I have owned it for over a month and I absolutely love it. Have in mind, Calvin Klein eternity makes a different scent every year for their summer fragrance and as for the 2013...I definitely Recommend! My only dislike is that its available only in one size.</li>
    <li> For those of you that like the summer product, the scent isn&#x27;t the same as the previous yr&#x27;s product. Two of the main ingedients have been left out. If your looking for the original don&#x27;t buy the 2013 line. go back a yr or too. It would be nice if they would give the buyer a head&#x27;s up on changes in the product. Now i&#x27;m stuck with the 2013 bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells incredible! Its the perfect summer cologne,  I was always a big fan of Tommy summer which started the whole summer cologne trend. Since Tommy stopped their summer lines ive been looking for another brand. This one is it! My gf loves it, other women will love it, guys will ask you what it is and where they can get it. I bought this without smelling it first having a feeling the eternity summer would be great because eternity itself is timeless.  I actually hope im only one of a few who will be wearing this but probably wont be. Best price on amazon as well. Thanks!:-)</li>
    <li> This is lovely and they should offer it all the time, not just seasonally or limited edition. My husband loves it and I love it on him.</li>
    <li> Smells fabolous and  stays strong all day long....best yet got it for a great price.....will be getting more in the future</li>
    <li> fresh and ocean breath! its stays on the skin for a while but little less than u would expect. but definitely worse the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just amazing! The smell is so good i had to steal it from my husband to spray my pillow and some clothes :)))) totally love it! And my husband loves it too :))</li>
    <li> Is the cologne watered down? Or is it supposed to wear off after a couple of hours? On clothes, it lasts a little longer, but on the skin, in a few hours, you would not even know you had put it on. I bought this from FragranceNet.com on Amazon, not directly from Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if this makes any difference. But the fragrance itself is outstanding. I like the 2013 edition better than the 2014 edition.</li>
    <li> I wear this scent all year long.  Ive only gotten compliments on it.  Never too strong.  You can wear a lot and its still a soft scent.</li>
    <li> Great product, the scent is clean and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Nice cologne for summer use and not overpowering. The scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Specs:&lt;br /&gt;Smell: fresh, pretty similar to eternity aqua but little softer&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 6 hours (4/6 hours are skin scent)&lt;br /&gt;Versatility: casual wear, would not recommend for something serious.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  would choose Eternity Aqua not this thing</li>
    <li> Love the perfume. Like some other comments, I have also felt that the perfume is wearing off very quickly. But then I tried the same one at the airport duty free shop and that wore off quickly too. So I do not think it is a seller issue. It is the perfume. So five stars to seller and three stars to perfume and average is four stars. May not buy the same perfume, but definitely will buy something from the seller.</li>
    <li> This specific cologne seems weak. Smell does not stay with you very long. Old, I&#x27;m guessing like it has been on the shelf to long. Some what disappointed. Will look elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> Good Perfium, fast delivery, cheap price...</li>
    <li> Very good. My girl loves it and of course I love it too</li>
    <li> I like that CK perfume for their sharp smell. It&#x27;s for every day usage. The smell lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> This is the 5th year I get this special edition for the Eternity perfume and once again, it doesn&#x27;t disappoints.</li>
    <li> A great fresh scent for casual everyday wear. It has a clean summeresk flavor to it. Definitely one worth mentioning.</li>
