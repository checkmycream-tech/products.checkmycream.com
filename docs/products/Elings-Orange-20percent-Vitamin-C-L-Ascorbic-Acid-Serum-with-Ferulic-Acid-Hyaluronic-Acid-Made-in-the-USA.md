      <li>It doesn&#x27;t finish what it is able to do.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>1,2-Dihydroxypropane also known as Propylene glycol is used as a humectant (a substance used to keep things moist); it is also used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals &amp; a preservative.</li>

      <li>, this product works very fast and the most effective product on the market for wrinkles .Also</li>
      <li>I have a healthy glo and a smooth complextion.</li>
      <li>I have been using another Vitamin C product on my face for several months and had great results.</li>

      <li>My skin is silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is able to\\</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>The cost is much more reasonable than what I had been paying.</li>
      <li>I expected an orange smelling product but what I got was an actual serum and very happy with it</li>
      <li>I like it because it contain Vitamin C+ Ascorbic acid which make face so smooth and looks healthy especially after exfoliation</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want my face to break out, but it washes right off my fingers with no residue</li>

      <li>I received this product and I first looked at the label.  </li>
      <li>It seems that the quality is different not as potent as the others I ordered</li>
      <li>I was worried at first because it seemed oily</li>
      <li>less is more, I say (and didn&#x27;t cost $50!).  </li>
      <li>( I have somewhat high hopes since a an older friend is getting good results from Elings Dream Hydrating Serum; after 2 months her skin is considerably smoother and younger looking.)</li>
      <li>Eling&#x27;s Vit C serum is colorless which is great because I can tell if the Vit C is active; Vitamin C turns yellow orange then to brown when it oxidizes.</li>
      <li>The product gives your face a very high shine so do not wear during the day if you don&#x27;t like the shine and or under makeup as it interferes with the look of foundation.  </li>
      <li>The pump only needs a light touch.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about 4 days and my skin has not broken out.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>UNTIL I GET MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT ITS EFFECTS WHEN APPLIED DIRECTLY TO SKIN CANCER</li>
      <li>So I searched Amazon for a product that had the&lt;br /&gt;L-Ascorbic acid; many products had it, but had multiple ingredients mixed in.  </li>
      <li>Noticeable reduction on dark spots and hyperpigmentation after first use with continued improvement during first 14 days!</li>
      <li>I love this serum, keeps my skin soft and small spots have disappeared.</li>
      <li>and it has helped clear up my acne.</li>
      <li>I am 54 years old</li>
      <li>This product is also works on stretch marks together with REVIVA 10% GLYCOLIC ACID (how they work is , during the morning  apply ELINGS ORANGE 20% VITAMIN C SERUM on a stretch marked area and then during the night apply REVIVA 10% GLYCOLIC , basically this combination gives collagen with Elings serum  and elasticity with Reviva on the stretch marks .</li>
      <li>So far, I have no complaints.</li>
      <li>It is also a major component of skin where it is involved in tissue repair.   </li>
      <li>Current models of wound healing propose the larger polymers of hyaluronic acid appear in the early stages of healing to physically make room for white blood cells which mediate the immune response.</li>
      <li>The only down side to this product is the really sticky/greasy feeling.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I absolutely love it. I was skeptical at first when I received it and saw the strip of paper with directions on how to use it but I decided to give it a try anyway and I am glad I did. My acne has cleared up and the dark pigment from old acne spots are lightening. I have a healthy glo and a smooth complextion. My skin looks better in only 2 weeks! I will definitely be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> Works Great, I have seen great results</li>
    <li> I like it because it contain Vitamin C+ Ascorbic acid which make face so smooth and looks healthy especially after exfoliation</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I was worried at first because it seemed oily and I didn&#x27;t want my face to break out, but it washes right off my fingers with no residue and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts! I wish I would have taken a before photo to compare it with because my wrinkles definitely seem a lot less visible now. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time ordering ... It seems that the quality is different not as potent as the others I ordered</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum.  It hydrates as well as repairing with the vitamin c.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Awesome!  Noticeable reduction on dark spots and hyperpigmentation after first use with continued improvement during first 14 days!</li>
    <li> I am 35 and I have cpl wrinkles on my forehead , neck  , this product works very fast and the most effective product on the market for wrinkles .Also if you have pimples caused by stress or blemish /spots/marks around the face You can see your face glowing in 3-4 days after using this product . This product is also works on stretch marks together with REVIVA 10% GLYCOLIC ACID (how they work is , during the morning  apply ELINGS ORANGE 20% VITAMIN C SERUM on a stretch marked area and then during the night apply REVIVA 10% GLYCOLIC , basically this combination gives collagen with Elings serum  and elasticity with Reviva on the stretch marks . You can definately buy this product during  your lifetime  .</li>
    <li> I am 54 years old and I have been using this serum for over one month. All of my friends have told me that my skin looks great. Now they are all using this product too.</li>
    <li> Can I just say that this product was a sticky water type solution in a poorly labeled bottle. Very disappointed in this purchase. After applying it, my face and neck remained sticky, until I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer and had to wash it off my face (itchy, sticky, feeling). Don&#x27;t waist Ur money on this product!</li>
    <li> Saw the show on Dr. Oz about the benefits of vitamin C and your skin. After reading reviews, ingredients, etc. of many online products, I chose Elings Orange. I love it. It is so moisturizing for my dry skin. I will forever be using this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this does anything. No smell, no reaction, no change in my skin. I&#x27;ll just stick with retinol</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin amazing. This stuff works very good.</li>
    <li> Eling&#x27;s Vit C serum is colorless which is great because I can tell if the Vit C is active; Vitamin C turns yellow orange then to brown when it oxidizes. Also, Elings metal pump bottle keeps air and light away from the Vit C serum. Sadly makers often add yellow dye to their Vit C products to hide the short shelf life. The pump only needs a light touch.  I&#x27;ve used this for about 4 days and my skin has not broken out. I only need a tiny amount to cover my face and neck. My skin feels smooth and silky. I&#x27;ll have to wait to see longer term results. ( I have somewhat high hopes since a an older friend is getting good results from Elings Dream Hydrating Serum; after 2 months her skin is considerably smoother and younger looking.)</li>
    <li> Love love love this product.  A little goes a long way, just dab on your face and allow a few minutes to soak in before applying your next product.</li>
    <li> UNTIL I GET MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT ITS EFFECTS WHEN APPLIED DIRECTLY TO SKIN CANCER I RATE THIS 3***    THREE OF ITS INGREIENTS ARE::  1.Ferulic acid is found in the seeds of coffee, apple, artichoke, peanut, &amp; orange as well as in both seeds and cell walls of  plants such as rice, wheat, oats. Ferulic acid is an antioxidant  that  is reactive toward  free radicals that are implicated in DNA damage, cancer, and accelerated cell aging  2.Hyaluronic Acid is used postoperatively to induce tissue healing notably after cataract surgery. Current models of wound healing propose the larger polymers of hyaluronic acid appear in the early stages of healing to physically make room for white blood cells which mediate the immune response. It is also a major component of skin where it is involved in tissue repair.   3. 1,2-Dihydroxypropane also known as Propylene glycol is used as a humectant (a substance used to keep things moist); it is also used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals &amp; a preservative.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working just the way I wanted itr to.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have noticed a difference.  People have commented that they love my make up but the make up is the same.  It&#x27;s my skin that&#x27;s the difference!</li>
    <li> I received this product and I first looked at the label.  It looks like a homemade sticker has been placed on it.  The \\&quot;sticker\\&quot;  is uneven and has a bubble in it.  The label also has an unfinished remark.  It states&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This patented vitamin-C formulation contains 20% L-Ascorbic. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is able to\\&quot; It stops there. It doesn&#x27;t finish what it is able to do.  I&#x27;m almost afraid to put this stuff on my face as I have no idea what is in the bottle.  I&#x27;m going to attempt to upload photos of this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week. So far, so good. I have been using another Vitamin C product on my face for several months and had great results. When I saw this product on Amazon, I had to try it. The cost is much more reasonable than what I had been paying.</li>
    <li> I really love the results I have gotten from this serum. I have only used it for a month and have already noticed my skin is not nearly as red or irritated and it has helped clear up my acne. The only down side to this product is the really sticky/greasy feeling. I only use it at night to avoid walking around with a shiny face.</li>
    <li> I order this product a lot. I&#x27;m very disappointed that this time I got a fully oxidized dark orange batch. Vitamin C serum works best when it is fresh, if I wanted a batch that has been sitting in the box for months I can just order from a store.</li>
    <li> I learned about the benefits of Vitamin C serum from the Dr. Oz website.  So I searched Amazon for a product that had the&lt;br /&gt;L-Ascorbic acid; many products had it, but had multiple ingredients mixed in.  This product was one of the only products that had only a few ingredients- less is more, I say (and didn&#x27;t cost $50!).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks.  So far, I have no complaints. My skin is silky smooth.  I use less of my day/night creams, and the skin on my neck is looking tighter.  I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and I am hoping that some sun-spots on my face will start to fade (I&#x27;ll give it another 6 weeks for that). I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was my first order from this seller. I couldn&#x27;t wait for this product to arrive and to start using and while it did arrive on time, was so disappointed when I opened the package. It looks so unprofessionally done; the labeling  askew and bubbled, the &#x27;how to use&#x27; cardboard piece accompanying not even cut straight and oddly phrased. If so little care is placed on the packaging, not very reassuring as to the level of care given to the actual content of product itself.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, keeps my skin soft and small spots have disappeared. My make goes on smoother, when I use makeup which I usully don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> product is better than I thought it would be. I expected an orange smelling product but what I got was an actual serum and very happy with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time.  I have not noticed any difference in my skin.  The product gives your face a very high shine so do not wear during the day if you don&#x27;t like the shine and or under makeup as it interferes with the look of foundation.  The product also makes my skin have a really bad oder after it&#x27;s been on a few hours so much so that I do not like to wear it.  I will search for another Vit C to use on my face.</li>
