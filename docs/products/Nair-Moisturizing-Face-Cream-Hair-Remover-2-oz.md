      <li>I have read a fair amount of reviews on this product, and seldom do people receive good results.</li>
      <li>He prescribed me Prednisone and advised that I get a good face cream, non scented, like Neutrogena or Eucerin.  </li>
      <li>i dont recommend this item its not as good as they say it is&lt;br</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>For the price, and what it is, this stuff truly is amazing.</li>
      <li>My results were amazing.</li>
      <li>So I am kind of thinking thats gonna happen here as well.</li>
      <li>I buy the kind where you get the two bottles, the remover and lotion.</li>
      <li>Good news, it did remove most of the light fine hairs.  </li>
      <li>It did ok on NY neck.</li>
      <li>FOR READING :)</li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to order this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Al glad my cousin suggested using these products for my imperfections.</li>
      <li>I felt safe using the Nair Hair remover.</li>
      <li>The hair came off smoothly and my chin looked and felt like baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
      <li>I had better results using Nair for legs on my face.</li>
      <li>, after I thought about returning it, many times, I went to amazon and read the reviews.</li>
      <li>And so the skin test! :)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>i hoped this would help me feel better about myself</li>
      <li>stuff smells and looks A LOT like the Nair lotion for legs/body (which I use and love).</li>
      <li>my face has never got more than 1 or 2 pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a nice smooth face.</li>
      <li>My life has changed for the better after tonight.</li>
      <li>then I noticed two more moles.</li>
      <li>In my experience, those microwavable waxes work better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had more misses than hits.</li>
      <li>I have tried this twice, time recommended and then more.  </li>
      <li>This is nice and gentle and removed the hair in all the spots I used it on my face, thank you!!!</li>
      <li>Straight razors as well as electric razors make it grow fasrer, thicker, and darker, and leaves a pretty awesome 5 o&#x27;clock shadow for you to rock.</li>
      <li>Just TAKE CARE of it and use a good, gentle moisturizer!</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this it worked nicely.</li>
      <li>Everything was fine until I wiped off the cream after 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>But it seems like it would do well on fine hair</li>
      <li>My neck, lip, sideburns and chest are reasonably fine.</li>
      <li>and I still have hair and a HUGE rash.  </li>
      <li>Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment.  </li>
      <li>After 15 minutes I gently dabbed it away with a warm washcloth.</li>
      <li>leaves my skin smooth &lt;br</li>
      <li>I had my Rx filled at Walgreen&#x27;s and while there I picked up a 1.75oz tube of Aquaphor (by Eucerin)</li>
      <li>What a great product, I can&#x27;t think you enough nair.</li>
      <li>I finally got the courage to buy it when I walked passed it at the store, and it worked amazingly!</li>
      <li>For the first time using this product it worked fantastic!</li>
      <li>it was that right and sore!</li>
      <li>It will burn the skin right off your face!</li>
      <li>Nair has always been a good product and still is, and now they have it for the face only!</li>
      <li>It took about 3 weeks, which in my opinion, that is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>It was fine at first then OMG.</li>
      <li>and I was fine for the first couple of uses .</li>
      <li>Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this worked perfectly, even with a 10 minute application.</li>
      <li>without further ado, I tried the Nair face and upper lip moisturizing hair removal cream, and it worked perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>I applied it to my chin hair first just to test it and tony surprise the time on the box(5min) was really accurate.</li>
      <li>Before using this product I always cleanse my face with good products, pat dry then use.</li>
      <li>I applied it three hours ago and it&#x27;s hurting so much!!</li>
      <li>Please learn from my mistake and test this product on your skin first!</li>
      <li>It works just fine on the upper lip, but not at all on the chin area, which is where I was more &amp;#34;concerned&amp;#34; about.</li>
      <li>I had never seen it before but thought it might be worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used facial hair bleach, but that doesn&#x27;t effectively reduce the appearance of a moustache; it just changes the colour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Simple and effective.</li>
      <li>Right before thanksgiving I used this</li>
      <li>I went to the immediate care clinic right when they opened and the doctor told me that I have a chemical burn.  </li>
      <li>that I didn&#x27;t really like specially when it came to wearing lip stick or any color or shine on my lips</li>
      <li>Your face will be hairless, VERY soft, and kinda sensitive to touch for about 12 hours, but that&#x27;s better than sporting a full bearded-lady look... &#x3D;</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this is made me turn bright red</li>
      <li>I let the product sit for 5 minutes and my face was so smooth and soft after!</li>
      <li>the end, I&#x27;m not out a lot of money as this product is pretty inexpensive.</li>
      <li>For the first time or two I used it, the product did what it said no problem.</li>
      <li>First of all, no hair is removed in the minimum amount of time that the box says.</li>
      <li>Just remember - ONLY leave it on for 5 minutes and be sure to moisturize the heck out of your skin afterwards.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what everyone is talking about, but this product works really well!  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was related, so I continued usage for another month.</li>
      <li>and I was getting more of them and that they were directly related to usage of this product, I stopped.</li>
      <li>But every time after this, it has not, and that only becomes more obvious the more I use it.</li>
      <li>I used this on my chin and cheeks (&amp;#34;beard area&amp;#34;) and did not exceed the recommended time.</li>
      <li>The first time i tried this product hair did come off but did not give me the result i wanted.</li>
      <li>The stubborn chin hair was gone the first time around</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I gave up and plucked the rest out with tweezers, which is what I had been trying to avoid by using this in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just got out of the shower after using Nair Hair Remover Moisturizing Face Cream, and it went pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I have used Nair facial hair removal cream on and off for many years.</li>
      <li>But caution to users, directions must  be followed exactly as written.</li>
      <li>Much better than plucking those unwanted chin and upper lip hairs!  </li>
      <li>It removes hair the first time from my face and chin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not buy this product! I have never had a reaction to any Nair product in the past (I have used the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; product on other areas of my body with no issues) so did not feel the need to do a skin test. I used this on my chin and cheeks (&amp;#34;beard area&amp;#34;) and did not exceed the recommended time. Although I didn&#x27;t notice any visible irritation immediately after use, my chin burned the rest of the day (even after attempting to wash off several times), the next day I woke up a scab covering my entire chin and some red bumps along the side of my face. The entire area that the product touched feels extremely dry and scaly, even though the product is supposed to moisturize. It did remove the hair like it said and was very easy to use, but the damage it caused was not worth it!</li>
    <li> I felt safe using the Nair Hair remover. But caution to users, directions must  be followed exactly as written. I inadvertently left some cream on my face longer than the recommended time. I noted a reddened area just above my lip, but no permanent damage&lt;br /&gt;occurred. If the user has a problem of rapid hair re-growth, the product should be used on a frequent basis. There was no after effects when I used the cream. It has no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I want to at least be able to save someone the time efforts and skin, please don&#x27;t buy this product it BURNS your skin I have red patches on my cheeks and face area now ,only having it on for 4 min and my face was burning and irritated  this product does NOT work at all .</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin, especially on my face. This surprisingly didn&#x27;t bother me though. The skin felt a little weird like with a rubbery feel for a couple days afterwards, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and it definitely got rid of the \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; above my lip.</li>
    <li> I have used Nair facial hair removal cream on and off for many years. It worked fairly well, a little pink afterwards but never lasted long. Yesterday was a DIFFERENT story! I applied the cream and within less than a minute my upper lip began to burn. I quickly rinsed my face and patted it dry. I was horrified to see what looked like a severe chemical burn. It is very painful, blistery and now has dark scabs forming from apparently oozing overnight. This product has caused a seriously embarrassing and painful consequence for me. I can only hope I have not foolishly scarred my face permanently.</li>
    <li> Worst..&lt;br /&gt;Its 2nd day and my face is still sensitive even water is hurting me.. i applied only on upper lip but my cheeks are also v painful</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and fair skin, and I basically just use this stuff to get rid of my blonde \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; and occasionally some stray eyebrow hairs.      I never had a problem with pain or irritation... until I used the product after I&#x27;d been tanning in a tanning bed (bad, I know).  In that case, the area was super red and tender.    Tried it again without recent UV exposure, and everything was back to normal.  Pain-free, redness-free, mustache-free.</li>
    <li> 3.50 at target and elsewhere. also burned my face. i hoped this would help me feel better about myself but instead it broke me out in a million little big bumps, still burns, and i look like a clown and feel worse about myself. not to mention the hair is back already and i just did it yesterday. also this same box is 3.50 at target. amazon, the place to get common products for twice the price.</li>
    <li> Great hair removal. I hate shaving. What a great product, I can&#x27;t think you enough nair. keep up the good work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking hair vitamins and noticed I was getting peach fuzz on my face. Tried this 5 times... I used the recommended time and it burned my face. Had to put aloe Vera because it hurt....it took the hair off my face though but every time I used it...it burned and I would only leave it on for 5 minutes. The 5th time I used it I noticed a brown mole on my face...then I noticed two more moles. I never had moles on my face before. It scared me that this product was damaging my face! I stopped using it. I&#x27;d rather shave my face then mess up my skin cells. Just sharing what happened to me...</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this is made me turn bright red and I am in pain.  5 mins of this crap in a bottle and I still have hair and a HUGE rash.  I clearly read the instructions and followed them but it doesn&#x27;t work.  I in fact can&#x27;t get any nair products to work. waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is talking about, but this product works really well!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 years now...leaves my skin smooth &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;a little red after using it, but it goes away after a few minutes.  would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Just got out of the shower after using Nair Hair Remover Moisturizing Face Cream, and it went pretty well.  I had a little peach fuze above my lip that I didn&#x27;t really like specially when it came to wearing lip stick or any color or shine on my lips I always felt they were very noticeable then. Also, my fiance decided to pick on me and try to pluck them and I was scared if he did it much they would come back black so I want to Wal-mart bought a bottle for like 3.36 or something and tried it.  I left it on for about six minutes mainly because I was still washing my hair when the five minutes was up.  It worked great. There was no smell, it was very creamy and did not leave anything behind and so far so good.  I have very very sensitive skin and there is no irritation or tingles going on so far.  Also, i have a scare about and inch long and it ends just above my lip and it is not too old so I was a little nervous about using it across it and it did not bother it at all. So over all great product.  I aslo did not wipe harshly when removing it I simple dabbed it with a very soaked wash clothe.  I hope this review had helped!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male, and I&#x27;m very self-conscious about my body, and my hair. I used this stuff to get rid of the stubble that appears mere hours after shaving. I had read that depilatories remove hair below the visible layer of skin so I tried this. I didn&#x27;t get chemical burn or any rash like the dozens of other horror stories I&#x27;ve read, but leaving this on for the recommended 3-5 minutes (even longer) and then rinsing and wiping away did nothing to remove the hair. I tried it 3-4 more times, using a different approach each time and it didn&#x27;t do a thing!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering getting this think twice, and get a waxing or sugaring kit instead.</li>
    <li> This might remove hair, but what goes along with it is certainly not worth it. First of all, no hair is removed in the minimum amount of time that the box says. Second of all, by the time the hair is removed, there is alot of iritation and I would wind up with a red line around the outline of where I had put the product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hair would be noticable after about a week so I was forced to use this alot. I never once used it outside of recommend usage as written in the directions and yet, after about a month, I noticed when I used it I was getting little bumps on my upper lip. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was related, so I continued usage for another month. When I put realized that the bumps were getting bigger and I was getting more of them and that they were directly related to usage of this product, I stopped. Unfortunately, it took longer for the bumps to heal than it took to get them. I have no permanant scarring, but it was very noticable for a while since as they healed, my upper lip began to look like it was extremely chapped an peeling all the time.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is one of the only products that I would honestly not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this it worked nicely. The second time I tried it I broke out terribly and it took forever for my skin to recover. It was hit or miss with this particular item everytime I used it and I&#x27;ve had more misses than hits. It irritates my skin too much. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> THis is the worst hair removal cream. It will burn the skin right off your face! I used it for my lip and didn&#x27;t leave it on as long as it said to because it started to burn so badly. I had to wash it off right away, I was left with burn and left a scab for a week.</li>
    <li> My face has been burning/numb for five hours. I only put it on four four minutes, it suggests five....I&#x27;m afraid of what I am going to look like tomorrow morning when I wake up for work.. I don&#x27;t even know how this product is allowed on the shelf. I do not recommend and I will never use this again... What did I just do?</li>
    <li> I tried this on the sides of my face and it has left me with burning red skin a full day later.  I have used Jolen bleach on my face and never had any problem so I figured I&#x27;ll remove the hair instead of bleaching it.  I will never use Nair again and I cannot recommend it to any one.  Beware of Nair!!</li>
    <li> It smells terrible, so I just become a mouth breather for the 6 minutes that I have this on my upper lip. It always removes all of my hair, which is black and kind of thick. Worth at least a test patch because who knows, maybe it will work for you like it does for me.</li>
    <li> I have now used this product twice. The first time, I followed the package directions and left it on for between 5 and 10 minutes. The second time, I left it on for longer. It removed a few hairs both times, but not many. I gave up and plucked the rest out with tweezers, which is what I had been trying to avoid by using this in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to many of the other negative reviews, this did not irritate my skin, either during the time it was on or after I removed it. I normally have sensitive skin, so I was a little worried that I might have a reaction. However, I suspect the likelihood of a reaction will vary by person. If you decide to go ahead and use this product, and are worried about the possibility of a reaction, I suggest trying a little in an out-of-the-way area first (not for hair removal, but to judge your skin&#x27;s reaction). That way you won&#x27;t end up with redness on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells and looks A LOT like the Nair lotion for legs/body (which I use and love). I couldn&#x27;t compare ingredients because I lost the outer box for this and the ingredients aren&#x27;t printed on the tube that comes inside the box. But I suspect I would find they were very similar, if not the same. So I am at a loss as to why the lotion for legs/body would work and this wouldn&#x27;t, unless this is a less concentrated version to make it safe for applying to the face. If that&#x27;s the case, the decrease in concentration of active ingredients is probably what makes it less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m not out a lot of money as this product is pretty inexpensive. But, since it&#x27;s also relatively ineffective, I&#x27;m going to try some other hair removal products, instead.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because I did ALOT of research and watched multiple YouTube videos of this product not working or causing some people&#x27;s skin to burn, but a really close friend of mine said that she had been using this product for years. I finally got the courage to buy it when I walked passed it at the store, and it worked amazingly! I applied it to my chin hair first just to test it and tony surprise the time on the box(5min) was really accurate. The hair came off smoothly and my chin looked and felt like baby&#x27;s bottom! I did my upper lip next and the same thing happened! Everything was smooth and I didn&#x27;t have any issues or weird feelings during or after! I love this and would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> After reading the negative reviews on here, I was hesitant to try this. But I needed to remove my upper lip hair quickly. I used to get my facial hair waxed, but getting to a salon was an issue, and it can be costly. I also tried home facial hair wax removal kits, both the strips and the hardening wax that doesn&#x27;t need strips, and both were somewhat effective, but quite painful. Finally, I have also gotten my upper lip threaded, but I&#x27;ve found that it is too time consuming and painful. I&#x27;ve even used facial hair bleach, but that doesn&#x27;t effectively reduce the appearance of a moustache; it just changes the colour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So without further ado, I tried the Nair face and upper lip moisturizing hair removal cream, and it worked perfectly for me. I have extremely sensitive skin, but after leaving the product on for 8 minutes, I did not experience any burning, pain, or redness. I would definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sally Hansen for removing the hair on my upper lip.  It didn&#x27;t work very well and finally didn&#x27;t work at all, so I thought that I would try Nair.  No matter what I use, my skin tends to burn and I put polysporin on after the cream comes off.  This product was no different in the fact that it burned for about an hour, but it did remove the hair.  I might try 4 minutes next time, but the burn generally starts right away.  I will use it again and maybe 3 minutes will do the job.  Just trial and error, but at least I found a product that does the job.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well..don&#x27;t keep it on too long your skin will burn!</li>
    <li> I think mine must have been expired. This didn&#x27;t work at all, but when I went to the store and picked some up it worked great. I buy the kind where you get the two bottles, the remover and lotion. Yes, you must be careful because it will burn if left on too long. If you get any redness and/or minor swelling, it will fade in a few hours. My recommendation is use it before a shower and/or before you go to bed.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it deserves 5 stars. I have upper lip course hair after waxing for 20 plus years. The other products werent working. This one work like it should. I left it on the max 10 mins and came off, no burning and left it soft to touch. Have tried this product on my chin and near brow areas worked like a charm. A lot better than the expensive brands on the market.</li>
    <li> The first time i tried this product hair did come off but did not give me the result i wanted. Hair wouldnt instantly come off unless i scrub my skin with the sponge really well. Other thing is that it burns. Oh, and my hair grew back thicker. I regret even trying this product out. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> You REALLY must read and follow the directions. I have medium skin and the product worked fine on my fine upper lip hair but not as well on the coarse hair of my chin. It did ok on NY neck. The only complaints I have are that I had to wipe pretty hard for the hair to come off. It says not to wash of the product but rinse thoroughly. From the reviews of the ppl who did wash it off, I&#x27;d avoid that. I just used it yesterday, so I guess we&#x27;ll have to see. READ THE DIRECTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM TO THE LETTER. Idk if it would bleach darker skin. That may be something you want to consider. Also, test it someplace OTHER than your face! If you burn yourself due to a reaction or sensitivity to the product, wouldn&#x27;t you rather burn your finger or something?</li>
    <li> The stores where I live do not carry this product anymore and I have been using it for a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, works well, gets rid of that little bit of hair my family is cursed with and all around happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might I add it came early ^.^ and is cheaper to buy online than in stores</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove chin hair and keeps the hair away longer than when I was using a razor.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what the others are talking about!! I suffer from facial hair due to endometriosis and hormonal imbalances.. To top it off I have thick hair everywhere!! I was so skeptical about this but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Well I applied a chunk of lotion on my chin and neck for less than 10 mins. Let&#x27;s just say I was speechless. The results left my skin soft and 1000xs better than waxing. Wish I would have tried this product a long time ago. After wasting hundreds of dollars on waxing and dealing with the embarrassment. I&#x27;m Al glad my cousin suggested using these products for my imperfections. I used Nair years ago and turned out to be a total fail with a disgusting smell. Boy lets just say they&#x27;ve come a long way. My life has changed for the better after tonight.</li>
    <li> I feel extremely mad at myself for not reading these reviews . As a woman you know it&#x27;s normal for us to get hairs here and there on our lips and chin! To save money I thought this would be great. I WAS WRONG! So I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3 months now and I was fine for the first couple of uses . I noticed that each time I used this I would break out in little zits/ tiny pimples . But recently the outbreak has been on my lip!!! How terrible is that&#x27;!!! And there&#x27;s no way I can hide this!  This should be pulled off the shelves . This is not safe . My lip has been numb for two days . Never again am I using this.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t put this product anywhere you want to maintain hair.  It removes hair the first time from my face and chin.  The stubborn chin hair was gone the first time around and it doesn&#x27;t smell like some of the other products I have used.</li>
    <li> For the first time or two I used it, the product did what it said no problem. But every time after this, it has not, and that only becomes more obvious the more I use it. I am writing this review with my face burning, red, and with a rash traveling down my neck, and with barely any of the hair removed. It works just fine on the upper lip, but not at all on the chin area, which is where I was more &amp;#34;concerned&amp;#34; about. Word of advice if this happens to you as a side effect: don&#x27;t try cooling down the burning or soothing your skin with lotions. In my case, it only briefly makes the effects more painful. In my experience, those microwavable waxes work better. I&#x27;m done with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try a new look and remove my sideburns and some hair in between eyebrows.  .  Not much hair but I began to find it unattractive. It removed a a couple of hairs the first time and on the second try the next day it removed nothing. There was no difference on the third attempt.  I then tried it on my legs with the same results. Very disappointed because shaving left my skin rough and caused bumps.  The cream did not but it also didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and have had no adverse reactions at all using this product.  I remove it after 5 minutes, and it works perfectly.  Way cheaper to buy on Amazon than in my local grocery store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nair in the past on my legs. Used this for my face once, it felt like it took a whole layer of skin off, and now I&#x27;ve been battling the worst acne of my life, and I used it MONTHS ago, and my acne still hasn&#x27;t cleared up. First time I&#x27;ve ever broken out like this as well. I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it.</li>
    <li> Ladies......Get rid of those mustaches!!! I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I was actually going to buy the Olay facial hair remover, but decided to try this instead because it was so much cheaper.  Bad decision on my part.  Everything was fine until I wiped off the cream after 5 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t feel any burning while it was on, but once it was removed, I could tell I had a bad reaction to it.  The skin was raised where I had put the cream on (thankfully only my upper lip area).  I figured if I put some moisturizer on, it would help.  Not so much.  It burned horribly.  It took at least 3 days for the redness and mild pain to go away.  Good news, it did remove most of the light fine hairs.  Not so good news, it left behind all the darker ones, which are now all the more noticeable because there is no peach fuzz hiding them.  This has totally scared me against using any other hair removal creams (even Olay).  Maybe I&#x27;ll try waxing in the future.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a nice smooth face. Just read the directions carefully and don&#x27;t leave it on for longer than recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 17, and I was SUPER embarrassed about the hair on my upper lip. I used it three days ago, and my skin is still dry and peeling and just awful! I have a huge red mark and it&#x27;s so noticeable... And when I put lotion on it, it burns. So I would definitely not recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this on my face before, I don&#x27;t even wax my upper lip, but I am going on a cruise in 3 days and thought I would feel a little prettier or a bit pampered if I removed my upper lip hair.  I don&#x27;t have much, and it is fine and blonde, and looking back I don&#x27;t know why I decided now I wanted to remove it.  I bought this product from Target for about $4.00.  Last  night I read the instructions carefully and after some thought, I opted to not do the skin test; I wish I had.  I applied the product last night, left it on 4-5 minutes, and then washed it off as instructed.  Immediately the skin between my upper lip and nose, and left to right between my cheek smile creases, turned beet red.  Within a few minutes the area swelled a bit and was tender to the touch.  I assumed this was a temporary reaction and went to bed.  This morning when I woke up the area was still a little swollen, half numb, and very red on the sides by my cheek smile creases.  The skin was still tender to the touch and a bit tingly.  I came online and looked at reviews here on Amazon and was horrified as some women reported horrible reactions including scabbing.  I went to the immediate care clinic right when they opened and the doctor told me that I have a chemical burn.  He prescribed me Prednisone and advised that I get a good face cream, non scented, like Neutrogena or Eucerin.  He told me to treat the area like a sunburn and to expect results as if it were a sunburn.  I had my Rx filled at Walgreen&#x27;s and while there I picked up a 1.75oz tube of Aquaphor (by Eucerin) Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment.  The label says it is for minor cuts, scrapes and burns.  Since it included the word &#x27;burn&#x27; I decided to buy this over another product I was considering.  Thankfully I have an understanding female boss and she told me that I could stay home today.  I feel like I look like a clown, all red around the lips.  I am so embarrassed.  I leave for a cruise on Sunday (3 days) andcannot believe I was so stupid to 1) think I needed this product and 2) to not do the skin test.  Please learn from my mistake and test this product on your skin first!</li>
    <li> I am sitting on my couch this very second with a cold compress on my face. I have never EVER been so horribly burned by any product like this IN MY LIFE. I&#x27;m in so much pain right now. I never use this kinda stuff. I had a bad experience as a teenager by accidentally using a similar product for legs on my face. That isn&#x27;t anywhere NEAR as bad as the burn I have now I followed the directions. After the first 5 mins I tested and found the hair still stubborn, so, FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS, I left it another 5. I even used the timer on my phone to insure I didn&#x27;t go over and accidentally burn myself. It was fine at first then OMG. I used it on my upper lip, chin, neck, \\&quot;side burn\\&quot; area and chest. I expected some redness, but my chin is visibly burned, swollen, red and was BLEEDING. My neck, lip, sideburns and chest are reasonably fine. I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t even really have acne as a teen. This is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully! I didn&#x27;t have any redness or anything after using it and it removed all the unwanted hair!! I will definitely be purchasing this again!!</li>
    <li> I used this product on my face once, leaving it on for four minutes, and after I washed it off my face was in a lot of pain.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the product or my skin, but it left me with several scars on my fair skin that I must now cover with concealer every day.  So if you do decide to try this product, I recommend testing it first on a tiny part of your face that no one sees, like under your chin or something.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my self-conscious 10 year old daughter. She had some darker upper lip hair that was bothering her, so I did some research, checked the local grocery store, and bought this. Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this worked perfectly, even with a 10 minute application. No irritation, but a very happy (and more confident!) young lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it on your skin somewhere first of course, but don&#x27;t let the bad reviews scare you off. If it works on delicate skin, that says a lot. I&#x27;d definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I had VERY smooth results!  Much better than plucking those unwanted chin and upper lip hairs!  But a warning: they really mean it when they say not to keep it on any longer than 10 minutes!</li>
    <li> See a lot of negative reviews but maybe it isn&#x27;t for everyone. Before using this product I always cleanse my face with good products, pat dry then use. It&#x27;s easier to get that way. Nair has not irritated my skin just yet.. Try it!! 😊</li>
    <li> I have successfully used other Nair facial hair products for years.  This one does not work for me.  I have tried leaving on the cream for five minutes, 10 minutes, even 20 minutes, but it does not remove my facial hair.  After reading other negative reviews, I am glad to know others feel as I do.  I am going to throw away my tube and find something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nair depilatory cream for legs and even that product is hit and miss. But the specific product they make for the face does even less than that. 10 minutes is the maximum recommended time to leave it on. After 15 minutes I gently dabbed it away with a warm washcloth. Behold, still facial hair underneath all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on for more than that, or you&#x27;d get some nasty irritation. In fact- I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all!</li>
    <li> After using this product to remove the small amount of blonde hair I had on my upper lip I was in terrible pain and left with scabs and breakouts. Right before thanksgiving I used this and I looked ten times work the whole thanksgiving break. It barley removed the hair and left my upper lip in burning pain and all red and blotchy for days. It&#x27;s been a week and I have a huge nasty scab on my lip and I broke out a lot in this area. It&#x27;s peely and dry and looks horrible even with makeup! WORST PRODUCT EVER. Nair literally burns your skin and leaves you looking worse than ever. I regret ever wasting my time or money using this crap.</li>
    <li> For the first time using this product it worked fantastic! However, I will say this, it took longer than the 5 minutes the box recommended. It took about 10 minutes for me, but I have thicker/coarser hair than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a whim at a local store. I had never seen it before but thought it might be worth a shot. Immediately when I got home I was regretting my decision, simply because I had been down this road before. I&#x27;ve bought numerous products like this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after I thought about returning it, many times, I went to amazon and read the reviews. What seemed to be the consensus was the &#x27;burn&#x27; that his product left on the skin after all was said and done. As my &#x27;solution&#x27; for that problem (since i have faced it myself) was to apply a layer of Blistex (lip balm) to the area I was going to apply the cream. I suppose Vaseline would work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I cleaned the product off my face, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hair was coming off! But again It took me 10 minutes, after doing a check at 5, to get the hair to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I don&#x27;t sense any &#x27;burn&#x27; on the areas I applied the face cream. I marked the product down to 4 stars simply because of the time it took me to get the hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I usually have with these products is that they work once MAYBE twice and then it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m immune to it and it no longer seems to work for me. So I am kind of thinking thats gonna happen here as well. But we will see. (Update soon to come)</li>
    <li> I had to use this product very often plus deal with my skin  breaking out. I stopped using tjis product 5 to 6mths and and still working on clearing my irritation.</li>
    <li> For the price, and what it is, this stuff truly is amazing. I am a PCOS sufferer, and battle with hirsutism. I grow hair on my neck, cheeks, chin, upper lip, and sideburns. It&#x27;s coarse and thick, and nearly impossible to keep up with. I have tried everything.. plucking is nearly impossible these days, the growth is so fast and widespread that it can take an hour or so just to get the extremely noticeable ones. Waxing is painful and expensive whether it be at the salon or at home. Wax strip are a joke.. and even a good home wax pot is hard to use on your own (on your face anyway).. not to mention painful... and you have to let it grow long enough to be VISIBLE in order to wax again.... not my idea of a good time. Straight razors as well as electric razors make it grow fasrer, thicker, and darker, and leaves a pretty awesome 5 o&#x27;clock shadow for you to rock. Laser treatment and electrolysis  are painful, expensive, and not guaranteed to work, due to it being a hormone imbalance. My point is, this works for me, because my face is tough. I&#x27;ve put my skin through the ringer trying every hair removal trick in the book. You have to remember this is a chemical that burns hair off your face, it&#x27;s gonna cause some irritations. If you have a little &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; this product isn&#x27;t for you. Trim with sizzors, or a electric eyebrow trimmer. My suggestion is just to LEAVE IT ALONE, so you don&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are PCOS or hirsutism suffers, or have very coarse hair, you will need to leave it on for the maximum time for most effectiveness. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work on the real stubborn hairs and plucking cleanup is needed. Like I said, I have a pretty tough face, but it is a little red and uncomfortable for the first half hour or so. It goes away though. Quite simply, I&#x27;m more than happy with the product.. makes me feel feminine again!</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers. Don&#x27;t even bother. I followed the instructions. Says to remove at 5-10 minutes. I removed at 8 minutes after testing at 5 minutes with no results. Didn&#x27;t remove my facial hair but managed to burn my skin. A terrible waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because, at age 40, I was starting to get an overgrowth of VERY fine, TINY clear hairs on my face - like a beard?! It also was growing on my NECK. Anyhoo I am a redhead with sensitive skin, so I of course was leery of this product knowing how Nair tends to sting, and well reading the reviews here... leery indeed. The first time I used it, followed directions exactly; apply to clean skin, leave on NO MORE THAN 5 minutes; use a warm wet washcloth to wipe off; rinse with lukewarm water. I did all that, but my skin felt almost sunburnt. SO... I used extra virgin olive oil, rubbed it into the &#x27;beard&#x27; and neck area that I&#x27;d used this product on; then rinsed that off, hopped in the shower and used my regular (gentle) skin cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DID remove all the hair; but yes, it will make your skin very sensitive afterwards. Just TAKE CARE of it and use a good, gentle moisturizer! The extra virgin olive oil is a staple in my skin and hair care regimen; it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and will moisturize your skin and sooth it after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used this product for the second time, because my &#x27;beard&#x27; and neck hair (ewww) were growing back. It took about 3 weeks, which in my opinion, that is not bad at all. Hormones and taking Biotin for my head hair to grow is probably what&#x27;s causing the facial hair to go all nutso on me! So anyhoo, every 3 weeks isn&#x27;t so bad, and the tube is a decent size, marvelous price, and it surely beats using my husband&#x27;s razor on my face. Just remember - ONLY leave it on for 5 minutes and be sure to moisturize the heck out of your skin afterwards. Your face will be hairless, VERY soft, and kinda sensitive to touch for about 12 hours, but that&#x27;s better than sporting a full bearded-lady look... &#x3D;-/</li>
    <li> I have to be very careful of the products I use because of my sensitive skin.  This product removed the facial hair quite well, and my skin tolerated the cream very well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try this product, as I have seen just as many bad reviews as good, but it was a quick cheap fix so I wanted to try. My results were amazing. I let the product sit for 5 minutes and my face was so smooth and soft after! The reason I put 4 stars is o had a slight burning/dry feeling to my face after rinsing. But after putting some lotion on the feeling was gone and there was no redness or swelling for me. I say try for yourself. And so the skin test! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this worthless product and followed the instructions to a t. A couple days after, the entire area I used it on broke out into tiny bumps and pimples. It&#x27;s disgusting. I will NEVER buy anything from Nair again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t!!! Don&#x27;t use this product!  I do not even have sensitive skin at all... And it started burning on contact.  I washed it off after 2 minutes (directions say 5-10) and showered for 20 minutes after.  My chin and upper lip were still in pain for 8 hours, then numb (like nerve damage numb) for 12... And still red, flaking, peeling like a bad sunburn the next day.  This product is as gentle as Draino - which also removes hair.  I cannot believe this product even exists.  It is HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair and I find myself having to go over some spots with a razor after. But it seems like it would do well on fine hair</li>
    <li> I love it and will continue to order this product.  B Thomas</li>
    <li> Nair has always been a good product and still is, and now they have it for the face only! I love it!</li>
    <li> Never in my life would I ever use this product again. This morning I applied some of the paste on my jaw area towards the corners (near my ears), on my top lip and under my chin down towards my neck area. I left it on for 3ish minutes and removed as directed however, as I was rinsing I could feel my skin starting to burn quite painfully! I knew it needed to come off but it was becoming more and more painful to remove. Once I got it all off I patted it dry and looked in the mirror and all areas (except my top lip) were red raw!!! It hurt to even move my neck it was that right and sore! I tried applying a bit of Nivea moisturiser to loosen it slightly after cold compressing it and now 6 hrs on, I am still left with horrible sore marks and my neck being the worst is virtually purple! I have just washed my face in the shower and to wet it again is so terribly painful. I will NEVER use this again on any of my body! Please avoid like the plague!</li>
    <li> great item at a good price</li>
    <li> I have read a fair amount of reviews on this product, and seldom do people receive good results. I bought this product praying it wouldn&#x27;t break me out, but it did.. And horribly!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just did one application of this, and immediately after use my skin was chemically burned. For about 3 days my upper lip, and neck were extremely red and I was unable to apply foundation out of fear it would worsen my condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second week, and my face and neck are COVERED in pimples from hair growing back. I have never ever been broken out this badly, even in my teen years my face has never got more than 1 or 2 pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review was based upon my skin type, which is sensetive and oily.</li>
    <li> I only gave this product one star because it makes me if I had to choose I would give it no stars it has no capability of removing hair whatsoever all it does is just irritate my skin and after I wiped it off all the hair was still there. I even left it on past the 10 minutes and still no hair removal.  Don&#x27;t waste your money,  seek other options!!</li>
    <li> I have tried this twice, time recommended and then more.  It doesn&#x27;t work. I had better results using Nair for legs on my face. What a waste of money. Never again</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with chin hair for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve tweezed, waxed, plucked, you name it. The hair always grew back and I was always pulling or checking and then pulling, it was a horrible cycle. When I would wax, I would get horrible bumps and skin irritation afterwards. I saw this product in Wal-Mart and was obviously hesitant given that its a depilatory, but I just tried it and the only word I have is WOW. Not only did the hair come off, the product itself smells like baby lotion and my chin and upper lip are so so soft and moisturized! It only took about 6-8 minutes, didn&#x27;t hurt and the results are definitely worth it. If you&#x27;re skeptical try it on a small patch and see how you do. I would definitely recommend this over waxing and plucking any day.</li>
    <li> This is nice and gentle and removed the hair in all the spots I used it on my face, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this! If only I could do zero stars!!! My face is currently burning! It&#x27;s ridiculous, the first time I&#x27;ve used it, and I bought the sensitive one!!!! I applied it three hours ago and it&#x27;s hurting so much!!</li>
    <li> ive been useing this product for at least 2 years ~ im going to become a freshman soon so i want all my unwanted facial hair to go away faast ~ i notice that it leaves face hair thiK!!! and it looks super ugly on my skin. i noticed after i stop useing it and started waxing i had les mini pipples on my skin and i never break out so i freak out when i found those UGLY pipples on my face . i dont recommend this item its not as good as they say it is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS FOR READING :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. K it literally takes d five minutes to remove ALL of the unwanted hair off of your face. It did like me with a red spot under my right eye. But cold water helped with that. I was gonna go and spend 40$ on a face wax. Stopped at Wal-Mart it was 3$ can&#x27;t beat it. It actually works. Simple and effective. So would recommend to just try it out!!!!</li>
</ol>
