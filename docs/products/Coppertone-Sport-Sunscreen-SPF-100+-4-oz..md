<ol>
      <li>and i am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>, this item was very good, I am very happy with this item, It came in the promised time.</li>
      <li>Some sticky, but the effect is very good.</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>This size is great for cargo packets to renew sunscreen protection while cycling.  </li>
      <li>This stuff did great when I went to Panama City Beach,Fla.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>The shipment was quick and I received the products in good conditions.</li>
      <li>The product is always outstanding.  </li>
      <li>Works great for long motorcycle trips in the sun and heat.</li>
      <li>I chose this rating due to the great quality of the material for such a great price.</li>
      <li>Provides excellent protection from the sun and is very resistant to washing off at the pool or beach, meaning less reapplication throughout the day.</li>
      <li>and I burn so quickly with anything below SPF70</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t have too much of a grimy feeling.</li>
      <li>I will be out in the sun shirtless for 5 hours and come back with a nice mild tan, no burn</li>
      <li>A family of four can chew through a four ounce bottle pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I am just not supposed to use this product on my face anyway OTHER THAN THAT its a great product for sun protection and someone like me who wears sunscreen all year round.</li>
      <li>It also is very lotion like and not thick, therefore it rubs right in!</li>
      <li>Even when applying after being in the water, it still soaks in really well and continues to work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Sunscreen works very well.</li>
      <li>I can not tell much about it yet.</li>
      <li>pretty much sunburn-less after several days in Cabo.</li>
      <li>I went to Disney and didn&#x27;t get a single burn when I used this--just reapplied it regularly (and this is incredible because I&#x27;m a very very pale redhead</li>
      <li>That aside, though, this very high SPF works wonders and kept even my very pale, easily burnt self</li>
      <li>works like a charm on my husband who is super sensitive to the sun due to diabetes medicines.</li>
      <li>but Walmart offers at cheaper price.</li>

    <li> I went to Disney and didn&#x27;t get a single burn when I used this--just reapplied it regularly (and this is incredible because I&#x27;m a very very pale redhead and I burn so quickly with anything below SPF70 it&#x27;s ridiculous). Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great for long motorcycle trips in the sun and heat.</li>
    <li> U need SPF 100 if you&#x27;re outside for extended periods of time</li>
    <li> Sunscreen works very well. Provides excellent protection from the sun and is very resistant to washing off at the pool or beach, meaning less reapplication throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The product is always outstanding.  This size is great for cargo packets to renew sunscreen protection while cycling.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like this item, this item was very good, I am very happy with this item, It came in the promised time.</li>
    <li> Great product but Walmart offers at cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and body but my face now has rashes on the sides of my jaws that are going away i stopped using this on my face and just wear a hat and they are going away. I&#x27;m sure I am just not supposed to use this product on my face anyway OTHER THAN THAT its a great product for sun protection and someone like me who wears sunscreen all year round.</li>
    <li> For basically the same cost as lower SPF types of this same sunscreen you get a smaller amount. That aside, though, this very high SPF works wonders and kept even my very pale, easily burnt self pretty much sunburn-less after several days in Cabo. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t have too much of a grimy feeling. Even when applying after being in the water, it still soaks in really well and continues to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go to Disney World with my kids. I am allergic to the sun and if exposed break out in hives and get sun burned. I wore this sunscreen the entire time and not one hive or any sun burn. So yay! Something that works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I will be out in the sun shirtless for 5 hours and come back with a nice mild tan, no burn</li>
    <li> A family of four can chew through a four ounce bottle pretty quickly. This seems to be the largest size they sell.</li>
    <li> Does not prevent from sunburn as expected</li>
    <li> I recommend you read the ounces, it small bottle. This bottle lasted me about 6 days of being in the sun all day.</li>
    <li> I used it for one weekend. I can not tell much about it yet. I will be in Mexico for 10 days and I will test it out.</li>
    <li> works like a charm on my husband who is super sensitive to the sun due to diabetes medicines. It also is very lotion like and not thick, therefore it rubs right in! A week at the beach &amp; pool with absolutely no sun reaction!</li>
    <li> Some sticky, but the effect is very good.</li>
    <li> I like this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff did great when I went to Panama City Beach,Fla. I was as white as a ghost and put this on and went to the beach, got in the ocean and I NEVER got burnt at all. I will buy this from now on when I need sunscreen. Skin cancer is not a good trade-off for getting a tan!</li>
    <li> i recomend to use the 100 protection. I play tennis and i am very happy with the results. use it</li>
    <li> I chose this rating due to the great quality of the material for such a great price. The shipment was quick and I received the products in good conditions. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I used this SPF 100 lotion and spent an entire day out in the sun and did not burn.  This from a guy who will flash-burn deep red if someone simply says the word &#x27;Sun&#x27; within 20 feet of me.</li>
    <li> Have used it before. This is an repeat order. Works extremely well for me.</li>
