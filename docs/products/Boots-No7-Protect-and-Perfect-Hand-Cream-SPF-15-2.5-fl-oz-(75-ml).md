      <li>I purchased both the boots no7 hand savior and the protect and perfect hand cream from an online drug store - I was hoping they would make a difference to the look of my hands, which were looking WAY OLDER than my years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for about 2 weeks and the lines on my hands are looking better.  Nothing miraculous but a noticeable difference.  I would give it 5 stars if it was unscented.</li>
    <li> Leaves hands nurished and never greasy... \\&quot;I hate that greasy feeling.\\&quot;  Helps keep them youthful. Boots makes great products!</li>
    <li> I wish that I could rate the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Hand Cream as high as the other products that I&#x27;ve used, but this one did not hold up to the claim!</li>
    <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. It feels moisterizing and clean, which is what anyone would likely want.</li>
    <li> My hands feel soooo smooth.  I knit . Since using the cream, my hands don&#x27; t snag the yarn anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the SPF, not expecting fantastic moisture, but it provided good moisture for my usually dry hands. (I get some ashiness &amp; a dry feeling throughout the day if I don&#x27;t reapply, but my hands are not super dry, so if this is a problem, you&#x27;d probably want to follow up with something else.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this, is that there was a noticeably softer look to the back of my hands, which are starting to get crêpe-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a noticeable scent, but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting to me though it might be to some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue is the price per ounce considering that it&#x27;s not waterproof and needs to be reapplied after hand washing.  It is a light liquid though and a little does cover the hands nicely, so the small size may go a long way. (Time will tell.) The size is good for carrying in one&#x27;s purse.</li>
    <li> Despite product description, this hand cream is *not* unscented. It has very strong perfume-y odor that I find very unpleasant. I cannot tell if claims made to improve skin are accurate because I will not be using this cream again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I have the worst hands in the world.  I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s, yet a first glance at my hands would put me in the 50-70 year old lady category.  They are that bad.  This comes from years working as an artist, doing carpentry, filming on crews in outdoor climates, and adventuring outdoors.  As a result, my hands have aged faster than the rest of my body.  I suffer from dry, cracking knuckles, to deeply wrinkled palms, to bouts of eczema when I get really stressed, to awful cuticles.  Yet somehow, my nails always grow nice and neat (go figure.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been hunting for the perfect hand cream to relieve my aching hands.  It has to be moisturizing enough to ease the cracking/wrinkling, yet not too moist or non-breathable that it will irritate and inflame my elusive and ever-waiting eczema.  It has to stay on after I wash my hands, not rub off on expensive film equipment, and not be so oily as to leave marks on my paperwork.  It&#x27;s a lot to ask of a cream, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap to expensive.  Did I mention I&#x27;m allergic to practically everything out there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- instant moisture relief that soaks in fast&lt;br /&gt;- seems to help a little with the wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- healed by dry, cracked knuckles&lt;br /&gt;- safe for those with sensitive skin and allergies&lt;br /&gt;- my hands look slightly younger…I&#x27;d say they look more like a 45 year olds…(hey, it&#x27;s an improvement)&lt;br /&gt;- non greasy and will not stain clothing or paper after use&lt;br /&gt;- forms a moisture barrier against dry wind and cold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- intense perfume smell (very strong, like you would get blasted with walking into Macy&#x27;s or Belk)&lt;br /&gt;- washes off after rinsing your hands, so you must reapply each time&lt;br /&gt;- quite pricey at $22, considering you have to apply it 10x a day&lt;br /&gt;- will irritate my hand if left on overnight&lt;br /&gt;- careful if you have a habit of touching your hair (it will make it greasy)&lt;br /&gt;- did I mention the smell?  Sometimes it&#x27;s so strong that I sneeze (probably yet another allergic reaction to the perfume, not the product itself)&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the bottle had a smaller hole dispenser (it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out way too much!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy this product, and I can see it working after just a week&#x27;s use.  But I really, really wish they made an unscented one because the perfume is very strong.  It&#x27;s strong enough that when I put it on, everyone in the car starts rolling down the windows and people in class will turn and glare at me.  I also wish it lasted longer.  I feel like I have to reapply it every hour, and at $22/bottle that gets expensive really quick.  I will explore other options, but in the meantime I will continue buying this product since it does, in fact, actually work.  If you can put up with the scent and the cost, it&#x27;s a worth investment.  Maybe one day my the appearance of my hands will match my actual age.Sometimes it&#x27;s so strong that I sneeze (probably yet another allergic reaction to the perfume, not the product itself)&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the bottle had a smaller hole dispenser (it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out way too much!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy this product, and I can see it working after just a week&#x27;s use.

    <li> This is by far the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of others and wouldn&#x27;t venture to guess how many I currently own.  Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Hand Cream borders on being miraculous.  There was an immediate huge improvement after just one use.  Yes it&#x27;s pricey, but WELL WORTH it and much more I might add.  Yes, there is a scent, which initially bothered me a bit, until I saw the results of the product.  I&#x27;d give this product 10 STARS, if I could.</li>
    <li> I try to use every day and I think it really helps-I try to protect my hands by wearing gloves to protect from the sun.</li>
    <li> The hand cream is moist and feels great on the skin. It protects my hands from the sun. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent hand cream. I just wish Boots would package it in a larger package. It doesn&#x27;t last me long enough, but I love it and I am a person that works out in the garden and around the house a LOT and this hand cream keeps my hands from cracking and being dried out.</li>
    <li> I love Boots products.  It&#x27;s nice buying them on amazon.  Try the moisturizers too.  They are wonderful and reasonably priced.  I originally learned about this brand in a magazine.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of hand-creams which promise to deliver (i.e. younger looking hands, less noticeable lines, etc. etc.) this really lives up to it&#x27;s promise!  Am very pleased with the results and will never go back to ordinary hand creams - yes the product is quite expensive but if you are like me and slightly vain about wanting younger looking hands (at 60 yrs old) I think it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>

I would recommend this product if you don&#x27;t mind it or want to try it out for yourself.  I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon because I found a better deal elsewhere.  Its current retail value is $14.69 - 2.5 fl. oz.</li>
    <li> Nice scent but no better than any other hand cream.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is great. It feels so good going on and makes my hands feel soft and protected. I&#x27;m buying it again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My hands feel wonderfully smooth and it is non greasy - I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that lasted through repeated hand washings - this product wasn&#x27;t the one for me.  Also, it is highly perfumed which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this regularly at night during the winter. I definitely saw improvement in the look and feel of my hands. The fragrance is not very pleasing, but the results are.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and has a nice feel, although can be a little greasy once applied. Haven&#x27;t noticed any major help in regards to the looks of my hands, but I like the cream. Not sure I will replace it with another, or just continue using my face cream as hand cream.</li>
    <li> A little greasy.  Really not much different than any others I have used.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I hate this hand cream. It is DISGUSTING. It smells weird, does not absorb AT ALL and makes your hands feel just.. dirty. I feel like I have sticky, gross film all over my hands and they are shiny, they look like they are covered in OIL. Yuck. And it says on the back of the bottle it still moisturizes and conditions after washing, HA this is a complete lie. It comes right off and hands are VERY dry after, more so than using no lotion at all. I hate this hand cream and I am sad that I wasted my money on it.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Boots No 7 products. High end, reasonably priced. Really softens chapped hands. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product with continued use. it keeps the hands nice and soft. I would also recommend use at bedtime. the smell is kind of plan so add your favorite lotion with it and there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came on time and I would recommend it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Not sure it is worth the expense as it is not tht much different for other hand creams&lt;br /&gt;Because of the expense, would not buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased both the boots no7 hand savior and the protect and perfect hand cream from an online drug store - I was hoping they would make a difference to the look of my hands, which were looking WAY OLDER than my years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than a week I was completely amazed by the results - I never thought my hands would look this good again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the hand savior every other day and this hand cream a few times a day - and like I said, I am totally blown away by just how great my hands look!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to make your hands look younger, than you have to try these products!!!  If you just need to deal with dry skin, the hand cream would be great by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend Boots no7 hand products highly enough - they are truly amazing!!!</li>
