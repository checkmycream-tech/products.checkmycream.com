      <li>I love the product and all the scents it comes in.  </li>
      <li>Many soap / shampoo containers have the \\&quot;pour</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always bought Suave body wash at drug stores and have never been able to come close to this pricing.  </li>
      <li>I would buy it again; Walmart may have better pricing and I will look into that as well.</li>
      <li>You cannot ask for a better body wash.</li>
      <li>I love Suave products</li>
      <li>However, for the size, if you are savvy as a shopper or with coupons, you would do better to go that route.  </li>
      <li>But it is better to have someone else do that for you.</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic and it creates a nice stock of body wash, so that you don&#x27;t have to go to the store to purchase more.</li>
      <li>It smell great and makes a lot of suggs your skin feel soft and silky from the body wash</li>
      <li>husband might even use which is fine by me.</li>
      <li>I enjoy suave body grooming incestials.</li>
      <li>have more sensitive skin then most and love it..</li>
      <li>love buying products in bulk because then I don&#x27;t have to replace it when I use up the first one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing to smell this first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Although, I am finding better pricing on a large store name and free shipping so....</li>
      <li>and I feel clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;d appreciate this more if it was more naturally made.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is great and it leaves you feeling clean without that dry feeling.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right on queue, it wiggles like jello!  </li>
      <li>It smells good and its a basic body wash.</li>
      <li>love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.  </li>
      <li>I like the Mango Mandarin clean, fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m doing my best to go with natural products overall in my life, and this is certainly chock-full of chemicals.</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s a nice consistency, like a soft jello.</li>
      <li>The scent is a nice citrus, not overpowering, and the gel doesn&#x27;t stain my washcloth like my last body wash did.  </li>
      <li>A bit of citrus, a bit of warmth, and &#x27;fresh&#x27; smelling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is worth the money</li>
      <li>why spend so much on other body washes when this does the same job and smells great?!</li>
      <li>I liked that this came in a multi-pack because it makes it much cheaper than buying them individually.  </li>
      <li>Here you simply sit the container on its top.</li>
      <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve paid very decent money for high end shower gels that honestly didn&#x27;t amount to any more than this Suave body wash.  </li>
      <li>It smells almost exactly like mango-madarin from Bath and Body Works, for like 1/10th of the price, but their consistency is much smoother.  </li>
      <li>and I would recommend it to people who don&#x27;t mind smelling like mango mandarin for many months because that&#x27;s how long</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really gelatinous, another review described it as &#x27;jello-like.&#x27;  </li>
      <li>SO FAST.  </li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>You really need to use a loofah or a sponge with this.</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t over joyed with this item.</li>
      <li>For the price I don&#x27;t feel like I lost too much.</li>
      <li>Smell is not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t have much staying power if that is something you are looking for.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great, is affordable, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was really worried that the smell might not be strong enough based on some of the reviews, but after receiving it, I am definitely not worried at all!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a high end product; it&#x27;s okay for kids and general washing; no realproblems or concerns.</li>
      <li>The packaging could have been a little better to dispense the soap from the bottle.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a better design so you can store it upside down and get every ounce of body wash outta there!</li>
      <li>Really works and leaves my skin soft and not oily</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m always cautious about trying out a new soap</li>
      <li>great soap, unfortunately I can purchase this considerably cheaper at supermarket.</li>
      <li>My face can turn red if I get near bleach, and my skin can get quite itchy (or even get hives) if I contact certain chemicals.</li>
      <li>I tend to have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>But, if you are too busy as I often am as a mom, go ahead and buy this in bulk.  </li>
      <li>I can put a reasonably sized dab onto my body-scrub sponge and have it last the entire wash.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price I guess , gives me a rash tho :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought Suave body wash at drug stores and have never been able to come close to this pricing.  Since I use it everyday, the six pack quantity cannot be beat.  The fragrance is great and it leaves you feeling clean without that dry feeling.</li>
    <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve paid very decent money for high end shower gels that honestly didn&#x27;t amount to any more than this Suave body wash.  When I decided to stop paying exorbitent prices, I found this gel at my local Albertson&#x27;s market for $4.29 per bottle.  This was A LOT less than I had been paying, so purchased one.  When it turned out to meet my need, I sought out Amazon and was pleasantly surprised to see that I could purchase SIX bottles for less than the price of 3 at Albertson&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash does not leave my skin dry and flaking, nor does it have a lingering odor, which would interfere with my perfume or cologne.  Per a few other reviewers, the consistency is weird.  However, i&#x27;d rather have it thick and gelatinous than runny and wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Great stuff smells good but is ok to use with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have more sensitive skin then most and love it..</li>
    <li> I bought enough to last my daughter a year. It smells good and its a basic body wash. I stock up so we don&#x27;t have to worry about month visits to our local stores. Although, I am finding better pricing on a large store name and free shipping so....amazon is not the cheapest for everything anymore.</li>
    <li> I love the product and all the scents it comes in.  Really works and leaves my skin soft and not oily</li>
    <li> It smell great and makes a lot of suggs your skin feel soft and silky from the body wash and it&#x27;s good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that it is a terrible product, it&#x27;s just that of all the body washes I have tried, it is my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;And I bought a six-pack of it. Ugh. I cannot wait until it runs out. Really. I tried giving some away to&lt;br /&gt;friends, but there&#x27;s been no takers. The orange scent is weak and seems very artificial.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.......</li>
    <li> Great stuff but I just wish it was subscribe and save eligible</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;keeps me clean:)&lt;br /&gt;I love buying products in bulk because then I don&#x27;t have to replace it when I use up the first one.</li>
    <li> Good body wash. The packaging could have been a little better to dispense the soap from the bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells great. You almost want to eat yourself, it smells so good! But it is better to have someone else do that for you.</li>
    <li> I like the Mango Mandarin clean, fresh smell.  I have allergies and this product is one of few that I can use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the smell but smell great.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the way this smells and she uses less body spray afterwards so it&#x27;s a win win. No Complaints</li>
    <li> Suave! It&#x27;s soapy! It&#x27;s cheap! I smell like a mango! Who could ask for anything more?</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was a good price and it was there.  I&#x27;m the only one using it and it lasted about a month, which isn&#x27;t bad at all.. but it would&#x27;ve lasted longer if it wasn&#x27;t for the consistency.  It&#x27;s really gelatinous, another review described it as &#x27;jello-like.&#x27;  That&#x27;s right on queue, it wiggles like jello!  So I squeeze it onto a loofa and it flops away onto my shower floor.  SO annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.  It smells almost exactly like mango-madarin from Bath and Body Works, for like 1/10th of the price, but their consistency is much smoother.  The bottle is a better design so you can store it upside down and get every ounce of body wash outta there!</li>
    <li> have yet to try, am sure will be very good as are most Suave products. husband might even use which is fine by me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing to smell this first thing in the morning. It&#x27;s like my wake-up call before the coffee. Awesome</li>
    <li> I enjoy suave body grooming incestials. However, this particular scent is beyond subtle. I really wasn&#x27;t over joyed with this item.</li>
    <li> I liked that this came in a multi-pack because it makes it much cheaper than buying them individually.  The scent is a nice citrus, not overpowering, and the gel doesn&#x27;t stain my washcloth like my last body wash did.  It&#x27;s an effective product and I would recommend it to people who don&#x27;t mind smelling like mango mandarin for many months because that&#x27;s how long this 6-pack will last you.</li>
    <li> great product and I will recommend it to all my friends and family.  If it came in a larger size I would purchase it as well.</li>
    <li> I love Suave products but this one was a let down! The Mango Mandarin scent was a bit underwhelming. It did not entirely smell like mango or mandarin oranges? For the price I don&#x27;t feel like I lost too much. The biggest let down was the consistency. The body was was thin and runny. You really need to use a loofah or a sponge with this. It does not lather easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Cleaning.</li>
    <li> Love it but their is one out there somewhere that had Bamboo in the name I liked better.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells wonderful, my boyfriend even uses it! That&#x27;s why I went ahead and ordered the six pack....can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> This body was smells great . It&#x27;s a really good price for 6 bottles. Will last you a loNg time.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, is affordable, and a little bit goes a long way. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tend to have sensitive skin. My face can turn red if I get near bleach, and my skin can get quite itchy (or even get hives) if I contact certain chemicals. So I&#x27;m always cautious about trying out a new soap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite pleased with the Suave Naturals Mango Mandarin body wash. First, it&#x27;s a nice consistency, like a soft jello. I can put a reasonably sized dab onto my body-scrub sponge and have it last the entire wash. It froths quite nicely. It does the job well and I feel clean when I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m not sticky, and I don&#x27;t feel slimy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is nice. A bit of citrus, a bit of warmth, and &#x27;fresh&#x27; smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the container is meant to sit on its head. Many soap / shampoo containers have the \\&quot;pour out\\&quot; part at the top of the bottle, meaning as you work your way down to the end that you&#x27;re always leaving some behind. Here you simply sit the container on its top. You get the very last drops of soap and nothing is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any complaint, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m doing my best to go with natural products overall in my life, and this is certainly chock-full of chemicals. So I&#x27;d appreciate this more if it was more naturally made. Maybe it would cost more then? Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t lather so nicely? It&#x27;s hard for me to know. I&#x27;ll have to keep experimenting with alternatives to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But until then, I do recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this soap with my own funds.</li>
    <li> My Daughter says this is absolutely wonderful! It leaves the skin feeling clean, refreshed and it also leave a very nice non overpowering scent. You cannot ask for a better body wash.</li>
    <li> I bought this in bulk as an experiment of sorts to see if I would save lots of money.  The smell is great, and I have always found Suave products to be efficient and cost-effective.  However, for the size, if you are savvy as a shopper or with coupons, you would do better to go that route.  But, if you are too busy as I often am as a mom, go ahead and buy this in bulk.  You can distribute them throughout the house and in guest bathroom(s).  After purchasing, I cancelled my subscribe and save, b/c the size, I found, for this family of 6, it just didn&#x27;t last long enough for the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Body Wash! It smells FANTASTIC! It totally wakes me up and motivates me to get going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really worried that the smell might not be strong enough based on some of the reviews, but after receiving it, I am definitely not worried at all! You definitely can&#x27;t beat the value of this either! The price is fantastic and it creates a nice stock of body wash, so that you don&#x27;t have to go to the store to purchase more. Love it!</li>
    <li> EVEN THOUGH SUAVE IS A PRETTY COMMON BRAND NOW.....IT&#x27;S PRETTY HARD TO FIND MANGO MANDARIN SCENT.&lt;br /&gt;I GOT FRUSTRATED WASTING TIME LOOKING IN GROCERY OR DRUG STORES.  THEN IT DAWNED ON ME...DUHHH....&lt;br /&gt;LOOK ON AMAZON......I FOUND THE BODY WASH AND BODY LOTION AND CLICKED ON BOTH SO FAST.  MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY LOVE THE SCENT WHEN I APPLY THE LOTION, AND KEEP ASKING FOR SOME TO PUT ON.</li>
    <li> love the smell.  why spend so much on other body washes when this does the same job and smells great?!</li>
    <li> purchased for the price and number of bottle in the set.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
    <li> great soap, unfortunately I can purchase this considerably cheaper at supermarket.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not a high end product; it&#x27;s okay for kids and general washing; no realproblems or concerns.
