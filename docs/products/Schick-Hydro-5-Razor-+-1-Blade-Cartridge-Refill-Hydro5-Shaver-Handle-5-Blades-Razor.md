### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best disposable Razor Ever.</li>
      <li>I am happy!</li>
      <li>Very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Minor caveat - there is no &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; for the razor.</li>
      <li>Shaves like a non-disposable razor, great product!</li>
      <li>The Hydro 5 provides a very good shave.</li>
      <li>Great Shave from the Hydro 5 as any 5 blade</li>
      <li>These razors do a good job of getting a close shave.</li>
      <li>But all around Good product.</li>
      <li>Good razor---nuff said.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine razor at a great price.</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>These are by far the best ever made.</li>
      <li>Shaving with schick is more comfortable because  gel reservoir is better!</li>
      <li>I have been using all the latest Gillette razors for decades</li>
      <li>Too many blades.</li>
      <li>I use before Gillette, but  this can shave more clean, and  no beard inside razors  , because  between razors are twice more place than in Gillette.</li>
      <li>Much better deals out there, including full price at the neighborhood convenience store.</li>
      <li>should no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;I received free as a promotion from Schick</li>
      <li>Seemed to be able to last quite a while which was nice.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
      <li>I like these razors, tried fusion and like them to but they rust quickly.  </li>
      <li>Sure it&#x27;s an older model, but I didn&#x27;t want vibration or need the coupon.  </li>
      <li>The razor with only 3 blades is much smoother and more effective.</li>
      <li>I think they did just as good of a job as the other razors I use.</li>
      <li>With a little shopping on Amazon, the blades can be had for a very good price, comparable to these new shaving clubs (for their &amp;#34;unbranded&amp;#34; blades).</li>
      <li>It is still better than a new Power Fusion when it is brand new.</li>
      <li>There is a spot above the blades that releases aloe to help keep the shave smooth.</li>
      <li>but recently I have seen their blade quality drop off significantly.</li>
      <li>It seems kind of ridiculous</li>
      <li>They stay clean (no rust) and sharp.</li>
      <li>When I discovered the head pops back to allow for sideburn trimming, and getting into the tight spots (right by the nose), I had to give it a 5.</li>
      <li>The price is right to make me switch from my usual razors to these.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Was not as described doesn&#x27;t come with a refill like it says in the title very disappointed. Plus the cupon on the back is expired as of over 4 years ago.</li>
    <li> the product does not bring the refill</li>
    <li> Was broken when received</li>
    <li> Shaves like a non-disposable razor, great product!</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s an older model, but I didn&#x27;t want vibration or need the coupon.  It&#x27;s a fine razor at a great price. Arrived quickly and packaged well. I am happy!</li>
    <li> A BIT EXPENSIVE WE&#x27;LL USE DISPOSABLE</li>
    <li> Too many blades. The razor with only 3 blades is much smoother and more effective. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Only 1 cartridge, would of rather bought at cvs</li>
    <li> Scam - misleading description.  Much better deals out there, including full price at the neighborhood convenience store.</li>
    <li> OMG! I have been using all the latest Gillette razors for decades but recently I have seen their blade quality drop off significantly. I tried this and am on the 7th shave with the same cartridge. It is still better than a new Power Fusion when it is brand new. Goodbye Gillette!</li>
    <li> I liked it. Seemed to be able to last quite a while which was nice. Wish it had come with extra blade refills but it didn&#x27;t offer that. But all around Good product.</li>
    <li> Good razor---nuff said.</li>
    <li> I use before Gillette, but  this can shave more clean, and  no beard inside razors  , because  between razors are twice more place than in Gillette. Shaving with schick is more comfortable because  gel reservoir is better! I recommending it!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best ever made. Ill never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Best disposable Razor Ever. I shave every 2 days and can keep these for about a month without changing the blade. They stay clean (no rust) and sharp.</li>
    <li> The Hydro 5 provides a very good shave. When I discovered the head pops back to allow for sideburn trimming, and getting into the tight spots (right by the nose), I had to give it a 5. With a little shopping on Amazon, the blades can be had for a very good price, comparable to these new shaving clubs (for their &amp;#34;unbranded&amp;#34; blades). Very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Minor caveat - there is no &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; for the razor. It comes all by itself.</li>
    <li> Great Shave from the Hydro 5 as any 5 blade should no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;I received free as a promotion from Schick</li>
    <li> I assumed l was getting a razor (with a blade in it) &amp; a spare refill. Nope. No spare refill. You can&#x27;t count the blade that&#x27;s already in the razor as a refill.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a promotion from bzzagent.com. These razors do a good job of getting a close shave. The aloe helps keep from getting any razor burns. I think they did just as good of a job as the other razors I use. There is a spot above the blades that releases aloe to help keep the shave smooth. However, this makes it difficult to shave the spot under my nose. That is my only complaint. The price is right to make me switch from my usual razors to these.</li>
    <li> I like these razors, tried fusion and like them to but they rust quickly.  These last forever for some reason.  I have used 1 cartridge for over a month and I shave 5 days a week.  It seems kind of ridiculous but it&#x27;s true.</li>
