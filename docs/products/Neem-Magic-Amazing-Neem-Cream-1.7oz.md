      <li>it&#x27;ll work much better</li>
      <li>goes on so smooth and smell nice...</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found that the skin on my face prefers the Neem Magic more.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>was just okay -</li>
      <li>It smells nice, which is really rare in a neem cream, and it has a nice light texture.  </li>
      <li>This has a pleasant orange fragrance, nice pump and consistency of cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would like in the colder months, but would be plenty for most women who don&#x27;t have extremely dry</li>
      <li>From the fragrance, to the suppleness of her skin, to the clear pores has been amazing to see, and what a glow she has!</li>
      <li>It moisturizes, helps with my fine lines and leaves my skin in great overall condition.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work at the cellular level, making the texture of my face appear to be smooth and plump with moisture.</li>
      <li>I am a big believer in Ayurvedic natural creams and this is one of the best out there.  </li>
      <li>My questions have been answered quickly and shipping is super fast!</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin calm and behaving the way it should.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Ran out quick and didn&#x27;t notice much difference in skin appearance.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This cream is truly magic only a hint of the neem smell and all the benefits!  </li>
      <li>If you struggle with acne as I do, I really recommend you give this or the turmeric cream</li>
      <li>And since this is very hydrating I let it sit before I add my primer and makeup.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>OH WOW!!!</li>
      <li>I have tried products with neem oil in the past, and while I love the benefits of neem oil, I just can&#x27;t stand the way it smells!  </li>
      <li>So i saw the Dr Oz episode and thought sure I will try this, not worth the time to google or purchase!</li>
      <li>it did not seem to work the magic as it says on my face, but maybe I did not use it long enough-</li>
      <li>It has a little tingle when I first apply which goes away quickly.  </li>
      <li>, it left my face feeling greasy and cause my pores to clog in areas-along my jaw line-if you really want to clear up your skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
      <li>While I do not need to know the tech aspect of the product, the bottomline is every time I want the cream, I have to open the whole damn thing and pour into my hand.  </li>
      <li>My skin is soft and glowing after I apply the cream.  </li>
      <li>but so far I like it.  </li>
      <li>not sure it&#x27;s &#x27;magic&#x27; and there has been an improvement in my skin overall, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s specifically this cream, or the fact that I switched to all natural skin care and this was one of the creams I picked.</li>

    <li> Smells good and feels nice on the skin. Ran out quick and didn&#x27;t notice much difference in skin appearance.  That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Neem Cream makes my face feel wonderful,really great cream for the money,let&#x27;s keep it to our selfs so every one will not want it.</li>
    <li> So i saw the Dr Oz episode and thought sure I will try this, not worth the time to google or purchase!</li>
    <li> Love it, Recommend it and would love to purchase it again and again. It combines the properties of orange and neem, which is brightening, rejuvenating and purifying your skin. For me, I use it as a night cream, so that when I wake up I can see the results.</li>
    <li> Great Great Great don&#x27;t miss out on this Product I&#x27;m 50 years old take my work this works already told friends and family  Thanks</li>
    <li> was just okay - it did not seem to work the magic as it says on my face, but maybe I did not use it long enough- only went through one bottle.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant orange fragrance, nice pump and consistency of cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would like in the colder months, but would be plenty for most women who don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s &#x27;magic&#x27; and there has been an improvement in my skin overall, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s specifically this cream, or the fact that I switched to all natural skin care and this was one of the creams I picked.</li>
    <li> clogs my pores, makes my face look oily, caused bad break up. It&#x27;s too heavy for my skin. i regret buying it</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I am giving 4 stars to the product itself but the design is 1 star.  I received mine and the pump does not work. Back and forth emails between the Co and me where they indicated that the pump works with air and it does not have a pipe inside.  While I do not need to know the tech aspect of the product, the bottomline is every time I want the cream, I have to open the whole damn thing and pour into my hand.  The pump does not work AT ALL.  The customer service people are extremely unhelpful.  They have even stopped responding to emails.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It is rich but not greasy and best of all it smells wonderful!  I have tried products with neem oil in the past, and while I love the benefits of neem oil, I just can&#x27;t stand the way it smells!  This cream is truly magic only a hint of the neem smell and all the benefits!  I struggle with acne and this at night time and the turmeric cream as my day moisturizer is a perfect combo for my skin!  Keeps my skin calm and behaving the way it should. If you struggle with acne as I do, I really recommend you give this or the turmeric cream a try, you wont be disappointed. The company has wonderful costumer service.  My questions have been answered quickly and shipping is super fast!</li>
    <li> OH WOW!!! Where do we start? My fiance is the 1 using this and she is nuts about this product! From the fragrance, to the suppleness of her skin, to the clear pores has been amazing to see, and what a glow she has! :) Thanks! Will definitely recommend to family and friends!</li>
    <li> I love all of Neem products. They&#x27;re all great buys. Worth the money. You&#x27;ll be a subscriber once you try it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after watching the infamous Dr.Oz segment and was disappointed, it left my face feeling greasy and cause my pores to clog in areas-along my jaw line-if you really want to clear up your skin take a little evening primrose for a couple of weeks it&#x27;ll work much better just don&#x27;t stay on it for the long haul!</li>
    <li> I am delighted with my purchase of Neem Magic.  I have been using it once/day for four weeks and find that it has given my skin a moisturized and glowing appearance.  It seems to work at the cellular level, making the texture of my face appear to be smooth and plump with moisture. Amazing!</li>
    <li> What could go wrong when using this Moisturizer! Nothing!!! Ive been using it now for a little over a year. I bounced between this mositorizer and the Tumeric one for the Same brand. Both are great. But I&#x27;ve found that the skin on my face prefers the Neem Magic more. I tri-clean my face and either using a collagen booster or toner and seal the deal with this creme. It&#x27;s help with acne and the overall health of my skin. I have dark completion skin tone that has its oily spots. And since this is very hydrating I let it sit before I add my primer and makeup. It absorbs well. I&#x27;ve also tried other products from this brand. Definitely a permanent stable in this skin junkie&#x27;s arsenal.</li>
    <li> This is the best neem cream that I have tried.  I am a big believer in Ayurvedic natural creams and this is one of the best out there.  It smells nice, which is really rare in a neem cream, and it has a nice light texture.  My skin is soft and glowing after I apply the cream.  It is non-irritating and not to thick.  It has a little tingle when I first apply which goes away quickly.  It moisturizes, helps with my fine lines and leaves my skin in great overall condition.  I am very happy with the purchase and am glad I found it!  Hope they do not run out of stock again because it is a must have in my routine.</li>
    <li> goes on so smooth and smell nice...</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but a couple of weeks but so far I like it.  Not greasy at all but feels nice.</li>
    <li> absorb quickly into the skin, very good</li>
    <li> My face feels soft and it seems to even out dark spots.  I got it because it was said to control inching which I get sometimes around my eyes.</li>
