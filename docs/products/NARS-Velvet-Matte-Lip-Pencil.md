      <li>The awesomeness resides in how good this lip pencil is in what concerns durability or smoothness.</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect red for my skin tone and the quality is great.  </li>
      <li>It is also moisturizes and goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a beautiful bright red.  </li>
      <li>One of things that I&#x27;m hoping will combat this a bit though is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to reply many applications throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I love love love the color of Cruella.  </li>
      <li>love the color - love the texture.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lip pencil.</li>
      <li>i saw it on my ophthalmologist and fell in love with the color</li>
      <li>Favorite lip pencil ever.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a great product!</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and the finish is perfectly velvety.  </li>
      <li>and it was pretty dang near to still perfect.</li>
      <li>Very flattering to my skin tone and hair and so easy to use!!  </li>
      <li>I got this as a tester first from sephora on my birthday and inmediatly fell in love!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s smooth, rich and sexy....</li>
      <li>It is a very complimentary color for me.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the splurge!</li>
      <li>It super smooth to put ob</li>
      <li>645AM, I applied my lip balm first (eos - the ball shaped one) and then the lip pencil; it came on smoothly and easily - so far so good.</li>
      <li>have blonde hair with fair to medium skin.....</li>
      <li>After reading all the positive reviews about the NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil (in Cruella), I was really excited to receive mine in the mail to try it out!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s seriously the best i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an awesome blue red that i can&#x27;t find elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The matte finish is just right for my face and my coloring, I have a fair colored complexion with ash brown hair and blue eyes.</li>
      <li>I have the same primary concern as many others have mentioned before me</li>
      <li>nice- a semi-deep red-</li>
      <li>more red than blue-red</li>
      <li>I love it, but I am definitely also on the search for a cheaper day-to-day alternative.</li>
      <li>It is like using regular lipstick only the application is much more precise because of the precision of the pointed tip.  </li>
      <li>Some reviews complain about losing product when sharpening it, but really you don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
      <li>I even tried that whole apply, blot, fix with powder, repeat shebang just to see if that would</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous shade of a darker red without being too dark (if that makes sense).</li>
      <li>The red is more of a brick red, matt.  </li>
      <li>Such a nice deep red!  </li>
      <li>One of my major concerns prior to purchasing this was if the color would work on me, but I took the risk and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I am a fair-skinned redhead, so finding a good red lipstick is hard.</li>
      <li>The color is a fabulous &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; with a slight leaning toward a combination of a touch of orange and coral.  </li>
      <li>Such a lovely red, what a pity.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would say if you are interested in investing in a solid product - buy this.</li>
      <li>At 2PM I ate (a messy) lunch and basically wiped it off myself with a napkin, but even afterwards it still left my lips a cute lighter shade of red where I only applied my Baby Lips again and went about my day.</li>
      <li>It also does not appear to dry flakily or in the middle, which are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>and although is matte it does not dry out your lips and stays on forever.</li>

<li> I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHY THE WIDE SHARPENER</li>
<li> Only negative thing I can say is that it does dry out your lips a little bit after a long wear, so I just put some chapstick on before applying</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not worth the cost.  </li>
<li> : it&#x27;s so expensive, $25 for a tiny pencil (that requires sharpening) is slightly excessive.</li>
<li> I was disappointed in the color, but really for $25</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> ...even though expensive for the size...the color, the matte, staying power can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Favorite lip pencil ever.</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned redhead, so finding a good red lipstick is hard. I found a blog that recommended the Cruella Velvet Matte Lip Pencil and I am in love!!  Very flattering to my skin tone and hair and so easy to use!!  I just ordered a second one, as a backup!  Thank you for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews about the NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil (in Cruella), I was really excited to receive mine in the mail to try it out! My pencil was shipped the day after my purchase and even arrived a couple days before expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 645AM, I applied my lip balm first (eos - the ball shaped one) and then the lip pencil; it came on smoothly and easily - so far so good. I did notice some slight drying, typical with matte, and nothing that was bothersome or dry enough to cause cracks in my lips. During the course of my morning, I drank two cups of coffee and from my water bottle (one of those was with a straw) and went to check on my lipstick at 11AM and it was pretty dang near to still perfect. Seriously. It was like I had applied just an hour ago instead of the 4 hours (plus coffee wear!). At that point I simply applied some Baby Lips (in Cherry Me) to combat any minor signs of wear. At 2PM I ate (a messy) lunch and basically wiped it off myself with a napkin, but even afterwards it still left my lips a cute lighter shade of red where I only applied my Baby Lips again and went about my day. It also does not appear to dry flakily or in the middle, which are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just some background: my skin tone can range from medium to olive (depending on the season and sun exposure, you know) and I have brown eyes. One of my major concerns prior to purchasing this was if the color would work on me, but I took the risk and was not disappointed. It&#x27;s a gorgeous shade of a darker red without being too dark (if that makes sense). I have the same primary concern as many others have mentioned before me: it&#x27;s so expensive, $25 for a tiny pencil (that requires sharpening) is slightly excessive. One of things that I&#x27;m hoping will combat this a bit though is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to reply many applications throughout the day. Overall, I would say if you are interested in investing in a solid product - buy this. I love it, but I am definitely also on the search for a cheaper day-to-day alternative.</li>
    <li> I got this as a tester first from sephora on my birthday and inmediatly fell in love! It super smooth to put ob and although is matte it does not dry out your lips and stays on forever. Everytime i wear it i get tons of complimets !!! Def buy it,looks good on all skin tones</li>
    <li> ...even though expensive for the size...the color, the matte, staying power can&#x27;t be beat.  it&#x27;s an awesome blue red that i can&#x27;t find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It glides on like a gloss, but its a pencil/lipstick......it&#x27;s smooth, rich and sexy....&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair with fair to medium skin.....always get rave reviews when I wear it!!!!</li>
    <li> And I say lipstick because that&#x27;s what I use it for. It&#x27;s seriously the best i&#x27;ve ever had. It lasts long (only have to reapply a couple times if you wear it the entire day), and doesn&#x27;t bleed. I got the Cruella color which is the sassiest red you will ever see; I get compliments every time I wear it. It is matte, which works well for me because I don&#x27;t like the shiny look. Only negative thing I can say is that it does dry out your lips a little bit after a long wear, so I just put some chapstick on before applying</li>
    <li> color is absolutely wonderful!  Such a nice deep red!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting the color to be something else, especially given the name.  I was expecting a beautiful bright red.  The red is more of a brick red, matt.  Some reviews complain about losing product when sharpening it, but really you don&#x27;t have to.  Just give it one or two twists that all.  I was disappointed in the color, but really for $25 it&#x27;s not worth the cost.  It&#x27;s just okay, nothing great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lip pencil. It is like using regular lipstick only the application is much more precise because of the precision of the pointed tip.  The color is a fabulous &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; with a slight leaning toward a combination of a touch of orange and coral.  The matte finish is just right for my face and my coloring, I have a fair colored complexion with ash brown hair and blue eyes. It is a very complimentary color for me.</li>
    <li> It does not smudge and is long lasting! I love it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a long lasting lipstick or pencil.</li>
    <li> I love love love the color of Cruella.  It&#x27;s the perfect red for my skin tone and the quality is great.  It lasts a long time and the finish is perfectly velvety.  Definitely worth the splurge!</li>
    <li> great color and it stays on forever!  love it! i saw it on my ophthalmologist and fell in love with the color</li>
    <li> This is the best lipstick ever. The color is just a detail. The awesomeness resides in how good this lip pencil is in what concerns durability or smoothness. I love it.</li>
    <li> nice- a semi-deep red- more red than blue-red</li>
    <li> Everything about this lip pencil is great. the texture, color and price together makes this a great purchase. It is also moisturizes and goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the color!!!</li>
    <li> I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHY THE WIDE SHARPENER</li>
    <li> love the color - love the texture. lasts all day and night without having to touch up (even after drinking wine). Nars is great quality.</li>
    <li> It only lasts 30 minutes. I even tried that whole apply, blot, fix with powder, repeat shebang just to see if that would help-- nope, the colour disappeared after 35 minutes. Such a lovely red, what a pity.</li>
