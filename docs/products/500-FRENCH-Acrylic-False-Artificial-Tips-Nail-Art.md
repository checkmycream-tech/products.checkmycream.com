      <li>i would buy more</li>

      <li>Received them within 1 week of my purchase (with free shipping!)</li>
      <li>I was very excited</li>
      <li>So far so good though!</li>
      <li>Very cheap, flimsy , they bend and break easy</li>
      <li>they look good when they first get done</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed and good quality.</li>
      <li>I recieved my order quickly and the nails are great for first time users.</li>
      <li>Works good, easy to use, Very sturdy.</li>
      <li>These are actually very nice nail tips, but they were not the clear tips I thought I had purchased.</li>
      <li>They came packaged seperately for easy use.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re easy to put on.</li>
      <li>They split too easily.</li>
      <li>they are just as strong as the cala</li>
      <li>The nail and cheap and break easily.</li>
      <li>everything else was fine.</li>
      <li>Very fast with shipping!!</li>
      <li>Even when put up against a light, you can not see thru.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy, but they work good when right amount of acrylic is out on them.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I thought it unique.  </li>
      <li>They just look super cheap and unlike anything I have used before.  </li>
      <li>Although they were pretty when applied, I found a flaw very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I just received my clear nails and they were clearly marked in separate bags, which was great.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>They came pretty fast and I was able to use them right away.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>these were the right ones.  </li>
      <li>although the strength was good not worth paying for one thing and getting another</li>
      <li>Hi, I am very very very irritated.</li>
      <li>The nails are exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for the request of a french manicure or other french tip designs.</li>
      <li>Takes a little longer to get since coming from out of country, but nice product.</li>
      <li>I have been waiting for almost a whole month for this package, and I just recieved it today.</li>
      <li>VERY displeased.</li>
      <li>i really didn&#x27;t like this product theysent me</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>my real nail begins.  </li>
      <li>and you need to smash it to your nail bed which will not hold to nail no matter how much glue you may use</li>
      <li>I have yet to use these because I like the white tips better, but these seem to be almost a rubbery plastic, so I&#x27;m very intrigued by them, but I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet.</li>
      <li>Otherwise decent product.</li>
      <li>These are a little bit thicker than some others I have, and I like them better.</li>
      <li>I bought these nails a little worried, but I&#x27;m glad to say I like them.</li>
      <li>Very organized and professional.</li>
      <li>I love them especially since I got so much for so little.</li>
      <li>I am guessing the reason is because the nail is harder than natural nail, but also more fragile.</li>
      <li>and when you glue them if you push on them too hard the plastic bends and turns white, but all in all I liked them</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll have to replace the nail if you are doing clear.</li>
      <li>people believe they are my real nails especially since they match my natural nail color.</li>
      <li>Crystal clear</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this item because I thought it unique.  Although they were pretty when applied, I found a flaw very quickly.  The nails crack easily and several of them split down the middle when completing simple tasks.  I will give them to my nieces to play with.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and good quality.</li>
    <li> I finally got my nails,tey comeg numbered .........there great ......but the wait kindda made me sad but who maybe te postal office made the mistake......buht still great!!!!!</li>
    <li> There very good quality!</li>
    <li> Very fast with shipping!! Got them in 3 days. These tips are great!! Crystal clear so they a great for cool designs. Plus you definitly get alot for your money so to me this is a great buy if you are a nail tech. or even just playing around with it like me :))</li>
    <li> I received my tips today 1/12/2015!!! I love them, they are sturdy...so I will order these again!!! They came sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> These are a little bit thicker than some others I have, and I like them better. They seem like they hold up better. I haven&#x27;t had any problems using these and will reorder again.</li>
    <li> these nails are very thick and seem really strong,cant wait to use them</li>
    <li> Item arrived as promised. Good seller.</li>
    <li> Bad quality. The nail and cheap and break easily. They are not sturdy.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re nail tips what could possibly go wrong? All 500 was there (I had my wife count them 😂) and each number was in their own bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominique</li>
    <li> The nails are exactly what I wanted. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> My nails broke and I play fingerstyle guitar. Tried these nails as temporary emergency aid. After two hours of playing two out of three nails had little cracks already. After another hour of playing, one nail just totally broke in small pieces, and it&#x27;s all despite being filed very short, maybe some 2mm above fingertips. So, they didn&#x27;t pass the classical guitar test (nylon strings). I am guessing the reason is because the nail is harder than natural nail, but also more fragile. I&#x27;ve heard that temporary use of acrylic nails must be okay for guitar for weeks and I see no reason why these ones are not hard enough to last just a few hours.</li>
    <li> I just received my clear nails and they were clearly marked in separate bags, which was great.  The only problems I may have is there is no nail ridge on the underside like all other tips I have used, they are clear plastic and the tips are very thin compared to other tips I have used.  I have not worn them for very long, so I don&#x27;t know if that will be good or bad.  Because they are thin, they look much more natural.  I am not filling with anything and just smoothing the edge and painting gel nail color over it.  Since they are so thin, I don&#x27;t have any bumps where the tip ends and my real nail begins.  If they wear well, I think they will be much better than the tips I am used to.  They just look super cheap and unlike anything I have used before.  So far so good though!</li>
    <li> These are just...awesome! Very organized and professional. I will definitely be recommending and re-buying! I bought the clear set along with some nail glue (KDS) and I can&#x27;t wait to try them. I will be doing nail art on these.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you mucho!</li>
    <li> Works good, easy to use, Very sturdy. I would definitely reccomend this product to friends and family. It is perfect for if you just want to do a clear nail.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, but taking them out the package they seem as if they&#x27;ll work out fine!</li>
    <li> I do not like is not what I ordered.we can be used  they are very small</li>
    <li> I do not like the way these look they look good when they first get done but with these i always end up cutting them off but on the up side the bags are number ..</li>
    <li> Product arrived earlier than estimated, but was not quite as described. They were of different material than expected, and did not come in storage box as described. Otherwise decent product.</li>
    <li> They are great! Perfect.</li>
    <li> i ordered clear and i received white..... very disappointed. wont buy these again. although the strength was good not worth paying for one thing and getting another</li>
    <li> 50 do not arrive in each bag, 38 and 40 reach only each.</li>
    <li> Very strong nails I like them a lot compared to other ones I have used recommend highly thy come in baggies though so I recommend getting a nice nail case</li>
    <li> I love that they fit perfectly on my nails and they&#x27;re easy to put on. I love them! For the price, they are awesome! I recommend this to everyone! Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Great fit! Good product!</li>
    <li> These are actually very nice nail tips, but they were not the clear tips I thought I had purchased. They were WHITE!!!</li>
    <li> Very flimsy, but they work good when right amount of acrylic is out on them.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves this</li>
    <li> (Using husbands account) I bought these nails a little worried, but I&#x27;m glad to say I like them. They came pretty fast and I was able to use them right away. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like and the reason for the three stars is that they&#x27;re really curved on the tips that go on your nail and when you glue them if you push on them too hard the plastic bends and turns white, but all in all I liked them and I will buy them again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for a while and I have tried different sellers, and this one is one I will be buying from again</li>
    <li> I only buy cala  nails at sally&#x27;s but needed clear nails and thought what the heck I love these nails they are just as strong as the cala and I am sold I have been doing my own nails for 6 years and I get a lot of compliments on my nails this is a perfect nail for glitter</li>
    <li> love love love nomore words to descride i do my own nails and i love it i would buy more but i still havent run out they should make it so that you can order just your size but i still love it</li>
    <li> I love these. They are perfect for the request of a french manicure or other french tip designs. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so long, so much filing and cutting.</li>
    <li> These are FAR from clear, let alone crystal clear. I hate liars. Even when put up against a light, you can not see thru.</li>
    <li> I could tell by the picture these were the right ones.  Some clear tips out there are flimsy and thin, these are the nice rigid ones that hold their shape but not so thick and hard that they pop off when you try to glue them on. Just right. Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> Loved this tips! Received them within 1 week of my purchase (with free shipping!) I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Got these In the mail the only thing o have to say is they have a shallow well on the back side of the nails for glue.</li>
    <li> I recieved my order quickly and the nails are great for first time users. They came packaged seperately for easy use. My daugthers and I use them to do our own nails at home.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fingerstyle guitarist that wrecks a nail once in a while and these things bail me out till it grows back. Looks natural when used with &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; glue.</li>
    <li> nice seler best wishes thanks for item nice best wishes from croatia nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice</li>
    <li> would&#x27;ve given 5 stars IF THE PRODUCT WAS AS DESCRIBED. these tips are white, not &amp;#34;crystal clear&amp;#34;. everything else was fine.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use these because I like the white tips better, but these seem to be almost a rubbery plastic, so I&#x27;m very intrigued by them, but I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet.</li>
    <li> Hi, I am very very very irritated. I have been waiting for almost a whole month for this package, and I just recieved it today. I was very excited then I opened it and it was a shock. Some sort of weird calculator looking thing, with a paper that came with it saying it was called a: digital multimeter. I have no idea what that is, nor did I order one. I order FALSE NAILS. So not only did I wait about a month, but then I recieve the wrong item. VERY displeased.</li>
    <li> They split too easily.</li>
    <li> Came in during the estimated delivery times. Great buy for the price! Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> got the nail just on time...good price perfect packaging the only thing is that the tip are a lil to thin but other than that everything is ok...thnx</li>
    <li> bought the clear nail tips thinking they would be just half nails, but they sent me something for full nail coverage. what arrived did not look like the picture. as they are located in Singapore, returns/exchanges does not seem practical for me</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and very impressed with product. A great price!</li>
    <li> the only complaint I have would be that the nails were not properly labeled as to their size and numbers were molded into tips.</li>
    <li> These nail tips are amazing. They are thin which I actually prefer. They are a perfect fit too and there are no air bubbles either. When I put them on and file them people believe they are my real nails especially since they match my natural nail color. I love them especially since I got so much for so little.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase. I would 5 star it but I judt wish I could choose the sizes I need since half of them wont get used. Oh well I&#x27;ll just buy more when I run out of my sizes.</li>
    <li> Great product at great price. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Takes a little longer to get since coming from out of country, but nice product.</li>
    <li> Nails you get are thick like plastic a child would use,each baggie was marked with number of the nail size but all baggies were open and nails were everywhere.nails are meant to fit nail bed but these plastic ones are very half circle and you need to smash it to your nail bed which will not hold to nail no matter how much glue you may use</li>
    <li> i really didn&#x27;t like this product theysent me something else that  i didn&#x27;t order. Not to happy about it. I&#x27;ll recommend it to those that are looking for white tips not clear.</li>
    <li> These are ok..but missing a size that&#x27;s mentioned on the description.</li>
    <li> Not that bad, but you do get what you pay for.  Average length and flexibility, careful when clipping them as they may get a white trace and you&#x27;ll have to replace the nail if you are doing clear.</li>
    <li> The nails are too wide and don&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
    <li> So thin, they didnt hold to the nail glue, or to the acrylic powder and gel. i would not buy again</li>
    <li> Very cheap, flimsy , they bend and break easy</li>
    <li> Loads of nails :)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply - can do my own nail extensions at home now rather than going to the salon! Great investment! :)</li>
