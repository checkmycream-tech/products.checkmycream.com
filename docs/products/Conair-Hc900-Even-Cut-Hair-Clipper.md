      <li>it&#x27;s very easy clean up!</li>
      <li>However, I thought it was a great idea and would work on certain hair styles, but not my three dogs.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what you get if you attempt anything more than a \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; head.</li>
      <li>but I wanted a bit more hair on my head.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>I hope someone else has better luck that I did.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get better results with a pitching wedge.</li>
      <li>Make sure you get the neckline carefully.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I felt around and found some places I thought might be them, but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Make sure to get all around the ears and sideburns.</li>
      <li>and yeah, I think you will end up paying more for it at the end.</li>
      <li>It is not my favorite clipper.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The combguards need to be redesigned and the clipper itself needs more power.</li>
      <li>I read many reviews and decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>If you follow the directions (move unit around from many angles)</li>
      <li>With all the attachments removed I was able to get an even skin head look.</li>
      <li>We were glad to have found this product.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll actually be able to hear the difference in the sounds the clipper makes when you&#x27;ve got everything cut evenly and gotten all the tricky spots in the way your hair falls on your scalp.</li>
      <li>When I saw this \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; hair clipper, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try to see if it would save me any time, or deliver better results.</li>
      <li>Doing this twice a week doesn&#x27;t even take me more than 5 minutes or so each time.</li>
      <li>there are a couple tricks i&#x27;ve figured out to get the most out of the clipper and for ease of use.  </li>
      <li>You will need some touch up around the ears, with the provided sissor, even better have your wife, or gal to do the touch up.</li>
      <li>Doing this twice a week doesn&#x27;t even take me more than 5 minutes or so each time.</li>
      <li>More of a&amp;#34;lawn mower than an edger/trimmer&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many different hair and beard clippers over the years, they seem to be the best.</li>
      <li>It would be interesting to find out how Amazon arrives at their star rating.</li>
      <li>I had to run it over my head many many times.</li>
      <li>I have thinning hair on top, so this is really a godsend for me, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the look, and now being able to conveniently maintain it.</li>
      <li>Easy to use with a bit of practice.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Also cuts better when your hair is clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Conair Hc900 proves to be a simple idea building a great value product!</li>
      <li>Oh, yeah, ABOUT CLEANING, this thing is a nighmare to clean because you are not supposed to use water, but I would love to see you try with just a brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very gratefull purchasing this shaver, it&#x27;s a suprerb machine trimming the hair and leaving it very smooth and comftable!</li>
      <li>After the first couple times you use it, it maintains a nice even cut.</li>
      <li>I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, as my son&#x27;s hair is fine.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t review the differant length guards, but it works fine for me.</li>
      <li>That will work fine</li>
      <li>Seem to work fine, will take some getting used to to get it even.</li>
      <li>This unit cuts ok.handles fine,</li>
      <li>Take your time and it works fine.</li>
      <li>It does take a little time to get use to how this circular cut works for best results.</li>
      <li>The reviews of this item were helpful and accurate.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and clean up is a breeze.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;  - feels comfortable in your hand</li>
      <li>Great if you like short hair or are losing your hair ( like me).</li>
      <li>Lowest price was here on Amazon, free shipping and no tax.</li>
      <li>It is not for every one, but if it&#x27;s a consistant smooth one length cut you want, this worked well.</li>
      <li>Charge the day before using and enjoy.</li>
      <li>about 10 minutes later I had a perfect haircut, so much easier and faster than going to a barber.</li>
      <li>For many years I kept my hair combed back in a &#x27;businessman&#x27;s&#x27; cut, or as friends called it a &#x27;wise guy&#x27; cut.</li>
      <li>It looked like the perfect solution for someone like me who is constantly running the shaver every direction over his head to get a straight cut.</li>
      <li>very easy to use, fast and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>clipper is great for keeping your hair super short.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great clipper.  Shirley Morse Baker</li>
    <li> It is not my favorite clipper.  While it does a good job cutting hair, it does pull at times and does not give as close a cut as I&#x27;d like.  We kept it and did not return it bu haven&#x27;t used it since trying it our 2 times.</li>
    <li> Works best on the shortest haircuts.</li>
    <li> This, plain and simple doesn&#x27;t work as intended. I happen to have a very \\&quot;nice\\&quot; skull, my children too, and even so this machine doesn&#x27;t work properly on the sides and the back, so I need to finish it with my hair trimmer (which is actually easier and cleaner.) Oh, yeah, ABOUT CLEANING, this thing is a nighmare to clean because you are not supposed to use water, but I would love to see you try with just a brush. To make matters worse, the oil for the blades get mixed with the hair and makes it even more difficult to clean. Add the fact that its battery needs to be charged 16 hours but gives you less than 30 minutes of charge and yeah, I think you will end up paying more for it at the end. To recap, the sides will be next to impossible to cut even with the rest of the head, and it is a nightmare to clean. Buyers beware.</li>
    <li> The Hc900 is the best invention for cutting hair by yourself. My wife&#x27;s hands shake too bad for her to cut my hair anymore. Hc900 allows me to cut my hair by myself. I use no attachment for I like it short. At the same time you get a head massage. Its true Hc900 is only for short hair. Also cuts better when your hair is clean. I would definetly recommemd the Hc900.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Does a good job, I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying.  Easy to use and clean up is a breeze.  Charge the day before using and enjoy.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Conair Hc900 Even Cut Hair Clipper after watching the video. When I received the clipper, I charged the clipper for 18 hours before using it. The hair cut that I got was really bad, a lot of uneven hair. I had to cut my hair really short just to even up the rest my hair so it would look right. I return the clippers to Amazon and they (Amazon) took about six dollars for shipping when there no shipping fee at the time of purchased.  I have purchased many items from Amazon and always have had a great relation with Amazon. I will purchased from Amazon again but not a Conair Hc900 Even Cut Hair Clipper.</li>
    <li> it stops taking a charge in list init stops taking a charge in less then 1 year.. Past the point you have to use it plugged in.</li>
    <li> The negative reviews I have read here are spot on; this thing doesn&#x27;t cut very well, and when it does cut it cuts unevenly. Con-air should recall this product and offer all those who have one a full refund.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, fast and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;but range of hair length is too limited. the longest style is quiet short.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping the good reviews were correct and the lone bad review was off the mark.  As it turns out his review was correct.  This thing is a piece of crap.  I used it while traveling for work, I needed a quick trim and had not time to see a braber.  I should have made time! After reading the instructions twice, I was ready to use it.  I used it exectly as directed.  I ended up with a very uneven cut and had bald spot even with the highest settings.  I had to go to an all night walgreens to get clippers to even it out in time for work the next day, and was asked if I had started chemo because even though I made it better I am pretty close to bald and have spot where I am.  I am returning and I hope this rating is enough to keep anyone else from a self inflcted bad haircut.</li>
    <li> I cut very short.. close to #1 or lower.. this doesn&#x27;t work for that at all.&lt;br /&gt;GO with the Remington instead.</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair or are follicly impaired as I am and you want to keep your hair fairly short, this will work very well for you. I tried other hair clippers and had trouble getting an even cut. If you follow the directions (move unit around from many angles) you will get an even cut.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would recomend this product for those with a lot of thick hair.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping - as described - VERY happy?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27, I started losing my hair at around 22 so I&#x27;m not really worried about how my hair looks, I prefer to just keep it either very short or razor cut.  I take the attachment off of this and use just the clipper alone on my head.  Works pretty nicely, took about 8 minutes to get it all down to the same length.  I think it&#x27;s a nice device for those that wear their hair short for fashion or those in the military.</li>
    <li> That pretty much sums it up.  If you follow the directions (rotary motion; go both backwards &amp; forwards; keep at it until everything is at the required length), it works as advertised. That&#x27;s about it.  If you just do 1 or 2 passes, you&#x27;ll look like crap.  If you do it right, your hair will be evenly cut. Its much more robust than my Remington Hair Clipper, which lasted less than a year (and I&#x27;m not alone in that experience).</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need to go over the same spot over &amp; over again to get an even cut.&lt;br /&gt;The longer length you choose, the more you will have to repeat the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still have to use a pair of clippers or scissors to trim around your ears.&lt;br /&gt;If you zero you head, this is the device for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you are 3+, then you may want to stick with a traditional trimmer.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this device, despite all the negative reviews. You just have to think ahead before you shave your head. I didn&#x27;t and I still survived the experience.&lt;br /&gt;1. Not powered by a lithium battery. You must fully charge before using or you&#x27;ll end up with a bad cut and be stuck with a botched &#x27;do (and all your friends laughing at you) for hours until you can finish.&lt;br /&gt;2. Hair, itty bitty prickly itchy bits of hair is going to get ALL over you. Pro tip: buy a barber cloak. Pro-am tip: cut 3 small slits in a (CLEAN) trash bag for your head and arms and wear it. SRSLY.&lt;br /&gt;3. You&#x27;ll still need a shower immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use the oil.&lt;br /&gt;5. The real start! Slowly but firmly drag the trimmer from the back to the front of your scalp in a straight line, doing this in rows. If your hair is longer or thicker, you want to give the clipper a shake at the end of each row, at least to start. Make sure you get the neckline carefully.&lt;br /&gt;6. Now front to back in rows. Make sure to get your bangs and your hairline carefully or you&#x27;ll have uneven spots, like a short widow&#x27;s peak and longer bangs, or vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;7. Now left to right. Make sure to get all around the ears and sideburns. I have a little Schick Quattro razor with a AAA powered beard trimmer I used to help with the most difficult areas. This clipper actually comes with a free &#x27;partner&#x27; straight trimmer coupon by mail.&lt;br /&gt;8. Right to left, same as 7.&lt;br /&gt;9. Like the ears, here&#x27;s the other part where a beard trimmer (or the free mailed-to-you trimmer) comes in handy: this clipper is pants at getting the back of your neck. Most electric razors have a simple trimmer attachment. That will work fine here.&lt;br /&gt;10. The finishing touch. Kind of like you would with a rotary electric shaver, go around your entire head in tight circles, clockwise and counterclockwise over the entire area. Wax on/wax off. You&#x27;ll actually be able to hear the difference in the sounds the clipper makes when you&#x27;ve got everything cut evenly and gotten all the tricky spots in the way your hair falls on your scalp. Comb it out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the results with a mirror! Than go take a victory shower - even with all the combing there&#x27;s still tons of trimmings stuck in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FIRST time you use it, if your hair is long, you&#x27;ll want to repeat step five 2 or 3 times, using the included comb in between to get all the trimmings trapped in your hair, then repeat 6, 7 and 8 a couple times with combings in between. If you keep yourself trimmed up once or twice a week you probably won&#x27;t have to do the steps repeatedly again after that - just the comb in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with all my screw ups, total cutting time for me was less than 30 minutes the first time, but my hair was several inches long. Doing this twice a week doesn&#x27;t even take me more than 5 minutes or so each time. And I&#x27;ve been complimented on my new spiky look several times already. I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 for one reason only - the lack of a lithium battery.&#x27;ve got everything cut evenly and gotten all the tricky spots in the way your hair falls on your scalp.

    <li> Pros: - Multiple settings and has a long charging cord so you can use this while its plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;  - feels comfortable in your hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: - The blades are not very sharpe. I had to run it over my head many many times. However I do have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;  - If you are not careful with the angle you are cutting at, you could cut too close and not at the desired length.&lt;br /&gt;  - Tough to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;  - Doesnt get around the ears well as other have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for at $30. If you dont have thick hair this could work a lot better for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very gratefull purchasing this shaver, it&#x27;s a suprerb machine trimming the hair and leaving it very smooth and comftable!</li>
    <li> Be paitent, at first it looked raged, follow directions, it smooths out. It is not for every one, but if it&#x27;s a consistant smooth one length cut you want, this worked well. You will need some touch up around the ears, with the provided sissor, even better have your wife, or gal to do the touch up. I am very pleased, good job ... Conair.  [[ASIN:B004UKT2PU Conair Hc900 Even Cut Hair Clipper]]</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for over 20 years, with several different hair styles as the times have changed. For the past 5 months, I have kept my hair evenly short, using a traditional hair clipper with a No. 1 attachment. When I saw this \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; hair clipper, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try to see if it would save me any time, or deliver better results. Unfortunately, using the HC900 took more time and delivered disappointing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The design of the HC900 cuts/chops/clips your hair, but does not \\&quot;eject\\&quot; the hair, so it can build up in the cavity above the cutting blades. In turn the clippings continually get cut shorter and shorter, as it is recycled back into the cutting area. What happens is that a lot of the tiny clippings get embedded into your hair, or ejected all over the place. When using a traditional clipper, the first pass usually yields the longest clippings, and you can direct where those clippings are dropped. There is also minimal multi-chopped clippings that get stuck on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This does not clip evenly. Even after 20 passes over the same area, I could hear the clippers cutting a little bit more hair. The result is that there are a lot of high spots and a lot of low spots. A friend and my wife, both commented on how \\&quot;off\\&quot; the haircut was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3, You definitely need another set of traditional clippers to clean up the edges and also around the ears. Why bother with using more than one tool, when you can use just the traditional clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Cleanup is a real chore. Not only do the clippings get all over the place, cleaning the HC900 is a royal pain. When traditional clippers, all it takes is about 6 passes with the cleaning brush, and it looks brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to cut your own hair, or have a friend/family member do it for you, save yourself the aggravation of buying one of these, and stick to the traditional clippers.</li>
    <li> Even in the video you can see it does not provide an even cut.  No matter how slow, nor how many different directions, no matter what I have tried to do to make this work it just doesn&#x27;t.  Eventually I just have to get out my standard clippers and fix it.  I can&#x27;t send it back because it was a gift and I didn&#x27;t get a gift receipt with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend your money in this one.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first to even try this, some of the reviews had scared me. Anyway one morning I decided what the heck and grabbed it and began. I was really surprised and worried when I saw big clumps of hair fall into the sink but just kept on as the instructions had said. about 10 minutes later I had a perfect haircut, so much easier and faster than going to a barber. Yes I really like this gadget and I&#x27;m sure glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much faster to use my conventional trimmers than to use this thing.  I wanted to be open minded about this, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  The combs around the outside act more as spacers and don&#x27;t seem to do much to line hair up for the cutters.  It also doesn&#x27;t cut hair around your ears very well.  Another reviewer noticed that, and I have to second them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several, and this is my favorite. I keep my hair military style short, and it is so easy once a week to run it around on level 2 on top, and level 1 on the sides. After the first couple times you use it, it maintains a nice even cut.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut to perfection I cut my hair short so with no level setting just blade to hair it shaped and cut my hair to perfection , only thing not so good was the package was missing the blade oil which it crucial for maintaining the clipper</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll get better results with a pitching wedge. Had to break out a set of regular clippers to clean up mess Conair made. Some claim good results but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I am balding on top and keep hair trimmed to a #2 on sides,  the Conair does a fantastic job!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wish it had a little longer of a gut.  But i love it and it is saving me $20 a cut.</li>
    <li> Very good.  The reviews of this item were helpful and accurate.</li>
    <li> I used this without a guard. It worked great I love it. It does take some time to get use to. The first time I didn&#x27;t like it but now I Love it.Thinking about buy two more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Great product! Perfect for guys that shave their heads, and keep it simple. You&#x27;ll never have to pay for a haircut again!</li>
    <li> This little guy works, takes a little getting us to but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s great for man-scaping!</li>
    <li> Seem to work fine, will take some getting used to to get it even. Great!</li>
    <li> 1. Does not clip around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not cut hair on back of neck to give an even edge.&lt;br /&gt;3. Used it once and had to go to the hairdresser to get the result fixed.</li>
    <li> I can not emphasize enough what a truly worthless product this is. I am utterly amazed and very suspicious as to why this product has more than 2 stars. I have used two separate units and they were both garbage. Trust me when I tell you to take your money and run, run far far away from this product. The design is flawed, the construction is poor, the battery unreliable. You have been warned!  Do not use without a backup plan or you will look like you have radiation poisoning. It does a horrible job of creating an even cut. Th only use I have found for mine is that if I use it first to start cutting my hair I can then finish cutting my hair with my remington short hair cut trimmer and using the two together seems to work fairly well. If you just use this trimmer however you will end up looking ridiculous, have a backup plan.  The battery died on this after about 4 hair cuts. It stalls out and shutsdown almost immediately but honestly I only attempted to incorporate it into my haircut routine because I purchased the dumb thing. This is a product that never should have been released after testing it.</li>
    <li> easier to use than the Norelco I bought earlier (for a one-handed handicapped )</li>
    <li> I just used this and I am VERY pleased with it.  It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to handle, unlike my deafeningly loud, clunky old flow-bee.  I first saw it in a Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue and was quite intrigued.  About six months later when I had the money I went ahead and ordered it.  As I usually am with new machines I was a little worried the instructions would be confusing, but it&#x27;s pretty intuitive.  I kind of approached it gradually.  My only complaint is about the &amp;#34;oil slots&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;inside the blade ring&amp;#34;.  I couldn&#x27;t find them, and it&#x27;s dark and black inside, so I couldn&#x27;t see I could barely see anything even under a bright light with readers.  I felt around and found some places I thought might be them, but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure.  I ended up just applying the oil, recommended with each use, directly onto the blade itself.  Hope that&#x27;ll be okay, at least until I found the slots.  I have thinning hair on top, so this is really a godsend for me, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the look, and now being able to conveniently maintain it.</li>
    <li> The Conair Clipper is just what I needed.  I use it without the attachments for a VERY close cut.  It is almost like shaving the head, but it leaves a little there.  It just makes it look sharp and all the same length.  I was unable to accomplish the look with regular clippers.  I thank the person that came up with this idea.  I can see if you use the attachments on longer hair that it would give a cropped look and be fine for a little extra length.  I hope they do not discontinue this item.&lt;br /&gt;RW&lt;br /&gt;Midlothian, TX</li>
    <li> Take your time and it works fine. We used it for our son who is very upset when getting his hair cut by either traditional clippers or scissors. This was SO much easier for us. The cut can be a bit inconsistent and it requires multiple passes. We would have to re-do areas with clockwise and then counter clockwise movements but it cut well and his hair looks good. Our son had 2-3 inch hair, so after cutting a small area, we had to stop the cutter and clean out the inside. The item came partially charged and all the accessories were there and sealed. Overall we are glad to have gotten it, and will keep using it. We were glad to have found this product.</li>
    <li> For a Do-it-Yourself Barber this is the trimmer you want! It comes with two guides for total of six cutting levels. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for quite a few years now, and I&#x27;ve went through some trimmers as well as full blown clippers. I believe this could be used as either!</li>
    <li> Conair HC900 is what they said and I will give them 3 1/2 star.  Its good and I will use it a few more time to learn more.</li>
    <li> I named it the Lawn Mower, cause that is the way it sounds and cuts the hair..I hate this little piece of crap, and I would never recomended even to my worsed enemy...This thing, truly CHOPS your hair...</li>
    <li> It does a lousy job............it cuts in patches, not an even cut.</li>
    <li> previous one lasted 2 years.It more than payed for itself.Hope this one does as well.Excellent deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair unevenly so you never know what it will look like after you are done, but if you keep going over it and over it, sometimes it gets close.  I still love it.!</li>
    <li> READ THE DIRECTIONS AND CHARGED THE CORRECT TIME.THE CUTTER WORKS WELL.I LIKE MY HAIR SHORT.I REALLY LIKED IT CUTS EXACT EAVEN QUICK .AND ON MY TIME.WORKING LONG HOURS LIKE ALL OF US ,CAN PUT 25 BUCKS IN MY GAS TANK INSTEAD OF THE HAIRCUTTERS POCKET.</li>
    <li> Love it, best hair cutter ever, cuts your hair at the length you want, there are 4 settings,so easy to use.  Would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I either shave my head or use a clipper to get the shortest cut possible. I use the Conair without the plastic comb guides (as per the owner&#x27;s manual) and I can give myself an even, extremely short, stubble length cut in about five minutes. You can use it plugged in, which I do, and it runs faster and cuts best that way. My only criticism, hence four stars instead of five, is that it does a poor job on your neck and around the ears. Need to use a trimmer to correct that. Overall, if you desire the same type of cut as I do, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> i use this clipper without the guard every day.  i don&#x27;t get nicks in my scalp like i used to get from a straight-line clipper, and this clipper makes it easy to get all the spots in the back that you can&#x27;t see.  there are a couple tricks i&#x27;ve figured out to get the most out of the clipper and for ease of use.  1. KEEP IT CLEAN AND OILED.  i cannot emphasize this enough.  brush out the hair daily and oil it at least every 3rd use if not every use.  2.  start in a straight line motion, back to front to back, and then side to side.  follow this with small circular motions.  you will hear the hair being clipped.  when you don&#x27;t hear the hair being clipped it means the hair is cut short in that spot.  3.  go slow and be patient.  going slow is actually faster than using the old straight clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this clipper is great for keeping your hair super short.  it takes the guesswork out of the self-cut and is comfortable, easy, fast, and trouble-free.  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It has far exceeded all my expectations. For anybody that wishes to wear short hair this does the job easily and with precision!</li>
    <li> A great product. I use it every 4-5 weeks. Great if you like short hair or are losing your hair ( like me). I haven&#x27;t been to a barber in over a year. It takes some getting used to and you have to use it for about 10 minutes to get a good cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also need a trimmer for behind the ears and sideburns. Also a small hand held mirror.</li>
    <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;Stupid unfindable &amp;#34;oil slots.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it cuts hair if you like it 2-3 inches long but not down to scalp (&amp;#34;0 grade&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;An all &#x27;round messy result.&lt;br /&gt;Impossible to clean.</li>
    <li> Very well made product, backed up with a 5 year warranty! For many years I kept my hair combed back in a &#x27;businessman&#x27;s&#x27; cut, or as friends called it a &#x27;wise guy&#x27; cut. No matter who I went to for a hair cut they never cut my hair as short as I wanted. That seems to be a problem often heard from most men with regular length hair. I finally got my wife to start cutting my hair about 18 months ago. Using a clipper set with the different size combs and a little practice blending and cutting the top with scissors I finally got the best haircuts of my life. As time went on, and since I&#x27;m semi retired with less hair and some baldness, I kept asking her to keep shorting the cut. Finally it got to just using a #3 comb all over my head and a trim around the ears and neck. So I thought since I am keeping my hair one length why not try out this Conair HC900 and stop taking up my wifes time. First to know you need to have your hair at 1 inch or less before you can use this Conair unit. You get 2 round combs for 6 settings of 1/8\\&quot;, 1/4\\&quot;, 1/3\\&quot;, 1/5\\&quot;, 3/5\\&quot; and 3/4\\&quot;. You can run the unit without any comb and get a stubble look. It does take a little time to get use to how this circular cut works for best results. Just keep in mind if you follow the instructions on cutting pattern magically after the last step of circular motions you have a great even one length hair cut. I use the unit every 10 to 14 days on #4 setting, 1/2\\&quot;, average time is about 10 minutes. There was a coupon in the box for a $17 battery operated small Conair Trimmer set with accessories, for just $6.99. I use that small trimmer for trimming sideburns and ear, neck line. Lowest price was here on Amazon, free shipping and no tax. Average cost of a haircut in my area with a tip is about $15 at the cheapest. Thats a savings of around $180 a year (almost a tank of gas).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut like it shows on Tv. Takes a long time and creates a mess.Won&#x27;t return it but certainly not worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Beware: The teeth on the 1-3 adjustment comb aren&#x27;t solid plastic all the way through and are each held on by 2 little contact points.  Any little drop from your hand to the sink could cause one to break off (as mine did the first time I used it). I called Conair about it and they wouldn&#x27;t replace it under the warranty because \\&quot;I was at fault\\&quot; for dropping it.  I was so mad - spent $30 on a product that&#x27;s so cheaply made it broke the first time I used it.  The worst part is that they won&#x27;t even sell you a replacement comb out of their parts store, so if you break it you&#x27;re out of luck.  I give them a horrible customer satisfaction rating for the whole experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the haircut goes.  It does provide a nice even haircut around most of your scalp and it is easy to use.  Around your neckline and and around your ears, however, it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job and many stray hairs are left a little longer than the rest, I guess that&#x27;s why they offer a free detail trimmer to go with it.  So I&#x27;d give it an &#x27;okay&#x27; rating as far as the product use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m more disappointed with the company than I am the product.  True, I dropped it and I suppose I am responsible.  But it&#x27;s so cheaply made, I wish the company would do more to stand by their customer and behind their product.  My wife and I won&#x27;t be buying any other Conair products anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Made for close cropped hair.  It might make a nice gift for anyone who has a person in the military, to keep them well groomed between haircuts..</li>
    <li> My husband saw this in Skymall and wanted to try it.  It is better than expected.  Multiple settings allow him to adjust as needed and it is very easy to use one handed as described</li>
    <li> It work best if you want to cut all hair to a same very short lenght. It does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would not work if you want too style your hair with veriabl length, or only a small area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good cutting blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- happy customer</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS on clearance. It did such a poor job that I felt compelled to give it a review on Amazon to forewarn any prospective buyers. I was looking for a nice even #2 cut. This thing was all over the place. Short hair in one spot and long in another. Didn&#x27;t matter how hard you pressed, it would just glide over some spots and then cut others.It has a very appealing design being cordless and rechargeable but is totally nonfunctional. After my patchy haircut with this thing I bought a regular corded clipper (also made by Conair)and got the even cut I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Got a good haircut with it.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews and decided to try it.  It would probably be the greatest if you have hair that grows straight out of the follicle.  I have curly hair that grows every which way.  I tried my best and was very patient (ya gotta be patient), but to no avail.  I had to go back to my Wahl.</li>
    <li> it doesnt cut all the hairs. it woould work better if it could lift the hair while cutting. it makes uneven cuts</li>
    <li> The human head is rounder in some places and flatter in others. The round parts of your head protrude into the device closer to the rotating blade. The result is a decidedly uneven haircut, especially on the round top/back part of the head where many men get a bald spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even using the 1/2\\&quot; locking comb, the highest cutting length, the top/back part of my head was cut to about 1/8 of an inch, making this part of my head appear bald. My bald spot doesn&#x27;t need to be emphasized. So to sum up, the Conair Hc900 can&#x27;t possibly cut hair evenly because the human head is round in some places and flat in others. Stick with clippers.</li>
    <li> Instead of spending $10.00 or $12.00 per week at a barber I cut my own buzz cut with this trimmer in a couple of minutes without any complaints so far.</li>
    <li> This product was misnamed, I would&#x27;ve called it \\&quot;Mange Cut\\&quot;. That&#x27;s what you get if you attempt anything more than a \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; head. With all the attachments removed I was able to get an even skin head look. Nothing wrong with that, but I wanted a bit more hair on my head. So defiantly don&#x27;t buy this if your looking to maintain a buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really recommend it for balding either, it worked but it&#x27;s probably easier just to use standard clippers. It&#x27;s nice for the back of the head, but awkward around the ears and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to charge it 16 hours out of the box, and your supposed to charge/run it down every month etc. People today are spoiled by Lithium-ion. I found myself put off by having to think about the battery. The charge lasts 20 minutes and you can use it corded but not for longer than 15 min. (they recommend).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had been marketed as a head shaving device I might have given it 2 stars. But it really doesn&#x27;t work for a buzz cut. That&#x27;s my main complaint. It failed to improve on classic clippers in anyway. So whats the point? (To get suckers like me to give Con Air $20.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with a pair of old fashioned electric clippers. Probably WAHL brand. I&#x27;ve had many different hair and beard clippers over the years, they seem to be the best.</li>
    <li> This unit cuts ok.handles fine,although it doesnt taper you get a good cut all over.the price was in line.thank you</li>
    <li> Was interested in this product, but wanted to read the reviews when I saw the 3-star rating; thought the product maybe could be OK. After reading many bad reviews, I realized the Amazon 3-star rating was optimistic. After doing a little math, I found that the weighted average of the reviews comes out to 2.75 stars out of 5, not the 3 stars pictured. Maybe Amazon rounded UP their star count on this product, even though I see other reviews showing star fractions? It would be interesting to find out how Amazon arrives at their star rating. Note: I am not a purchaser, just a potential purchaser--but not anymore. [The math, done when there were 40 reviews: 15 reviews x 1 star + 5 x 2 stars + 4 x 3 stars + 7 x 4 stars + 9 x 5 stars &#x3D; 110, divided by 40 reviews, &#x3D; average review is 2.75 stars. So my rating is 2 stars, to adjust the weighted average close to 2.75 stars.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the result of my 2-star review went live, the Amazon star chart shows ~ 2.5 stars; perhaps a little low but at least it&#x27;s below 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Not able to get replacement parts easily</li>
    <li> Easy to use with a bit of practice. Must be kept clean and charged. Oil it frequently. More of a&amp;#34;lawn mower than an edger/trimmer&amp;#34;. Look elsewhere for &amp;#34;trimming and sculpting&amp;#34;.  If you want to save a fortune on hair cuts, then this could be your answer. If you want to keep your hair close-cropped and looking consistent day-to-day, then this is the tool to accomplish this look.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for me....I shave my head.....takes a minute or two every morning.....I dont have to get someone to shave my head anymore....not sure if it would work if you had longer hair.....but works  great for me</li>
    <li> Maybe this gadget works if you have thicker hair that tends to stand up. I have somewhat thinner hair that lays down nicely - but I still like it short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that by design it would lift hair, cut, and repeat as I moved it around my head. That&#x27;s not the case - the combguards don&#x27;t stand your hair up at all and the clipper doesn&#x27;t generate any vacuum effect to pull your hair up. And as other reviews have noted, it takes forever. I expected that having read those reviews - I didn&#x27;t expect it to take THAT long. Nearly as long as it takes when I have my haircut professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combguards need to be redesigned and the clipper itself needs more power. It&#x27;s too flawed to work on at least some hair types.</li>
    <li> Does not work, after 10 min. I looked like a cancer patient. It was a real let down, no part of it did what it says it will. I sent it back and bought Andis pivot head set, it works better than advertised.</li>
    <li> Extremely uneven cuts, takes forever.  Every time I use it my girlfriend has to go over my head with a traditional razor.  Edges are awful, and doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near the quality they claim in the ads.</li>
    <li> Looks good, but dose not work as advertised, or maybe my head is miss shaped.  I don&#x27;t know which is true so I blame it on the product.  Don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
    <li> This is great for butch hair cuts, it cut very well and most of the hair stays in the hollow cavity in the middle of the cutter.  It is easy to clean and does a great job.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a thirdy-four years old guy with hair problems... So I decided to adopt a short hair style to dissimulate the thinness of the wisps of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this item on a catalogue of an expensive imports shop here in Brazil (Polishop) and I just had to experiment. Buying it from Amazon was easy, cheap (just a half of Polishop&#x27;s price) and the item came safely and in no more than a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Conair Hc900 proves to be a simple idea building a great value product! It is very well constructed, robust and reliable; it really cuts pretty precisely just by moving the piece around your head. WARNING: You need to be short haired already to get best performance.&lt;br /&gt;To use it unplugged, one full battery charge offers weeks of &amp;#34;retouching&amp;#34; capability, yet you can use it wired.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a negative review I read here before buying it, mentioning &amp;#34;cleaning problems&amp;#34;, if you don&#x27;t try to cut a long hippie hair with this clipper, I guarantee no mess in your bathroom sink!</li>
    <li> I keep my hair as short as I can so I can&#x27;t review the differant length guards, but it works fine for me. Iv got a kinda lumpy head so it took a little practice but after a few try&#x27;s I got it down. What I really like, is the hair collects in the recess in the shaver, so as long as you keep it tight to your head it&#x27;s very easy clean up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;comb guide&amp;#34;.  Get a &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; cut so it works well.  Have only used it once and after the next use it will have paid for itself by not paying barber fees with a tip.</li>
    <li> Did no like it seems to pull your hair as it cuts it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t write a revue as my Conair was broken when it got to me.  However, I thought it was a great idea and would work on certain hair styles, but not my three dogs.  I was hoping it would be the perfect grooming tool.  Not so much.</li>
    <li> The Conair HC900 works as described.  Great for crew cuts.  Cuts evenly.  No mess, easy to clean.  Long battery life.  Recharges quickly.</li>
    <li> The seller was fine but this product may need to go back to the drawing board.  I gave this to my brother that keeps his head almost shaved.  He tried it but it didn&#x27;t really work for him the one time I saw him try it.  He ended up removing the guard entirely and shaving his head completely.  Wasn&#x27;t really what he was going for.</li>
    <li> Head unit worked quite well. When used per instruction it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller trim unit failed at 11 months, motor went, would totally discharge a new set of batteries in 5 seconds. I paid $3.99 for the extended warranty from SquareTrade.com. Emailed them a copy of the Amazon.com order confirmation. They are in the process of crediting the paid amount back into my Amazon account. Will add to this review when the credit shows up.</li>
    <li> After only two uses the thing stop working  too cheap motor</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for 15 years with the regular barber style shavers. I saw this and instantly fell in love with the idea. It looked like the perfect solution for someone like me who is constantly running the shaver every direction over his head to get a straight cut. I bought it without really even reading a whole lot of reviews because it seemed like such perfect solution for me. It was designed for people like me. Then.... I got it an eagerly tried it out. Wow. After taking twice as much time, I had to stop and get out my old shaver and finish with that. The hair that it did cut didn&#x27;t cut even or at the same level on my old razor. I will be returning this thing asap. I hope someone else has better luck that I did.</li>
    <li> I admit that this product was an impulse buy on my part.  I cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair regularly and this looked like a great product to make the job easier, as my son is 21 months old and doesn&#x27;t like to sit still for haircuts.  Whenmy husband opened th box it was missing the comb, scissors, neck brush and oil that were supposed to come with it.  It did have a drape included that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be in there.  But those things didn&#x27;t bother me because we already have those items from other clipper sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first go around on my son&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t fare well.  It seemed like it took forever to get anything resembling an even cut, and that was only on a small part of his head!  We followed the directions and went from back to front and in a circular motion, but it just wasn&#x27;t working well.  So we switched back to the clippers and finished up the job, only to find out that there were sections cut by the Even Cut that were shorter than the guide we used.  Yuck!  My husband commented that our son looks like he&#x27;s going through chemo! (He knows from experience, as he finished chemo nine months ago.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, as my son&#x27;s hair is fine.  My husband has thick, coarse hair so we decided to give the Even Cut a try on him. Maybe the problem was that my son&#x27;s hair never really got to the clippers evenly.  Equally as terrible results! We are back to using the tried and true clippers!</li>
    <li> Did not work as you think, you have to go over and over your head.  Not worth the time and money.</li>
    <li> Be careful. It will leave you bald quickly. The settings are a bit deceiving.</li>
    <li> sold me a broken item&lt;br /&gt;would not hold a charge an they told&lt;br /&gt;it was my fault and now they wont give me my&lt;br /&gt;money back and now i have the law invalid</li>
    <li> No good, didn&#x27;t cut hair and hard plastic hurts your head</li>
