<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this oil. I use it in the mornings as a moisturizer with one drop per each part of my face (each cheek, forehead, chin, then neck) and it does what I need it to. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> Nice oil.....love this product...thanks!</li>
    <li> Exceed my expectation</li>
    <li> it smells really like a rosehip oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for your skin! It&#x27;s like a miracle in a bottle for wrinkles, scars, and general skin health. This is super high quality, cold pressed organic, the best you can get and the price is perfect!</li>
    <li> My skin seems to glow with using just a little of this oil.  My Rosacea seems to be under control - the first time in almost a year!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. I was expecting a rose fragrance to the oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s replaced my moisturizer and I use it every day. Even at that rate I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll finish it for awhile!  In love!!</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  It arrived when promised and the packaging was perfect; each container had no flaws.  I use this as a facial oil at night, along with some other essestial oils, etc.  It does a great job and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I am using this with carrot oil on my face, after dermarolling and its wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It takes the pain away from the derma rolling and hydrates quickly, also it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oil look or feel.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone skin, and didn&#x27;t realize when I&#x27;d purchased this that it was not going to work with my skin. I can say that even in the incredibly short amount of time that I used this product, I noticed a reduction in redness/hyper-pigmentation on my skin. It did make me break out, however, but as I&#x27;ve now learned, that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are dealing with redness, scarring or wrinkles and are not prone to acne breakouts, this product will be perfect for you. I hope to be able to return to rosehip seed oil in the future!</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. Yuck!</li>
    <li> This smelled rancid the moment I opened it.  I was very disappointed and didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks, but it&#x27;s already cleared up my face and gotten rid of some winter dry patches I was suffering from- this stuff is fantastic. I have very acne prone skin so I was concerned how I would fair with this oil- but I&#x27;ve had no problems. I put it on my face under my moisturizer every other night and use it to remove my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It hardly smells at all and contains some vitamin E to preserve it- though I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s still good to refrigerate it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can also be used on hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for winter</li>
    <li> Great for mixing a few drops into daily face and body moisturizer. I would not make it through arctic winters without lizard skin without it. Nice rich amber color and smells fresh, seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> Love love love! Mix a couple drops of this with Watt&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid and a drop of lavender/tea tree essential oil, and you have the perfect everyday face treatment for blemished skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product; I put it on at night to moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have reordered several times.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about the benefits of  Rosehip Seed Oil sooner. I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted so much money on serums that for the most part, don&#x27;t do anything they promise. This oil has become my night time ritual. I love how natural it is and that it sinks right in, leaving my face feeling so soft and smooth. I use it alone without applying a moisturizer over it, after cleansing and toning. This is by far the best and most economical skin treatment I&#x27;ve used. The oil is amber in color and has a mild odor to it, a little bit earthy but by no means overpowering. By the time I&#x27;m finished applying it to my face, the smell has completely dissipated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks and it has not only lightened my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, but it has decreased blemishes as well which was completely unexpected.  Since my skin is oily, a lot of other oils I have tried have not been compatible with my skin, but the light, dry quality of this one makes it perfect.  Now that I know that rosehip oil works for me I have ordered a nicer one from Pai, but it&#x27;s good to know that there is an inexpensive alternative that really works.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying rosehip seed oil so far I really like it glides on my skin and adsorbs quickly.  Using it to smooth away acne scars and even my post baby stretch mark.  I even massage a little into my scalp, not greasy my hair still has body and a nice sheen.  I will probably buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I bought this by accident, because I didn&#x27;t read the description properly but it proved to be terrific.  I then read (carefully) the uses and how toos and used on a very dry scalp.  My head was itching really to distraction and my hair dresser said, dry scalp.  I was out of coconut oil so I used this and it did a great job.  Just rubbed a little on the scalp, left it overnight (you really don&#x27;t want to go out with this on, my hair did look unattractive) and washed it the next morning.  It greatly relieved the itching and the second go round fixed it.  I live in the Arizona low desert and believe me, it sucks every bit of moisture out of your skin and scalp.</li>
    <li> I used it to make my own belly butter and it turned out perfect.  No stretch marks yet and going on 6 months! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Just received this today in the mail.  Nicely packaged.  Opened it up.  Put it on clean face and I&#x27;ll admit that I used more than the 2-3 drops as directed.  It feels very nice on my skin but also smells very mechanically oily.  It would be nice if some scent could be added to make this more pleasant to use.  I will continue to try it again and use less next time to see if this improves the lingering scent.  My skin feels lovely though.</li>
    <li> product is as described - arrived in a safety sealed bottle inside a box.</li>
    <li> It was ok moisturizing just smelled a bit funny not sure if normal smell. Overall pretty decent</li>
    <li> This rose-hip seed oil came on time and nicely packaged. It didn&#x27;t smell weird and made my skin smoother and helped take care of some acne and dryness. It comes in an amber glass bottle with a glass dropper, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus! However, it felt more oily and didn&#x27;t absorb as well as my favourite brand of rose-hip see oil. also it had a more yellow colour, as opposed to the other brand, which has an amber-ish  colour. Other than that, I do not regret buying this and is still my number 2 go-to when I can&#x27;t afford my regular oil!  Definitely  buy this if you need good rose-hip seed oil but are on a budget, it does work!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a zit since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used rosehip oil so I was a little leery about this purchase.  It arrived quickly and has already started to even out my skin tone!</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my face as a moisturizer after I oil clean or detox. It has made a remarkable difference in my skin texture as well as lines, wrinkles. I also use it on my scars.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil! I apply it after I wash my face maybe 3-4 drops in my hand and apply it to my face while its still drying....its a natural serum and a dry oil so it doesn&#x27;t  leave my skin oily(b/c I have oily skin already) and I still achieve that glow that I love and its looks really healthy and natural. And its also great to apply to the ends of your hair when its dry.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  It smells rancid, however.  I could find no &amp;#34;use by&amp;#34; or expiration date.  Feels very smooth but I am put off by the smell.</li>
    <li> Great value for a quality product</li>
    <li> I have used this now for 2 days since my purchase. It is wonderful! I have had a sore that I have tried everything on and nothing else has helped until now and it is healed already! Highly recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with vitamin c serum interchangeably the past few weeks and my dark circles have already gotten so much better. My skin is looking great- I barely need to use foundation anymore.</li>
    <li> great price.  very strong smell.  first time using rosehip seed oil so not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be that strong.</li>
    <li> I use it as a moisturizer and it seems fine for my normal/ oily skin. I only use it at night time.</li>
    <li> Strong smell but I suspect it is a positive for potency as I like the restorative effects I see.  I cut the RH Oil with jojoba &amp; that improves absorption, reduces the smell and adds anti oxidants then I spray with hydrosol.  Skin softens, glows.</li>
    <li> great for the eye area ...keeps my wrinkles at bay</li>
    <li> Very nice face moisturizer. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Does not really do it for me.  It leaves my skin feeling oily.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Use with my essential oils as part of my face cream</li>
    <li> On time product I ordered the same no complaints or issues.</li>
    <li> So far so good, hopefully I get results after a month or two</li>
    <li> My skin is already shinier! Smells great. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Yes! I read reviews as you guys did and bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and half. I used to have acne from teens and left old scars on my face. Actually not that much expectation I had before using this, but I see some differences now. My acne scar(loss of tissue) seems fading away and red blemish spots also get brightened. I will continue to use and see if there is more change.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It feels wonderful on my skin. I have a few dark areas on my chin, in just a few weeks I see a definite improvement.  Prescriptions from the dermatologist did not help. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This works better then fresh fruit masks!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it everyday and so far its great with no skin irritation. I keep mine in the fridge so it wont go bad.</li>
    <li> Great oil for my clear and much more smoother than ever.</li>
    <li> I have a bad case with acne and my mother has Rosacea and this product has helped us both so much! Our skin is much softer and looks healthier !!! I recommend this product .</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with other oils but I tried to use it on my face due to some good reviews and it was not a match for me. It broke me out, not terribly but it did cause bumps on my face. I will use it on my stretch marks and hope to see results.</li>
    <li> Need to preface that I&#x27;m a 28 year old male, ideally not the target audience for this product but a fan nonetheless. Purchased this product after reading the positive reviews from others regarding it&#x27;s ability to decrease the appearance of scars as several weeks ago I came down with chickenpox. I know, who gets chickenpox at 28? This guy. It. Was. Miserable. Fortunately, I&#x27;m now in the process of healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the point! After my scabs fell off I was left with several pox marks still in the process of healing, primarily on my forehead. Nothing extremely noticeable, more so bothersome. Started applying the Rosehip Seed Oil twice daily to the affected areas and shortly after noticed the redness surrounding them to decrease. It&#x27;s now been about a week since I started using the product and must say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. No more red, raised lesions but instead smooth, healed skin in it&#x27;s place. Honestly, I was pretty skeptical of this product and others&#x27; reviews but it worked for me. So much so that I&#x27;m writing this review, my first ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of other side notes. One reviewer described it as smelling \\&quot;heavenly.\\&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t quite go that far. Not that it smells terrible, heavenly just isn&#x27;t the first word to come to mind. Also, like another suggested, keep it in the fridge so it doesn&#x27;t spoil. The dropper allows for the oil to be applied quickly and easily. It really does rub in nicely too. If you&#x27;re hesitant, give it a try, it&#x27;s only $6.00</li>
    <li> I was allergic to this and I&#x27;m not allergic to anything that I&#x27;m aware of.</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a whim at the health food store. BEST MOVE EVER. I didn&#x27;t go into it expecting anything; I was really just experimenting. But boy, was I pleasantly surprised! It doesn&#x27;t smell great, and it feels awfully greasy if you overuse - use the dropper to put one drop on your fingertips, rub them together, then lightly apply to face. But the iffy smell is completely worth the results. My skin was brighter after just a few days&#x27; use, and within a few weeks&#x27; time, I was shocked  to realize that a chicken pox scar I&#x27;ve had over my eyebrow SINCE AGE FIVE was significantly less noticeable. Nothing has even come close to affecting that scar, and I never expected anything to. I swear I looked in the mirror with my jaw wide open for about five minutes, turning my head this way and that to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going crazy. Ha! Definitely seems to ease the appearance of wrinkles, too. Forget expensive moisturizers; this is all you need!</li>
    <li> It smells awful and I&#x27;ve not noticed any improvement in my skin whatsoever. I can&#x27;t justify assaulting myself with this stuff any longer. It smells like I&#x27;m rubbing my face with oil from a grease trap at a Chinese restaurant. I&#x27;m sure I could get the same results rubbing an eggroll all over my face.</li>
    <li> Good for scars and as a face moisturizer. Excellent quality: looks, smells and feels like the real stuff.</li>
    <li> This oil has made it&#x27;s way into my holy grail products. It&#x27;s so amazing, it has made my skin softer, brighter and less dull looking. It has evened out my skin tone and made it more even looking. I love it and I will continue you buy it.</li>
    <li> use it in my lotions and hair products</li>
    <li> This is a lovely oil for your face it really does help &amp; you can feel the difference on your face, this is a product that I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You</li>
    <li> A must for organic skincare. Very light oil that absorbs quickly into clean, exfoliated skin. I love the dropper bottle, and a little goes a long way. Rosehip oil is my go-to choice for daily moisturizing. Good product with an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got an older batch but mine smells like cooking oil (and looks like the color of cooking oil). It isn&#x27;t a horrible scent but a very \\&quot;oily\\&quot; scent, which isn&#x27;t great when you are using it daily. Although I know scents aren&#x27;t exactly great for the skin because it could be irritating, I&#x27;d like my moisturizing ritual to be a pleasant, relaxing one. Apart from the scent, I did like its moisturizing benefits. It really does absorb nicely, and just a great moisturizer overall. I also like the dropper head, which makes it sanitary for daily use. If I run out of this I will probably be purchasing rosehip oil from another brand just to see if other brands will have a better smell.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. Remember to keep it in the fridge.</li>
    <li> Smell is not so pleasant but skin feels softer :)</li>
    <li> So I bought this oil to mix with helichrysum essential oil and hazlenut oil as part of a scar treatment for a recent surgical scar. I am using that mix regularly and the jury is still out on that.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I got to reading about rosehip seed oil and that Miranda Kerr uses it on her face, that it has properties similar to Retin A, that it is a dry oil and can even help with acne. Well of course I was skeptical because it is an oil people! Everyone knows oils break out your skin....or so I thought! I have very acne prone skin (used accutane in my teen years....it was that bad) and this stuff applied thinly on my face has done wonders! My adult acne (admittedly minor at this point in my life) cleared up, my fine lines are smoother, and my complexion just looks softer and more radiant than it has in a long time! And I have been using it for a week and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out!&lt;br /&gt;I also started adding a smidge of the Young Living Gentle Baby essential oil blend (also good on scars and wrinkles they say) and I have noticed even more line reduction in the last 24 hours of using it. I just can&#x27;t stress enough how much these two products have changed my face in a week. If I didn&#x27;t see it myself, I wouldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is an amber/orange color out of the bottle and has a kind of botanical smell. It is light and doesn&#x27;t bother me. It absorbs into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue as long as you don&#x27;t use too much. The Gentle Baby does leave a tiny bit of an oilier feel on my face, but so far no breakouts with that so time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;I like how the vitamin e that is used to preserve this product is the safe d-alpha and not the petroleum one that is bad for you. Other than that, you are getting pure organic rosehip seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again and will recommend to others as well. I can&#x27;t wait to see what changes happen to my skin after a month or two of use!</li>
    <li> ive been using this for a whole week and just love how it leaves my face after i wash it with my daily routine face cleaning since i tend to get really dry after my face wash&lt;br /&gt;.  the oil looks orangy but it dosent stay orange in my face,  personally the smell i love it on ny face its my favorite scent.good size bottle for the price.  my  everyday use</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This oil has a very odd smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like roses.  I do not recommend this at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just tried this today. It&#x27;s definitely darker in color, which I hear is a good sign, but it has an unpleasant odor, that lasts all day. Plus even using only 2-3 drops as suggested leaves an orange like hue on my face and its really greasy. Will look for another kind of product that offers similar benefits.</li>
    <li> makes my skin super soft- does smell a little weird but it worked really well so who cares. I did notice though that when I got it the box was pretty beat up and the oil wasnt sealed so I was a little wary of it being what it said it was.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for rosehip oil. Usually a pure (only preserved with a trace amount of vitamin E) rosehip oil would be much more costly, so this brand is really offering a good deal. The oil is dark amber-ochre in color, which is ideal for rosehip oil. The bottle is in dark glass, important to prevent oxidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is an excellent addition to any natural skincare routine. I apply this with toner or organic rosewater after vitamin C serum. It&#x27;s non-irritating and feels very nourishing. Personally I would only suggest using it at night as one of the final steps of your skincare routine. It absorbs well and is a great way to give your skin extra vitamins at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a verified buyer because I didn&#x27;t purchase my bottle from Amazon, but I did buy this exact product from Life Flow.&lt;br /&gt;I rated this at 4 out of 5 stars only because the smell is not so pleasant (it smells a bit fishy.)</li>
    <li> Rosehip Seed Oil should not smell like Roses and should be dark amber.  This was.  Rosehip Seed Oil will go rancid easily so I put mine in the refrigerator.  The smell was different, but storing it in the refrigerator reduces the smell and once it interacts with skin that smell isn&#x27;t there (rub it in).  It&#x27;s not cooking oil smell and it&#x27;s not a rancid smell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for scars and stretch marks as some claimed it works and I&#x27;m 100% positive this is making a difference and reducing them.  It seems the claims Rosehip Seed Oil repairs damaged skin are not ficticious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working with it and spent hours trying to figure out what&#x27;s the real deal with Rosehip Seed oil versus phony and versus rancid, but the proof for me was does it work, does it repair skin and this sure does appear to so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts with this, unlike many other products.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it every other night. The oil absorbs quickly and makes the skin soft and  gives it a nice glow. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any bad chemicals in it to harm you. The price is GREAT. Will continue buying it. Would recommend it to everyone, especially if they have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I use this every night!</li>
    <li> This product has been a very nicer addition to my beauty routine.  Very moisturizing, no added chemicals, and keeps my skin even toned and healthy looking</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for the last six months, on and off at night.  My skin feels soft I like it.  No it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses or anything like that, it does have a bit of a strong scent maybe like Omega 3&#x27;s, but it goes away quickly.  It does have some photosensitivity so only use it at night and keep it away from light.  Better off, store it in the fridge.  Feels good when it&#x27;s a bit chilled too.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell how I thought it would it was very strong and bitter smelling.  The pro is it can within 2 days of ordering which is a plus if you really need it.  I&#x27;ll just have to find another place to find rosehip seed oil or I&#x27;ll just do rose.</li>
    <li> As we all know, rose hip oil has fishy smell, and for many people,  strong enough to tolerate. But not so with this brand. I recommend it for ease of use in regards to smell.</li>
    <li> smooth transaction feels okay on the skin but i dont like the old oil and used tea leaf smell it has..ordered another one from now solutions brand and it does not have that smell. so i dont know i just got an old batch :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t break out, and the oil is quite amazing in how it moisturizes without leaving residue. I see why people rave about it. I&#x27;m pretty sure my acne&#x27;s been more tame as well. The oil simply sinks right in, and I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer on top of it, because my skin smoothes out (so to speak), and the moisturizer spreads and sinks more readily after using 2 drops of this. I found that patting it on gently works more effectively than sliding it on (because then I had to use almost 4 drops).</li>
    <li> This has done everything I read online while researching this. My skin has cleared up, it looks smoother and younger, plus this is easy to use! I just clean my face, then drop a single drop on a clean finger, rub between my finger tips and distribute my forehead. I repeat with my face cheeks, and then my neck. I am impressed at how long this is going to last with using only 4 drops (what I prefer to use) AM and PM. My favorite benefit is that I&#x27;m not using of chemicals found in many moisturizers. It arrived quick and well packed, too!</li>
    <li> this oil is wonderful for scars, wrinkles,  I also use for to  make my own deodorants and  my night creams or after any treatment in the face.</li>
    <li> A product you won&#x27;t regret purchasing. I added it to lotion and to my cover up. It improved my skin gradually. A couple drops go a long way.</li>
    <li> I only use a drop or two mixed with organic aloe gel and I like what it does for my skin.  Recently started using it on my arms, will buy again</li>
    <li> smells great and feels wonderful on my skin.  I keep it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.</li>
    <li> The oil is less expensive than some other brands but the quality seems to be just as good. I love Rosehip oil and use almost daily.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for one week, &amp; although I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading of my blemishes my skin is immediately smooth w/ a healthy glow after each use.</li>
    <li> Great product and priced well</li>
    <li> I use this every night and can already see a difference in my skin. It also works great under makeup if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> Quality bottling and product. Exactly as described by manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I sometimes have oily skin so I am very attentive to how I use this product. I will be experimenting with it, especially for night time moisturizer and rejuvenation benefits.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price and lasts for months.  I store it in the refrigerator once opened to prolong its longevity and keep it from going rancid during the summer months in the heat.  Right now my husband is using the latest bottle of the rosehip seed oil.  He applies it to his face and neck to help soften his skin and is hoping it will help with fine lines and brown spots.  He hasn&#x27;t been using it long enough to really see a big difference yet, though.  Hoping in another month or two there will be more notable changes, although, his skin does feel much softer after application.-RK</li>
    <li> Absorbs easily makes my skin feel soft. If you are looking doe something that smells rosy this is not it!! Don&#x27;t expect it to. It&#x27;s stinky for a minute but it&#x27;s highly beneficial to the skin so I can deal.</li>
    <li> I love this so far. Something about dropper bottles I love, but it is more than just that. I use it under my eyes, on scars, and on my growing baby belly. It is reassuring to know I am putting something all natural on my skin to help preserve it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses as one might expect, but I am enjoying it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE---- When I began buying this product it was a gorgeous bright orange color, and has gotten progressively paler with every bottle I have bought. I am starting to question the quality of this oil, it smells different, looks different, and my face reacts different. I will probably not purchase this brand of oil again. :(  Love it, im 24 years old so I&#x27;m not the targeted demographic for this product, however my skin was a mess of acne and oily and dry at the same time. At one time I had &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; skin, after a surgery it all went downhill and I have been struggling for over a year to find a solution. So far, this is it. Within a week of using it night and day (during the day I mix a few drops with my moisturizer), a guy friend said I was &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and that he couldnt put his finger on what was so different but that I looked great and I agree, my skin hasnt looked this nice for a long time.</li>
    <li> To be honest i actually completely forgot all about this product! It took over a month to get i. Idk if it was out of stock or what but im not really trippn on it because i did end up getting it and it was packaged really well and i do like this product and this brand ive bought other stuff from them with no complaints with any of them. The color is an amber color and it had a faint smell that made me think of flaxseed oil idky lol. But rose hip seed oil is supposed to have faint unpleasant type smell. I placed a drop of it on the back of my hand and rubbed it in. I noticed the smell disappeared when the oil easily and quickly absorbed into my skin withn seconds. My skin felt so freakn soft and smooth. Im 21 and i have normal skin type not oily or dry and my skin was already soft and smooth and i usually get compliments on my skin but i wanted to enhance my skin. Ive used this everyday since i got it which was  acouple days ago. I wash my face, neck and chest with warm to hot water mixed with some apple cider vinegar and sometimes i do clay masks after. I dont HAVE to use a moisturizer after im done with my face but i will. Ive tried shea butter, grapeseed oil, olive oil, mango butter, coconut oil and more but i like this the best so far. I put up to 4-6 drops of it on a finger tip and rub in my face, neck and chest and it doesnt leave me looking oily i glow and have that extra softness i desire. I also put 20 drops in my hair oil i made and idk if it made a dif since my oils by themselves hydrate my hair without making my hair really oily and leave it shiny and very soft. Im going to try with just this oil on my hair and scalp alone to see what it does.</li>
    <li> Great for  my face I use it every night.</li>
    <li> Best unit price-wise for organic cold pressed rosehip oil.</li>
    <li> I have chronic Psoriasis on my hands (I&#x27;ve had it since I was 3) and during the winter it flares up on my face on my nose and above my eyes. This oil worked wonderful to help keep it from peeling and to keep down inflammation. I have previously used coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax, and olive oil and many other storebought lotions.&lt;br /&gt;With rose hemp seed oil I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic improvement on my skin, better than any other oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  If you have Psoriasis or dry skin condtions - BUY IT.  Its the best $9 you&#x27;ll ever spend.&lt;br /&gt;I work customer service and it can be a bit embarrassing during the winter months. This has helped so so so much.  It also does not break out my skin, (I&#x27;m 21) and it is not super oily...as in it doesn&#x27;t make your face look greasy like olive oil does. The only bad thing is that if you are a klutz like me, and forget to screw the dropper lid back on, its really easy to knock over and spill. Yes, this happened to me, so just be careful. The oil will really make your skin look radiant, or in my case, less like a burn victim.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic, works as expected.</li>
    <li> Rose oil. WORKS great, BUT Does NOT smell anything like oil. If you like this smell, you will like effects.</li>
    <li> I received my merchandise as described and have been using it for about a week now, hoping to see results in the near future. Smells like green tea.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;This rosehip seed oil works fine to protect my skin. I use day and night</li>
    <li> So far i love it. It makes my face feel so good and hydrated will be ordering more for sure!</li>
    <li> The product itself is fantastic but I don&#x27;t think I will order it on Amazon in the future. It seemed to go bad faster than It should. When I repurchased from Vitacost (a reputable online health store) the product smelled better and is giving me better results. Rosehip oil should have a somewhat potent earthy smell and a rich amber coloring. The product from Amazon smelled a lot like urine and was a lighter yellow color. It is also less expensive on Vitacost. Again this brand of Rosehip oil is amazing and I will continue to repurchase from Vitacost as they seem to have fresher stock.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the first time after reading about this in magazine. I was pleasantly surprised. I usually wash my face and then add 3-4 drops and rub into my face. it feels like it holds more moisture to my skin. This one is cold pressed which is the better one to have..oh just get it. makes your face smooth in the morning!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this oil, and I&#x27;ve swapped out all other moisturizers for it!  A little background on me:  I&#x27;m a 30-something female struggling with adult acne and dryness. (I live in the desert where there&#x27;s no humidity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying a half-dropper of this oil to my face and neck immediately after cleansing at night.  It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky at all.  By morning, I&#x27;m left with skin that&#x27;s dewy, radiant and refreshed.  It&#x27;s also the only oil that doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. (Previously, I tried olive and coconut oil, but they caused blemishes and didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin completely.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this bottle in the fridge until its time to apply it...wow, that turns it into a cool refreshing treat in the heat!  Give this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> You just need a little bit, so this lasts quite a while.  It makes my skin very soft.  I&#x27;m glad I got it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. I use it as a moisturizer night and day. I am 21 and I firmly believe in prevention rather than reversing. I keep it in my fridge to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to say this oil has made my skin softer after a month of use. I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it as part of a facial recipe and its perfect. Makes your skin feel extra soft and silky</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used rosehip oil from another company and had great results so I purchased this one to test it out. It also gives great results. I like that it comes in a drop bottle so things don&#x27;t get messy. The other company didn&#x27;t have that so I ended up wasting a lot of it. Would purchase again. Nice to have since I&#x27;m starting to get wrinkles and want to stay looking young and healthy.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting miracles from this product. I was just expecting this oil to moisturize my face and leave it soft. Instead, it gives me clogged pores. I get pimples all over my cheeks when i use this product. I started using Argon oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, coconut oil at the same time about a year back. And I started getting tinny tinny pimples on my cheeks. Then I realized on of this oil is cause this pimple or maybe makeup. Then I started just using Argon oil ONLY and my skin became normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month back, I started mixing the Rosehip Seed Oil with my Argon oil again to see it Rosehip seed oil was causing the  pimples. And I currently my both cheeks have uncountable tiny pimples. I stop using the Rosehip seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, and I don&#x27;t get any pimples (Maybe once or twice a year, I will get 1 to 2 big pimple(s) to take out the bad stuff from my face). I am in my late 20. So of course it&#x27;s not related to &amp;#34;hormone&amp;#34;. it&#x27;s been about a week I stopped using the Rosehip seed oil. Hope my skin will get back to normal soon.</li>
    <li> I read of the benefits of rosehip seed oil, and decided to try it as a moisturizer. It is indeed great stuff. It&#x27;s all I use to moisturize my fairly dry and aging skin. Goes on light and leaves no oily residue, and leaves my skin soft. Life-flo brand seems great, though I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else. They claim organic and cold-pressed, which is the best, and I like that it comes in a tinted bottle, as the oil loses effectiveness with exposure to light.</li>
    <li> The price of this product makes it well worth giving it a try.  Moreover, the product has been good for my skin and my nails.  Accordingly, I certainly recommend that you try it at this price point.  It has not made me break out as I feared that the oil may potentially do for my t-zone skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great and helps with blemishes. I use daily with a face moisturiser.</li>
    <li> very high quality - has a proper smell and color, skin feels and looks great after using it. i have tried other brands, this one is still the best.</li>
    <li> After a motorcycle accident that left me in shock trauma for 11 months, facial reconstruction and many many surgeries and scars to go with that. After reading about how to help my scars, i found rosehip oil. I  used this every day for 6 months and my bright pink and white scars have all blended into the surrounding skin wonderfully, 5 years later, in the present day, people are shocked to know that my face was completely rebuilt.. It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it stored in the fridge as well, last longer that way. remember a dab will do ya... Also good for dry skin, eczema and dry scalps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are self conscious about your scars, give it a shot, it does wonders!</li>
    <li> I have been using it but not as often as I guess I should, the smell is too much too handle... I didn&#x27;t see any of the results specify.</li>
    <li> I love rosehip oil it leaves my skin great and the price is very affordable.And rosehip oil is good for your skin</li>
    <li> love this great stuff</li>
    <li> This item is amazing! I put on at night as my moisturizer and love what I wake up to. It will make your skin soft and supple--a perfect canvas for makeup in the am! Also, I am prone to acne and although adding oil to acne prone skin seems counter productive, it actually has worked wonders on the clarity of my skin too. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few weeks day and night and all I can say is &amp;#34;very pleased!&amp;#34; A little goes along ways, I use two to three drops each time and my face is soft and blemishes are beginning to fade! This will become a part of my daily face regime for sure!</li>
    <li> THIS IS HARD TO RATE BECAUSE IT IS WHAT IT IS, GOOD TO USE AT NIGHT TIME, NICE SCENT - GOOD STUFF!!</li>
    <li> 2 drops takes you far.  you&#x27;ll have this bottle forever. so many benefits . I already see my face clearing up! Plus its natural and healthy with so many other good benefits.</li>
    <li> Just receieved yesterday.  Put on before bedtime and I could not believe how soft it made my face feel.  Will write more later after using for a period of time, but for the first time use.......impressed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to hydrate my face, especially after I&#x27;ve been outside in the wind or sun for a while. It feels great and has made my face glow naturally.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this oil! I use it primarily as skin care, but it also works wonderfully as a leave-in hair conditioner/fly-away tamer. I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and all the medicine I have to take have done a number on my skin and hair. Prednisone induced acne is no fun in your 30&#x27;s, but since I started using this rosehip oil as a facial moisturizer my skin is smooth and clear with a healthy glow to it. Even my doctor commented on how healthy I&#x27;m looking! One tip: store the oil in the fridge for a longer shelf life. No where on the bottle does it suggest this, but trust me, it will make the product stay fresher longer, plus it feels really nice applying the cold oil post-shower to hot, summer skin. And you really cannot beat the price!!</li>
    <li> This oil is great for moisturizing your face! I always put it on after cleansing while my skin is still a bit damp so that it can lock in the moister. I don&#x27;t like using it on dry skin or it can sometimes make my skin oily feeling because it doesn&#x27;t distribute well when you use it over dry skin. It makes my skin so supple and soft and is definitely the cheaper alternative to Argan oil!</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit off...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Roscea/facial redness.  I have always considered myself to have oily skin so the thought of adding oil to my skin seemed crazy, and while you&#x27;re skin will definitely feel oilier when this is applied (which is why I only use it at night), it doesn&#x27;t add any oil long-term.  It seems to calm my skin, the redness seems diminished but I am experimenting with a few other things so I can&#x27;t say for sure it&#x27;s the Rosehip Oil.  There is a distinctive odor, which other reviewers have mentioned, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive.  I use a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels smoother when I use this!</li>
    <li> I chemically exfoliate my skin and sometimes I can overdo it and dry my skin out. Using rosehip seed oil on my face at night has really helped to soften and moisturize my dehydrated skin. This bottle last forever as well. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy after application. Has a bit of a weird smell, but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> My skin didn&#x27;t react badly to it. I didn&#x27;t notice any miraculous change in the appearance or texture of my skin (occasional pimple, some redness, clogged pores, fine lines) but this did take care of the dryness I sometimes experience. My skin absorbed it fairly quickly so oiliness was not an issue. I used only a couple drops on my entire face so the bottle lasted several months.</li>
    <li> I have very [VERY] dry skin and hair, which has been exacerbated by this past winter&#x27;s windy weather. I love this oil because it is not too greasy and it never seems to clog my pores. I was disappointed that the box was slightly damaged when I received it and the first time I used it I DID break out on my cheeks, so if you have sensitive skin like mine it is probably best to test it on small areas first. Overall, though, a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil...  it gets absorbed compeltely by your skin and is not greasy.  It is simply the best product that I have ever used on my face, and I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Good product for use in my diy projects</li>
    <li> My skin tone is a lot more even and my face is softer since I&#x27;ve started using this. It absorbs right into your skin making it nice and supple, so there&#x27;s no greasy effect. I plan to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to prevent stretch marks.  I also use it as a facial moisturizer.  It works great for that too because it soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy.  I like the top with the dropper on it too.  There is another brand I liked better because this one kind of smells bad, but the bottle top made it a pain to use.  The four star rating is due to the smell.  It just smells kinda funky, a little fishy maybe.</li>
    <li> Great oil my skin looks more even tone and I have not had any acne because of it.Actually my acne has decreased so much.U can&#x27;t belive how improved my fine lines around my eyes look.I will replace my current anti aging products with this.This oil is a must!!</li>
    <li> YOU&#x27;LL BE AMAZED AT ALL THE GOOD INGREDIENTS IT CONTAINS; NOT TO MENTION WHAT IT CAN DO FOR YOUR SKIN AND HAIR AND NAILS. WILL NOT BE WITHOUT THIS OIL. IT&#x27;S A MUST HAVE FOR ALL YOUR BEAUTY NEEDS. THANKS, AMAZON FOR CARRYING THIS PRODUCT. DID I MENTION IT IS ORGANIC, TOO ????  NOW THAT&#x27;S SMART SHOPPING !!!! YOU&#x27;VE GOT TO LOVE SHOPPING AT AMAZON. COM.  THANKS, AGAIN.  A REPEAT CUSTOMER AND A HAPPY SHOPPER. :)</li>
    <li> I love rose hip seed oil as a skin moisturizer and use it in my oil cleansing routine. This is light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering scent. It does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
    <li> Very oily, it does make your skin look hydrated but it also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; &amp; when my hair touched my face it made it greasy looking</li>
    <li> Good oil to use to moisturize the skin after baths and shower</li>
    <li> Love his product! Works great, use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil and the texture.  It isn&#x27;t too greasy, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts with it.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It was ok sometimes it combats my acne which are these annoying bumps on my forehead. Other times it doesn&#x27;t. Its super absorbent and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy so that&#x27;s a plus. all in all I like I do keep it refrigerated. Oh I just remembered one thing that could improve its the smell it dissipates after application but when your applying its strong my sister it smells like fish lol I don&#x27;t think so though.</li>
    <li> great face oil. I use it daily at night before my moisturizer. Amazing feeling skin the next morning! Love it and will order more for friends and family.</li>
    <li> Smooth as silk, no yucky smell. Works great! Not greasy like I thought it would be. Haven&#x27;t notice anything else yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put on my face at night in place of a moisturizer. I have a lot of acne scarring and was hoping it would help fade the scars, as many reviews said it would. I&#x27;ve been using it 5-7 nights per week for about 4 months now, and I don&#x27;t notice much difference. I also didn&#x27;t experience the next morning &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that many reviewers experienced. It didn&#x27;t do anything bad to my skin, but just didn&#x27;t do much different than a normal moisturizer would do. Might be worth a try, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. It does last quite a while - I&#x27;ve been using a generous amount each time as stated above, and still have about 1/2 of the 1 oz bottle left.</li>
    <li> I love using as a moisturizer after washing my face. My skin soaks it up leaving softness behind with no acne.</li>
    <li> Delivered timely and products is just as described</li>
    <li> The alternative to Retin-A.  By all means try this on your face nightly.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I use this oil at the end of my morning and night routines by mixing it into my moisturizer. I have very dry and sensitive skin. And when it comes down to it, I need a very heavy moisturizer to get me through my day with showing skin flaking. Unfortunately, when I use very heavy moisturizers, they are greasy and never seem to sink in. A couple drops of oil in a medium moisturizer though, is perfection for me. I have tried several different ones including, jojoba, argan, apricot and now rosehip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this does&#x27;t smell like roses and most people might say it smells straight up bad. Like some sort of fruit gone bad. I&#x27;ve grown used to it though and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s a dark orange color, and slightly thicker than some other oils. The bottle itself is pretty standard glass with a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this oil shines though, is how it makes the skin look so plump and moisturized and healthy. I add 3 drops to my morning moisturizer and 10 to my nightly one. I have had no breakouts whatsoever, it even helps old acne marks heal faster. And my skin looks so nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get over the smell, this is a great oil to use.</li>
    <li> It does not lighten up dark spots, or minimize the fine lines.  It is a great moisturizer and makes your skin less sensitive.</li>
    <li> This probably does nothing but my mom wanted it</li>
    <li> I have been mixing a few drops of this oil with my face lotion and it has taken away all dry spots. Works well.</li>
    <li> I do not see or feel any difference. I don&#x27;t see why there&#x27;s so many hype about it.</li>
    <li> I first heard Dr. Oz mention the benefits of rosehip seed oil on your skin. It definitely seems to nourish skin well &amp; is a great moisturizer. High quality product!</li>
    <li> I recently read about this product and I decide to give it a try. I lie how soft my skin feel and the soft fragrance. I am always looking for more natural ways to trreat and heal.</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like fish oil, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Very light oil with a fresh smell. I use it twice a day on my face - morning and night. No breakouts and I swear my skin looks clearer.</li>
    <li> I use it once a week as a moisturizer.  I put it on my face, neck, arms &amp; legs.  It has been great this winter to help chapped, dry skin.  I don&#x27;t know if how I use it is correct but it works for me.</li>
    <li> Pleased with it. Using it in a hormone balancing cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing rosehip seed oil featured on Dr. OZ about a month ago. It does make your skin feel nice. I can&#x27;t tell yet weather there will be a positive texture improvement, but I am happy so far. It has a pleasant, light smell and soaks into the skin quickly. I does not clog pores or look greasy on. My skin feels so soft now and I now feel better knowing I am putting on something natural on my face, and not a chemical moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Rosehip Seed Oil for several bottles and have to say I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;been getting very good results.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face just as it is and I also use it as a carrier for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> really helps with my rosecea flare ups</li>
    <li> Saw a change in less than two weeks</li>
    <li> I love this, has def improved my skin</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy after it sits for a minute. My skin is soft and smooth. Also, no breakouts, and I am prone to them. Awesome</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Amazon and will continue.  Fair price and excellent quality!</li>
    <li> Get compliments on my skin. - - and I really appreciate that!  Just began using it on my hair, but my hairdresser says it is making a difference.</li>
    <li> Very good quality item, helped me heal from a few blemishes, fast shipping, recommended.</li>
    <li> Seems to have cleared up some very mild rosacea on my face. Does not smell good, but not bad either.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face but it didn&#x27;t really do much. If your looking for a facial oil. Almond oil works really well. Sleep with it on your face and you wake up with a natural glow and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Miracle worker. On my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> I really like this Rose Hip Seed oil, it does not smell like roses, it smells kind of like tea which is from what I heard how its supposed to smell. It was more amber in color then another brand of rose hip seed oil I&#x27;ve bought, someone told me this is what true rose hip seed oil is supposed to be like and not clear. My skin soaks it up well, though I mix it in with other oils to make an after show moistener that works great and isn&#x27;t greases but I use it as a spot treatment sometimes to for dark marks. I also like that is has a dropper, the other brand I brought didn&#x27;t have that. Its s very amber, and could stain your whites so if you put it on before getting dressed wait for it to dry some if you&#x27;re going to wear white. I wish there was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product.  A little goes a long way.  I just use a few drops rubbed into my fingertips and spread it over my face before my night cream before going to bed.  Let it work its magic at night.</li>
    <li> The reason that I got this oil was because I heard would help to ger rid of acne spots. I have to say it&#x27;s a good moisturizer but as far as clearing my face, not to happy with it.</li>
    <li> It helps with dry skin, the only thing I don like is the smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s feels great on my face but my husband can&#x27;t stand the smell or even go near me when I put it on at night. I didn&#x27;t realize the smell at first until he told me..now I can&#x27;t put it on it makes me want to throw up ..</li>
    <li> If you do some research you will see that the fish smell is normal for this oil  I will have to get use to the smell but the benefits outweigh the unpleasant odor so I will def. use it</li>
    <li> After a long dry winter, this is exactly what my face needed.  Can be applied on wet or dry skin.  I will continue to use this stuff.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe all the hype on this one. Ive used lots of oils and most of them tend to make your skin a bit better in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in my entire life. It&#x27;s still not perfect. I have some acne scarring and stuff but I had someone ask me what makeup I work cuz I just looked &#x27;radiant and glowing.&#x27; I&#x27;d seen her many times before and never changed my makeup and knew this was why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep mine in the fridge to last longer but it warms instantly in your hands so it won&#x27;t go on cool.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality and price of this oil.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Bought it help heal a scar and its fabulous</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local health food store for around $6.00. I have been using it for three weeks, twice a day. I just smooth a few drops onto my face - a little goes a long way. The oil is orange in color and does faintly tint your skin (to me it looks like a nice glow.) I have not had a problem with it staining my pillowcase or clothing, but it does stain a white wash cloth if I use one to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;I am 57 and have sagging skin, enlarged pores, wrinkles, fine lines, a fairly severe scar, and severe sun damage. (My scar is from skin cancer surgery.) I also have a few spots of sebaceous hyperplasia. This rosehip seed oil has made my skin feel and look firmer and smoother and reduced scaliness, bumps, and unevenness in color. It has also reduced the appearance of the sebaceous hyperplasia - the mounds are still there, but they are smaller and less noticeable. It has also reduced the lines on my forehead, cheeks, and throat.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen no improvement in my scar, or in the lines around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I started using a few drops on my arms every day, and the improvement in skin texture is remarkable - no more little bumps on my upper arms, and my dry hands and elbow look much better,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll report back if it does start to help with the appearance of my scar. in the meantime, I will continue to use ScarAway silicone sheets, which have helped a lot: http://www.amazon.com/ScarAway-Professional-Silicone-Treatment-Sheets/dp/B001AJ4L1E/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1434592257&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;scar+silicone</li>
    <li> Got this for my face. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes but it does help keep my skin from getting too dry. I always use it on stretch marks. Seems to help a little.</li>
    <li> i love this product, my skin feels wonderfully soft but not greasy after applying.</li>
    <li> To be honest it prevents breakout. I want to love it bc it&#x27;s organic,  but it has synthetic vitamin e. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it until I find another source but once I do I will stop.</li>
    <li> This product was actually sold out, but it took A MONTH for it to process. I waited for weeks before finally contacting them, only to find out it was actually sold out, despite what it says online. Terrible customer service. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Caveat: Realizing that everyone is unique, results may vary. This review is based on my experience. I was looking for a hyperpigmentation treatment. Rosehip seed oil was one suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I love this oil! I used this in addition to my normal night routine. After my toner (Derma-e), I would cover 1/2 dropper of oil on my fingers to spread evenly over my face, neck, and chest. The oil was nice and light, not greasy at all. It was a deep yellow color with a faint scent. My skin absorbed the oil relatively quickly. I followed with a moisturizer (Aubrey Organics). When I woke up, my skin was smooth and hydrated. I did not notice a reduction in the hyperpigmentation but my skin skin seemed more firm and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I ran out! Towards the bottom of the bottle, the dropper became useless so I poured the remaining oil on my head and spread throughout my hair with my fingers. Why did I not try that earlier??? My hair looked and felt fantastic after my shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love rosehip seed oil! While it did not treat my hyperpigmentation, it produced many other wonderful results.</li>
    <li> Luv this rose hip oil my skin just soaks it up and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> great to use with my natural oils.</li>
    <li> Smooth and feels great.  Just a few drops is all you need.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with moisturizing but ended up using it for healing shingles; it is helping the scars to fade quickly.  I had been using a SkinMedica lotion for healing, but when I began to use this they started fading quickly.  The smell can be described as &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;-do not expect a rose scent-and the color is amber, so I am careful around light colored clothing, but it has not stained anything that I have noticed.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Has natural pleasant smell and does not leave skin too greasy.</li>
    <li> I guess its good. I can&#x27;t really make out a noticeable difference. It&#x27;s just like any other moisturizing oil. I add it to my bath with epsom salt, tea tree oil, tuberose oil and coconut oil and sometimes I use it before bed.</li>
    <li> hydrating and very good quality for a great price. I use it 2x a day. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my night time regimen before I go to sleep. It really does make my skin softer the next day.</li>
    <li> Great.  Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Just as described.  Loved it.  Great service, as usual!</li>
    <li> The odor smells more like olive oil and has a consistency relative to it.  Having said that, if you are challenged with dry skin, this product may be your fountain of youth.  Apply on with damp skin.  The oil really soaks in better that way.  Start off slow if you have sensitive skin.  I found it more effective on my knees and elbows than on my face.</li>
    <li> Loved it!! This is my second time buying this</li>
    <li> Arrived open....no safety seal either. Very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I know some reviews spoke of how awful smelling it is, however I didn&#x27;t think so. It kind of smells like green tea to me. I can live with that. I haven&#x27;t noticed super noticeable results yet, but I have noticed slight diminishing of fine lines.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this product ... I wish they would have a bigger bottle for this ... The 1 oz. I used it in no time ....&lt;br /&gt;Great for skin.</li>
    <li> Bought a small bottle to make sure my skin wouldn&#x27;t be to sensitive for it. Love that it&#x27;s a dry oil and absorbs quickly. Folks if you think this should smell like roses, you&#x27;re mistaken, it&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil, it&#x27;s not going to smell like roses as it&#x27;s not made from the actual part of the rose that smells good. It doesn&#x27;t smell good, it&#x27;s not nauseating, but it&#x27;s not going to smell good expect that. The smell is tolerable and you adjust. The benefits far outweigh the odor. Trust me! 43 year old Mom keeps getting mistaken for 35. Truly! Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this item or any other rosehip oil, so have nothing to compare it to - but looks to be pure - have just started using it</li>
    <li> For anyone using Rose-hip seed oil, it should NOT have an order at all! If it does, its either bad, or not authentic.It should have an amber color. Also, this oil is light sensitive, and should be kept in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt; I buy only organic, 100% oil carriers. The one I use is from Mountain Rose. You can buy it online.. I hope this helps anyone confused about what they are buying..</li>
    <li> This oil did nothing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I know certain things work for certain people but it did nothing whatsoever for me. In fact, my acne seemed to get worse. It didn&#x27;t even properly moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use this for my hair or anything else. Strictly a facial product, and that&#x27;s what my review is based on.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the feel of oil and lotions on my skin.  But, this wonderful oil absorbs quickly leaving no oily trace at all.  It will be a while before I&#x27;ll be able to verify its hoped for therapeutic properties on my face.  But, so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was cheap and you only use a little at a time. I have replaced my foundation with this product. It makes your skin feel so soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for treating facial wrinkles. But the other day my cat scratched up my chest when she got scared and the irritation from the scratches would not go away for hours. As soon as I used the Rosehip oil, the stinging immediately went away. it was awesome. Plus there is hardly any smell to it at all. The dropper makes it really nice for application too.</li>
    <li> Another popular company that I bought rosehip seed oil from was clear colored. Glad I bought this one. It looks more potent.</li>
    <li> This oil really makes a difference in the appearance of my skin. I use it every night after I wash my face with Oil of Olay face wash and my Clairsonic. I am in my mid/late thirties and skin care has become more important now a days. I look young for my age, as is, and I&#x27;d like to keep it that way.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, keeps my skin looking refreshed...I just love it.  By the way, it is a lot cheaper than high priced moisturizers and it lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> The Life-Flo Organic Pure Rosehip Seed Oil was as described.  The only problem was that delivery was slow.  If you are needing or wanting it right away, you may have to go to a local store and make your purchase there.  If you&#x27;re not in a hurry, then it may be worth the wait.</li>
    <li> After watching an episode of Dr Phil and his recommendation to start incorporating a rose hip oil in your daily routine; I ordered this. I am in love with this product. I put one drop (that is all you need) in my facial moisturizer day and night; it does not make my skin feel greasy or oily and really moisturizes my skin. After about 2 weeks of using this product I definitely noticed a huge difference in the elasticity of my skin. I&#x27;m not saying that I&#x27;m wrinkle free; but there is a HUGE noticeable difference! I also experience occasional blackheads and cystic acne; and have had none of that since using this product. I recently started blending this oil with coconut oil for use on my entire body....LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great for the dry PA winters.</li>
    <li> My hands aren&#x27;t itching and to me that is a miracle. I have hand eczema and after a particularly long day of lifting and working I put this on and my hands didn&#x27;t itch in the middle of the night. I woke up in the morning and they were a bit swollen and felt like a break out was coming but it didn&#x27;t. I had my hands in water a lot tonight and so I&#x27;ll see if this oil can handle the vengefulness my eczema is capable of or not but all told I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
    <li> Great quality rosehip oil for the cost. I have been into facial oils the last few years and this is really great company to check out if you are looking for high quality organic oils at a fair price. This absorbs nicely and is great alternative to face cream, especially at night. Rosehip oil claims to help with scars but I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Another tip is to add a couple of drops to your regular body creams and lotions for that extra moisture boost.</li>
    <li> I just looooooove this product. it definitely works on the brown spots and even pores.</li>
    <li> Lightweight oil absorbs quickly and I notice a definite improvement in the texture of my skin.  Very smooth and not greasy, and because rose hips is a Natural oil and not synthetic (i.e. mineral oil) NO Breakouts. The product is genuine Amber (dark yellow) in color. I love this brand and have already re-ordered more.</li>
    <li> My face is smoother all traces of my rosacea have disappeared. Plus it smells heavenly. I love the bottle with the dropper it makes using the oil easy.</li>
    <li> Ok, a little heavy oil and it has some smell.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Gotta shop around for a good price for it varies.</li>
    <li> Very very good.&lt;br /&gt;bye allergy.</li>
    <li> It does not have the consistence of other oils, however, it feels good on your face.  I guess it all depends on what you are used to, try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> If you are doubting this product, don&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve had scarring due to acne which caused really embarssing dark spots. I kid you not, a few days later I noticed lighting of my skin, and even the texture was better and my skin was more bright! Rose hip oil has seriously been a miracle for my skin. I apply it in the morning under my makeup and at night before bed. It has worked better than any harsh, chemical products. 5 stars without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I wish this was cheaper. It seems legit, but I haven&#x27;t researched this brand or type of rose yet. It clogs my pores a tiny bit on my face even though I dilute with witch hazel</li>
    <li> It was packaged safely and was a nice size bottle and was what I needed to make a concoction for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin. And I put a lot, trust me. A lot of expensive non-sense.</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing it on the Dr. Oz show. I mix it with alittle bit of my night lotion for my face. Not sure if it is working but it is not hurting my skin.</li>
    <li> great product but look at the time to process it was on time but did&#x27;nt pay attention to the time for processing. It was more then the others.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product but for a day or two.  The problem is - the smell.  It is really bad.  I will use the product to see if it benefits my skin but I will only use while at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality must be very degraded.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product on 2/13th and have been WAITING, only to be told by email on 2/21st that they are out of stock!!!!  WASTE OF MY TIME, THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT&#x27;S OUT OF STOCK AND THEY STILL HAVE THIS LISTED!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months, twice a day. As a facial moisturizer, I have never found anything that compares to it. It sinks in deep, doesn&#x27;t require additional layers of application, and yet it stays light. My skin feels softer and healthier than it ever has. But as far as taking care of acne spots or scars, it did nothing for me. My skin isn&#x27;t worse, but it&#x27;s not better. Ultimately, I&#x27;ll keep on using it, because it works for my dry winter skin, the price is right, and one little bottle goes a long way. I just wish it helped in another areas.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful on the face.  Absorbs quickly.  I use it first after cleansing in the morning, let it absorb, then apply AHA lotion and moisturizer.  At night I use the light Clairene Retinol lotion, then the oil on top.  It is great stuff.  I use it under eyes but try not to get it over eyes as it will seep towards open eye and irritate.  I think I see a difference after just a week, not dramatic, just more hydrated and smoother!</li>
    <li> Skin has healed using this, at first I didn&#x27;t like the fishy smell of cod liver oil but after using it my roscea cleared up in two weeks and the dry cracked skin was gone. This is a winner better than any docotrs perscribtion I have had. if I had known about this any sooner I ould have saved my self money on doctors bills.</li>
    <li> I have a patch of psoriasis on my inside wrist, I have used prescription cream as well as many over the counter creams. Since I have started using Rosehip Oil, the itching has subsided and the plaques have shrunk. I use the oil a couple times a day 3 or 4 drops. I truly am impressed with the results so far. I have not tried the oil on my face as yet, but I will.</li>
    <li> I like this oil because it very light, moisturizes the skin throughout the night and you literally need just 3 drops.Makes my skin glow per my husband.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face daily, in a mixture with coconut and apricot oil. My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;ve had problem skin for years. The dry patches, redness and itchy spots are gone, wrinkles are under control! I&#x27;m not saying I look 25 again, but I definitely see an improvement, even over when I only used the coconut and/or apricot. This seems to be the magic mixture for me. I used to joke about having &#x27;face dandruff&#x27;, it was so bad. Not anymore. Skin is soft and pliable.</li>
    <li> My skin gets so dry in the winter, so this is my new face moisturizer. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and is really soothing.</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect moisturizer for dry skin including face.&lt;br /&gt;Helps ease the pain and redness with razor burn/ bumps&lt;br /&gt;I first ordered because I was told it helped with acne/ acne marks but it didn&#x27;t do much for that.&lt;br /&gt;But I am more than happy with using it to remove eye make up. Its very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> If you have a healing scar or cut this is the way to go.  The Rosehip makes difference over pure Vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other rose hip oil and so far this brand is my favorite.  It has a little bit of an oily scent but nothing too strong at all.  it really does moisturize my skin and helps my foundation go on nice and evenly.</li>
    <li> After using the rosehip oil, I can really tell a difference in my skin. I have noticeably diminished fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. It makes my skin soft and supple. I have been getting a lot of sincere compliments from people who dont know I&#x27;m using the Rosehip oil. Thank you!</li>
    <li> A bit thicker than expected, and it broke me out a bit when I put it on my face by itself. Mixed with my other oils it was a nice addition, though. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> use to brighten complexion</li>
    <li> Great for getting rid of wrinkles but must keep in refrigerator.  Makes your face feel soft.</li>
    <li> Recomiendo sus ventas</li>
    <li> I am addicted...this stuff is amazing.  My skin is moisturized and glowing.</li>
    <li> i use this on my skin at night to fade and prevent acne marks. it works well and it doesnt make my acne worse.</li>
    <li> Great Oil, smell is not bad at all it kinda smell like green tea, this makes my face feel so baby soft and look smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This lasts long too, you really just need a couple drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff.  I use it every morning and every night around my eye area and it has worked amazingly well.  SO much better than $30+ eye creams!</li>
    <li> great stuff, fast shipper, great product. Works very well. bought a bottle for a friend too, she loves it and sees her spots disappeariing</li>
    <li> Works well on skin. Great for a daily skin regimen. This oil does have a bad smell. I am not sure if I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and the price was unbeatable! I use it daily on my face and it has helped smooth my complexion. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just a few drops and my skin toned up, cleared up, and the texture became really smooth.  I wish they sold larger sizes for body use.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 3 weeks and really seeing good changes to the texture of my skin. No wrinkle reversal yet but definitely worth using this over all of the creams in the store. Seems to work better w/o the fillers. Smells kind of like green tea.</li>
    <li> UPDATE7/27-I ordered two bottles recently, opened the packages-there are no seals and the oil is very different in color and it even seems as there is some kind of dark sediment. Has this gone rancid?&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/28- I attempted to return these bottles and the seller had a no return policy. I contacted Amazon customer service to ask about simply exchanging the bottles. I got a prompt reply stating that the seller no longer sells this item but that Amazon would refund me the total and I could keep the bottles and discard of them however I want. So this has turned into more of a review of Amazon customer service than the product. I love Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oils consistency reminds me of jojoba oil. The smell reminds me faintly of coffee. I have only been using this product consistently for about a week and I have already noticed my skin tone is more even. Mind you I mean even in color, not texture. I can&#x27;t say it has done much to help prevent breakouts (which I am extremely prone to) but it does seem to calm inflammation and redness very well. I ran errands and went to school with just a light dusting of bare minerals on (which really doesnt do much for me) and still felt confident enough.  I think its helping to speed the healing process of scars and it moisturizes well enough that I don&#x27;t really feel the need to use anything in addition. ALSO it seems to help balance oil as well as jojoba oil does. If this product continues to perform like it seems to be doing now, I definitely plan on buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/25/15 update&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this(and other rosehip oil products) religiously and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. I NEVER breakout like I used to. If I get anything it is small and very manageable. Also, I do have a habit of picking at ANYTHING on my face, and this helps calm everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price too!</li>
    <li> This came right on time and fast. The oil is wonderfully dark and rich with its promised moisture. I mix it with raw shea butter to make a body and face butter I place in an amber glass jar.</li>
    <li> very good to moisturize your skin...</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this stuff and my skin loves it! Drinks it up and feels really hydrated.  I love it! I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell but at first it reminded me of cold english tea! Weird.  But anyway, it&#x27;s great and I do see a reduction in any spots that have left marks but that could be a combination of other things i&#x27;m using too, i just really enjoy this oil and it&#x27;s great value.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and have found some darker spots on my skin to have faded some. It also softens my skin.</li>
    <li> After researching online how to reduce redness from broken capillaries and blemishes due to acne scarring, I stumbled upon an article that said Rosehip Seed Oil is a good natural solution. I went onto Amazon and read the reviews before I stumbled upon this brand, decently priced, reviews weren&#x27;t so bad, and it has a little dropper so it&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is yellowish, and the smell isn&#x27;t very appealing but that isn&#x27;t a big deal to me. When rubbing it onto your skin it dries pretty fast and it doesn&#x27;t feel as oily as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face for about a week now and seen no results, other than a bit softer skin. But what I have seen is whiteheads popping up in my t-zone. My skin&#x27;s pretty sensitive, so that could be the reason why. Although I&#x27;ve never had a problem with extra virgin olive oil , it&#x27;s non-comedogenic and a great moisturizer for dry skin. But it also doesn&#x27;t help with facial redness either so I&#x27;m back on my search to find something natural that will actually does. For now I&#x27;ll keep this product on the shelf and use it on my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give enough positive feedback for this oil! I have been using it nightly for 2 months and I can see a visible difference in lighter sunspots, fine lines and wrinkles. My skin feels more elastic and makeup glides on effortlessly. I have also been applying it to a large surgical scar and I can barely see the staple marks now. Shipping was faster than expected and packaging was perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent rose hip oil. Lasts a while when mixed with other products. I like to mix it with jojoba as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> it seens to give my normal mostirier for my face an extra boost!</li>
    <li> Fantastically priced Rosehip seed oil! I use this on my face before bed and it never irritates. It makes my skin feel refreshed without being too heavy.</li>
    <li> I use Rosehip seed oil daily!  It is one of my favorite oils and one I will never want to be without.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Definitely a great facial skin treatment.  Finally something that works for my wife at an affordable price.  Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin since I purchased this item.  I stopped putting it on my entire face and now just put it under my eyes for extra moisture</li>
    <li> The smell is a little odd at first but eventually becomes comforting. I really like putting it on my split ends and around my eyes. It&#x27;s also made my nails stronger when I rub it into my cuticles. I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle and my skin feels smooth, but it hasn&#x27;t been good for my acne.</li>
    <li> Been using this once every night and it seems to have helped cleared my skin of dark spots. Nothing I have used for skin care compares to this.Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, my skin look more lighter and fresh , I purchase this product 3 times already</li>
    <li> I have used rose water for about 20 years then decided to add rose oil to my skin care  routine. I love it, its clean and gives such a wonderful glow, I also use it on the ends of my very long hair to keep them healthy, *********</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product. Helped my acne scars tremendously , will definitely be buying more when I run out !</li>
    <li> I am always looking for alternatives to harsh chemicals and this surely is one. I use it nightly and have seen gradual improvements in troubled areas, especially around the yes and lips.</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM AND GREAT PRICE. IT&#x27;S EVEN AN ATTRACTIVE BOTTLE.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT. DR OZ MADE ME BUY IT FOR WRINKLES.</li>
    <li> This is a very good rosehip oil. One thing I dislike about rosehip oils that are commonly found in beauty products is that they tend to sometimes have a artificial rose smell, but this has a more natural earth-y smell which, to me, is great! To others, may repel. I have extremely dry skin and I love using this every other night. It is very rich when first applied but seeps in quickly. You only need a few drops to cover the entire face. I also like to use on my hands as well.</li>
    <li> Great for dry and irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I RARELY leave reviews for anything but this product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week. I ordered it mainly to use as a moisturizer on my face in the morning and at night. At first it may seem like your face is a little oily but your skin absorbs it pretty quickly leaving your skin super soft and moisturized. I have had no breakouts whatsoever and it actually has helped to clear up my acne and some red spots. I also have been using it on my arms because my arms are really dry and I have red bumps all over them. I exfoliate them really good in the shower and then rub a few drops of this oil on them and they are SOOO soft. Like I said I just got this product about a week ago but I&#x27;m going to order more right now to make sure I don&#x27;t run out !!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! it leaves my skin very moisturized and shiny that&#x27;s shy I use it only before sleeping. In the morning my skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it goes on smooth on my face. I use it before I put make up on and I also use it at night when I go to bed. Most of the time I use my Ponds face cream after I putting the oil on my face. When I wasn&#x27;t using it, my face seemed dry and dull. Now my face feels and seems smooth looking and brighter. I recommend this product. I have been using it for a couple months now. This was my second order and will continue to order. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> It was just okay. Nothing special about it. Sorry!</li>
    <li> I use it to keep the  skin on my face soft and to help reduce lines.</li>
    <li> I use it every night as a moisturizer on my face and in my hair after showers for anti-frizz. Works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see if I have positive results...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
    <li> Only issue is that it smells like Vitamin E.  Otherwise I live it.  I ad a little peppermint to my hand when I use this on my face.</li>
    <li> The real deal.  Great quality oil.  When you have a fake or diluted oil, your skin will show it.  My skin looks GREAT!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter, don&#x27;t have available feedback.</li>
    <li> The color is golden, and a medium to lighter viscosity. I have started using nightly.  Don&#x27;t feel too greasy and is easy to wash off in the morning.  My skin is a little softer.  Not fantastic, but then I am 51 so weigh in that.  I am a little disappointed in the smell!  It actually has a more &amp;#34;cooking oil&amp;#34; smell and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s slightly on the rancid side???  Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s me or not?  Maybe it&#x27;s a good carrier oil and that&#x27;s just how they smell.  (It&#x27;s a vit. E base)  I&#x27;m just disappointed it doesn&#x27;t have a more rosier aroma.  Kind of hidden in there is a slight smell of rose.. It&#x27;s my first experience using an oil with rose.  I have no other products to compare it to.  So I rate it okay since I do think my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> Amazing for fine lines but smellS so much baaaaaad.</li>
    <li> Notice a big difference in my skin and decollete area.</li>
    <li> Bought it bc i read its great for under eye basgs, circles and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like fish, the odor is offensive... I&#x27;ve only had it a week so I&#x27;ll keep trying and update the review.</li>
    <li> I love this oil its like a Retina A in natural forms. Shipping was great, product was the authentic thing! love this seller will be buying again. The only con would be that this stuff does make you break out if you put it on acne, however if you have scars or hyperpigmentation it&#x27;s a lovely moisturizer, fader better alot better than bio oil, mederma, murad. would recommend to anyone even considering it. it does not contain acids that break down your collagen and that i something so substantial when trying to over turn cells in order to remove post marks.</li>
    <li> I really want to love this. I bought it based on other reviews (beauty bloggers) claiming that it reduces scarring and hyperpigmentation, which I have a lot of thanks to severe acne for most of my life. I do notice that this reduces redness, but unfortunately it seems to irritate my skin by causing/exaggerating breakouts every time I use it. I&#x27;m hoping that once I get my acne under control, I can begin using this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it smells and feels lovely. I add two or three drops in my palm, rub my hands together and gently press it on my face after moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read about the benefits of rosehip oil, so I tried the affordable Life-Flo brand. I&#x27;ve been quite happy with it.  It has definitely made my skin softer and has not caused any breakouts. It contains a very small amount of vitamin E (1%).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week as a part of my skincare routine. The oil is very light and absorbs easily. I&#x27;ve been using it both as a moisturizer and as a cleanser (per the oil cleansing method). Seems to be great for my oily skin (my skin is LESS oily now), and it seems to be very anti-inflammatory for my mild rosacea. Pretty excellent stuff!</li>
    <li> With just one use..this product made my skin even toned and brightened my chin area&lt;br /&gt;I will update in few weeks!!</li>
    <li> Good quality but I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> I got the about a month ago and have been using it daily and nightly, i have seen a reduction in my fine lines and my skin looks brighter ... loving it :)</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It is very thick, amber colored oil, that absorbs nicely into my skin. I put it on my face at night and by morning it is completely absorbed without any greasy feeling. There is a (totally normal) slight fishy odor to it that can be a little unpleasant but I can tolerate it. With regular use, I do notice a healthy glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of it  and it did not work for my skin&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> The product is outstanding.  This was the best price I could locate on this product and it shipped lightening fast!</li>
    <li> its smells, feels like cooking oil i don&#x27;t like it at all and i don&#x27;t think its rosehip seed oil</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone skin since middle school which comes in heavy to light phases. Overall, this product helps reduce redness for me. I mix it in with my night cream and wake up with smooth skin. I still have pimples of course (yay for that...), but it smooths out the skin&#x27;s appearance and feels hydrating.</li>
    <li> reasonably priced &amp; works wonderfully. i have used rosehip seed oil (5-10 drops, depending on the time of year) with aveeno daily 24hr body moisturizer (1 pump) as a daily face lotion for about a year now, got rid of a lot of sun damage from my college days (&amp; a few scars from the earlier tomboy years). feels a thousand times better than anything else i&#x27;ve tried &amp; also helps with adult acne!!</li>
    <li> I do like it, it really improved my under eye area dryness, but it has an unpleasant smell</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer on my face a neck at night. It is my new favorite thing. I love it. Also, I keep it in the fridge when I am not using it.</li>
    <li> feels fantastic...  have no really seem any visible results, but may just be too soon</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with rosehip.This brand is very good . I add to almost every thing, mix it with witch hazel,add to my hair oils and to my lotion</li>
    <li> I agree with teri n. about the cooking oil smell.  My expiry date says 2015 but it is a very dark orange and smells rancid.  I have decided to throw mine away.  I noticed a smell but ignored it.  After using it for a week my husband said it smelt terrible.  I did not expect a nice smell but having the rancid smell hanging around all day is awful.  It is possible that I got a bad bottle.</li>
    <li> It only takes a drop or two to &#x27;do&#x27; entire face and neck. Slight smell, but nothing really significant. DOES NOT SMELL LIKE ROSES.</li>
    <li> Excellent as advertised</li>
    <li> I bought this to soley kinda get rid of my scars and the discoloration. The product works but not as fast as i was expecting, my scars have definitely shown improvement because there less prominent but ive only been using this for 2-3 weeks. The smell isn&#x27;t exactly delightful to me but i mixed half the bottle with raw shea butter and use that for my body use a little of this on my face each day. It definitely helps my face stay moisturized and with the winter approaching, this is a miracle product for moisture.</li>
    <li> Feels really nice on my skin. Just put on 2-3 drops, that&#x27;s all , you don&#x27;t need to slather it on like some lotions, but my face feels really smooth with it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all.  It has a real fishy smell just like vitamin E.  Which leads me too believe this is more vit. E than it is Rosehip oil.  Or they put too much vit. E in it.  Or maybe Rosehip oil just smells fishy.  I don&#x27;t know.  I just know it stinks!  This is the first time I bought and tried Rosehip oil and I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> softens the skin perfectly</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been really happy with the Rosehip Seed Oil.  I&#x27;ve not mixed it into any homemade lotions yet but I have put it directly onto my face.  And, I&#x27;ve used it in a hot oil hair treatment and thought it worked well.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful oil.  I mix a drop or two into the palm of my hand along with my daily moisturizer. It really softens and moisturizes without an oily feel.  Also great to use for OCM (oil cleansing method) as it really penetrates the pores and cleans them out.  This is my second bottle and will definitely continue to use this  product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend a fortune on retinol A products that may damage/burn your skin - go straight to a retinol A derivitive with rosehip seed oil! It smells, but only momentarily; one drop will cover your entire face at nighttime! Great for wrinkles, dark spots, and uneven skin tone. Go all natural when possible!</li>
    <li> Keep a small bottle of rose hips oil next to your shower. As soon as your done showering, rub several drops of rose hips oil over your body. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily. You can continue to layer on your regular boy moisturizer or just use the rose hips oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose hip seed oil is a pressed seed oil, extracted from the seeds of a rose bush which grows wild in the southern Andes. It is unique among vegetable oils because it contains retinol (Vitamin A), and is also high in vitamin C. Rose hip seed oil is high in the essential fatty acids -linoleic acid oromega-6, and linolenic acid or omega-3. It is commonly used in skin care products. It is used for a variety of skin conditions, including dermatitis, acne and eczema, for mature and sun burnt skin as well as brittle nails and wrinkles. Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.

    <li> Skins feels great! The oil absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or clog pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she mixed it in with some moisturizer and it gave the moisturizer a silky sheen.</li>
    <li> Great for winter dry skin. Absorbs quickly with a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> This oil gave me high hopes and while I am sure it works for some, for me I felt that it made me break out and I did not see an other benefits that warranted its use.  Perhaps I am just reactive to this type of oil.</li>
    <li> I bought the Life-Flo Organic Pure Rosehip Seed Oil, 1 Ounce as an additive to my homemade organic face cream. I cannot attest to the product by itself but the cream that I made is wonderful! I will never buy store bought face cream again. Super nourishing, my face is smoother and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love this rosehip oil! I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and they were just ok. This oil is fresh and very moisturizing and my skin loves it! It absorbs very quickly in my skin, and it lasts. I will definitely re-order! Thank you!</li>
    <li> It smells like cooking oil and after using it for several weeks, I can&#x27;t see any differences.:(</li>
    <li> No scent at all, would really enjoy a little bit of rose scent. However, it feels lovely on my skin in the evening, keeps my skin from drying out overnight.</li>
