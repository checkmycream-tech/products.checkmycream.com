      <li>Henna is the perfect solution!</li>
      <li>but the rest is a great color.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, very easy to mix up.  </li>

      <li>Then, nodding even more vigorously, off he went upon his way.     </li>
      <li>Maybe even better.    </li>
      <li>After trying several brands of henna, I have found that Avigal makes the best product of the most commonly available hennas around.</li>
      <li>This leaves hair in great condition and natural coloring.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to do it yourself.</li>

      <li>I get beautiful, even results, the color is not metallic or brassy, and it lasts for months, even with regular washing.</li>
      <li>Sometimes not as fine a sift, but</li>
      <li>Using this product, I enjoy using Avigal Henna</li>
      <li>It is also a good natural looking color.  </li>
      <li>I did blonde highlights for awhile which did a nice job, but when more grays started coming in I needed something else.</li>
      <li>So my color does not fade, and my hair is silky and full of body.    </li>
      <li>I was going for from my youth but beautiful none the less.</li>
      <li>The color looks natural and my hair, which is somewhat fine, is more manageable using henna.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Just a quick root touch-up every three weeks</li>
      <li>It used to come in cute fabric bags, but the product would stick inside the hems and the new packaging is easier to use.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful golden red- not harsh or brassy at all.</li>
      <li>i have used the \\&quot;champaign\\&quot; color of this product several times and liked the results.</li>
      <li>I may be as wide as I am tall, but my hair is gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks golden.</li>
      <li>A picture is worth a thousand words.  </li>
      <li>I did try Aveda color at the salon &amp; it washed out right away...</li>
      <li>In fact, I just had a trim &amp; 4 different stylists at the salon were amazed that henna gave me such great color.</li>
      <li>On time, before expected, and it&#x27;s an outstanding product!</li>
      <li>A great product and the natural colorant holds a longer time than other rinses.  </li>
      <li>Rinsing is totally quick and easy using only conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and I went with mixing my precious left-over Strawberry Blonde with Copper.  </li>
      <li>;) Thank you Avigal.</li>
      <li>I have never been interested in using hair color because of maintenance and chemical exposure reasons.</li>
      <li>always consistent color.  </li>
      <li>It covers my gray naturally, is pretty inexpensive, and I get tons of compliments on the color.</li>
      <li>Pretty consistent product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 5 year and love it.  </li>
      <li>Using this alone, the color for the first week is very orange.  </li>
      <li>It is kind of messy to apply but if you take precautions (lotion ears, forehead,neck or possible stain areas of skin &amp; of the bathroom), you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>most of the grey right on top of my head, around my face, and quite dark underneath.    </li>
      <li>The result is very shiny, radiant hair.  </li>
      <li>Makes it so much easier to put on and take off.  </li>
      <li>I have had people lean close and confide to me that they can absolutely tell the difference between the naturals and the bottle reds...</li>
      <li>I have bought this brand of henna for several years, the larger size is more economical and lasts in the package very well.</li>
      <li>He nodded to himself the whole time.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My hair was smooth and shiny afterwards and the color took a long time to fade.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t used henna before, expect it to be messy when you apply it and have an old towel handy to cover your shoulders with while waiting for it to stain.</li>
      <li>I do think that was important since after the first round</li>
      <li>The color mixes easily with other shades of henna, to create a vibrant but completely natural result.</li>
      <li>I get envious looks with both women AND men complimenting me (at my old granny age!)  </li>
      <li>Much easier than buying raw ground henna, mixing it with different spices and oils to concoct the correct color, and then waiting for hours for dye-release, then sitting for hours more for the dye to take.  </li>
      <li>Every single one of them think my hair is naturally this color (fortunately I do have the complexion for red hair).  </li>
      <li>I was a natural strawberry-blonde until my grays started showing up in my mid-twenties.</li>
      <li>and mine is clearly natural.  </li>
      <li>No split ends or breaking hair, the henna is a natural conditioner.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy it again if the price stays reasonable.  </li>
      <li>This henna works better than any other dye I have used (including other henna products).  </li>
      <li>(I live in CA), and said, in his very British accent,</li>
      <li>i bought this \\&quot;golden red\\&quot; in the hopes that it would add a \\&quot;subtle red tint\\&quot; to my golden hair.</li>
      <li>The color lasts just as long, and I find it&#x27;s much easier to apply than the traditional method.</li>
      <li>Little different from my original red</li>
      <li>The dark hairs are a dark auburn, the white hairs are a beautiful, sparkling golden red giving an overall look of an expensive salon high-light dye-job.  </li>
      <li>luckily if faded out within a week and a half... even though its supposed to be permanent... dont buy this if youre blonde and want a red tint.</li>
      <li>Fading at top and sides,  I have tried 2 other hair products with not a very good result.</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s 100% natural, I save the salon price for hair color $$$, and my hair color looks completely natural - it just covers up a little gray and enhances my natural color.</li>
      <li>Those areas did come out brighter and a little more orange toned after the second round</li>
      <li>Completely natural, of course Never have to worry about damaging hair, even if you leave it on too long</li>

    <li> Excellent product!  Arrived quickly.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got everything expected.</li>
    <li> This henna works better than any other dye I have used (including other henna products).  The variety of colors exceeds other brands.  The application process takes a very long time, and it takes a while to rinse it out.  Best to do when you don&#x27;t have a time schedule.  Also, it would be very difficult to do by yourself.  The result is very shiny, radiant hair.  My hair looks golden.</li>
    <li> This color works best on my gray! Tried other henna a and this one is a red I like! Yay!</li>
    <li> On time, before expected, and it&#x27;s an outstanding product! Completely natural, of course Never have to worry about damaging hair, even if you leave it on too long</li>
    <li> I started using Avigal henna 30 years ago. The quality is second to none.</li>
    <li> This henna compared to Rainbow Henna&#x27;s &amp;#34;Strawberry&amp;#34; is lighter and stains faster.  It didn&#x27;t clump as easily and was easier to wash out.  When they tell you to wear gloves to apply this, they are not kidding!  But the stain will wear off your hands in a couple of days.  The color looks natural and my hair, which is somewhat fine, is more manageable using henna.  If you haven&#x27;t used henna before, expect it to be messy when you apply it and have an old towel handy to cover your shoulders with while waiting for it to stain.</li>
    <li> I was a natural strawberry-blonde until my grays started showing up in my mid-twenties. I did blonde highlights for awhile which did a nice job, but when more grays started coming in I needed something else. I have never been interested in using hair color because of maintenance and chemical exposure reasons. Henna is the perfect solution! It covers my gray naturally, is pretty inexpensive, and I get tons of compliments on the color. In fact, I just had a trim &amp; 4 different stylists at the salon were amazed that henna gave me such great color. It is kind of messy to apply but if you take precautions (lotion ears, forehead,neck or possible stain areas of skin &amp; of the bathroom), you&#x27;ll love it. I have been told that red is a difficult color to recreate from a bottle and that natural redheads have even more trouble because we tend to have coarser hair, which means the color won&#x27;t last. I did try Aveda color at the salon &amp; it washed out right away...grrrr! Henna doesn&#x27;t do that. This color does &amp;#34;tone down&amp;#34; a bit in first few washings but never ends up looking strange or washed out, even months later! My sister is a fan too.</li>
    <li> Red heads unite!! Being a natural redhead,  it is difficult to duplicate a natural color of our former shade.  Fading at top and sides,  I have tried 2 other hair products with not a very good result. You will not have this problem with. Avigal. This leaves hair in great condition and natural coloring. Not brassy or orangy.. Terrific product. Hairdresser said it looked perfect. (when I used another product,  his remark was&amp;#34;what happened&amp;#34;) Thank you Avigal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 5 year and love it.  It&#x27;s the perfect color for me and makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> i have used the \\&quot;champaign\\&quot; color of this product several times and liked the results. i bought this \\&quot;golden red\\&quot; in the hopes that it would add a \\&quot;subtle red tint\\&quot; to my golden hair. I got the impression from other reviews i had read about this product that the color results would be satisfactory. i followed the directions and ended up with ronald mcdonald hair. bright bright orange/ red that looked completely fake and awful. luckily if faded out within a week and a half... even though its supposed to be permanent... dont buy this if youre blonde and want a red tint. it will not give those results.</li>
    <li> After trying several brands of henna, I have found that Avigal makes the best product of the most commonly available hennas around. It is a beautiful golden red- not harsh or brassy at all. My hair was smooth and shiny afterwards and the color took a long time to fade. I will definitely use this product again and again.</li>
    <li> No instructions...naturally strawberry blonde..now with gray...turned my hair bright orange..from what I researched...tried dawn...nothing..very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand of henna for several years, the larger size is more economical and lasts in the package very well. It used to come in cute fabric bags, but the product would stick inside the hems and the new packaging is easier to use. Now it comes in a cardboard cannister with metal lids, which I still prefer compared to plastic bags and containers used by competing manufacturers. The color mixes easily with other shades of henna, to create a vibrant but completely natural result. No split ends or breaking hair, the henna is a natural conditioner. Although directions state to mix it into a \\&quot;mud\\&quot; and apply with a brush, I usually mix it into a thick liquid and put it in a squirt bottle, like regular package coloring. The color lasts just as long, and I find it&#x27;s much easier to apply than the traditional method.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first. It did give me a beautiful red. Little different from my original red I was going for from my youth but beautiful none the less. I used the two step filler process since I had leftover chemical highlights. I do think that was important since after the first round the highlights were fairly oranged tinged. Those areas did come out brighter and a little more orange toned after the second round but the rest is a great color. I will use again. Hopefully once highlighted areas are grown out and cut away it will be even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this henna for 30 years. It&#x27;s easy to do it yourself. I get beautiful, even results, the color is not metallic or brassy, and it lasts for months, even with regular washing. (Just remember to use gloves so your hands don&#x27;t get stained!)</li>
    <li> Well, I wish Amazon would bring back customer photos.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  I may be as wide as I am tall, but my hair is gorgeous.  I get envious looks with both women AND men complimenting me (at my old granny age!)  A man in the elevator stopped me just last week (I live in CA), and said, in his very British accent, \\&quot;I say!  Your hair is quite  red!  You are British?? A British family?  From England?  Lovely hair!  Red.  Red.  Quite, quite lovely.\\&quot;  He nodded to himself the whole time.  I almost expected him to tap an imaginary umbrella on the ground to punctuate his points. Then, nodding even more vigorously, off he went upon his way.     Every single one of them think my hair is naturally this color (fortunately I do have the complexion for red hair).  I have had people lean close and confide to me that they can absolutely tell the difference between the naturals and the bottle reds... and mine is clearly natural.  But no, naturally I am about 35% grey/white, 65% dark, dark mousey brown -- most of the grey right on top of my head, around my face, and quite dark underneath.    The color this henna gives is awesome.  The dark hairs are a dark auburn, the white hairs are a beautiful, sparkling golden red giving an overall look of an expensive salon high-light dye-job.  Just a quick root touch-up every three weeks (my hair grows fast) keeps everything great.  And so easy to use.  Much easier than buying raw ground henna, mixing it with different spices and oils to concoct the correct color, and then waiting for hours for dye-release, then sitting for hours more for the dye to take.  This is the best henna I have used since Hennalucent \\&quot;Sunset Glo\\&quot; went out of business.  Used that for 30 years.  This Strawberry Blonde Avigal is very, very similar.  Maybe even better.    I do not however, follow the instructions to the letter.  I mix about 2 ounces of Pantene \\&quot;Ice Shine\\&quot; conditioner in with the henna dye mix.  Makes it so much easier to put on and take off.  Then, again, against instructions, I also never, ever, ever use shampoo to rinse out the henna pack -- I use only the Pantene conditioner for the rinse-out.  Rinsing is totally quick and easy using only conditioner.  No shampoo for least 24 hours.  So my color does not fade, and my hair is silky and full of body.    I did have an episode a few months ago when Amazon and other sellers were out of the Strawberry Blonde hue and I went with mixing my precious left-over Strawberry Blonde with Copper.  My husband diplomatically just said... \\&quot;well, it looks... darker now\\&quot;.  Moral of the story -- I now buy Strawberry Blonde months ahead of needed use... just in case.</li>
    <li> Using this alone, the color for the first week is very orange.  I&#x27;ve been mixing it with other henna from Lush and that sort of tames the color a little bit.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, very easy to mix up.  The smell is ok, it doesn&#x27;t stick around on the hair for more than a day.</li>
    <li> Pretty consistent product.  Sometimes not as fine a sift, but always consistent color.  Lasting semi-permanent (4-6 weeks)</li>
    <li> A great product and the natural colorant holds a longer time than other rinses.  It is also a good natural looking color.  I will definitely buy it again if the price stays reasonable.  This was a nice transaction.</li>
    <li> Feels great to use this product - a chemical free haircolor that conditions my hair each time I use it. Using this product, I enjoy using Avigal Henna because it&#x27;s 100% natural, I save the salon price for hair color $$$, and my hair color looks completely natural - it just covers up a little gray and enhances my natural color.</li>
    <li> Works great; wife&#x27;s hair always returns to the gorgeous red I fell  in love with.</li>
