### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My best results were during the summer!</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s best to keep the soap away from water when not in use.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>as i can lol!</li>
      <li>and I see awesome results</li>
      <li>I love it,  it works!!!</li>
      <li>now she&#x27;s happy, and im happy!</li>
      <li>I have been using Kojie San soaps for about 6 months now, and it has greatly improved my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
      <li>Works great feels great</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great soap</li>
      <li>after rinsing, i felt i had a botox LOL</li>
      <li>Not that great.</li>
      <li>My soap arrived on time, in nice packaging with every perfect corner in tact upon opening!</li>
      <li>and my skin feels amazing!</li>
      <li>and it’s amazing!</li>
      <li>This is a great soap for lightening and cleansing, I love it!</li>
      <li>This a must have for fair, good looking skin.</li>
      <li>Amazon, keep up a good job.</li>
      <li>The price is good and works just as advertized.  </li>
      <li>Good soap, good deal, good skin-care.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i will continue to use and order more!</li>
      <li>It did feel nice.</li>
      <li>2-5 minutes for lighter-medium skin tones and 10-15 minutes for darker tones to have this product work effectively.</li>
      <li>Also an organic oil moisturizer, like rose hip oil for moisturizing afterwards.</li>
      <li>and if you want to get a nice glow for a upcoming event.</li>
      <li>A beautiful bar in my holder with pretty engraving on it.</li>
      <li>However it smells fine, soapy and kind of vanilla-esque.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m caucasion and I don&#x27;t tolerate greasy sunblock most days, so I have sunspots around my cheecks.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much better tho .</li>
      <li>I love the firming feeling it gives.</li>
      <li>My skin does look better.</li>
      <li>I love the vanilla</li>
      <li>The soap is okay....  </li>
      <li>:))</li>
      <li>Most people who complain about Kojie San either don&#x27;t know how to use it or just don&#x27;t know what they are doing.</li>
      <li>Love These Bars.</li>
      <li>I like this version better than the Orange kojie soap.</li>
      <li>Lathers well nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love the collagen in it.</li>
      <li>just wish it was a bit more potent now that i&#x27;m acclimated to it.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it here @</li>
      <li>THIS SOAP DID NOT WORK FOR ME,CAUSED MORE DISCOLORATION ON MY HANDS.</li>
      <li>and my appearance is more youthful looking.</li>
      <li>Omg just came today so happy shipping was so fast will update you if it work</li>
      <li>Was and am still pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>The orange bar is better..</li>
      <li>It has worked ok on stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very easy to slip and get comfortable with the results.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s even better is that it has had a significant impact on my acne breakouts.</li>
      <li>like original kojiesan better.....</li>
      <li>Strong.</li>
      <li>My face was full of blackheads and using this has gotten rid of most of them.</li>
      <li>Great lather and my skin was soft, clean, and over time was lighter.  </li>
      <li>Skin felt fine.</li>
      <li>The soap is doing fine at maintaining and evening my skin tone though.</li>
      <li>At best, it has made my skin tone a half shade lighter than before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m light medium.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t enjoy it .</li>
      <li>It  lathers up richly and makes my face feel smooth after using.  </li>
      <li>I bought this soap because I got a major farmer&#x27;s tan on my arms and legs over the summer, and seeing the good reviews on amazon made me want to pick it up.</li>
      <li>I originally used the Kojie San Orange soap but not on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>iv&#x27;e been using the original for 3 weeks 2x a day and leaving on for 5 minutes at a time.</li>
      <li>It has a regular size and it was ok for price but its whitening properties arent as effective.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin looking clean.</li>
      <li>The smell is a faint, clean vanilla but quite nice, and it has a thicker lather, which is great for more coverage of the face and body.</li>
      <li>Make sure you put the soap in a plastic bag as it can melt fast.</li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d try this version when I couldn&#x27;t find a good deal on the regular stuff.</li>
      <li>but i use a good moisturizer after,it does help with fading dark spots,but it takes time like most products,</li>
      <li>Very similar to the Orange one, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to melt as quickly - which is actually a good thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think it helps, but the main effect is from the soap, I am sure.</li>
      <li>Dissolves quickly.</li>
      <li>The best part about this soap is that it lasts a pretty good while; I&#x27;m only just now getting to the 2nd bar (and that&#x27;s with daily use!).</li>
      <li>took alittle long to recieve over all my wife seems to love the product she will probably irder more when she needs it</li>
      <li>I make sure to use a strong SPF every time I go outside.</li>
      <li>This soap smells good and doesnt stain my bathroom like  the other orange one,its a bit drying</li>
      <li>received the soap yesterday and used it right away...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m already positive this will even my skin color out!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this product broke me out in huge hives all over my neck and decollete about a week into using it.</li>
      <li>I was looking the ingredients, and there are only two differences: this one has an adorable vanilla scent and also includes collagen.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>You have to be consistent to see results with this</li>
      <li>I plan to order more to use on my entire body.</li>
      <li>fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It does lighten pretty well though.</li>
      <li>I tried this soap and it is not as effective as the foreign soap I bought.</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t that much lighter, but it definitely is noticeably more radiant.</li>
      <li>It can be drying, but I believe the secret is in finding a good exfoliating toner that is alcohol free.</li>
      <li>arrived fastly and was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>or it&#x27;ll pretty much start eating at your flesh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like your usual Dove bar where it&#x27;ll take a good while to finish.</li>
      <li>and it has a good ammount of lightening ingredients without being harsh or burning (when I didn&#x27;t ask for it) Would recommend!</li>
      <li>The seller is beyond reproach, including a sweet little note hoping I will enjoy my purchase!</li>
      <li>I have been using this since i was in Philippines and found this here and ordered as fast</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think there much of a difference between these and the orange ones..</li>
      <li>, you shouldn&#x27;t really feel any residue at all.</li>
      <li>It really dries out/</li>
      <li>ages your skin when you use it too much.</li>
      <li>Use 2-3 a week along with another skin lightener if it&#x27;s too much to handle.</li>
      <li>It really does what it say.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> just got it today for my mom! she&#x27;s been looking for this soap in evey asian store told her to check online. now she&#x27;s happy, and im happy! she loves this soap! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Ive been using for less than 2wks along with skin lightner to lighten my acne marks.Im African American. This soap has lighten my spots 1shade but user will definitely need to use moisturizer following use. Will order again</li>
    <li> This soap smells good and doesnt stain my bathroom like  the other orange one,its a bit drying but i use a good moisturizer after,it does help with fading dark spots,but it takes time like most products,if i use it too frequently it gives me some rashes,so i use it once or twice a week,skin reacts differently for everyone so it might not be an issue,overall i like it and i have bought it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for almost 3 weeks and I already see a difference in my skin. My face was full of blackheads and using this has gotten rid of most of them. Only downside about this soap is your skin will be dry after using it so make sure to moisturize your skin after</li>
    <li> I like this version better than the Orange kojie soap. It&#x27;s definitely stronger, so don&#x27;t leave it on your face for as long as you leave the Orange one. It really helped lighten up my hyperpigmentation from acne</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using Kojie San soaps for about 6 months now, and it has greatly improved my hyper-pigmentation. I will be buying these products again! It can be drying, but I believe the secret is in finding a good exfoliating toner that is alcohol free. I recommend Skin Prep by Cellbone. Together, these products are working miracles for me. Also an organic oil moisturizer, like rose hip oil for moisturizing afterwards.</li>
    <li> It  lathers up richly and makes my face feel smooth after using.  I purchased to help diminish marks on my face that were made through pimples.  It seems to be working and my appearance is more youthful looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap but I didn&#x27;t enjoy it . I don&#x27;t know how to say that but I didn&#x27;t see change on my skin . The lightening one  it&#x27;s much better tho .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three bars and I&#x27;ve never seen a difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this product broke me out in huge hives all over my neck and decollete about a week into using it. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This really helps to peel darkened areas from tweezing or acne. When used with AmLactin 12 % Moisturizing Lotion, and RDL Babyface No.2  they help to lighten darkened areas and even skin tone.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap exclusively for the past 5 months and it’s amazing! I use it as a body bar and on my face. Not only did it clear up some stretch marks I’ve had, It also helped smooth out my KP on the back of my arms and my knees and elbows! My hands look younger too! I just follow with Cocoa Butter all over my skin and I couldn’t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;This is THE only soap I intend to use as I don’t see how any other could possibly give me better results.</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP DID NOT WORK FOR ME,CAUSED MORE DISCOLORATION ON MY HANDS.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for lightening and cleansing, I love it! I noticed a difference the first time I used it. It wasn&#x27;t a dramatic shade of pale, but my face was white after washing instead of pink or red. I&#x27;m caucasion and I don&#x27;t tolerate greasy sunblock most days, so I have sunspots around my cheecks. I&#x27;m already positive this will even my skin color out! My soap arrived on time, in nice packaging with every perfect corner in tact upon opening! A beautiful bar in my holder with pretty engraving on it. The seller is beyond reproach, including a sweet little note hoping I will enjoy my purchase! You won&#x27;t have anything to worry about with these guys, oh! and my skin feels amazing! I will be buying this same thing from them in the future.  :))</li>
    <li> I have been using this product Kojie soap and toner plus cream for two weeks i thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but to my surprise it did it got rid of my dark circle and uneven skin tone not all is gone yet however I will continue to use it, all I could say is wow!</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this version when I couldn&#x27;t find a good deal on the regular stuff. Dream White is vanilla-scented, and doesn&#x27;t melt like the papaya-scented bar. (Though I miss that fruity smell.) It lathers generously and keeps my skin luminous and glowy. It is a little bit stronger than the regular kojic acid soap. I made the mistake of using it on my face twice in one day (twelve hours apart) and it burned some, but other than that, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out. I can&#x27;t say it hasn&#x27;t made me any more sensitive to sunlight than I regularly am, because since I started using this version, I&#x27;ve worked sixteen days in a row, so I haven&#x27;t actually had the chance to stand around and stare at the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not awful, though. Good soap, good deal, good skin-care. No complaints, and I&#x27;m probably gonna buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this has a daily body wash. It smells wonderful but  as far as its &amp;#34;lightening&#x27; effects it is very low. I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday for a month and while I enjoy the soap I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if it was going to take this long treat my dark knee caps and toes. Daily use with this product over a few months might make a huge difference in lighting up darker spots. No immediate results overnight. I think this soap used with other lightening products might speed up the process faster. I think it&#x27;s a great soap and if you want to get a nice glow for a upcoming event. I really enjoy this soap as a daily body wash but not as a dark area treatment. Make sure you put the soap in a plastic bag as it can melt fast. Also test it on your arm before using on your whole body as other reviewers have broken out from it.</li>
    <li> It disn&#x27;t make my skin any whiter I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m a hispanic and I&#x27;m not that dark. It did feel nice.</li>
    <li> This soap is working very well helping me to remove a permatan.  I use Dream White on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Tried the orange to these soap ..I don&#x27;t really think there much of a difference between these and the orange ones.. Can say if they work or not because the bars are small and within a week there gone ..So I wont order these again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the white bar. The orange bar is better..</li>
    <li> Sorry! I have not seen a difference with this product.... Maybe my issue is deeper than soap.</li>
    <li> Mrs. loves this stuff and uses it every day and she will be ordering her third order in a few more days.</li>
    <li> took alittle long to recieve over all my wife seems to love the product she will probably irder more when she needs it thx.</li>
    <li> iv&#x27;e been using the original for 3 weeks 2x a day and leaving on for 5 minutes at a time. Then I use retin a and follow up with amlactin... My skin was glowing but the melas a was still there but starting to break up. I just got this today and left it on for 5 minutes and I really felt the burn😳 after rinsing and drying I noticed that the melasma on one side of my face was almost gone!! Now I guess I&#x27;ll have to focus more on the other side! I really like this soap😉 I will update in a few weeks</li>
    <li> Too drying. Does not lighten. Dissolves quickly. Just a normal soap.</li>
    <li> does not burn feels like a botox been using it for about a month now and I see awesome results</li>
    <li> Omg just came today so happy shipping was so fast will update you if it work can&#x27;t wait yay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve notice it being stronger than the regular Kojie San&#x27;s Kojic Acid soap due to the fact it lightens my skin a lot faster. I recommend this to anyone looking for a solution to most skin products such as scars, stretch marks, and especially acne prone skin. It really does what it say. Most people who complain about Kojie San either don&#x27;t know how to use it or just don&#x27;t know what they are doing. Why not ask around or research on instructions? 2-5 minutes for lighter-medium skin tones and 10-15 minutes for darker tones to have this product work effectively. There is some stinging involved which some people say tingles but I know tingling is completely different from stinging. Remember it is kojic &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; so it will burn. Use 2-3 a week along with another skin lightener if it&#x27;s too much to handle.</li>
    <li> This soap broke my face out in bumps. I had to discontinue usage immediately. Would not recommend for this reason.</li>
    <li> Great lather and my skin was soft, clean, and over time was lighter.  I plan to order more to use on my entire body.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because I got a major farmer&#x27;s tan on my arms and legs over the summer, and seeing the good reviews on amazon made me want to pick it up. However, there hasn&#x27;t been major changes to my skin tone, and I have been using it for about two months. At best, it has made my skin tone a half shade lighter than before. It is extremely drying, so I would advise you to use copious amounts of lotion afterwards.</li>
    <li> Just in case you a re sensitive, here are the ingredients (picture attached). The ingredients list I saw online was not complete and I was disappointed to see fragrance smack in the middle of the list on the box AND THEN MINERAL OIL. Collagen and Elastin are the LAST INGREDIENTS.  I don&#x27;t know what star rating to give considering I have second thoughts about using this on my skin since I am sensitive. Here is the list in case you need to copy and paste: Cocos nucifera (coconut oil), de-ionized water, sodium hydroxide, Kojic acid, glycerin, fragrance, Aqua (and) xantham  gum (and) phenoxyethanol (and) ethylhexylglycerine, cocodiethanolamide, mineral oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil, titanium dioxide, collagen, elastin, BHT</li>
    <li> it really works for me.</li>
    <li> arrived fastly and was exactly what i was looking for. Not sure if the product is actually working but it does make my skin softer...</li>
    <li> The soap is okay....  like original kojiesan better.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a month and a half now. My skin isn&#x27;t that much lighter, but it definitely is noticeably more radiant. What&#x27;s even better is that it has had a significant impact on my acne breakouts. A co-worker noticed that my skin is clearer. The best part about this soap is that it lasts a pretty good while; I&#x27;m only just now getting to the 2nd bar (and that&#x27;s with daily use!).</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I think continual use made me breakout. It seems to leave a waxy residue on my skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> Beware of long term side effects especially if you have dry skin to begin with. It really dries out/ages your skin when you use it too much. It does lighten pretty well though.</li>
    <li> Works great feels great</li>
    <li> I love it,  it works!!!</li>
    <li> It burned my skin a little so I won&#x27;t be trying this one again I don&#x27;t think my skin can handle collegen and Kojie acid</li>
    <li> So glad I found it here @ amazon! Never stop using it.</li>
    <li> This soap really works. I had some blemishes and skin discoloration. This soap cleared up the blemishes and skin discoloration. I also use it on my body. It has made me skin glow. I love the collagen in it. It isn&#x27;t as drying as the other kojie San soap. I will continue to use this soap.</li>
    <li> I reorder this all the time. It keeps my skin looking clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kojie-san regular soap since 2 years ago. My skin was like MAC NC 42 (search Google Images for pictures), damaged because of the sun. and now I am NC15. It  helped a lot with scar marks and freckles. The soap really works, but of course, you can not go out under the sun and always use sunscreen even inside of home. If you go under the sun while using this soap, your skin will BURN, so be aware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using the Dream White version. I was looking the ingredients, and there are only two differences: this one has an adorable vanilla scent and also includes collagen. In my skin, it feels stronger than the regular soap, so do not leave it on your face if you are not used to it. Oh, and this one is white, unlike the regular version, which is orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Kojie-san Lightening lotion and I think it helps, but the main effect is from the soap, I am sure. From now, I think I will always order the Dream White instead of the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more advise: always order this item from Amazon, because last time I ordered from ebay and the soaps were fake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Likas papaya soap in the past along with their lotion. You had to be EXTRA careful on not letting the product sit on your skin too long or it&#x27;ll pretty much start eating at your flesh and it burns. Not literally eating, but you will get scars and it&#x27;ll hurt every time you touch the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that knowledge, I decided to be careful with this soap as well even if it&#x27;s not the usual orange/papaya one. First few times, I let it sit on my skin for no more than 1-2 mins. Skin felt fine. From then on, increased the time gradually. Even after 5 mins, my skin won&#x27;t burn from it. Only certain areas of my neck will &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s towards the end when i usually wash off the soap anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes but at a much slower rate than Likas. You have to be consistent to see results with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s best to keep the soap away from water when not in use. It&#x27;s not like your usual Dove bar where it&#x27;ll take a good while to finish. You only need to use a little bit of this whitening soap and it spreads/lathers pretty well. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll waste a lot and soon realize your bar is almost done when it hasn&#x27;t even been a month yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to compare this white anti-aging soap vs the kojic orange one once my 2nd bar runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m light medium. I wanted to make my skin lighter. So I tryed this soap for 3 months everyday morning and night didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.. :( it probably takes a few years or something... :(</li>
    <li> I originally used the Kojie San Orange soap but not on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very oily and shiny Tzone and ive used a lot of &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; soaps, powder, toners etc some worked (but expensive) and some didnt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine told me to try using kojie san derma white she said her skin is less oily, so i ordered to give it a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the soap yesterday and used it right away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I love the vanilla smell.&lt;br /&gt;2. knowing kojie san it melts fast so i cut it into 5 equal parts&lt;br /&gt;3. i used it on my face and leave it on for 5 minutes, it kinda sting but its bearable&lt;br /&gt;4. after rinsing, i felt i had a botox LOL maybe because of collagen content&lt;br /&gt;5 my skin feels so smooth and silky after 1 use, feels tight and looks white&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will continue to use and order more!</li>
    <li> Was and am still pleased with this product. I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap exclusively for the last 7 months and I can say at the very least it has rid me of most of my mild blotches and skin discolorations. The key is to keep a strict routine and sunblock regimen. My best results were during the summer! I had already been exfoliating every other day to every third day for six months using Daggett &amp; Ramsdell soap (didn&#x27;t do much for me as far as lightening).&lt;br /&gt;My nightly routine with this soap was to exfoliate with a mitt in the shower and let the suds soak in for a minute or two with the water off, if it starts tingling then it&#x27;s time to rinse, I tried to brave the burn once when I left it on for over 15 minutes and ended up with a few small red marks on body and face.. but I think this would happen with any soap. Whether or not you completely rinse off the soap is up to you(r skin tolerance) I found that leaving a very tiny soap residue on my body before bed helped the lightening process but it should not be heavy, you shouldn&#x27;t really feel any residue at all. Either way you need to moisturize. The soap is hydrating but not enough to stand on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I would wash my face again with the soap, rinse completely and apply 50+ sunblock to all sun exposed areas and avoid the sun like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;I have achieved 1.5-2 shades of lightening so far but I have been lazy in the winter and after a couple of weeks without using sunblock the really nice glow has faded moderately.. it&#x27;s still there but it&#x27;s very easy to slip and get comfortable with the results. The soap is doing fine at maintaining and evening my skin tone though. It has worked ok on stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was a bit more potent now that i&#x27;m acclimated to it. However it smells fine, soapy and kind of vanilla-esque. Lathers well nice and smooth. I feel like this is a quality soap and it has a good ammount of lightening ingredients without being harsh or burning (when I didn&#x27;t ask for it) Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Love These Bars. I can tell a noticle difference in my skin after using one bar! Will be purchasing again!!!!</li>
    <li> Strong. Very similar to the Orange one, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to melt as quickly - which is actually a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Careful if you&#x27;re using retinoids with this - it&#x27;ll dry your skin out like nothing!  Moisturizer is a must.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see results. It just burned and make my skin really rough.</li>
    <li> This product does the job for what I am using it for. it does get expensive. However, with any result it does take time.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier !! Now im trying it!</li>
    <li> I tried this soap and it is not as effective as the foreign soap I bought. Not that great. It has a regular size and it was ok for price but its whitening properties arent as effective.</li>
    <li> Only woks as a soap cleaner not a spot lighting soap.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  The price is good and works just as advertized.  Amazon, keep up a good job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since i was in Philippines and found this here and ordered as fast as i can lol! I ordered another batch since this product is tested for clearing out your skin and whitening hidden areas of your body. This a must have for fair, good looking skin.</li>
    <li> It has lightened melasma stache but not sun spots or old lady spots whatever they are. I&#x27;m 30 and I am not ready for the stuff popping up so I tried this. I love the firming feeling it gives. I use it on my face, neck and other areas. It whitens well. I make sure to use a strong SPF every time I go outside. Its not hard. My skin does look better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say much about the product because I don&#x27;t use it daily. However, I have to say I was using the other Kojie-San soap before this (I can&#x27;t remember which strength), and I actually prefer that one. It seemed to do more as far as lightening the acne and other facial scars that I have. I just ordered a bundle of said other Kojie-San soap and probably just continue with that particular one in the future.</li>
    <li> Wow...I&#x27;ve been using just regular Kojie San for two months as an acne and old scar treatment, which is fantastic, but after just one use of this Dream White, I can tell my skin is more receptive to it. The smell is a faint, clean vanilla but quite nice, and it has a thicker lather, which is great for more coverage of the face and body. I really recommend alternating between the two kojie san soaps (orange and white bars) By cutting each bar into thirds to ensure it lasts longer, and switching between to another piece when it runs out. This should help a lot.</li>
