<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far the best item I have found to help me out...</li>
    <li> Great applicator. Reaches where needed. Sponge holds plenty of oil  Best I have found for those of us with limited reach</li>
    <li> Took some time to get using. Not sure I would be buying again.</li>
    <li> It is great and works better than expected.</li>
    <li> The body reach rod is great, you can bend it into the reach position you desire, thus enables you to reach areas of my back which I previously couldn&#x27;t. The sponge applicators that come standard are not as durable, after about 8 - 12 uses, the sponges began to tear apart when remove from the rod. This is a good product for those who have difficulty applying lotions, oils  &amp; medications to your back, you just need to order a more sturdier sponge applicator.</li>
    <li> I was between two and three stars.  The Body Reach has a major flaw.  The handle, while ergonomically fitted to the hand, is made out of a slick nylon (or other) material that you just can&#x27;t hang on to with soapy hands.  It twists in your grip so that you can&#x27;t keep the pad flat.  The handle should be textured or otherwise shaped so that it can be firmly held when your hands are soapy.</li>
    <li> This was just what we were looking for - would recommend it.</li>
    <li> A product that really comes in handy when you don&#x27;t have someone else&#x27;s hand to put lotion on your back. I didn&#x27;t know they made something like this and was actually thinking someone should invent it and then i saw this product on Amazon and swooped it right up. When my husband isn&#x27;t available I use this and all is well since I live in a very dry climate and lotions are a necessity.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I thought it was pretty pricey, but after using it, I was pretty happy I found this one.  It is sturdier than most and reaches my back really well.  I use it to apply lotion, but because the pads go on and off the holder so easy, I can use it in the shower too.</li>
    <li> Thought would be easy to use but it isn&#x27;t - if I could I would return it...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE GREAT TO LOTION OT PUT ANTI ITCH MEDS ON MY CALVES. ALSO GREAT TO CLEAN BACK OR FEET IN THE SHOWER. EASY TO USE AND CHANGE PADS. AFTER USE JUST WASH WITH SOAP AND RINSE WELL AND LET DRY.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and useful.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and suffer from an itchy, dry back and no-one around to apply lotion for you, then you need this.  This thing has change my life.  I no longer suffer from the itchiness, dryness and irritation from not apply lotion.  It is the most easiest thing to use.  Apply your lotion to the sponge and apply to your back.  The arm is long enough to reach all the way to your rear.  Cleaning the sponge is easy too, just apply a little soap, scrub with your fingers and let it air dry. What a great invention!!</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job as advertised .it&#x27;s handel gets slippery and hard to keep in posection on back..</li>
    <li> This has been a God-send! Great tool.  THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Great way to slather lotion on your own back.  It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it,  you can achieve the desired result of a back full of lotion.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  Cznt expect more than that.</li>
    <li> A wonderful tool to apply lotion to one&#x27;s back without assistance from another person.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought this! I&#x27;ve been struggling with bacne for several years and it&#x27;s finally clearing up now that I can apply real medicine on my back. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion applicator.  It makes applying lotion so much easier with my limited flexibility.  I also purchased replacement pads and I&#x27;m glad I did, since this item is now a staple in my daily routine!</li>
    <li> Spinal fusion prevents me from bending over to apply lotions to my back, legs, and feet. This solves the problem.</li>
    <li> This rocks! I have needed something to pour ointment on my back for years and here out is. The pads are large and it spreads it nice. Love love love how easy this is!</li>
    <li> excellent, reaches full back areas</li>
    <li> This is a very well-made lotion applicator.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Received quickly and enjoying use as described</li>
    <li> Works great and is very handy to use by someone that has limed arm movement.</li>
    <li> This applicator reached every section of my body with ease.  I use this with lotion and my back has not been itchy since I have been using the flex applicator.  I strongly recommend using this when you dry off after you shower.  I rinse the pads after every use and they come out clean.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by the dermatologist, this item works out well to reach the back shoulder blade areas and should last many years.  I have excellent range of motion but would think that a reach shorter than 18\\&quot; would not work as well for these areas.</li>
    <li> it was the best thing i ever had on my back.and not much time.thank you.</li>
    <li> First off I only received 6 sponges with the wand, not the 10 promised.  I don&#x27;t know who said they last 1month, first sponge lasted only 10 days when used daily. Second sponge lasted 15 days used every other day. Covering separates from foam. Wand is great for reaching entire back. Need to improve sponges!</li>
    <li> Perfect to apply lotion to my feet and legs.</li>
    <li> Works well to lotion or apply creams to your back without assistance.</li>
    <li> Very helpful when you don&#x27;t have a partner to put lotion on your back.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as flexible as it appears or states.</li>
    <li> Its too pricey for the quality. The pad tend to bend when you apply cream on your back. Otherwise, its just a plastic stick on cotton pad nothing else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this wand a 5 star because it is just what I needed to get lotion to sunscreen with ease. I look high and low and wasn&#x27;t able to find something so easy to use which even is bendable. I recommend this wand to my friends.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those of us who are not very limber and want to put lotion on our back.</li>
    <li> Product works great to put lotion on my back. The replaceable sponges show wear from velcro when you take them off to wash, but that is expected.</li>
    <li> Seems very well made, not at all flimsy.  It does bend but you must exert quite a bit of pressure to bend it so it will not easily change position while you are using it.  The pad, once attached, will also take pressure to remove and should not come off while in use.  Also the extra pads are quite handy to have available when you need to change the pad.  All in all,  this should be an excellent product for applying lotion or cream to hard to reach parts of your own body.</li>
    <li> I like this, i can do my whole back with cream but it is not easily bendable as it was supposed to be.</li>
    <li> I use to to apply lotion or muscle rub on my back.  Works easy - the velcro really holds the foam sponge applicator.  My husband always means well - that he will put lotion on my back or muscle rub - but never happens - this way I can do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great value - I will have to look at getting the exfoliator pads.  I think this would be a good gift for someone pregnant.</li>
    <li> Works well not awesome just well enough to get by that&#x27;s about it on hard times this helps you our</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as show on the label.</li>
    <li> Just what my Dad needed to apply lotion to his back.  Comes with lots of applicators and works great for him.</li>
    <li> it works well ,  but only 4 stars as it bends as you use it.  stiffer would be better</li>
    <li> Best so far in applying moisturizing lotions. The pads work well and are washable and re-useable. The handle does bend into shapes which facilitate getting to hard-to-reach spots, but does straighten out a bit too easily (minor issue)</li>
    <li> Did not like the design. Difficult to use with hinge not staying locked.</li>
    <li> takes a lot of effort to bend but it does if you hold it for a few.  pads included adhere with tiny velcrolike system and come off for washing exactly as advertised. Great!</li>
    <li> Helpful for applying meds to my back.</li>
    <li> Works great to help me put lotion on my feet. Arthritis keeps me from bending to far and this works great.</li>
    <li> I love this invention to put lotion on my back. Although I have a loofa to clean my back, this Body Reach Lotion Applicator does the trick and cleans up easily with some warm water and soap, so I can use one sponge over and over. The items I ordered arrived as promised and all works just as described.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t reach your back?  Most of us can&#x27;t. This enables you to put on your lotions very easily.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased this item for myself. I decided to get one for my sister and she loves it as much as I do. It makes it so much easier to apply lotion to hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Bought for my sister with bad arthritis &amp; she luvs iit...no pain for her when she uses it!  Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had to apply lotion all over your back, you know why I love this applicator. Living alone, I have no one handy to help and this really fills the bill.</li>
    <li> Because of arthritis, I have trouble reaching my feet to apply lotion.  This gadget is the fix.  The replaceable pad adheres very well to the velcro and I&#x27;m able to reach from the back of my heels to the tips of my toes.  Glad I found it.  Highly recommended. It would be great if there were an abrasive pad that could be used with the same wand to smooth rough skin.</li>
    <li> Love this, you can really reach areas you may other wise not be able to reach to apply lotion. Application pads last a long time, love you can get replacement applicators.</li>
    <li> Perfect for someone who cannot reach their back or has flexibility issues.  Plastic arm is a bit hard to bend.</li>
    <li> My back feels great! I highly recommend it. Eventhough it&#x27;s not as flexible as one would believe from the ad.</li>
    <li> I think this will be helpful for my friend who cannot bend over to lotion his legs. He had tried other devices that were difficult to use so I hope this will work.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized that this can be used in the shower with shower gel too. It also is good for applying ointments. I am totally happy with this product! I have severe arthritis, scoliosis and bursitis. Makes it pretty miserable to reach areas. This is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Purchased as gift for the boyfriend. He has owned several of these in the past and this one happens to be the best that he owns. It bends and is so durable. The supply of extra sponges is great too? Great price, great shipping, quality product!</li>
    <li> Super reusable pads and handy applicator. Great for lotion and leg makeup ( I am allergic to the sun)</li>
    <li> This is a simple system that allows me to apply lotion to my back.  The pad washes clean with little effort and can be used repeatedly.  A very good price for a very useful item.</li>
    <li> Gift for friend &amp; I don&#x27;t know how she likes it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but looks like it will work just fine.  I like that the pads are washable and reusable.</li>
    <li> I really needed this! My anti inflammatory medicine is a gel that cost me $50  tube and dropping globs of it in the floor was just not cutting it for me. This works great! I&#x27;m able to apply it to my back with just a small amount that soaks into the pad. I wish I had gotten this sooner! The pads wash out well and dry quickly.</li>
    <li> Works as described. The removable applicators wash easily so they can be reused.</li>
    <li> I have used this maybe a dozen times for my back which has a bad habit of getting dry, itchy, and bumpy. First wet a pad with rubbing alcohol, and rub-down. Then a pad with lotion. If the pad used with the alcohol is not removed at once and rinsed several times, it will deteriorate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the biggest problem with this applicator is the handle. It is too small in diameter, which causes a lack of control when trying to move it around your back.</li>
    <li> I have used several other devices to reach my back with lotion and creams.  This device because of the larger pad works great.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product Forapplying foot lotion on my feet .  Works so great that I purchased a second one for use at my cabin</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. However,  I knew what I wanted.  The applicator is washable which means it will last even longer.  No more itchy back.</li>
    <li> This was a great idea. It works ok but not a flexible as I had hoped. Good product for the money.</li>
    <li> For reaching that mid-back area--this is the perfect applicator. To make the replaceable pads last longer,and keep from making a mess, I store it in a zip-lock bag until ready to use.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect wand. It reaches my entire back and the Velcro helps to keep the pads in place. It is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Thhis gadget does sthe job just fine.  Comes with 8 pads which can be either washed or considered disposable.  Each one lasts me for about 2 weeks before needing changing.  Only complaint is the handle becomes slippery with use.  The loop on the handle is useful for retaining a grip but a textured handle would make the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this applicator for body lotion and suntan lotion. I&#x27;m really glad to have the extra sponge attachments so I could designate one pad for each application.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use,i love it..Just what a disabled person needs.I recommen this 100 %.fast shipping,low price A+++++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little but harder to use than you&#x27;d think, but it does work when you need to apply sunscreen to your back.</li>
    <li> So simple, yet so ingenious! I used it today for the first time at the beach, and I had no sunburn! Aside from applying lotion by oneself, especially the back area, this is a great product because it eliminates the need for actually using your hands to apply lotion.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 14&amp;#34; model several years ago and have been very satisfied. It&#x27;s fairly priced, very well made, the pads do not absorb whatever lotion or soap you put on it, pads last a long time and can easily be washed. I am a senior age  male , 5&amp;#34;9&amp;#34; tall, with good mobility for my age and found the reach to be adequate. I decided to get a second one this time the 18&amp;#34; model to have one in shower for body wash and one on bath counter for moisturizer.  The 18&amp;#34; is the perfect size for me to easily reach all areas of my back whereas with the 14&amp;#34; the middle back was a stretch.  The 24&amp;#34; would be way too long for me and actually would be cumbersome to use. I highly recommend this product with no reservations.</li>
    <li> A different lotion applicator was not good at all.  This one is the closest and does a very good job.  I wish it was just a tad more flexible, otherwise no complaints at all.  I also like the number of replacement pads that came with the product, makes this item really affordable.</li>
    <li> Eliminates the contortions one goes through when trying to apply lotion themselves to the back.  The sponge applicator is soft and more durable than I expected.  The wand is a bit hard for me to bend, but that&#x27;s not a necessity for me.  I found this so helpful that I bought one for my mother who has to regularly apply medicated creams to her back.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because we&#x27;re having an unusually cold, dry winter in &amp;#34;sunny&amp;#34; California.  The lotion applicator a god-send....now I don&#x27;t have to bug my husband to smear lotion on my itchy back!  The applicator is flexible so it can be bent into just the right shape, and it stays that way.  Great product.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for applying lotion to places on your back that you can&#x27;t reach.  Would recommend it to anyone who has this problem.</li>
    <li> This works really good for covering your back. However, it is hard to bend and it not proficient without that so that why I give this product  a four.</li>
    <li> works great for putting the lotion on my back</li>
    <li> Easy to use and holds the lotion on.  The one draw back is that your hands must be try when using as the handle will be slippery</li>
    <li> The reason I bought the 18&amp;#34; Semi-Flex-Reach was to be able to apply sunscreen to my back.  I used it 1 weekend and did not get burned</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I use it to apply lotion to my back. I gave ont to my sister &amp; she also lovesit.</li>
    <li> Finally, something that lives up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best one we have ever used for applying lotions and sunless tanners.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I liked:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use for back and legs.&lt;br /&gt;-It is a great length and the flexibility is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;-The sponge is a good size so you can cover more area in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;-The wand has velcro on it so the sponge adheres easily and stays in place.  But it is easily removed and can be used on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;-It also washes out well after each use and seems like it will last a long time.  Getting several replacement sponges is great to share it and to have extra on hand when needed.&lt;br /&gt;So glad we found this.</li>
    <li> Family member wasn&#x27;t able to put medicine on her own back until we purchased this applicator for her.  Now her daughter doesn&#x27;t have to stop by before &amp; after work to do it for her.</li>
    <li> Whoever designed this beauty must have used it before releasing it on the market. There are several other solutions on the market but none work as well or offer as complete a solution. Easy to use. The pads are perfect for spreading lotions and they are washable. Replacements are reasonably priced when they are needed. The flexible handle is perfect for people with different physical abilities. Glad I chose this one.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different lotion applicators over the years and this is by far the best one ever. As others stated, it does not stay bent like shown, but I don&#x27;t care or need it to. The pads are a very good size and seems to be really well made. The pads really stay stuck on the applicator and are very easy to wash. The handle is really slippery if your hands are wet or if you have lotion on them so keep hands dry and apply lotion to your back first then to the rest of you body. I highly recommend this product. It is very well made and will last years.</li>
    <li> I hunted for this in my local Walgreens and RiteAid. They had never heard of a gadget you could use to apply lotion to your back. This is a long wand, bendable -- altho I haven&#x27;t found that necessary -- to apply lotion. It comes with a two-year supply of foams pads which fit quite securely to Velcro pads at the end of the wand. I squirt a soothing lotion, Moisturel, onto the pad after securing it to the wand and massage the lotion on to my back. Voil&amp;agrave;, no more itching.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 82 year old aunt, she loves it and is now able to need less assistance..</li>
    <li> works perfectly - great for suntan lotion on your back</li>
    <li> This lotion applicator is very sturdy. I find that the applicators are easy to take on and off when switching from soap to lotion, and there are enough of them that, with proper washing and care, they should last me forever (Just kidding! But for a very long time.). Am very happy with this purchase. At first I didn&#x27;t think it would bend to fit, but with a little practice, found it to be very effective.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly for applying medication and lotion to my back.  The pads wash easily and last for weeks of reuse</li>
    <li> There is no way you will be able to bend this handle without a blowtorch.  It&#x27;s very short.  It needs another 6 inches.</li>
    <li> This is pretty handy to have. I have RA and cant reach my legs or feet anymore so this helps me apply my lotion. Great idea for anyone who has trouble reaching parts of their body.</li>
    <li> enjoy this product, but should have more pads to go with it. the pads should be replaced each time you use it</li>
    <li> very nice easy for father to use to put lotion on his back</li>
    <li> This has been very helpful while I was recovering from hip surgery and couldn&#x27;t reach below the knees. I have used it to apply lotion, and also BioFreeze. The pads wash out easily, but be sure to not let them dry out before washing. I keep a small container of water by the bathroom sink, so I can drop the used pad in immediately if I can&#x27;t take time to wash it right away. Then the next time I wash my hands, I just pick up the wet pad and wash it using the lather on my hands.</li>
    <li> While the applicator and pads do their jobs and do it well I couldn&#x27;t get the  applicator  to bend.  I am 75 and if I was an 18 year old football player I&#x27;m sure I could do it without a problem.  The illustration shows it with a slight bend.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come that way.  Good idea, but make sure you have a strong man available to bend it.</li>
    <li> The pads get saturated with the lotion long before any gets on your skin, and then in a short time the pads shred apart.  Not really very reusable.  The wand is ok and reaches far enough down the back, but I did find out later that the same company makes a longer wand.</li>
    <li> Like it but hard to store in the drawer. It could have been a little shorter.</li>
    <li> This works well to get lotion on the top part of my back.  I wasn&#x27;t sure why the pads were so much larger than the applicator where the pads fit by Velcro, but I cut them in half and have twice as many pads.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily to put lotion on my back since I received it and it works great. The pads stay on well and the only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is difficult to bend. It works exactly as I wanted it to otherwise.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied that I chose this product-it is very easy to use and effective at meeting personal care needs. You may want to order the longest handle length to aid in less bending, though, the 18 inch is well suited for my needs.</li>
    <li> I am 85 so bending is difficult.  It bends to the side not in a straight curve so I would not buy again.  Ann H.</li>
    <li> I could not get it bent vey much.  The next day it had straightened itself out.  If you really&lt;br /&gt;need it to be very bent, as in picture, don&#x27;t order this one.  Otherwise it&#x27;s fine, and I can&lt;br /&gt;use as is.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for applying lotion to those impossible to reach spots on your back.  Great relief from the dry skin that winter brings.</li>
    <li> Great for applying lotions or pain creams or essential oils</li>
    <li> I have a really difficult time using this item.  I don&#x27;t know if the handle was put on crooked or if it is made that way, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem angled properly.  If I had to do it again, I would keep looking.</li>
    <li> Sent to elderly aunt who has mobility issues with shoulders.  She is THRILLED with it. She can now apply lotion to her shoulders any time and by herself.  Thank you for helping me help her.&lt;br /&gt;Joan</li>
    <li> Have to apply medication to my back on a regular basis. It makes an easy reach for my entire back.</li>
    <li> My back was so dry this is just what I need.</li>
    <li> Works very well, can reach all parts of a back with no problem, no sharp edges and potion stays on pads and is easy to get everywhere.  Can use a pad again and again and again without any obvious problem.  Great product and very useful.</li>
    <li> Applicator does not bend, making it a little hard to use. Like the fact I can remove the pad and wash it each time. Over all not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Love this. Now I can lotion my whole back by myself...</li>
    <li> Sponge pills off after 3/4 time use.</li>
    <li> This is Larry&#x27;s wife. I have mobility problems and this device is wonderful at putting lotion on my lower legs and feet perfectly. I even reach my ankles on the other side easily. I rinse it with hot water and hang to dry.</li>
    <li> Love these! Best applicators I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Item was just what I needed.  Have gotten some other similar items and they did not meet my needs.  I am 76 years old and not as flexible as I used  to be.</li>
    <li> Thank you for making this product!</li>
    <li> This was a solution to the problem of applying topical arthritic gel. Enormously useful. Pending the time when I develop an extra set of arms, this is the solution to the problem</li>
    <li> I had another style for topical meds, but the balls in it kept falling out.  This applicator works very well and reaches all the spots on my back I cannot.</li>
    <li> Wow!  The best!  THE VERY BEST!  After using this applicator only once, I knew I&#x27;d found the only applicator I&#x27;d ever need.  It reaches everywhere and I&#x27;m ordering other attachments, and getting rid of my other forms of washers/brushes, etc..  Great gadget.</li>
    <li> The wand of the lotion applicator is quite difficult to bend. The handle twists easily in the hand, making it extremely difficult to use effectively. I doubt I shall use it again. In addition the sponge feels rough and scratchy.</li>
    <li> I tried this after getting the 22&amp;#34; model which was difficult to use/control for lotion or body wash application.  This size is really much better.  Like the 22&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s hard to bend that much.</li>
    <li> Using this to apply an expensive medicated cream, I found it too big to be practical.  it would be nice to have a smaller applicator (and sponges).</li>
    <li> I thought about buying the applicator with the rollers after reading reviews that these pads absorbed a lot of the lotion. I opted for this one. It does absorb some of the lotion, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> I use this quite often to apply lotion to those hard to reach spots on my back.  The only thing is that I wish the handle was a bit longer.  Everything else about this is perfect.  I reuse the pads and the handle bends however I want.</li>
    <li> Does reach places you can not easily reach, but is hard to maneuver and tend to flip over so wand is on body instead of lotion pad. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Unless you work out regularly and lift a lot of weights, you are not going to be able to bend this to look like the pictures.  If you do manage to bend it, it will spring back to it&#x27;s original shape. Overall I found it to be difficult to use, clumsy, and not at all flexible.</li>
    <li> Tried both sunbuddy and this on.  Go with this one. It&#x27;s better to use.  Harder to transport since it doesn&#x27;t fold up,but pads and the reach are best so far.  A bit pricey for what you get, but the thing is just what I needed.  Pads are huge; so expensive lotions/ointments require them to be cut smaller for regular use, but that works too.  Have only had for a week, but would buy again.  Wish I had bought earlier.</li>
    <li> Great idea!  Works as expected - has a tendency to twist around so you have to hold it really tightly.</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It is somewhat difficult to bend the applicator to reach certsin places and it doesn&#x27;t stay in that position for long</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my elderly sister who has skin rashes and needed lotion on her back but lives alone.  She loves the sponges that can be washed out, which by the way are hypoallergenic.  She likes the flexibility of the handle and was thankful to get so many pads with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this ! Finally I can reach my back without hurting my shoulder.</li>
    <li> On time, expected quality</li>
    <li> Very nice assistive device to use when your flexibility or mobility is not up to snuff.  Well made and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing ever invented. I had surgery on my lower back this summer and it is still hard to bend over. This does the trick to put lotion on my legs and feet. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> very satisfactory product</li>
    <li> I love this applicator. The pads are a good size for applying lotions, creams or oils. Spinal fusion to my neck and back make it extremely difficult for me bend or rotate my body.I can now reach my feet and back easily. The Velcro keeps the pad securely attached to the wand. the 10 pads that come with the wand should last me for over a year and I love that I can order additional pads when needed.</li>
    <li> satisfied with product, it is very hard to find an item like this, ordering and shipping was exceptional</li>
    <li> If you have ever had an itch on your back that you couldn&#x27;t scratch, this lotion applicator is for you.  It&#x27;s perfect and comes with a good supply of sponges for application of lotion.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in excellent condition.  It performs well and exactly as  the description.  The applicator allows me to apply lotion to the difficult to reach areas of my back.</li>
    <li> very adustable and easy to use</li>
    <li> doent bend very good but not a problem for me.. very soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than the other applicators with roller balls.  Having to wash it after each use is a bit of a pain but I just leave the applicator attached and hang in the shower to dry.  Uses more lotion than applying by hand but the convenience is worth it.  Is a little awkward&lt;br /&gt;to reach  below the shoulder blades.</li>
    <li> This would work better if the handle would remain in one position. I have bent the handle for optimum use for me and it returns to a straighter mode.</li>
    <li> Its for my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The handle is not adjustable and for my legs not long enough to reach my entire foot. The pads spread lotion pretty well, and the handle is tough and well made but not long enough for a tall person.</li>
    <li> The best for applying lotion to your back.</li>
    <li> Got here fast etc. but the wand is not curved like the picture so it can be hard to get some spots on your back.  But its better than nothing or burning.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit of doing to get this working properly, but once I got the hang of it I found that it works well.  The sponges wash easily for re-use, too.</li>
    <li> does not bend easily even when warm but it does have some advantages like the placement of the valcro sotne pad sticks well</li>
    <li> The body reach has been working so great for me. It helps apply lotion in areas I can&#x27;t reach. What I wish it had was a cover for the sponge to make it easier during travel</li>
    <li> I found the length of the wand a little troublesome as it was wobbly.  The pads don&#x27;t hold the lotion well.</li>
    <li> Much better than other applicators I have tried. Well worth the money and the extra pads a definite plus. I had major back surgery and this works very well to reach my back and legs. The other &amp;#34;roller ball&amp;#34;-type applicators are a waste of money...clog, hurt from rolling so hard to try to release lotion (and tried many different lotions), inflexible...can&#x27;t reach around to back of legs. This one is the best out there.</li>
    <li> This works just great! And the pad is removable and washable. In addition, there are extra pads which saves having to send in for replacements for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I did not order this product at this time</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Stays put when you use it, has a nice (18&amp;#34;) reach; sponge is detachable, washable, and it has a nice cord to hang in my bathroom when I need it.  Thank you!  I only wish I had invented this product!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to reach areas on your back if you can reach your hand very pleased with was recommended I use it to put on the lotion on my back.</li>
    <li> I am totally pleased with this product.  Everything that I wanted.  It makes applying lotion to my back so easy.  If you clean it after every use it will last a very long time.  Applicator pads can also be used on both sides.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have tried and this product is by far superior. The only drawback I see is that it does not stay bent like I want it. Maybe I should have ordered the longer version. The velcro section that holds the pads is really nice, hold the very nice think pads in place. No issues at all. The pads are very high quality and do not waste lotion at all. I finally have a solution to my dry skin on my back.</li>
    <li> My mother was suffering with very dry skin on her hard-to-reach back area. The skin became so irritated that it began to bleed.  After a brief search, I found this tool for her.  It was exactly what she needed.  She uses it with moisturizing soap to wash her back.  When she gets out of the shower, she applies moisturizing cream to her back with the same sponge.  It&#x27;s easy to use and she&#x27;s very pleased with the results. Her back is healed and she continues to use this tool.  It&#x27;s a clever design and should last a long time since there are several sponges included in the kit.</li>
    <li> This item makes lotion application so much easier.  I wish I had purchased this sooner.</li>
    <li> Awesome is the only word that can describe this. Love it. Have recommended this to everyone I know. Works just as described.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom who no longer has the flexibility to apply lotion to her back. She is thrilled with the product and no longer suffers from dry skin itch.</li>
    <li> This lotion applicator is wonderful.  the refil pads stay in place they can be washed out and they spread the lotion better than any applicator I have had before</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else.  The pads are easy to remove and clean.  Since the pads don&#x27;t absorb the lotion, I had to work a little harder to get the lotion rubbed into my bad, but that&#x27;s okay.  I do wish the wand would stay flexed when I bend it, but it seems to slowly go back to its originally straight position.  All that aside, I really do love this applicator and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t retain shape which was extremely difficult to bend into place in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly didn&#x27;t do for someone who is physically disabled.</li>
    <li> Could not find a body reach lotion applicator locally. My dermatologist did not have one either. This works great. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It bends, but needs to be tweaked a bit each time.</li>
    <li> Going to be Christmas gifts for good friends this year.</li>
    <li> Reaches those hard-to-reach places in the middle of the back. I&#x27;m not very flexible, so the center of my back isn&#x27;t reachable without this applicator. The only drawback is if you get any lotion on your hands before picking it up, good luck hanging on to it. It&#x27;s harder to get your hands on than a greased pig at the county fair. That&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t get a 5th star. Works to perfection otherwise.</li>
    <li> I bought to apply sun burn cooling lotion after burning my back. It doesn&#x27;t stay bent like others say but it does stay in position I think long enough to get the job done. I think they might be calling this accident a feature. A slight bow in a non bending handle I think would cover 99% of the jobs this thing would be needed for plus give you the strength to really dig in if needed. Pads are just cotton faced soft foam. They wash out pretty easily by hand.</li>
    <li> Appears all the lotion soaks back into the sponge. On my back where I used it was the only place I burnt.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  I have a need to apply different medications to hard to reach areas of may back.  This does the job nicely, and with the changeable pads, the applications never get mixed.</li>
    <li> Purchased for 90 year old mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> For dermatology patients or people with shoulder problems, this is a God-send.  It&#x27;s a perfect way to apply medication or cream to areas which are impossible to reach.</li>
    <li> A man is first choice to apply back lotion, but this is a fabulous number two.  Easy to use, reaches entire back, gets rid of all those annoying itches!</li>
    <li> I am disabled and have limited range of motion in my arms. This helps me to be able to apply lotion to my back and feet by myself without having to ask someone to help me.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality of the product and the extra pads that came with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the loofah pad for my wife to use in the shower.She has RA and bad shoulders. It would be ok for creams but when wet and soapy the handle has no grip and it slips and she can not scrub her back.</li>
    <li> Loving this!  Works well.  I use it to apply lotion on my back when there is no one else around who can help.</li>
    <li> The applicator reached perfectly around my back and the back of my thighs, which are hard to reach because of arthritis. Get one, you&#x27;ll be so happy!&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are wonderful quality and each one will last you for quite a while. There are several lengths available for the wand, so everyone should be able to find a length that works for them.&lt;br /&gt; I bought an applicator with detachable heads from another company, but the prongs that attached the heads to their wand broke off after a short time, and I am not able to use any of the attachments now.  The semi-flex also has attachments available, so I might try some of them.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to reach the spot to apply the medication. I will think about getting a second one for the road.</li>
    <li> I love this &amp;#34;Body Wand&amp;#34;!!! It is very well made and allows me to finally reach those difficult spots and apply lotion to my back. It feels so good to be able to stop the itching. The wand is sturdy and the handle is easy to grip and comfortable to use. The pads are fairly large and allow me to really get lotion where I need it most. The pads  are easy to wash and are reusable. When I first bought this product, I was having problems bending the wand. I wrote a comment to that effect. I was shocked when I received a  telephone call from Brian who works for Reachmate Plus, the company that sells this product a couple of days after I submitted my comment to Amazon. He wanted to address my concerns directly. Brian told me that the wand is virtually unbreakable and that all I needed to do was apply a little more pressure to bend it to my preferred shape for best use. I talked to him for a while about the product. It is made in the USA. You can buy optional attachments like a loofah and mirror. I am so impressed by this company. They go so far beyond just providing adequate customer service. I think it has been forever since I have received a direct phone call from a caring person in a company who wanted to directly address my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who has ever failed at trying to apply lotion to their back without any help.</li>
    <li> Makes applying lotion to the top center of your back SO EASY...  like this much better than the mini-roller version I had.</li>
    <li> Not as flexible as I would like but otherwise it works well enough.</li>
    <li> Helps to put that sunblock on my back!!</li>
    <li> Very durable, so so in reaching my back</li>
    <li> This works great.  The only thing I did not realize is that they come with different length handles, and although this one is fine, I would have probably gone for the longer handled one as I have limited range of motion in my shoulders. It works very efficiently.</li>
    <li> I used to use the roller style, but found they don&#x27;t last long.  The swivel would lose its lock position and it would swivel in directions that didn&#x27;t work for arm positions without my being a contortionist.&lt;br /&gt;So.  I tried this style and am really loving it!  It&#x27;s much easier to get an even spread of lotion all over my back..  The pads are long lasting and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this to apply cream to my back and it works just great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product features of which you won&#x27;t find in any other product I have researched......I use this to apply lotion to my back and have used it for years.....this was an extra because I never want to be without it.  You certainly can wash the sponges for reuse and I have a supply of extra sponges.  This 18&amp;#34; is plenty long enough and it bends.  This is a product I never want to be without.</li>
    <li> Since I live alone it&#x27;s great for me</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works really good.</li>
    <li> By far, thebest body reach ever!</li>
    <li> Works great for me as I do not have total flex-ability.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Mind you, I am upgrading from a paper towel folded up and taped to the end of a wooden back scratcher lol. But this thing is awesome! The pads are great, easy to wash and reuse. Some reviewers complain that it&#x27;s not bendable. I could care less about it bending. It reaches the back of my shoulder blades, and to me that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  I like the fact that you can change the pads when they get worn out.  Its easy to reach with and does the trick.  I had to ask my husband to apply lotion to my back all the time.  Now I can do it by myself and its so convenient and helps with the dry itchy skin.  I even use it for my legs.  It washes out easily.  I purchased other types of  lotion applicators that did not work well.  I am so glad I found this.  Its lightweight and easy to use. I plan to purchase a couple for my girlfriends.  I may even purchase the longer handle one for my husband.</li>
    <li> Great to put lotion on my back. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Somewhat difficult to bend the handle, but it stays put when finally shaped the way you want it. There is a small velcro dot at the top of the handle that allows a smaller surface area. This was valuable to me because I use it to apply an expensive cream medication for my back. I live alone and do not have anyone to do it for me.</li>
