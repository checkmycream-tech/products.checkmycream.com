<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the first bar soap I&#x27;ve used outside of the stuff you get from a big box store, like Target....and I&#x27;m never going back. This stuff is great. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave any dry/filmy type feel. I don&#x27;t even use cologne hardly any more because this stuff smells strong enough and the scent seems to last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve been using this nearly daily and it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll get two months of use out of this before I have to re-order. Looking forward to trying a different scent next!</li>
    <li> I was visiting a small town in VA with my wife for my B-Day and went into a very cool small shop and found this wonderful soap. Mistral is by far is the best smelling sandalwood soap I have ever used. Excellent quality and long lasting smell. Really cleans my skin with no left over residue that most soaps leave. I got it for #10.00 + shipping. Well worth it. I paid $17.00 + tax for it from the store in VA. Will buy more!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This soap and &amp;#34;Musgo Real&amp;#34; are my two favorite mens soaps and you guys out there will love the manly scent however to some it may be somewhat flowery smelling. Not too strong but somewhat pricey. I will only buy this soap when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful and lathers well. I will buy it again for my husband.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this for me, I am not sure they should be aimed as &#x27;men&#x27; it is a nice sandalwoody earthy scent that women can appreciate too. I like scents that are non-cloying, green lemony earthy and that is unfortunately difficult to find without either going for something aimed at another gender or purchasing expensive brands.. recently after purchasing a half a dozen ivory shower gels for around $20 bucks to dump them all in exactly six bubble baths I think that going for something that one likes is better than saving money and really hating the best part of your day.. .. the seller also enclosed a gift nail file so that was a nice surprise..</li>
    <li> Really great and long lasting scent, all the office personnel has said very nice things about the scent</li>
    <li> This soap is great! I was a little skeptical at first, but based on the reviews I decided to try it. And man, it did not disappoint! I think my wife loves it more than I do. And man, the smell is long lasting. You can still smell it on my after 8 hours. Price is high, but I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the bamboo scent. Soap was ok</li>
    <li> Great scent, great lather. The bar really is a lot bigger than you expect, so you do get a lot of bang for your buck. I have bought all of their scents and this is my favorite. The Teak Wood scent is a close second.</li>
    <li> Great soap!  If you think $10 is too much to spend on soap, maybe you should evaluate how you smell.  I don&#x27;t mean that as an insult.  Really, how do you smell?  If your a man like I am, you don&#x27;t want to smell like a farm animal, but you also don&#x27;t want to smell like you just left a strip club.  I&#x27;m not into flowery smelling soaps, and I&#x27;m not a big fan of a strong chemical smelling soap.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like a grandmother, a pimp, or a lonely soul who has chocolate looking marks on his shirt form a mid-day visit to the VIP room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has a great light scent, which isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  It suds up well, and creates a nice lather.</li>
    <li> Just opened it today smells great. I have used Mistral soap for sometime there is none better.</li>
    <li> Great but too expensive</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> If you like sandalwood soap, you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
    <li> I can confirm that this soap is so manly that it will grow chest hair</li>
    <li> This is fast becoming one of my favorite body soap bars. Great lather, leaves you feeling clean, and the scent is not as strong as the Mistral Black Amber soap, and no where near as floral but a good scent none the less. Showering twice a day this soap lasts about three weeks to one month, it does not take much to get alot of lather even in the harsh hard water I have.</li>
    <li> As a soap, this is quite good.  We use softened water and it lathers and rinses well.  Leaves skin very soft and the fragrance lasts several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s the first of my problems: the fragrance.  This soap smells like the 70&#x27;s.  It reminds me of Brut.  I&#x27;m into retro fragrances, but this one rubs me the wrong way somehow.  I don&#x27;t dislike it enough to not use the rest of the bar, but I won&#x27;t purchase this scent again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second problem is the size of the bar.  On the one hand, you think \\&quot;great value\\&quot; but the thing is so big that it&#x27;s hard to use and I have large, man&#x27;s hands.  But the biggest issue with the size is that it&#x27;s absolutely too large for any soap container I can find.  If you share your shower with family, you&#x27;re going to want to protect your $10 soap from getting wet and wasted by kids and wives, but nothing fits.  Even cutting the bar in half wouldn&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s too high/thick for the containers to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will try this brand of soap again, but not this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2/15:  This soap lasted for 58 showers.  I will say that over the two months of use, the smell grew on me a bit, so I&#x27;ll add a star to the review.  It&#x27;s still not my favorite, and I did not buy again, but I didn&#x27;t find it as objectionable as I first feared I would.  I replaced the bar with the Teak scent, which I like much better.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: ....Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Perfume[Fragrance], Alpha-isomethyl Ionone (banned by IFRA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rather not wash myself with carcinogens, thanks.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this brand. The smell is super powerful and really wakes you up in the morning. It is very invigorating, nice masculine smell too. The bar really isnt too bad with the price either when you factor in its size. This thing is the size of a brick! so dont feel bad about paying that for a bar of soap, it will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Mistral soaps are very high quality.  It may seem expensive for a bar of soap, but they are larger than average bars.  Also the soap and smell are very concentrated so that it only takes a small amount of soap to wash with, and the smell does not fade after weeks or months of use.  I have used this,  the exotic vetiver, and the blue one (cant remember the name) and This is definately my favorite.  Smells clean and classy without being fruity, flowery, or overpowering.</li>
    <li> Lathers well, washes off well, softens skin, feels clean, moisturizes well, stays hard even when left in the shower in a wet dish.  The price is kind of high but its a large bar and lasts a long time since it doesn&#x27;t soften up...&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few other scents from Mistral, and this is by far the best, don&#x27;t bother with the others, this is a great scent, it makes my entire master bedroom smell great after a hot shower...</li>
    <li> I thought that this soap wouldn&#x27;t be worth the cost.... but let me tell you, it is worth the cost.... This is the only soap my son and I will use. It lathers well and last quite a while... the bonus is the fact that it smells great!</li>
    <li> This soap has a wonderful smell - makes the whole bathroom fragrant! Hard-milled bar lasts a very long time, making the price worth it. My husband really likes this and makes sure we always have an extra bar on hand.</li>
    <li> Very large bar, I mean BIG compared to my normal sized Dove Soap.  I&#x27;ve always used Dove because it didn&#x27;t  really have a smell but that&#x27;s exactly why I wanted to change to something else.  The Sandalwood Bamboo just seems to strong for my test, but the scent lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to smells, this might be too strong for your taste as well.</li>
    <li> This is a big thick bar of soap that last a long time.It is a little costly but it lathers great and rinses clean, and what a wonderful smell ! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I bought this soap and the teak wood one. They were both good, but this one smell a lot better though. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it, it is worth the $$$ since it last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Probably a little too expensive but I like the smell and it lasts more than a month.  My face and body feel so clean and I would prefer to use this product over the cheap versions out there.  My skin does not feel dry and it didn&#x27;t have trouble with the extra cold winter by drying out.  Can&#x27;t top that!</li>
    <li> A great productand fast service!</li>
    <li> big a** bar soap  does the job  if you got small hands  it feels like a brick  chop it in half to fit</li>
    <li> This is a HUGE bar of soap that lasts and lasts. The sandalwood aroma is present without being overbearing. The lather is always rich and plentiful and it does leave my skin feeling clean without stripping it and drying it out, an important consideration in the dry climate of winter Montana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the size of the bar helps compensate for the price but if you don&#x27;t have large hands or use a washcloth or similar it can also be a bit awkward to use until it has worn down a bit.</li>
    <li> This soap was a tough decision for me.  Spending $10 on a bar of soap seemed to be a bit much. But!  It was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is a brick and last a fair amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers great, more than a normal bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic, leaving you and your bathroom fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first of three that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;The black Amber is pretty awesome too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to smell good and be clean, I would say do it.</li>
    <li> Large bar, and lasts for about 2 months.  Probably would not buy again just due to price, but liked the scent.</li>
    <li> Soap has a pleasant odor and leaves no residue on skin. A it bulky but it does reduce in size with use.</li>
    <li> Simply the BEST! it&#x27;s luxurious PRICEY But worth it. Did I mentioned that this bar of soap is B I G? This soap cannot fit in one of those regular soap containers and Yeah it&#x27;s that big! This soap I bought lasted me 5 months of everyday showering and the whole bath room smells wonderful each time after you&#x27;re done showering, the scent of this soap STICK S with you for the rest of the day. Whoever made this soap really knows what they&#x27;re doing and spent a lot of time doing their research love and care making this soap. Oh before I forgot to mention, this soap is Made In France, imported and you know how the French makes of things &amp; knowing they&#x27;re European....They don&#x27;t skimp when it comes to quality because it&#x27;s what they are: They ALWAYS wanted to have the VERY BEST of things just like any Western european countries like Germany Sweden Spain Norway. I fully recommend this soap to anyone, don&#x27;t worry about the price because you pay a high price for TOP QUALITY products and with this soap...You get what you paid for which is nothing but Quality!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic, lathers well, and just feels....luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey, but as others have said, it&#x27;s worth the money and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I took a star off because I didn&#x27;t feel it was as gentle on skin as it implies/as it gets worn down, but it really does just feel and smell amazing.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this soap.  Great smell, gets you clean, large size bar lasts for a long time.  Shipping is always fast, and easy.</li>
    <li> Great aroma to the soap and a great texture.  My only problem is that it&#x27;s so big.  At 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;, I have big hands and this bar of soap is a bit too bit.  In spite of being large and a bit difficult to handle, it should last me quite a while.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for that manly woody kind of smell.  Definitely has that edge that one&#x27;s grandfather might have liked.  My wife used it and said it &amp;#34;smells like a man&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of sandalwood, and it is not overwhelming in any way. It seems to last me quiet a while and a whole lot longer than the regular soaps. I can safely say with daily use it lasts me at least a month. I tend to have sensitive skin and this is quiet gentle to say the least.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap! This is a triple milled soap so it is a nice dense bar of soap and seems to last a long time compared to the store bought bands. And it doesn&#x27;t get all mushy in the shower....it stays hard. It lathers up extremely well, cleans well, and rinses off completely....and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought four different Mistral soaps and this is the first bar I am using. I will say that the scent for the sandelwood is rather light. In fact it is lighter than your standard store bought brand of dial, irish spring, etc. I would like a bit stronger scent. It may be that there are differences between lots as this is not large volume production soap or perhaps my particular bar sat on the shelf for awhile and the scent decreased. The scent between the different bars of soap I bought does appear to vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I give the soap 4 stars and would buy again</li>
    <li> I order two varieties of this soap, and threw the Black Amber scent away- it was WAY to strong.&lt;br /&gt;This one however, is very nice.  The soap bars are HUGE.  Kind of looking forward to it wearing down a bit so its easier to use.  (I may cut them in half next time.)</li>
    <li> lathers great, mild scent, long lasting...</li>
    <li> Well made, dense soap that lathers nicely.  I switched back from gel soaps that were getting to &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or had lost natural scents.  Mistrel&#x27;s soaps are quality and they last. No soap scum, nice scent.</li>
    <li> A good buy!  The block of soap is a little too big to hold comfortably - but that problem goes away with use!</li>
    <li> Great scent. At first when I opened it I thought, &amp;#34;Wow this is overpowering,&amp;#34; but it really mellows after the first use. It is a real refreshing scent and makes a great lather. Would definitely recommend to a friend and I plan on repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This soap is truly great. It&#x27;s huge so it lasts about 2~3 months, even with daily showers. Most importantly, it washes body well and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap....has a wonderful sandalwood fragrance and the bar is&lt;br /&gt;such a large bar....lasts forever.....purchased from Amazon....have purchased quite&lt;br /&gt;a few items from Amazon...always get such great products, great products and fast&lt;br /&gt;shipping...</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Smells the bathroom up nicely.  REAL man smell.  Probably my new favorite soap.  The bar is also pretty darn huge.</li>
    <li> Okay but a bit expensive. You can buy better liquid soaps for the price.</li>
    <li> Great soap!  Really nice scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  Great Lather, and I feel very clean when I&#x27;m done showering.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s also a huge bar of soap.  I think mine lasted me about a month with daily showers.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending this much per month on soap, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> If you are a big cologne guy or a big aftershave guy, you might love this bar of stink.  However, for me it was way too strong and smelly and I ended up throwing it out after two uses.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of sandalwood.  Yet this bar of soap doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  It lathers well, the suds are great. I&#x27;ve used it each night for two weeks now before writing this review.  But getting the sandalwood scent is hard to do.  I&#x27;ll look for another soap that smells like sandalwood and not give me that blank stare.</li>
    <li> I made the move from body wash back to bar soap (which I haven&#x27;t used since I was kid taking baths) as I had to use a bar of Ivory soap when I ran out of body wash on the ship and I feel in love with the way your skin feels and decided it was time for a change.  I am after purchasing over 200$ worth of soap in the last 6 months trying to find &amp;#34;the perfect bar&amp;#34; and then I found Mistral.  On a whim, I ordered a bar (Black Amber) and loved the lather and the fact how long it lasted but wasn&#x27;t 100% keen on the scent.  I decided then to buy the rest of their scent lineup for men, and loved this scent the most. The scent is amazing.. I love it.. very earthy and masculine without the hippie overtones.  The bar lasts me a little over a month with 2 daily showers and I&#x27;ve used it in both hard and soft water and find it never leaves a film and never dries my skin out.  I&#x27;m not sure why others say this leaves a filmly residue.. heck, it doesnt&#x27; even make my skin oily a few hours after showering (unlike ALL body washes I&#x27;ve used).  But I also respect we all have different skin types, and mine is your typical Gaelic Caucasian skin that never tans a day in it&#x27;s life span, if that helps.</li>
    <li> Not sure if its cleaning me or not, but the smell first thing in the morning is phenomenal. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> A French soap for a manly Man? Indeed. It&#x27;s a big bar of soap. It lathers really well. It has a manly Bamboo smell (but not overpowering). This bar of soap is really good and worthy of the price point but at the end of the day I prefer the Mistral Teakwood soap.</li>
    <li> I have been moving toward more natural soaps and have had some great experiences, but this soap was not one of them.  First, it is NOT all natural as the fragrance is definitely man made.  It does NOT smell anything like sandalwood and the smell is very similar to an Axe body wash.  I decided to try this soap because it was an Amazon top seller and I love sandalwood.  I hate, I hate, I HATE this soap.  I smell like a shady guy that runs a pawn shop somewhere or a man whore.  I am very particular.  Loved the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood.  This one was a total waste of ten bucks plus shipping.  I will be throwing it out after one use.  Very disappointed!  Taylor of Old Bond Street, Old Man Murray&#x27;s, and River Soap Company all make soaps that I have purchased trough Amazon and have been very happy with, but this stuff is far too cologneie (yes, I know that&#x27;s not a word).</li>
    <li> It dries out my skin a little but then all soaps do to some extent. I have tried and reviewed many and this is thee best one yet.</li>
    <li> nice big bar of soap so you are getting closer to 3 normal bars. not too perfumed and works great no residue.</li>
    <li> Least favourite scent between cedarwood,this and teakwood</li>
    <li> Great soap and great smell. The smell is not to strong.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap, the sandalwood fragrance is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Smells Nice and doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
    <li> Item as described and fast shipping - recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my second Mistral mens soap.  I used the Cedarwood Marine prior to this one.  The Cedarwood lasted longer on my skin scent wise than this sandalwood.  The sandalwood is not at all overwhelming.  I wish it was stronger sandalwood smell wise.  I also wish it lasted longer on my skin.  Still a great soap that has lasted almost 4 months.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of this soap! I got it as a gift for my boyfriend and he has decided it&#x27;s all he is using for now on. The scent is a little woody without much musk and is the perfect level of strength. My main concern was that it may end up being overpowering, but it is not at all. It builds up a creamy lather and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any oily residue like some others that we have tried. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I like the Teakwood better</li>
    <li> Bought this soap for my husband and I can&#x27;t stop sniffing him. Way hotter than Axe.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a luxury break from your standard bar of soap, this soap lathers thick, lasts long, and leaves the skin without residue. The scent is mild, sandalwood that leaves a detectable smell at arms length for a few hours and by day&#x27;s end a hair&#x27;s length from the skin. The fragnance is much more sophisticated than your traditional body wash. A classic smell without leaving you smelling like an old man.</li>
    <li> Love the smell... Smells like man.I just have mad sensitive skin,  which this soap leaves me with dry skin. Not as bad as like Dial soap, but enough to were I need lotion, but not dry enough to were I would never use this brand again. I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I bought these soaps as gifts for my sons. They love the scent, don&#x27;t know yet how they hold up.</li>
    <li> Delivery was within the scheduled time; packing was appropriate; and the general form, fit, and function of the product was as described.</li>
    <li> Excellent bar of soap.  It is definitely good sized.</li>
    <li> Buy IT!!!!! Price is good and the product is excellent. Great idea not only for you, but also for Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap to relax during the filming of Southern dysComfort (www.southerndyscomfortmovie.com) to relax; it was a gift from the director:) It really is a stress reliever.&lt;br /&gt;Michael Alton Lowder</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the soap.  I think it will last long, which for the price is a plus.  The reason I gave it 3 stars, though is that despite what others have commented, it feels just like other soaps when rinsing off and it does seem to have somewhat of a film left.  You&#x27;re not feeling as smooth and soft as some have said.  From my experience, I don&#x27;t feel like this is a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> The price was a bit of a deterant but I bought and really like the smell, great in the morning and smelling when stepping into the shower. The bar was bigger than I thought and should last awhile, glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this soap. The bar is a good size, it seems to last a long time, it smells fantastic, lathers well, and it does a great job of cleaning. I have tried a lot of sandalwood soaps and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love the soap.  Nice fragrance and very good lather.  Leaves you feeling very clean.  I am going to buy more bars.</li>
    <li> It seems that most men&#x27;s soaps, especially liquids, try real hard to throw a ton of scent on you and hope it sticks. Inevitably, it rinses off right there in the shower. This stuff has real staying power, though, and it&#x27;s not a crummy artificial smell. Its cleaning power is also great, and doesn&#x27;t leave you dry. It&#x27;s all about those oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this stuff may seem expensive at first glance, but the bar is huge and it lasts a very long time. You&#x27;ll probably wind up spending more on your-favorite-brand-name-soap at your-favorite-brand-name-local-store than you will buying one of these.</li>
    <li> Kinda expensive but smells good. Lasts about 2 months, so about the same cost as body wash. Kinda wish it was transparent, but what can you do?</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the softer skin. My family stands beside me after my shower just to get the aroma. LOL</li>
    <li> This soap makes my entire bathroom smell good for half hour. It lasts quite awhile and it lathers nicely. Does not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price.  Worked fine as a soap but the scent was overwhelming and not particularly pleasant.  The scent clung to me all day long.  Not a keeper.</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful.  I was hesitant on ordering it because I had never smelled it in person, but I think this will be the soap I stick with for life.</li>
    <li> Definitely a manly mans scent.</li>
    <li> i love sandalwood and i realize there are different types/scents.  this soap is terrible.  you can barely smell the sandalwood, and what u can smell is like a very cheap aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;literally threw it away because it wasn&#x27;t even worth holding onto it to do carving.</li>
    <li> smell great and last long</li>
    <li> Quality good, but a bit high priced compared to others. Not a strong sandalwood aroma.  Will try others next time.</li>
    <li> You can smell something really nice as soon as you open your box. The scent of this soap is very aromatic and nice, and also the scent is staying on your skin after shower for like a day. Some people asked me like if I just finished shower. Very good and reasonable price stuff !! Five STARS!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, not overpowering and the bars last a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are soap aficionados and this brand is by far the best we have tried.  It is long lasting, leaves skin feeling clean and not dried out, and all their fragrances are heavenly.  Will continue to purchase as long as they don&#x27;t change their formula!</li>
    <li> The soap bar looks like great quality and although the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite I will try the others as well.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome, smells great, strong woodsy scent that stays around subtly throghout the day. it is a LARGE bar of soap, has laste dover a month so far and seems that I have not even put a dent in it</li>
    <li> I do not care for this soap.&lt;br /&gt;The scent quickly fades.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves me with an itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does not offer all day long odor protection.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a bit hesitant to pay $10 for a bar of soap, but based on the reviews here I took the plunge, and I am very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the cost. I did hesitate on purchasing, only because...it&#x27;s soap. But, I have to say this soap is worth it. The bar&#x27;s pretty big, which means it will defintitely outlast any of those regular guys. And, it doesn&#x27;t disappear as quickly, either. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and there is only the slightest decrease in size. I estimate that one bar will last me about a month, perhaps more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent - This soap is everything that your run of the mill bargain soaps are not. The scent is wonderful, and smells masculine without being overpowering. And, as others have commented, it makes the bathroom smell great, and the scent does stay with me for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance - I am extremely satisified with this soap. It lathers up very well, much more so than the cheap soaps I had been using, and it does not dry out my skin in the winter like other soaps do. Since I started using this brand, my &amp;#34;winter itch&amp;#34; has all but subsided! Loving this soap, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to switch to anything else anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;ve always viewed soap as a commodity, akin to gasoline or apples, do yourself a favor and splurge a little. You will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> A great soap: mild, manly fragrance, very rich lather, excellent cleansing attributes, dries quickly (and therefore suited for travel), gentle on the skin. Note: its a big bar of soap, just a bit unwieldy at the beginning. Used daily (two washes), a bar lasted for just over a month - very reasonable for a bar of soap. I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I like this soap because it lathers really well. It leaves no annoying residue. You will feel very clean afterward. And it smell so good. Yes I like my soaps and aftershaves and colognes to smell like a man should smell. This soap will not empower you to lead a nation to war, but it may bring you into the civility you so desire. Very balanced.</li>
    <li> Smells quite manly. A strong manly woodsy musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigger than your palm and quite solid meaning it&#x27;s packed tight and won&#x27;t crumble so it will probably last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is all over my bathroom and doesn&#x27;t dissipate after use like most soaps do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin either</li>
    <li> I like this soap. I&#x27;ve been using standard Doves or whatever that you can buy in bulk packs for years now and decided to upgrade my skin care recently. This has a pleasant smell, in fact I wish the scent lasted longer once out of the shower. It IS big, when first unwrapped and put in the shower, you have to be careful not to drop it on your foot. Does seem to last a long time though. All around, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I liked it.  I don&#x27;t wear cologne and was hoping this would smell strong enough to give me at least a mild scent (without going down the cologne road).  It doesn&#x27;t - but still a good soap, lasts much longer than regular, small, standard men&#x27;s soap.</li>
    <li> just a soap, leaves your skin dry.....nothing special about it, definitely not worth it</li>
    <li> I got one of these bars a few months ago and thought the aroma was a bit weak.  Then I used it and found that it was not overwhelming in a good way and that the mild wonderful scent lasted to the bitter end of the bar.  The sandalwood is a nice masculine thing and it lingers on me and in the bathroom.  This is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent without being overpowering. Very clean smelling.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent, transports me back to the candle-friendly days of the 70&#x27;s. Fits right in with my lava lamp and blacklight in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> smells good and works well</li>
    <li> Just became my go to brand.  Will have to buy the others scents.</li>
    <li> amazing best soap Ive ever used</li>
    <li> Nasty stuff waste of money</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that my husband uses, He likes how it lathers and I love how he smells after he uses it. I have had to buy several as gifts for some men because of how wonderful it smells. Not sweet but very masculine. It last much longer than regular soaps.and the size is quite large.</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic!! The aroma it left on my skin was amazing after I showered.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> More of a floral scent than woodsy sandalwood. Lathers well but leaves my skin feeling dry afterwards. Also, it&#x27;s a rather large bar, but if you don&#x27;t find a container large enough to house it there will be noticeable reduction in volume from sitting in your shower (surprisingly so for what I expected to be  a hard soap). I&#x27;ve had mine just about two weeks and it&#x27;s already more than half gone.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this soap and I like how it makes him and the bathroom smell.  We&#x27;ve tried other sandalwood soaps that weren&#x27;t nearly as scented or didn&#x27;t really smell like sandalwood.  It&#x27;s also a big bar that lasts a long time.  This is my go to add on for Amazon orders when i need a few more bucks for free shipping.  Hubby likes that he always has another bar when he uses one up ;)</li>
    <li> This soap is huge! Unfortunately tho it does not last as long as some people claim it does, unless they shower once  every 2 weeks or something &amp; make it last a few months. If you&#x27;re someone that showers at least once a day like me, I&#x27;d say it should last a good 2 weeks. It lathers up great &amp; has a unique fancy manly smell. It&#x27;s not too strong &amp; leaves the skin nice &amp; clean without any greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Great bar. Very big and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My whole bathroom smells nice after I shower, plus I&#x27;ve been getting a few compliments here and there about how nice I smell. I&#x27;m hoping this lasts a while, it&#x27;s definitely worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I smell damn good after showering with this.  Not overpowering, but still there.  And the bar lasts forever.  I get about 2 months out of each one so the price comes out to be not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> I am neutral on it, which considering the cost is not that great of a feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong with it, but nothing great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not as strong or long lasting as I thought it would be, and it is a little drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: I raised my rating as it lasted so long it was a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Incredible fresh woodsy fragrance.</li>
    <li> Good soap and strong sandalwood odor that stays on one&#x27;s body. This is an excellent product that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Superb soaps! Get four direct from Mistral and save shipping.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best quality soap bar I&#x27;ve owned.  It has a consistent aroma throughout the entire bar and it left my skin softer and silky more than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why bring up the popular soaps you typically get at the grocery or walmart stores when there is no comparison.  See it and believe it for yourself by purchasing this soap.</li>
