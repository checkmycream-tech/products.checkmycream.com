<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this cream works great it made my skin so soft took away dry skin. i loved it great value and great prduct .i loved how it was not oily and gressey</li>
    <li> Does not work as described nor even close. Still cannot figure out how this is a filler.  If I did not get this so cheap, it would definitely be going back as a waste of money.</li>
    <li> great feel for a fill in</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all.  No better than the primers I already  have.  Photos shown on advert are probably photoshopped because it certainly doesn&#x27;t work like it shows on there.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love  this product. It makes my skinn feel silky  smooth.  You have to dab it don&#x27;t rub it in. I highly  recommend  it!!</li>
    <li> No better than just using ponds, maybe not even as good...Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> Useless product! I have fairly nice skin for my age and thought this might help with a few wrinkled ares. I saw absolutely NO difference in the appearance of my skin after application except that it sort iof rolls off your skin. I like some of the other products, but this one is not worth bothering with.</li>
    <li> Maybe I am using this wrong but I just don&#x27;t see the difference like the product pictures show in the description. I am only 31 years old so my lines are very fine. I used this on my forehead a few times trying to achieve a smoothed result but it failed every time. I can say that it does feel smooth on the skin but for filling in any kind of wrinkles it just didn&#x27;t work; at least not for me. The product is thicker than a moisturizer (more like crisco). I did attempt to apply more thinking that was the problem but when I apply more I get a pilling up of product whenever any thing rubs on that area.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product !!</li>
    <li> Just wonderful for your skin been using this for years love it.</li>
    <li> Im giving it 1 star because it came delivered to me in a sealed box from Amazon. But, unlike: &amp;#34;Lightweight Wrinkle Filler Cream for Flawless Looking Complexion - Reduces Appearance of Wrinkles, Redness, Blemishes and Imperfections - Magic Finish Makeup for Glowing, Healthy Skin&lt;br /&gt;from M. Asam&amp;#34;, that I had purchased along with this. The Lightweight Wrinkle filler cream for flawless looking complexion was triple sealed, vacuum sealed inside and out, so I new for sure there was zero risk for contamination. Now when I opened the box for M. Asam Perfect Teint II, the only sealing was the tape that covered the box. It looked as if 1/3-1/4 of the actual cream was missing, like someone took their finger and just scooped it out. And seeing as how theyre both from the same company. Why would one be sealed so well, and the other not at all. What really sealed its fate, was when I opened the jars, the 1 that was triple sealed had a vacuum sealed label under the lid, the other had nothing. Pretty disguisting.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It does what it says!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says, temporarily</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> Rolled right off the skin , useless</li>
    <li> Good product - thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product I use it all over my face. It makes my foundation super easy to apply and keeps it looking fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  It makes the face look so smooth and it is a great finishing touch after  makeup has been applied.</li>
    <li> This product truly makes your skin look smooth and the wrinkles less prominent. Pair this up up M. Asam Magic Finish and you have a winner.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my face feel so good and helps with my red patches. It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the most favorite thing I have right now. I am getting older and signs of age are showing. It fills in my lines and wrinkles and makes me look at least 8 years younger. I am in love with this stuff when I am out I am going to buy more. I recommend this completely.</li>
    <li> This cream reminds me of Crisco cooking grease!  Does NOT hide wrinkles, does NOT fill in fine lines, glides on smooth but will &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; off should you rub your face.  Aside from the pleasant fragrance, this stuff is completely worthless and I am highly unsatisfied with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am horrible with finding the right skin color concealer so I decided to try this filler and concealer. I have to say it is great to use with my powder. The filler and concealer really fills and conceals my flaws leaving my skin looking soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all.  There are many other similar products that work thousand times better than this product.</li>
    <li> Helps makeup go on smoother but feels kind of weird on the face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - I love the way is looks and my skins feels. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and I some days just use this instead of applying all of my makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes. All reviews are 100% my own opinion.</li>
    <li> It pills up when you put it on so it is basically unusable.</li>
    <li> Works great as a base under makeup! I really love M. Asam Perfect Teint II on my face instead of foundation. It covers all the little fine lines around my eyes &amp; mouth. Plus I also have oily skin &amp; this does a fabulous job of controlling shine as well. Best part is a little goes a long way, I don&#x27;t have to use near as much of this concealer as I did with foundations. I put a thin layer on, then powder, &amp; then apply the rest of my makeup. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this before I put on makeup and it makes it go on so smooth.  I cannot go without it.</li>
    <li> What a great fill-in cream. Has a nice soft smell and is not greasy or super duper thick at all!!! Love how it leaves my skin feeling super soft and silky. Feels like I have not put on anything at all!! Cannot even notice my fine lines or wrinkles at all. Neutral color so your makeup will not look different when applied!!</li>
    <li> Flawless love perfect Teint II amazing makes my skin so soft and smooth especially when i put my makeup on after i would most definitely recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream, works great with my sensitive skin type and and leaves my face looking very smooth after applying my foundation.</li>
    <li> Great! I have chicken pox scars and this filler reduced them visibly. It is easy to use and blends great!</li>
    <li> I love this! Other creams I have wait and use for awhile to show results. But this shows right away. Absolutely love it</li>
    <li> feels good on the skin</li>
    <li> This product is unique and effective. I dab a tiny bit on after my makeup is done, on the areas where it works  best. I  find it works best on fine lines, not deep furrows, and also completely hides the one enlarged pore I have. I use this on my upper lip and on chin and between brows. Just a little bit - it&#x27;s immediately apparent  if you&#x27;re  using too much cause it will roll into little pieces as you&#x27;re applying it. It smells divine (fragrance disappears immediately) and there&#x27;s no other line blur product as effective! It lasts a long time cause you need only use a little. I never pay this much for other beauty products, but this is an exceptional one. I never want to be without it. Because Im a retired senior and only use it once or twice a week, I&#x27;ve had my jar for a year, even after giving a sample to one of my nurse practitioners who complimented my skin and hated her wrinkled upper lip area. I&#x27;m  69.</li>
    <li> I must join the bandwagon on these reviews.  I normally purchase this on HSN but am glad to have found it here.  When I take pictures with this on, my skin looks perfect and I have far from perfect skin.  This is the only product I can never be without.  More than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I could not wait  to use this once I received it and I&#x27;m so impressed!! I have some large pores and some wrinkles due to raising to many children I&#x27;m sure lol. This filler and concealer is great I use it with my foundation and it makes me look 10 years younger. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and then the &#x27;what&#x27;s different about you I can&#x27;t put my finger non it&#x27; saying. Thank you so much for letting try your product I&#x27;m sold and sure I will be back for more. I would recommend this to any women looking for the perfect face or the one that makes you years younger.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Filled in the creases and spots on my face and made my skin look so smooth. A great addition to my makeup routine! What a great product! Definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this cream.  It goes on easily with no reasy residue.  It makes my face feel really smooth and soft.  Love the way it works with makeup!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  goes on smoothly and really helps to fill in those wrinkles and fine lines.  makes skin feel soft and smooth.  goes great under the Magic Mask!  Will be purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> This primer is pretty thick. It seems to do the job, but it seems to leave quite a coat.  The result is quite smooth and matte.  This isn&#x27;t a bad primer, but for the money, I can do better.</li>
    <li> Really nice product! I do get tired of spending my money on things that don&#x27;t actually do what they say they are supposed to do, but this actually does what it says. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great results. No greasy/oily feel.  It does have a great scent. And I have been using it since day one of receiving it and it has helped fill in those hard to hide/cover spots.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  Fills in small wrinkle lines very well.</li>
    <li> What I liked about this is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy on my face.  I am a firm believer you have to keep your skin moisturized.  I use this in the mornings before I put on my make up.  What I have noticed is the little lines around my lips from smoking - those lines are not as noticeable. My make up also stays.  I dont have to keep applying during the day.  This is a great foundation on which to build.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this little jar of cream! I have been using it mainly on specific targeted areas where I am unfortunately seeing signs of aging,and it seems to smooth out the fine lines we all hate.i will continue to use it.not a lot of chemicals in this product,which is what I look for in cosmetics</li>
    <li> Makeup can make wrinkles show up more. This cream concealer helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles after you apply your makeup for a more even smooth finish. I just dab a little bit where I need to, on my forehead and around my eyes. It has a light pleasant scent. I love how this cream makes me look and feel younger.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something which works for my fine lines. I hate to see those fine lines around my eyes which makes me look like grandmother of my son lol. Luckily I found this cream. It is very ight on the skin. I heard good things about it. It works great. I have noticed great difference on skin. Thise fine lines are smooth out. Im so glad now.</li>
    <li> This product is a great way to make your skin look smooth, fresh, and young. It is lightweight and does not feel heavy or uncomfortable on my skin. It does a great job hiding and blending small imperfections like fineblines and spots. This is great for daily use or for special moments when you want to look picture perfect.</li>
    <li> I have forehead wrinkles from years of squinting. I like this stuff works better than concealer which you have to get to perfectly match your skin. I don&#x27;t think this stuff has the dry thick feeling of concealer, and works much better anyways.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Nice clean sent, leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I have terrible lines from years of &amp;#34;furrowing my brow&amp;#34; and this product makes them disappear!  I LOVE it!!  I wish I had found this years ago!!!  It is so easy to apply and feels light on my skin.  Anyone that has any fine lines or wrinkles should definately give this product a try!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in using this.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have found my new beauty product must have. It works just as great as some of the more expensive brands of it&#x27;s kind. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin looking young, and feeling soft. It doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; scent. I have used it for a couple of weeks and I see no signs of it clogging my pores. I have been wearing it without makeup and I feel I look great! You can use it with or without makeup if you choose. It is light weight on my face. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cake like. I love this product you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love the way this fills in all my imperfections. It makes my skin smooth and appear so smooth. A little goes a long way and I am able to wear it under my foundation. I feel like it helps my foundation stay on longer also.</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed....</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I was allowed to purchase this product to try for just .99!  This is a product I will not be able to live without.  It is WONDERFUL!  They have a new customer for life!</li>
