### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>This is undoubtedly the BEST hair straightener I have EVER used-</li>
      <li>It feels wonderful and makes my hair look great!  </li>
      <li>and though it provides great shine; the product does TRANSFER!!</li>
      <li>This is a excellent product.</li>
      <li>Lay my edges wonderfully and no greasy build up.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome!!</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>Hi just want to tell everyone this product is great!</li>
      <li>Happy I could find it again.</li>
      <li>and I am always on the look out for a product with great hold and shine without the &#x27;crunch&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Also works great for flyaways or as a holding wax for edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course, I wiped his face off and let him know that my hair gel/pomade (whatever) had rubbed off on his face, LOL.</li>
      <li>I just love it!!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>I watched and the results were amazing, so</li>
      <li>Glad I made the purchase, my order came from Amazon very quickly too!</li>
      <li>The ingredients seem relatively safe.</li>
      <li>This gel is for those who have a better texture.</li>
      <li>Hicks edges is better.</li>
      <li>makes my relaxed African-American hair smooth and shiny (kind of like a weave) when used with my flatiron.</li>
      <li>This on one of my favorite edge controls.</li>
      <li>My hair looks healthy, beautiful and has a natural shine since I have used it.</li>
      <li>This product leaves hair shiny without being oily and slicks hair without hair feeling stiff, very nice and it smells good too!  </li>
      <li>I loved this product since I was first introduced to it by my daughter, while visiting her in Los Angeles, Calif, over 10 years ago.</li>
      <li>It can smooth the toughest edges to a smooth, silky perfection!</li>
      <li>but it easily melts with heat application, almost like beeswax.</li>
      <li>AT FIRST I LIKED IT,</li>
      <li>I hope the manufacturer will continue to make Vonte Silk Effects available.</li>
      <li>It works very very well!</li>
      <li>The product I &amp;#34;thought &amp;#34; I was ordering was clear and the product I received is blue and does not hold hair it smells good but isn&#x27;t worth a dime !!</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced and the vendor ships very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Look me up on Facebook if you&#x27;re interested and send me a message!</li>
      <li>well worth it because its concentrated.</li>
      <li>Now, I used it in my mom&#x27;s hair and the blue, you honestly don&#x27;t see it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s blue in color but it easily emulsifies when you rub it into your hair or between your hands, it also washes out easily.</li>
      <li>I like the stuff, great shine seems like edge control, not sure what to do with it</li>
      <li>I may have misunderstood the use for this product, because I thought it would be like an edge control that gives your hair some shine, the shine part is true, but it holds absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>Now reading the reviews on here about it, most have received the blue kind instead of the white.</li>
      <li>but this product does do exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>;but most times that&#x27;s not necessary.  </li>
      <li>Several famous stars swear by it.</li>
      <li>It doest exactly as stated.</li>
      <li>I paid about 4 dollars for silk elements and let me say it is ten times better than this.</li>
      <li>like I thought and it works ok if you want to flat iron your hair.</li>
      <li>When I was completely relaxed, I loved this product, the down side to it</li>
      <li>but none the less, all good so far.</li>
      <li>and it does really work</li>
      <li>Its like perm in a jar for real.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the product.</li>
      <li>Be sure to run it into hair thoroughly because it&#x27;s blue in the jar, but will turn clear when blended with hair.</li>
      <li>IT WILL LOOK NICE FOR A FEW MINUTES</li>
      <li>For those of you who are hair savvy and are concerned about, the NO-NO&#x27;s of hair products(whether relaxed or natural), this product does contain a NO-NO, I can&#x27;t remember right off hand</li>
      <li>Once I was 5 months post-relaxer (currently 11- months post relaxer)I was no longer able to use to product to smooth my edges, upon application it would smooth down briefly and by the time it would get to work, I had FUZZY greasy edges; so now it&#x27;s in my closet gathering dust.</li>
      <li>I thought it was the clear, but it&#x27;s a different kind doesn&#x27;t work the same!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for my &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; and this is the winner hands down.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m torn between 2 stars and 3 stars, but I went with 2 mainly because of the price point.</li>
      <li>The only mild drawback is the texture which is like a wax</li>
      <li>Vonte is light enough to not weigh down my hair yet strong enough to control those &amp;#34;edges.&amp;#34; During the day, if my edges require more attention, I use  a wet brush to awaken...</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to go natural.</li>
      <li>I thought this gel was brown in color and light, but it&#x27;s blue and re color appears blue in our hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works wonders on edges , I&#x27;m natural and live in humid Houston</li>
      <li>thought it was clear</li>
      <li>I thought the product was clear 😩😩</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using this product because it makes my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>However, it makes my hair soft when it dries and it feel moisturized.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product a month ago which I have gone natural.</li>
      <li>I use this product to create finger coils in my natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I like the consistency of the product and it holds the hair well, but I should have purchased the clear formula instead of the blue.</li>
      <li>I may give it a shot again, once I am &#x27;completely&#x27; natural (still holding on to what I have left of my relaxed ends) and transitioning wearing twists!</li>
      <li>I am a no poo natural girl and this product rinses out easily, no white streaks.</li>
      <li>I may give it a shot again, once I am &#x27;completely&#x27; natural (still holding on to what I have left of my relaxed ends) and transitioning wearing twists!</li>
      <li>I have a little peice of unruly hair right at the start of my part</li>
      <li>just ONLY put this in your hair when it is dry and ready to be flatironed/pressed.</li>
      <li>It is not dry or flaky!</li>
      <li>(she&#x27;s natural but I flat iron her hair weekly) and hopefully, it will help with limiting the reversion that occurs with her hair here in HUMID central Texas!</li>
      <li>(she&#x27;s natural but I flat iron her hair weekly) and hopefully, it will help with limiting the reversion that occurs with her hair here in HUMID central Texas!</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and if you still use a hot comb it will work wonders also!</li>
      <li>It holds but not for long on my hair, im natural and its blue so can stain...</li>
      <li>I will update once, I find another use for this product, I don&#x27;t like to waste my money.ges, upon application it would smooth down briefly and by the time it would get to work, I had FUZZY greasy edges; so now it&#x27;s in my closet gathering dust.</li>

<li> Now if you have blonde hair, or any other color I would definitely suggest you get the clear product to this.  </li>
<li> The blue stayed too long on your scalp.</li>
<li> To me there was no clear purpose of this product and definitely not for 12 dam dollars.</li>
<li> It was blue, not clear.</li>
<li> You can also reactivate the hold of the product by simply wetting your edges or hairbrush with water and smoothing your hair back down.</li>
<li> The only down side is that the blue does sort of stain your nails</li>
<li> I&#x27;m SOOOO in love with this product and realize how hard it is to find (at least on the East Coast), so I am now a distributor for the cities of Houston, TX, Charlotte, NC, and Greensboro, NC!</li>
<li> The other issue I have with this product is that where ever I apply it, it makes my hair super shiny and sleek; however, the rest of my hair where it isn&#x27;t applied, looks very dull in comparison</li>
<li> I comb it through sections of my hair prior to straightening, adding a little Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Hair balm or Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine straightening serum for slip and rub it in my fingers to melt the wax a bit-</li>
<li> After a few seconds the color disappears as if it never was blue.</li>
<li> and I have a very loose curl pattern,</li>
<li> Spent 11$</li>
<li> So i guess it&#x27;s not really a downfall</li>
<li> was it&#x27;s not available locally</li>
<li> not what I expected it to be</li>
<li> I call this &amp;#34;my little magic&amp;#34; because it only takes a little product to do the job.</li>
<li> This product works extremely well on all hair types for smoothing and holding edges.</li>
<li> OR SO HAVE TO WASH IT OUT OF MY HAIR, ITS VERY SLICK, NOT A REAL FIRM</li>

    <li> I thought it was the clear, but it&#x27;s a different kind doesn&#x27;t work the same!</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the BEST hair straightener I have EVER used- makes my relaxed African-American hair smooth and shiny (kind of like a weave) when used with my flatiron. The only mild drawback is the texture which is like a wax but it easily melts with heat application, almost like beeswax. I comb it through sections of my hair prior to straightening, adding a little Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Hair balm or Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine straightening serum for slip and rub it in my fingers to melt the wax a bit- THEN i comb it through. If you don&#x27;t like extra oil on your hair, you should probably just use the Vonte alone or with a silicone-based serum instead of the oil-based one I mentioned. A little goes a long way and if you still use a hot comb it will work wonders also! just ONLY put this in your hair when it is dry and ready to be flatironed/pressed. Also works great for flyaways or as a holding wax for edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;m SOOOO in love with this product and realize how hard it is to find (at least on the East Coast), so I am now a distributor for the cities of Houston, TX, Charlotte, NC, and Greensboro, NC! Look me up on Facebook if you&#x27;re interested and send me a message!</li>
    <li> This on one of my favorite edge controls. I am a Stylist and I sell it like crazy in my salon. Its like perm in a jar for real.</li>
    <li> I thought this gel was brown in color and light, but it&#x27;s blue and re color appears blue in our hair. After a few seconds the color disappears as if it never was blue. It does not hold my edges down. My hair so dull an course and kinky and nappy that no gel or edge control will hold down my edges. This gel is for those who have a better texture. However, it makes my hair soft when it dries and it feel moisturized. It also makes my hair shiny. Lot gives my cornrows a slick shiny finish. Nothing works for these edges though. I want to order another gel but hope to find the one that looks like regular gel. I&#x27;m still using this product because it makes my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized.</li>
    <li> not what I expected it to be will not buy it at all thought it was clear instead it was blue</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product. It doest exactly as stated. People were asking were did I purchased it. My hair never felt dried out after washing it out of my hair.</li>
    <li> The product I &amp;#34;thought &amp;#34; I was ordering was clear and the product I received is blue and does not hold hair it smells good but isn&#x27;t worth a dime !! Spent 11$</li>
    <li> It holds but not for long on my hair, im natural and its blue so can stain...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the product. It was blue, not clear. And it was costly for the quality. Hicks edges is better.</li>
    <li> I began using this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair to avoid the harmful effects of alcohol-based hair gel and I LOVE it!  It is reasonably priced and the vendor ships very quickly.  I recommend this product hands down to anyone needing help taming frizzy/kinky/curly edges.</li>
    <li> The color is the only thing I would change.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of the product and it holds the hair well, but I should have purchased the clear formula instead of the blue.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! Happy I could find it again. Had been looking for it forever! It is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I loved this product since I was first introduced to it by my daughter, while visiting her in Los Angeles, Calif, over 10 years ago. I only wish the beauty supply stores here  in Dallas, Tx. would carry this product also. My hair looks healthy, beautiful and has a natural shine since I have used it. I get compliments all the time. I hope the manufacturer will continue to make Vonte Silk Effects available. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I found the ingredient list on the imperial beauty supply website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botanical Extracts, Paraffin, Glycerin, Oleth-10. Cetyl, Acetate, Mica, Oleth 20, Water, FB&amp;C Blue.  I use this product to create finger coils in my natural hair.  The ingredients seem relatively safe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; and this is the winner hands down.  Vonte is light enough to not weigh down my hair yet strong enough to control those &amp;#34;edges.&amp;#34; During the day, if my edges require more attention, I use  a wet brush to awaken...;but most times that&#x27;s not necessary.  I use this product along with mixed roots curl pudding and I&#x27;m good to go.  I just love it!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like  it leaves the hair blue ! I thought the product was clear 😩😩</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works wonders on edges , I&#x27;m natural and live in humid Houston and it does really work</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well on all hair types for smoothing and holding edges. It is not dry or flaky! It feels wonderful and makes my hair look great!  Several famous stars swear by it. Check out the website at [...]</li>
    <li> The blue stayed too long on your scalp. Especially around the edge of your hairline.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I call this &amp;#34;my little magic&amp;#34; because it only takes a little product to do the job. It can smooth the toughest edges to a smooth, silky perfection!</li>
    <li> This product leaves hair shiny without being oily and slicks hair without hair feeling stiff, very nice and it smells good too!  Be sure to run it into hair thoroughly because it&#x27;s blue in the jar, but will turn clear when blended with hair.</li>
    <li> I like the stuff, great shine seems like edge control, not sure what to do with it can anyone help</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn between 2 stars and 3 stars, but I went with 2 mainly because of the price point. For the amount it costs, the product is absolutely not worth it in my opinion. I say this because I had bought silk elements edge control prior to this, but when I seen this on YouTube I wanted it so bad and did not use my silk elements. I paid about 4 dollars for silk elements and let me say it is ten times better than this. I may have misunderstood the use for this product, because I thought it would be like an edge control that gives your hair some shine, the shine part is true, but it holds absolutely nothing and I have a very loose curl pattern, to me it just seemed like I put coconut oil or something heavier on my hair. To me there was no clear purpose of this product and definitely not for 12 dam dollars.</li>
    <li> Hi just want to tell everyone this product is great! Price is a little steep but well worth it because its concentrated. Glad I made the purchase, my order came from Amazon very quickly too!</li>
    <li> I initially saw this product in a hair magazine, where the comedian Monique, was tauting this product as a &#x27;perm in a jar. I am a self-admitted PJ (product junkie) and I am always on the look out for a product with great hold and shine without the &#x27;crunch&#x27;. When I was completely relaxed, I loved this product, the down side to it was it&#x27;s not available locally and though it provides great shine; the product does TRANSFER!! By this I mean, just like people who&#x27;s makeup tranfers to someone&#x27;s clothing so does this product. I was meeting a friend for lunch one day, and I went to give him a hug, and when I pulled away, he had a shiny spot on his face!! Of course, I wiped his face off and let him know that my hair gel/pomade (whatever) had rubbed off on his face, LOL. The other issue I have with this product is that where ever I apply it, it makes my hair super shiny and sleek; however, the rest of my hair where it isn&#x27;t applied, looks very dull in comparison and I didn&#x27;t want to apply this product to my entire head, just my edges. For those of you who are hair savvy and are concerned about, the NO-NO&#x27;s of hair products(whether relaxed or natural), this product does contain a NO-NO, I can&#x27;t remember right off hand (I&#x27;m writing this review from work) but I think that it&#x27;s mineral oil that is in this product. I tried to find the actual ingredient list before finishing this review, but finding the ingredients is like looking for the \\&quot;Lost Ark\\&quot; or the \\&quot;Lochness Monster\\&quot; nor is the ingredients listed on the jar; from the last jar that I purchased anyway(makes you wonder if/what the company is hiding). It&#x27;s blue in color but it easily emulsifies when you rub it into your hair or between your hands, it also washes out easily. You can also reactivate the hold of the product by simply wetting your edges or hairbrush with water and smoothing your hair back down. Once I was 5 months post-relaxer (currently 11- months post relaxer)I was no longer able to use to product to smooth my edges, upon application it would smooth down briefly and by the time it would get to work, I had FUZZY greasy edges; so now it&#x27;s in my closet gathering dust. I have recently read of this product being used as a straightening wax, so I may attempt to use it this way on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she&#x27;s natural but I flat iron her hair weekly) and hopefully, it will help with limiting the reversion that occurs with her hair here in HUMID central Texas!! I may give it a shot again, once I am &#x27;completely&#x27; natural (still holding on to what I have left of my relaxed ends) and transitioning wearing twists! I will update once, I find another use for this product, I don&#x27;t like to waste my money.ges, upon application it would smooth down briefly and by the time it would get to work, I had FUZZY greasy edges; so now it&#x27;s in my closet gathering dust. I have recently read of this product being used as a straightening wax, so I may attempt to use it this way on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she&#x27;s natural but I flat iron her hair weekly) and hopefully, it will help with limiting the reversion that occurs with her hair here in HUMID central Texas!!

    <li> I loveeeeeeee this product!!!! It works very very well! I have a little peice of unruly hair right at the start of my part and I use this to tone it down, ever since I started using this, my hair game has stepped up! Yay for vonte!</li>
    <li> My discovery of this product was from a hair dresser from California who uses this product. I watched and the results were amazing, so I said i needed this and wanted to try it. So hence I ordered it. Now reading the reviews on here about it, most have received the blue kind instead of the white. I myself thought I was getting the white product but none the less, all good so far. Now, I used it in my mom&#x27;s hair and the blue, you honestly don&#x27;t see it. The trick is to rub in the hair untill it disapairs. Now if you have blonde hair, or any other color I would definitely suggest you get the clear product to this.  All and all it does everything it says. The only down side is that the blue does sort of stain your nails but it can come off with soap and water. So i guess it&#x27;s not really a downfall but this product does do exactly what it says. So yes I recommend it and honeslty I&#x27;m going to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Lay my edges wonderfully and no greasy build up. I am a no poo natural girl and this product rinses out easily, no white streaks. Also emulsifies well so I can add a sheen to my hair without the heavy sticky feeling. I have also straighten my hair since owning this product and while I only use it on my edges, my hair wasn&#x27;t fried after using it nor was it overly greasy</li>
    <li> AT FIRST I LIKED IT, BUT NOW I NOTICE MY HAIR TURNS WHITE, I HAVE TO USE A LOT AND AFTER A DAY OR SO HAVE TO WASH IT OUT OF MY HAIR, ITS VERY SLICK, NOT A REAL FIRM HOLD IF USING FOR EDGE CONTROL IT WILL LOOK NICE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN MY HAIR WOULD WAVE UP</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a month ago which I have gone natural. It&#x27;s not too greasy like I thought and it works ok if you want to flat iron your hair. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to go natural.</li>
