      <li>Love the way my lashes look!!</li>
      <li>Very nice color.  </li>
      <li>I was using another navy mascara and loved what it did with my brown eyes, but the company discontinued it, so I went on the hunt and found this.</li>
      <li>Good product and price</li>
      <li>Makes your eyes pop in a good way.</li>
      <li>I love love love it!!!</li>
      <li>oh so sultry &amp; sexy!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE my mascara!</li>
      <li>While the Teal color didn&#x27;t show up as brightly as I thought it would, I still love it.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of the kind we used in the 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Nice color</li>
      <li>It cleans off very easy as well</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and a good deal for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad Maybelline came out with more colors</li>
      <li>I have never seen it in any store, so I&#x27;m so glad for Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have ordered all 3 colors and love all of them.</li>
      <li>love my eyes just love my eyes</li>
      <li>Not &amp;#34;great lashes&amp;#34; but the color is interesting.</li>
      <li>I just LOVE</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Love the Teal color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this product.</li>
      <li>This mascara is a lovely teal color and is definitely different but very, very nice!  </li>
      <li>Its really cool!</li>
      <li>It does wash off easily.</li>
      <li>i enjoy the product very much though i think it was my fault for not paying much attention when picking the colors i was hoping it would be more bluishy</li>
      <li>This needs a few coats for the color to really pop, but is great!</li>
      <li>I really love the teal and it looks stunning with blue eyes!</li>
      <li>Worth the price of the shipping.</li>
      <li>The teal is a fun color and differently colored mascara is kind of unusual and unique.</li>
      <li>but its good other</li>
      <li>I have medium-blue eyes, and when I wear the teal mascara, it brings them out so much!  </li>
      <li>They are quite stunning actually.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s funky enough to be different, yet not too bright that I cannot wear it to the office.  </li>
      <li>The color is pretty but does not show up on my lashes very well at all</li>
      <li>I also have this kind in black.</li>
      <li>I loveeeeee my new mascara!!</li>
      <li>Bought it for my Girl who is very picky about mascara.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this mascara though and will start buying whatever other colors I can find.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a little more pow with this.  </li>
      <li>The price was a bit higher then I would&#x27;ve liked and the tube seems to only last about 2 months if you use it everyday.</li>
      <li>I use neutrals everywhere else so adding a little subtle color in my eyes is really a beautiful effect.</li>
      <li>My eyes nearly appear teal.  </li>
      <li>then that one minor misunderstanding, though it did make my eyes burn when i used it the first time,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a natural medium-blonde, but dye my hair auburn.  </li>
      <li>You can see the color if you look closely, and it&#x27;s more visible under the right lighting, but it&#x27;s subtle enough that someone could have a conversation with you and not notice anything different about your mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super flaky, but it is a bit more dry and flaky than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a mascara in a color other than black which is too dark for me most of the time.</li>

<li> , I just hope it&#x27;s not just for a limited time.  </li>
<li> I was a little nervous at first that the color wasn&#x27;t going to show up on my black eyelashes, but after a few coats they were sooo teal.</li>
<li> but you have to apply coat after coat to make it thick enough.</li>
<li> the teal in my green eyes stands out.</li>
<li> The color of these mascaras are dark with subtle color.</li>
<li> Maybe a bit thin, too.  </li>
<li> WORST MASCARA</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loveeeeee my new mascara!! It brighten my eyes making it oh so sultry &amp; sexy!</li>
    <li> My order came on time. Would puchase again.</li>
    <li> The color is pretty but does not show up on my lashes very well at all</li>
    <li> The Maybeline colored mascaras are a delightful surprise. I was looking for a mascara in a color other than black which is too dark for me most of the time. The color of these mascaras are dark with subtle color. They are quite stunning actually. I use neutrals everywhere else so adding a little subtle color in my eyes is really a beautiful effect. I have ordered all 3 colors and love all of them. The mascara is an excellent quality and even though it is not a waterproof (which I prefer it not be) it stays put and doesn&#x27;t come off below your lashes during the day. It cleans off very easy as well</li>
    <li> This needs a few coats for the color to really pop, but is great!</li>
    <li> I am a lifetime fan of this mascara.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a little more pow with this.  It&#x27;s a great product but I have to put multiple coats on to get results.</li>
    <li> Note: I do not wear a lot of makeup.  While the Teal color didn&#x27;t show up as brightly as I thought it would, I still love it.  I&#x27;m a natural medium-blonde, but dye my hair auburn.  I have medium-blue eyes, and when I wear the teal mascara, it brings them out so much!  My eyes nearly appear teal.  I love it!  However, the mascara itself isn&#x27;t quite the same quality as others in Maybelline&#x27;s line.  It&#x27;s not super flaky, but it is a bit more dry and flaky than I&#x27;m used to.  Maybe a bit thin, too.  I wear contacts, so flakiness can be an issue--I just learned years ago to never touch my eyes unless absolutely necessary.  Also, had to be careful not to clump my lashes when applying a second coat.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous at first that the color wasn&#x27;t going to show up on my black eyelashes, but after a few coats they were sooo teal. The price was a bit higher then I would&#x27;ve liked and the tube seems to only last about 2 months if you use it everyday. I really enjoyed this mascara though and will start buying whatever other colors I can find.</li>

    <li> Bought it for my Girl who is very picky about mascara. She loves it, so it must be great!</li>
    <li> Nice color but you have to apply coat after coat to make it thick enough. It does wash off easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this product.

    <li> It&#x27;s okay but the teal is not dramatic enough, and it also didn&#x27;t go on as thick as expected.</li>
    <li> Very nice color.  I love it. Reminds me of the kind we used in the 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  Doesn&#x27;t add length though, just color.</li>
    <li> Good product and price</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and a good deal for the price. I also have this kind in black. The teal is a fun color and differently colored mascara is kind of unusual and unique.

    <li> i enjoy the product very much though i think it was my fault for not paying much attention when picking the colors i was hoping it would be more bluishy then greenishy but its good other then that one minor misunderstanding, though it did make my eyes burn when i used it the first time, though i used it again and didn&#x27;t have that problem the second time.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume</li>
    <li> I love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Not &amp;#34;great lashes&amp;#34; but the color is interesting. Definitely needs mascara primer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad Maybelline came out with more colors, I just hope it&#x27;s not just for a limited time.  Love the Teal color, it&#x27;s funky enough to be different, yet not too bright that I cannot wear it to the office.  Maybelline as always, makes the best mascara out there.</li>
    <li> WORST MASCARA I HAVE EVER USED</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and she loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my mascara! I just got it today. I HAD to put it on! VERY good for the price! GET IT! Its really cool! A+!</li>
    <li> love my eyes just love my eyes&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Maybelline Blue Mascara for over 30 years and now they have additional colors I just LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;So do the  middle school girls</li>
    <li> If I wear a teal blouse the teal in my green eyes stands out. Instead of my eye color standing out it actually seemed to recede with this color mascara.</li>
    <li> I really love the teal and it looks stunning with blue eyes!</li>
    <li> Beautiful!! Love the way my lashes look!!</li>
