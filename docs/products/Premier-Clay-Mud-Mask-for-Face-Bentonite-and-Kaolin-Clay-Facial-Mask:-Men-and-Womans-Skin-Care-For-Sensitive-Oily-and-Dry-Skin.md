      <li>Of those two clays, this one behaves the most like kaolin.  </li>
      <li>The mask is more of a clay mask then any sort of sea or ocean.  </li>
      <li>love the ingredients in this mask.</li>
      <li>Great product I highly recommend seaweed clay mask.</li>
      <li>i really loved this product, its Natural and healthy ingredients are amazing</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
      <li>The things I liked most about this product were the 50% organic ingredients, with the most prodominant ingredients being organic, and the fact that La Beaute Pure does not test this mask on animals.</li>
      <li>Of the clays in this mask, bentonite and kaolin are the ones I am most familiar with.  </li>
      <li>It drys easily and evenly.</li>
      <li>Also it washes off easily.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised how amazing this product worked!</li>
      <li>The directions were easy to understand and follow, and this leaves your skin sillky smooth.  </li>
      <li>Super fabulous Clay mask!</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic for our skin.  </li>
      <li>The 3-in-1 clay mask with Bentonite Kaolin and facial clay was delivered in great condition and as described on the product page.  </li>
      <li>I like the small package which makes it great for travel!</li>
      <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this mask.</li>
      <li>Now I feel like I&#x27;m clean again &amp;</li>
      <li>I like using facial masks, but I have to admit that sometimes the brightly colored ones are a bit off-putting.</li>
      <li>While I mostly stick to Neutrogena products now, I did really like the sulfur mask that came with the Proactive system and was searching for an affordable alternative.</li>
      <li>Overall, my experience with it so far has been very good</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and works really well, leaving your face clean and the pores diminished in appearance.  </li>
      <li>I read in other reviews that the mask was clumpy, but I found the bouncy, almost gel-like clay to go on very smooth with a synthetic bristle foundation brush, which I use to apply all clay masks I own.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not broken out nor become irritated from this product so I give it 5 stars!!</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling amazing and definitely pulls the crud out of your pores.</li>
      <li>Made in USA from all natural ingredients, this 3-in-1  is more than just a mask its a multi-tasking problem</li>
      <li>Ive never had such a nice  even skin tone and glow before.</li>
      <li>I love that is has natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I really like how clean my face feels after and the smallness of my pores after.</li>
      <li>It tightens your face as it dries and my pores were smaller so far so good.</li>
      <li>But it leaves my skin feeling soft, hydrated and super supple!</li>
      <li>I love that this particular brand is all natural organic and not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>Not only is the La Beaut&amp;eacute; Pure mask affordable, it is a natural, SUPERIOR product.</li>
      <li>After only 1 use I can tell a huge difference in my skin!  </li>
      <li>My face feels tighter after i used this after just the first time.</li>
      <li>The clay mask makes my skin smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth and soft now.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s just something very primal and soothing about smearing your face with mud, allowing it ti leach out the impurities as it dries and then washing it away, feeling scrubbed new and clean.</li>
      <li>It rinses clean, but takes a little more effort than some of the thicker masks I&#x27;ve used, so I recommend rinsing in the shower.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it came in a pot instead of a squeeze tub like some other masks I&#x27;ve tried, because it seemed to be a little bit easier to apply, and was just a more fun and hands-on experience.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine, who suggested this to me, has oily skin, large pores and breaks out a lot, so she uses the vinegar, and it works really well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I also love the wide array of healing, cleansing and soothing ingredients they&#x27;ve included.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment too much on</li>
      <li>My skin is much clearer since using this product.  </li>
      <li>I also really appreciated its texture, scent and color.</li>
      <li>I do wish it had a little bit of a tingle or scent but overall pretty good.</li>
      <li>but I was really pleased when I noticed that it did indeed lower the redness in my skin due to</li>
      <li>deep clean clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;OCEAN</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have too much of a small, but it smells pleasant and goes on a little cool at first.</li>
      <li>I have only used it a few times but so far product seems to be great quality</li>
      <li>it left my face glowing, i love the soothing relaxing feel it left me feeling in.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>~ La Beaute Pure &#x3D;luxury beauty products are all natural and use organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>This mask is not only really fun to use and apply,</li>
      <li>Clay is well known as a skin lightener, removing dead cells from your top layer of skin.</li>
      <li>~ Clay works as a skin lightener, removing dead cells from your top layer of skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s long-term effects due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t owned this product for very long, but as of right now I&#x27;m very much enjoying</li>
      <li>It super tightens your skin, and my pores are noticeably smaller (and I never had large pores, but after using this and noticing the difference it makes, I guess my pores were getting bigger).</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and I made the mistake of purchasing the Proactive system in 2012.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin REALLY soft and supple!</li>
      <li>The product has little to no scent and is easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>After using this my skin definitely felt tingly clean and refreshed, my pores appeared smaller and my skin was both tighter and smoother.</li>
      <li>If you want to clear everything out of your skin, this will remove all the crud in your pores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ready to go back for another night after I treated myself to the mask.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and can get irritated, but this was not the case with the 3-in-1 mask.</li>
      <li>the size was really the ONLY downfall of this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product arrived on time and as described. I have only used it a few times but so far product seems to be great quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a clay mask before but I really enjoy them! This product comes in a small jar but a little goes a long way. The product has little to no scent and is easy to wash off. It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic for our skin.  I suffer from acne and this product is number 1.  My skin is much clearer since using this product.  Great product I highly recommend seaweed clay mask.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!  Today, after another sleepless night at the hospital, I came home &amp; put on this mask.  I was almost too tired to even do that!  It feels so nice &amp; soothing, let alone the benefits for my skin.  I swear hospitals put something in the air to dry your mouth &amp; skin out &amp; make you tired.  Now I feel like I&#x27;m clean again &amp; my face doesn&#x27;t look so tired.  My face feels soft-no red spots or puckered up skin!  I&#x27;ll be ready to go back for another night after I treated myself to the mask.  Then I will look forward to another mask in a couple of days!  I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  I can say this mask has been a bright spot in my day! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Love this mask! I can&#x27;t comment too much on it&#x27;s long-term effects due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t owned this product for very long, but as of right now I&#x27;m very much enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it came in a pot instead of a squeeze tub like some other masks I&#x27;ve tried, because it seemed to be a little bit easier to apply, and was just a more fun and hands-on experience. I also really appreciated its texture, scent and color. I like using facial masks, but I have to admit that sometimes the brightly colored ones are a bit off-putting. My fianc&amp;eacute; has taken to calling me a &amp;#34;smurf&amp;#34; when he catches me wearing some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I washed it off, I really liked how my skin felt. It didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortably &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and was very soft to the touch! My pores were visibly reduced, and my redness was as well. Overall, my experience with it so far has been very good and I&#x27;m hoping that its beneficial ingredients continue to improve my skin through further use.</li>
    <li> The things I liked most about this product were the 50% organic ingredients, with the most prodominant ingredients being organic, and the fact that La Beaute Pure does not test this mask on animals. I have read about the skin clearing qualities of some of the ingredients, including bentonite clay and had used products with seaweed, sea kelp, and grape seed oil before. I read in other reviews that the mask was clumpy, but I found the bouncy, almost gel-like clay to go on very smooth with a synthetic bristle foundation brush, which I use to apply all clay masks I own. Some reviews say that the clay has a smell, but I honestly couldn&#x27;t find a trace of one. The mask has no smell to me, which I like because I worry about things that will sit on my face and may be perfumed. My skin is sensitive and can get irritated, but this was not the case with the 3-in-1 mask. The mask dries to the &amp;#34;tight skin&amp;#34; feeling you expect from a mask. One thing I really liked was that it washed off so easily...some masks don&#x27;t a leave a residue. My skin is left toned feeling and soft. I really like how clean my face feels after and the smallness of my pores after. I like the small package which makes it great for travel! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> Of the clays in this mask, bentonite and kaolin are the ones I am most familiar with.  Kaolin is one of the finest and silkiest of clays.  It has good oil controling and cleansing properties.  Bentonite is known for it&#x27;s detoxifying properties.  It usually comes as a powder and can be difficult to mix because it is so absorbent.  Of those two clays, this one behaves the most like kaolin.  It is creamy , goes on thin, and dries quickly to a chalky greyish white.  It rinses clean, but takes a little more effort than some of the thicker masks I&#x27;ve used, so I recommend rinsing in the shower.  The skin feels soft after using it.  It would be nice if it came in a larger jar, but it takes less of this mask to cover your face than is typical.  Discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I use this mask once per week. It has a mile seaweed smell but it does not bother me. The clay mask makes my skin smooth and clear. Love this mask, will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is a nice clay mask.  Easy to use, and works really well, leaving your face clean and the pores diminished in appearance.  The directions were easy to understand and follow, and this leaves your skin sillky smooth.  I received a discount on this item for testing and review.</li>
    <li> This mask is not only really fun to use and apply, I mean, you&#x27;re putting mud all over your face in the name of beauty! But it leaves my skin feeling soft, hydrated and super supple! At first, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this mask. This small jar seemed like a pale colored jar of goop. It doesn&#x27;t have too much of a small, but it smells pleasant and goes on a little cool at first. With some mud masks, the drying process can be a little painful with cracking and crusting of the product. This mask does dry, but does so slowly and doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort. I&#x27;ve not broken out nor become irritated from this product so I give it 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> If you want to clear everything out of your skin, this will remove all the crud in your pores. I have combo skin so I use vinegar. A friend of mine, who suggested this to me, has oily skin, large pores and breaks out a lot, so she uses the vinegar, and it works really well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do NOT have to use a lot. I put a very thin layer on my skin and it works just as well. Actually, better, because when I put it on thick, pieces of it would fall off my face. A thin layer does the trick, and it stays on your face even after it dries. Also, the less you use, the less it will clog your drains. It super tightens your skin, and my pores are noticeably smaller (and I never had large pores, but after using this and noticing the difference it makes, I guess my pores were getting bigger).</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and I made the mistake of purchasing the Proactive system in 2012. While I mostly stick to Neutrogena products now, I did really like the sulfur mask that came with the Proactive system and was searching for an affordable alternative. Not only is the La Beaut&amp;eacute; Pure mask affordable, it is a natural, SUPERIOR product. After one use, my skin was firm, smooth, and the very deep blackheads on my forehead were being pulled to the surface. After the second use, my obvious blemishes were gone, and the deepest blackheads on my forehead have nearly vanished. I&#x27;m 32, and I&#x27;m starting to develop those fine lines I&#x27;d like to treat, but I shy away from many moisturizers other than Cetaphil, which I use in only spot-trearments because of my sensitive skin. Now that I can visibly see my pores are getting smaller, I&#x27;m looking forward to keeping this product on-hand as part of my acne treatment regimen - and as a natural alternative for maintaining glowing, youthful skin.</li>
    <li> I never used a clay mask before but I&#x27;ve started incorporating it into my skincare routine every 3-4 days or so despite the actual product indicating to only use it every 7 days. I&#x27;ve always been incredibly skeptical about these things but I was really pleased when I noticed that it did indeed lower the redness in my skin due to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: I&#x27;ve started getting complements about my skin glowing and I&#x27;m a guy whose never gotten those before. So big kudos if it is this clay mask doing that.</li>
    <li> Mud masks are one of my favorite at-home spa treatments. There&#x27;s just something very primal and soothing about smearing your face with mud, allowing it ti leach out the impurities as it dries and then washing it away, feeling scrubbed new and clean. I love that this particular brand is all natural organic and not tested on animals. I also love the wide array of healing, cleansing and soothing ingredients they&#x27;ve included. After using this my skin definitely felt tingly clean and refreshed, my pores appeared smaller and my skin was both tighter and smoother. I would use this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Thus stuff is amazing. I put it on and followed directions. After washing off, which was very easy, my face felt refreshed and the pimples I did have weren&#x27;t as inflamed and the pain was reduced. Can&#x27;t wait til next week to do it again. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> The smell is really nice considering it&#x27;s a clay mask. Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Yes . I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! Leaves your skin feeling amazing and definitely pulls the crud out of your pores. It was smaller than I anticipated but I forgot to check the size of the container before I purchased it. Either way, great product. Highly recommended</li>

    <li> I love this clay mask. The consistency is really perfect. It drys easily and evenly. Also it washes off easily. My face feels tighter after i used this after just the first time. Ive never had such a nice  even skin tone and glow before. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far. I&#x27;m unsure of the seaweed part of the mask. It&#x27;s definitely earthy.  It&#x27;s a small jar and looks super thick however once you start applying it it goes on to the consistency you want which I love.  The mask is more of a clay mask then any sort of sea or ocean.  It tightens your face as it dries and my pores were smaller so far so good. I do wish it had a little bit of a tingle or scent but overall pretty good.</li>
    <li> i really loved this product, its Natural and healthy ingredients are amazing and i totally loved the smell which seemed to be of a cucumber but also kinda minty. it left my face glowing, i love the soothing relaxing feel it left me feeling in. all in all i loved this product, i would have given it 5 stars but i feel like for $15 it should be larger then only 2oz. the size was really the ONLY downfall of this product.</li>
    <li> This is so amazing. My skin looks so amazing after using this. This is a must have for you skincare. I had a few little pimples and after using this they were gone.</li>
    <li> Beautiful results, love this product! The jar is a small jar that fits in the palm of your hand which is smaller than what I was expecting, but you don&#x27;t need a lot of product at once so it will last. I love that is has natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and used it last night. I left the mask on for 25 minutes. After only 1 use I can tell a huge difference in my skin!  I had a few small breakouts and they&#x27;re almost completely cleared up and my pores are smaller!  I love this stuff! I just wish it was a larger container for the price.</li>
    <li> great product,  I ordered another one and am now going to buy their serum.  I adore this company! !!</li>
