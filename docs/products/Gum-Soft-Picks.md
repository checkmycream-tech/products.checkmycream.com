      <li>I&#x27;m not a flosser and tend to move more towards toothpicks.</li>

      <li>It even helps me to create more of a regimen</li>
      <li>It is better than any product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Its advantage is that it is flexible, and hence able to work its way into twisting passages between teeth, and there is no danger of its damaging gums as floss might do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty good about brushing and am getting better about flossing.</li>
      <li>These soft picks seemed like a great idea.</li>

      <li>break way too easily</li>
      <li>They bend and wear out very quickly</li>

      <li>are very closely set ( my own) but these go where floss seems to split apart on me.</li>

      <li>My gum health has improved a great deal from using them on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>This is a great back up to have.</li>
      <li>They are an important adjunct.  </li>
      <li>Floss far superior &amp;#34;wall to wall&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>These are so quick and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Then this might be for you.. otherwise read my original review.</li>
      <li>I still use floss, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these!  I carry these in my car and purse so I don&#x27;t have to floss in public.  They are a life saver for when you have food stuck in your teeth!</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a few of these as samples. It really gets where a toothbrush can&#x27;t. Dental floss is probably better, but this is much more convenient.</li>
    <li> These little soft-picks are great!  I have used other picks made of metal with stiff bristles, and they bend and break between my very hard-to-get-between teeth.  These picks are soft, yes, but they are also sturdy.  They don&#x27;t ben easily, and the are very efficient at removing the food and plaque between the teeth.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with these!</li>
    <li> I hate to floss and always have.  My dentist always praises me for what a great job I&#x27;m doing flossing and to keep up the good work!  I&#x27;ve never had the heart to admit the truth:  that flossing is not consistently part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the GUM Butler Soft Picks because of a recommendation from a friend.  Actually, the recommendation was for Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks.  While reading reviews for them, I found a suggestion for the GUM Butler Soft Picks.  At the time I was ordering, the Doctor&#x27;s product was more affordable per pick and I couldn&#x27;t decide, so I got them both to compare.  I did like the Doctor&#x27;s product, but I have found that I prefer the GUM product.  The bristles are softer and feel gentler on my gums.  Also, the bristles wrap around the stem and go further up the stem.  Because of these two qualities, I use them all the time and am more thorough.  With the Doctor&#x27;s product, I find it sometimes makes my gums tender and therefore use it less frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked to these products because I simply hate flossing; however, I fully understand the benefit and necessity of flossing.  Granted, this is not a substitute for flossing, but it still helps remove more debris than brushing and rinsing alone.  I do still floss on occasion, and in fact, I find that I floss more often now that I use the GUM Butler Soft Picks.  The reason for additional flossing is that the Soft Picks make my mouth feel so much cleaner, much the same as the day of a dental cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office, and it&#x27;s an addictive sensation.  What I prefer with the Soft Picks over floss is that in tighter areas the floss frequently gets stuck between my teeth and breaks or, worse, ultimately snaps past the tight spot and painfully into my gums.  The Soft Picks remove debris without the discomfort in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, my husband has a lot of dental work in his mouth, including three bridges.  He&#x27;s always used the Oral B Sensitive Floss and finds the GUM Butler Soft Picks work much, much better in those areas.  He astonished daily at what the Soft Picks remove from his bridges that, by contrast, the floss has left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would caution that while I love them, they aren&#x27;t perfect.  I have to be careful in tighter areas not to bend the stem.  It&#x27;s a thin, soft plastic and, once bent, is very difficult to continue to use.  I typically clean the teeth that have more room first and then the tighter areas last.  It&#x27;s also a bit difficult to get the back molars - much the same difficulty as flossing but with less hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see them as affordable as the Doctor&#x27;s product and I hate disposing of more plastic into the environment, but I would still definitely recommend the GUM Butler Soft Picks in the arsenal of healthy mouth care!s work much, much better in those areas.

    <li> We use these after each meal. They are effective in cleaning the spaces between teeth. Have tried other products ie; balsa picks, plastic picks etc. These are easy and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Gentle on the gums and does the trick.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife.  The are a little longer in length than she is use too, so she gave them to me.  I use another make and when finished will go to these</li>
    <li> They bend and get distorted easily but they do the job.</li>
    <li> I am a longterm user of the other interdental brushes made by this company.  I have a couple of tight spaces and must use the slender cylindrical sizes.  I thought that these would be convenient to keep in my purse or carryon for travel in addition to home use.  I find that the brush is ineffective, both due to its size and due to the fragile, easily broken wire that connects the brush to the little flat handle.  When I use it I don&#x27;t feel as if I have gotten the spaces as clean as they could be.  On occasion I will follow use with a Go-Betweens (made by the same company) cleanser (the thin size brush). Sometimes I remove additional particles that are obvious and were missed by the Soft Pick.  Even if I don&#x27;t notice any additional debris, my teeth and gums feel cleaner and more stimulated after using the Go-Between.  None of these products are a substitute for flossing.  They are an important adjunct.  I will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of these Gum sticks, they massage my gums so much, and its like your scratching them because its a good feeling. Get used to them, dont do too much massaging the first week, or your gums will be sore, or, at least mine were. I am using this to get rid of gum gingivitis, and giver more blood flow to gum area. In just a few weeks, you will see how healthy your gums become after daily usage. Nice brush with an electric toothbrush after to stimulate gums. I love them. I guess you got to floss too, these only get the top of the tooth, I cant slide them all the way down like floss. BUT if your looking for gum stimulation and health, these are so great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> On time delivery.  Product was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Effective. Gentle enough to use on a regular basis. My purpose is to clean between teeth and stimulate the gums. I was given these as a sample at my last dental checkup. I use these in combination with regular dental tape-ribbon type floss. Do not force. If the angle is too great, the tips bend or break. This does not replace flossing. I have added it to my regular flossing,</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok. The tend to bend by the time I clean through half my teeth. Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as floss; the rubbery bristles have too much space in between.</li>
    <li> Okay, maybe hate is too strong a word but I do have an intense dislike for it. If not for really good color matching of the resins used for my fillings, you&#x27;d see what I mean. That being said, as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve been pretty good about brushing and am getting better about flossing. Still I&#x27;ve had a couple of root canals and one, which I had to cap, I chose to cap with gold. It&#x27;s a tooth way in the back and flossing just doesn&#x27;t get in the space too well. It rips to shreds quickly when I thread it. On a recent visit to the dentist, the hygienist pointed out that the space between that tooth and the one next to it doesn&#x27;t seem to get much action. She gave me a couple of freebie interdental picks which did a great job but are obviously more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found these babies. There&#x27;s little more that I can say except that I&#x27;m very satisfied with the result. It easily cleans the area and with a few turns of the shaft and leaves me feeling like I&#x27;ve done a complete job. It even helps me to create more of a regimen so I find myself brushing and flossing more often as well. And that&#x27;s just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRICE FOR THE AMOUNT.</li>
    <li> These are plastic based and feel rough on gum line. I do like that they are very compact, thus making them  very portable in wallet, purse, etc.</li>
    <li> Its a trash. not work good and break easily. i dont like it. I dont no why GUM make this..</li>
    <li> 1st one broke; didn&#x27;t try another</li>
    <li> Item as described, received before estimation delivery date.</li>
    <li> I got some of these from my dental hygienist since she knows how fanatical I am about my teeth.  So I already knew they were great.  Love the little carrying case.</li>
    <li> Before I tried the Gum Soft Picks I was using the wooden type of picks and they worked fine, yet these GUM Soft Picks works so much better! Since it is hard for me to floss, this works great and it reaches perfectly into&lt;br /&gt; those hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;Also this is so much gentler to my gums than the wooden type was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just 10 days, I noticed a huge difference in my Gingivitis, my gums are now a light pink and NEVER bleed when I brush or use these. And my gums feel better and so so clean!&lt;br /&gt;These I use after meals also (I keep some in my purse in a zip-lock bag), this way between brushings, my gums and teeth are clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these to all!</li>
    <li> I had some serious dental work consisting of a bridge and a crown a few years ago.  My gums just did not like it and receded a bit around the crowns.  My dentist told me I had to clean a couple of pockets.  He gave me an oral B proxabrush (or something like that; sorry, don&#x27;t remember the precise name) and doctors brush picks.  Both turned out to be torture devices.  After a week of trying to use them my gums were more sore than ever because both things are scratchy.  I started looking for a better product, and found this one thanks to wonderful amazon reviewers.  These picks are great!  No more pain and scratching already raw tissue.  Very soft, gentle, thin and clean great both gum pockets and under the bridge.  After one day of using them after every meal, the troubled gum area feels a lot better and no more bleeding.  I am so happy I found something that is so easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended using this product as a supplement to brushing and flossing. Its advantage is that it is flexible, and hence able to work its way into twisting passages between teeth, and there is no danger of its damaging gums as floss might do. It is also inexpensive and easier to use than floss.</li>
    <li> Bought these without reading any reviews.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  I&#x27;m not sure what the size of these are, maybe 1 mm but if you don&#x27;t have sufficient gaps between your teeth these are worthless.  They bend and wear out very quickly so they are not very good at removing anything that you might ordinarily use a toothpick for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a definite reduction in the quality of this product recently. The tip of the brush now bends VERY easily and cannot be re-straightened to any usable degree. This wasn&#x27;t the case when I first bought them a few years ago. I&#x27;m not trying to force them into any tight gaps in my teeth - I&#x27;m just using them in six spots and they become largely unusable after just 3 or 4.</li>
    <li> have been using these little picks for years.  i can&#x27;t get the hard ones between my teeth.  these are just right.  i wash them with  soap and hot water after i  use them.  don&#x27;t throw away with one use  they last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Too thin, they break really fast.</li>
    <li> These work great for my tremors and cleaning my teeth</li>
    <li> I read reviews stating that this product was better than Doctor&#x27;s Toothpicks, but after testing both, this is the inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true: the rubber bristles are kinder to your gums and do not cause bleeding like Doctor&#x27;s, but they are also useless at extracting plaque, i.e. cleaning your gums. First I brushed with these, and no plaque came out. Then I brushed with Doctor&#x27;s, and all the plaque finally came out. These picks did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bleeding problem many report with the Doctor&#x27;s toothpicks subsides after a week or two as regular cleaning cures your chronic inflammation. Only inflamed gums bleed. So the only advantage these picks have over Doctor&#x27;s is not really an advantage at all in the long run.</li>
    <li> These soft picks do clean between the teeth.  They are very flimsy and soon have to be replaced.  I hate the waste of throwing the pick out every 2 or 3 days.</li>
    <li> I saw them and heard they are very comfortable and convenient.  It was true I really use them often and they do not hurt.</li>
    <li> Works as described.....good alternative and safer than a toothpick.</li>
    <li> Its not better than floss but its a great toothpick replacement.  I take one or two of these on the go for those food that like to get stuck between the teeth like salad, corn, beef. ETC.</li>
    <li> After reading up online about how take better care of my gums, I saw that GUM soft picks came highly recommended to use with brushing and flossing. I can&#x27;t believe how well these are rated, considering they&#x27;re basically useless. I have severe crowding on my front teeth, so I get it, they can&#x27;t fit. But even with my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; teeth, these picks have yet to do anything aside from break whenever I attempt to use one. I don&#x27;t know what kind of gaps they&#x27;re expecting to find in somebody&#x27;s mouth, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a single space in my mouth where these cleaners can fit. It&#x27;s a shame, because the rubber bristles are soft and gentle feeling, so they&#x27;re probably more thorough than traditional flossing, and I was excited to try them and have something a little easier for on-the-go. No luck. Will not repurchase, wish I could return, will be continuing to find something that actually works.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful for your product. It is better than any product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Better than toothpicks!</li>
    <li> Very good product I love it :)</li>
    <li> I was already using these, especially for travel and when out at restaurants (discreetly, of course,) but my dental hygienist suggested I supplement my daily flossing with them.  These are a very good product as they work for both widely and tightly spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> Love these things. Great stand-in for floss for visible teeth (hard to reach the back) and really useful for braces or built in retainers.</li>
    <li> These are our favorite toothpicks. I still use floss, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t need it anymore. The little case they enclose not only hold the soft picks, but are also good for keeping small pills in my pocket.</li>
    <li> Very good for getting those bits and pieces between teeth.</li>
    <li> gave me a sample.  Easier to use than floss or toothpicks, I think, and does a better job too.  No bleeding gums after using, also.</li>
    <li> Gum soft picks.? Or maybe doctors brush picks?&lt;br /&gt;The soft picks  are very good for cleaning between teeth near the gum. They are soft and well designed little brushes for efficient cleaning but require enough space between teeth to do their job. Small spaces  just make them bend back on themselves.&lt;br /&gt;Doctors brush picks are harder and one end is designed to remove impacted food from between teeth. It is a real toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;The other end is a small hard flat plastic brush that can force its way between teeth but might irritate gums.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest spending six bucks and buy the small size of each. Then decide.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I suggest having both around. The gum soft picks work better on most of my teeth and clean both sides but the doctors picks remove impacted food better.&lt;br /&gt;Neither one forces food up under the gums as dental floss can.&lt;br /&gt;Buy both. It&#x27;s cheap money and your gums are worth it.</li>
    <li> These work better than ribbon floss or conventional toothpicks. These rally are great, fit in anywhere, and never irritate the gums.</li>
    <li> These are so quick and easy to use. Nice if you are away from home and don&#x27;t have time to floss your teeth.</li>
    <li> Use them all the time, they are soft on the gums, but they clean very well.</li>
    <li> I love these things, but so darn expensive :(</li>
    <li> good enough to clean some stuff stuck on your teeth, doesn&#x27;t necessarily clean everything</li>
    <li> These soft picks seemed like a great idea. I bought a pack last night and tried them today. I found some positive results, but NOT for tightly spaced teeth. These little picks are very soft at the point of bristles. They bend easily and can&#x27;t get through some tooth gaps. Floss far superior &amp;#34;wall to wall&amp;#34;. That could be why NONE of my dentists has recommended picks like these, but they&#x27;ve ALL recommended flossing. And no dentist of mine has used them on my teeth. But they ALL floss.  My suggestion? These picks are fine on a supplemental basis. Whatever you do, though, keep floss as numero uno.</li>
    <li> Perfect for people like me who have difficulties flossing!</li>
    <li> The brush picks I was using before were larger and had harder bristles which hurt my gums. These are small enough to reach into all the spaces I need to reach. They are made of soft enough material that I don&#x27;t feel like I am hurting my gums. They still have bristles, though. One reviewer wrote that they are too soft to be durable, but I only use them once, so I don&#x27;t know if they could last longer. However, I don&#x27;t think that would be very sanitary. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I love these soft-picks! The store were I but them locally, can&#x27;t seem to keep them stocked. so being able to find this good deal, was great. I have issue&#x27;s with the regular floss, these are easy on my gum and small enough to carry everywere, even in my pocket.</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended this product to me to use along with floss and as alternative to floss, when I am not able to.  It helps if you have bleeding gums, sensitive gums when flossing as it strengthens the gums.  I bought it for me and my kids.  The product is soft and easy to use, but if you have any teeth that are really close together with barely room to floss then you may be better off flossing those particular teeth.  I like it, so do my kids.  I use 1 pick on entire gum line and in between teeth at gum line.</li>
    <li> I love them because they are soft and do the job well. I sent them to my kids they love them too.</li>
    <li> I have teeth that are tightly spaced and  can fit these between my teeth just fine. I keep them in my purse and even use them at home.</li>
    <li> Item is as advertised.  Very pleassed.</li>
    <li> Better than floss and helps you keep your teeth in you mouth.  Imagine ,easy to dislodge particles from between your teeth while steering your car!</li>
    <li> I carry these picks everywhere I go. My gum health has improved a great deal from using them on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I find this product the easiest  method of flossing.  Each brush last four to six uses.  I was first introduced to these brushes by my dentist.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect thing to put on your bedroom night stand.  You can use them the last thing in the evening while you&#x27;re in bed and not feel guilty that you didn&#x27;t floss.</li>
    <li> This is wayyy better then toothpicks. Really sooths the gum. The only thing is it snaps really easy.</li>
    <li> Great toothpick and inbetween teeth cleaner, shipped quickly very happy with this product. Beats a wooden tooth pick anyday Im hooked on this!</li>
    <li> Great checkups at the dentist.</li>
    <li> Purchased at Amazon as is just about everything I buy. They have such a wide variety of offerings, there is very little that I cannot buy on Amazon...it is my \\&quot;go to \\&quot;store. These dental cleaners are far superior &amp; much easier for me to use then dental floss. And my dental hygienist agrees!! She is very pleased with my dental care and oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I am on a hunt for the perfect toothpick... again. I like that these can really scrub the sides of your teeth with gentle rubbery fingers, but they fall apart too quickly. To really clean my teeth after eating, I may need to use two. I used soft brush picks before this that are no longer made, sigh! All the brush picks I try now are so hard as to make my gums sore. This is the best substitute I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Tiny product,breaks easy .</li>
    <li> These are the best &amp;#34;tooth pick&amp;#34;-type devices I&#x27;ve ever used.  They are a great replacement for flossing and are easy to use and effective. It also works great for cleaning under bridges.  My dentist recommended them and now I know why.</li>
    <li> I love that these have a small carrying case with them to carry when out of the house.  These are cushioned and do not harm the gum like some others.</li>
    <li> These are good for sensitive gums and especially if you have a permanent retainer.</li>
    <li> I am going to edit this review at the beginning and let you know something very important about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is meant for people with false teeth and dentures. Not for people with 100% real teeth. This will hurt and damage your teeth, if they&#x27;re REAL. If you have dentures... Then this might be for you.. otherwise read my original review. My teeth are all real and in decent shape. I wanted to take better care of them so I got this product. It is NOT for me or anyone with REAL teeth. This product is intended for Dentures/false teeth. Duck these arseholes for making it seem otherwise. -10 points for their money-grubbing deception. These would probably be amazing for Dentures.. not for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible. These do not work better than flossing. They do not fit between most my teeth. Flossing gets between 100%, and flossing shows results, whereas these show ZERO results. They do NOTHING between the teeth that normal flossing helps and obviously show no results on the rest. I&#x27;ve used worse products but, against a product that shows no results, that doesn&#x27;t mean anything. The only good thing about these is that they&#x27;re soft. Again, doesn&#x27;t mean anything when you get nothing out of them. I wasted my time and money. If you&#x27;re ordering them on Amazon the current seller is Pharmapacks, they shipped out in 8 days. Unacceptable for someone like me who orders online regularly. Overall ordering from the shipper, and the individual product itself was disappointing. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> break way too easily and I don&#x27;t see how they fit between teeth....</li>
    <li> I hate flossing! Just won&#x27;t do it! My dentist reccomended these and I was like, well we&#x27;ll see because I had used the individual kind that you pull through and didn&#x27;t care for them either. Well, my dentist will be pleased because now, I look foward to using these!!!! Being just the one stick with a soft brush on the end, it comfortably goes in and out and it feels as if my gums are getting a massage. Fantastic, give them a try and see.</li>
    <li> These products seem to be the same as the ones sold at CVS stores.  In the past CVS told \\&quot;POCKET PICK ACTION BRUSH\\&quot;, now CVS no longer carry them.  Compared with the \\&quot;POCKET PICK ACTION BRUSH\\&quot;, the product sold at CVS nowadays are just garbage.  Product like this are made of plastic, so it cannot be bended, if you bend them, they got broken.  The bristles are too short and not real.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years. They are the best pics you can find.</li>
    <li> Everyone should use these. My dental hygienist told me about these. They are easy on the gums and really work well.</li>
    <li> I got these on recommendation from my dentist. I&#x27;m not a flosser and tend to move more towards toothpicks. These have become a staple with me now though and there must more through than a toothpick there actualy like small brushes that get in between teeth easily.my teeth are very closely set ( my own) but these go where floss seems to split apart on me.</li>
    <li> Great to have in the car, in our wallet, purse etc.  I love tooth picks, they are really healthy for your gums after a meal, but not everyone has offers them.  This is a great back up to have.</li>
    <li> they are soft and work so much better than other types of teeth pickers!</li>
