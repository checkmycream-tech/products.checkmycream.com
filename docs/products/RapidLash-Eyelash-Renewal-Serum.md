### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>curler.(That is the best way I can measure their growth)&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>BUY IT if you want beautiful eye lashes!!</li>
      <li>Wanted to add, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found for this product.  </li>
      <li>The thickness isn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d hoped for, but I am very happy with the end results.</li>
      <li>, I was greatly supprised and very very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I had heard some great things about it, and being a college student, I decided to buy it online since it was twenty dollars cheaper.</li>
      <li>and i promise you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
      <li>A problem I run into is that after I curl mine, they look great, but then when I apply the mascara, they straighten out after drying...just a side note.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after reading all the great reviews.</li>
      <li>Works great -</li>
      <li>I love it!!  </li>
      <li>Longer, thicker, more  feminine lashes for my beautiful brown eyes!</li>
      <li>and my eyelashes are SIGNIFICANTLY longer!!!</li>
      <li>It did arrive very quickly and in perfect conditon.     </li>
      <li>I was also wondering if anyone reading this has any recommendations for amazing mascaras that they LOVE???</li>
      <li>I applied a good amount every night on the lash line, and it did take about two months to really see results, but guess what...it does get results!!!</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
      <li>Follow the directions and hope it works for you  :)  </li>
      <li>What upset me the most was that during the time i was using it my lashes became brittle and fell/broke off more often than before.</li>
      <li>My lashes are much better.</li>
      <li>so it looks like I have liner on :-).  </li>
      <li>now~ :)</li>
      <li>I abosolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a HUGE difference.</li>
      <li>but I have lightly put some on lower eye lids as well.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll go light a candle for peace now.</li>
      <li>but so far, I am extremely happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone interested.  </li>
      <li>for me the results weren&#x27;t significant; without mascara it wasnt noticable.</li>
      <li>I used it for about 4 weeks and noticed a significant change in the thickness of my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hooked and for fear of losing these new lashes, which honestly feel like someone else&#x27;s lashes</li>
      <li>The trade off for noticeably longer, thicker lashes is worth it, plus once you&#x27;re happy with the improvement, you only use it once or twice a week to maintain, so I would think any under-eye darkening would begin to fade.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have lashes again and real eyebrows for the first time in my life.  </li>
      <li>One day while gently removing my eye makeup i lost most of the longer lashes that took me 8 weeks to grow.</li>
      <li>Almost 300 positive reviews... surely it works, right?</li>
      <li>My eyelids have been getting more and more red all day.</li>
      <li>5 stars for RapidLash and I am getting ready to order some more right</li>
      <li>I decided on this product because it seemed a decent price, the ingredients were mostly natural, and the feedback was mostly good.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s filling in but very light</li>
      <li>My eyebrows also have filled in and are much darker than before.  </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I just apply shadow and bottom liner and curl the upper lashes, for a really nice look too.    </li>
      <li>But if you can do that - then you&#x27;re golden</li>
      <li>So far I am sure it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube after 3 months and it seems to be pretty full.</li>
      <li>but I would rather pay more money for a product that actually works.</li>
      <li>I did my research and tried Ardell first, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll add my two cents  enthusiastically: it works, it really works!</li>
      <li>I never had bottom lashes and my top lashes were very short.</li>
      <li>I am now trying Enormous Lash hoping it will give better results,</li>
      <li>I use it every night, only on the top lashes.</li>
      <li>Not bad at all though compared to the many of the millions of other kinds of store and boutique brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it feels natural &amp; I don&#x27;t have to worry about \\&quot;false</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t put too much or it will sting your eyes some.</li>
      <li>My lashes are straight as a pin, &amp; after RapidLash making it longer, I still have to use curlers to shape it up.</li>
      <li>So now when I curl my lashes and use the mascara, my eyes really pop like they never have.</li>
      <li>I know will really work.  </li>
      <li>It did not improve the thickness which what i was really hoping for.</li>
      <li>I would even say be patient and wait for the 8 week mark to notice a real difference.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell much difference in the fullness of the lashes, just the length, but I&#x27;ll take whatever I can get.</li>
      <li>My lashes are also curling up slightly in a gorgeous way, giving me a natural sweep of lashes that you might get with a lash curler, which I never use because that&#x27;s too harsh on them.   </li>
      <li>This is just more extreme than I thought might happen.     </li>
      <li>I ordered this in a different site, i was so excited when it came</li>
      <li>Yes Rapid Lash is cheaper than most other eyelash serums out there</li>
      <li>My lashes are longer, but since I&#x27;m asian, they are super straight, so they have not grown up and curled much,</li>
      <li>The first week the product burned a little but not as much as I expected, especially as I became more adept at applying the serum.     </li>
      <li>I hope this helps someone try this...from someone who tries to do the more natural route and doesn&#x27;t hope for much</li>
      <li>They are longer and actually curling upwards, something that is nonexistent because most Asian lashes point out straight.  </li>
      <li>I started rapid lash about 6 weeks ago...and wow!!</li>
      <li>I actually noticed a difference within the first 4 days of using the product!</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to the expensive Latisse and LiLash.</li>
      <li>Just a few more weeks</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if that was normal</li>
      <li>And I love the fact that I can find it on Amazon.com for far less than anywhere else.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve def been getting some attention with my new lashes</li>
      <li>After almost 3 months of nightly use, I can tell a definite difference in the length of my lashes, again not like false eyelashes but very nice eyelashes.</li>
      <li>It does take a long time to see a difference, 6 weeks, but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>and I ended up washing off a bunch of my lashes with the mascara every night, so if you are looking to grow and keepmore lashes you might want to look into non-water proof and/or natural mascaras for normal day wear.</li>
      <li>I am also using a natural mascara, with things like rosemary in it, which I think has been helping to continue to nourish my lashes.</li>
      <li>My lashes are naturally blond and this has also made them darker.</li>
      <li>Tuly Natural Mascara</li>
      <li>But i will try it at my eyebrow and see what happens so far</li>
      <li>With blonde lashes you don&#x27;t get much definition around the eyes unless you put on mascara, and I don&#x27;t feel like putting mascara on all the time.</li>
      <li>That is just me.&lt;br /&gt;Getting ready to order my second tube for maintenance after a few more weeks of regular use.</li>
      <li>I decided to try Rapid Lash because #1 i have short and straight lashes and #2</li>
      <li>I promptly began using the product following the directions 5/27 and although only a week has gone by, I&#x27;ve already seen a difference in the length of the lashes on my right eye.  </li>
      <li>My sister started it at the same time as me and has also had the exact same effects.</li>
      <li>My lashes are coming in a little darker then my normal blonde which is cool.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s become part of my routine and is just too easy not to - takes only a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
      <li>but this stuff really works as long as you use it EVERY night.</li>
      <li>Since the price has come down on this, I think it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I also got dark circle under my right eye.  </li>
      <li>I had a major allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably helping that I&#x27;m no longer obsessively plucking them, but there&#x27;s definitely a difference in their thickness, and while they&#x27;re not nearly as thick yet as they were before I started plucking them, they&#x27;re noticeable enough that I don&#x27;t have to use the eyebrow pencil anymore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered a natural mascara that does not bother my eyes.</li>
      <li>so i stopped it immediately, also made my under eyes having new lines that i never seen before and made it dry.</li>
      <li>I use Stiletto to give it a more dramatic effect...</li>
      <li>&amp; I saw results within 3 weeks, although only it made my lashes long, not thick.</li>
      <li>It does sting a little after putting it on, it was tolerable at first</li>
      <li>There was a little bit of puffyness around my eyes the first week.</li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;m Asian and my lashes are hidden under my eyelid.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m Asian and my lashes are hidden under my eyelid.  They are sparse and not very long at all.  I read several reviews regarding RapidLash and of course was skeptical, but given the price here (less $10 than the usual $49.99) was what sold me. I promptly began using the product following the directions 5/27 and although only a week has gone by, I&#x27;ve already seen a difference in the length of the lashes on my right eye.  They are longer and actually curling upwards, something that is nonexistent because most Asian lashes point out straight.  I have hopes for my left eyelashes, so am looking forward to the 4th week of this regiment. Just remember to not over apply the substance, as after it dries, it can flake off, which happened to me.  Follow the directions and hope it works for you  :)  I so far have not experienced any itchiness/irritation, although when I applied it to my lower lashline, it was slightly pink.  In my case, however, it just looks like eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 6 weeks and it works.  My lashes are longer, thicker and darker.  My eyebrows also have filled in and are much darker than before.  I have blond hair and blue eyes so the darker brows were a little startling at first, but it&#x27;s better than the sparse, straggly, patchy, almost invisible brows I&#x27;ve always had.  I&#x27;ve noticed very slight under-eye darkening but nothing dramatic that can&#x27;t be fixed with a little make-up.  The trade off for noticeably longer, thicker lashes is worth it, plus once you&#x27;re happy with the improvement, you only use it once or twice a week to maintain, so I would think any under-eye darkening would begin to fade.  Also, very slight burning sensation the first few applications until your lids adjust to the serum.  I have no discomfort now.  Hope it works for you like it has for me.  I&#x27;m thrilled to have lashes again and real eyebrows for the first time in my life.  Wanted to add, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found for this product.  Retail stores charge $50.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin, realtively short blonde eyelashes. With that Latise perscription eyelash stuff on tv I saw other over the counter stuff begin to pop up and I began to hope that maybe there was something affordable that would work to increase and/or grow my lashes. I decided on this product because it seemed a decent price, the ingredients were mostly natural, and the feedback was mostly good. I applied a good amount every night on the lash line, and it did take about two months to really see results, but guess what...it does get results!!! My lashes are a third to two thirds longer and thicker, and that is a definite improvement. It has been three months now and I continue to see results. There was a little bit of puffyness around my eyes the first week. No reddness or irritation or anything like that..just a slight puffiness that only I noticed because I look at myself everyday, and I usually am very sensitive to things. My lashes are coming in a little darker then my normal blonde which is cool. With blonde lashes you don&#x27;t get much definition around the eyes unless you put on mascara, and I don&#x27;t feel like putting mascara on all the time. My lashes are also curling up slightly in a gorgeous way, giving me a natural sweep of lashes that you might get with a lash curler, which I never use because that&#x27;s too harsh on them.   I am also using a natural mascara, with things like rosemary in it, which I think has been helping to continue to nourish my lashes. The brand is Honeybee Gardens: Tuly Natural Mascara and I bought it from Amazon as well. It doesn&#x27;t clump on my thinner lashes, but it does flake a little after a while like any non waterproof mascara. Not bad at all though compared to the many of the millions of other kinds of store and boutique brands I&#x27;ve tried. I recently tried some waterproof regular store brand mascara for a beach trip and I ended up washing off a bunch of my lashes with the mascara every night, so if you are looking to grow and keepmore lashes you might want to look into non-water proof and/or natural mascaras for normal day wear. Of course I still keep the waterproof stuff for those days/ocassions I need it. I hope this helps someone try this...from someone who tries to do the more natural route and doesn&#x27;t hope for much, I was greatly supprised and very very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Works great - I never had bottom lashes and my top lashes were very short. I&#x27;ve def been getting some attention with my new lashes</li>
    <li> This product was strange.  It worked for my daughter but not at all for me.  I purchased it on Amazon and when I told the seller they said that it works with some people&#x27;s chemistry but not others.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, then it should be returnable.  I want to spend my money on things I know will really work.  This is a hit or miss.  Not worth the 50% gamble.</li>
    <li> I start using it from one and half week and may be I am the only one who is noticing the difference but it seem like it is making my eyelasher grow or may be darker. So far I am sure it I continue use it it will work and I have no red eye or itching with this product.</li>
    <li> I used to have fake eyelashes...the ones that are put on individually. After a year or so I quit getting them. If you&#x27;ve ever had false eyelashes put on regularly, you know that your real eyelashes fall out. I tried this product hoping it would speed up the growth of my eyelashes. It worked. My lashes definitely grew in length. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t make my lashes any thicker or darker than they were before the fake ones, just longer. Also, I noticed that under my eyes did get dark. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it was worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in a different site, i was so excited when it came but then when i applied it that night, the next day when i woke up i notice around my eyes look reddish, i looked sick. I don&#x27;t know if that was normal so i stopped it immediately, also made my under eyes having new lines that i never seen before and made it dry. But i will try it at my eyebrow and see what happens so far i haven&#x27;t had any bad signs reacting to it with the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Rapid Lash because #1 i have short and straight lashes and #2 I got something stuck in my eye and i lost some lashes from rubbing them too hard. I used the product everyday for 8 weeks. I did notice that it made my lashes grow longer after about 3 weeks. However unlike other customers who say their lashes now touch their eyeglass lenses etc. for me the results weren&#x27;t significant; without mascara it wasnt noticable. It does sting a little after putting it on, it was tolerable at first but it didnt go away and my eyes always felt heavy and tired because of it. It did not improve the thickness which what i was really hoping for. I did see new lashes growing in the corners of my eyes but it didnt help to fill in the gaps where i was missing lashes from before. They looked long but very thin, sparse and weak. What upset me the most was that during the time i was using it my lashes became brittle and fell/broke off more often than before. One day while gently removing my eye makeup i lost most of the longer lashes that took me 8 weeks to grow. Extremely dissapointed and I wont be getting this product again. I am now trying Enormous Lash hoping it will give better results, if not i&#x27;ll keep looking. Yes Rapid Lash is cheaper than most other eyelash serums out there but I would rather pay more money for a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> Has been four weeks and I see no change at all in my lashs or eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I have been using RapidLash for about a month now and my eyelashes are SIGNIFICANTLY longer!!! I am a true skeptic and I hardly ever buy into such products or their gimmicks, but I decided to try RapidLash because I use waterproof mascara alot and saw my lashes slowly dwindling away...I actually noticed a difference within the first 4 days of using the product! My lashes are longer, but since I&#x27;m asian, they are super straight, so they have not grown up and curled much, but so far, I am extremely happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone interested.  I was also wondering if anyone reading this has any recommendations for amazing mascaras that they LOVE??? A problem I run into is that after I curl mine, they look great, but then when I apply the mascara, they straighten out after drying...just a side note. 5 stars for RapidLash and I am getting ready to order some more right now~ :)</li>
    <li> My eyebrow saga began at the tender age of 14, when I had absolutely no clue how to pluck my eyebrows, and I decided that it was time for me to do them myself. What wound up happening after that was a six year battle with my eyebrows that ended with me having nearly no eyebrows left due to my attempts to fix my prior mistakes. Over the past year or so, it got so bad that I wound up having to draw them on, which was such a pain to do every morning, and it kept me from doing things like swimming for fear that they would melt down my face. I decided that enough was enough, and I decided to try Rapid Lash. I had heard some great things about it, and being a college student, I decided to buy it online since it was twenty dollars cheaper. I started using it the night it arrived in the mail, and Oh. My. God. It hasn&#x27;t even been two weeks yet and I&#x27;m already seeing a HUGE difference. It&#x27;s probably helping that I&#x27;m no longer obsessively plucking them, but there&#x27;s definitely a difference in their thickness, and while they&#x27;re not nearly as thick yet as they were before I started plucking them, they&#x27;re noticeable enough that I don&#x27;t have to use the eyebrow pencil anymore. Thank the gods for Rapid Lash!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff! I&#x27;m only 25 but I just had a baby and my eye lashes disappeared during pregnancy and have never come back. I started rapid lash about 6 weeks ago...and wow!! My eye lashes are long and thick and look like they did when I was in high school!! I&#x27;m never going to stop using this stop! It does take a long time to see a difference, 6 weeks, but it&#x27;s so worth it. It&#x27;s also something you can&#x27;t miss - you have to do it every single night or it won&#x27;t work. But if you can do that - then you&#x27;re golden and i promise you&#x27;ll be happy. I never had any eye lid darkening or even side effects at all. Sometimes my eye lid would itch a bit but nothing I even thought twice about. BUY IT if you want beautiful eye lashes!!</li>
    <li> Decided to try this with the hope of not having to wear eye makeup all the time. Found out about it from a well known host on a morning show. Have been using it for about 4 weeks now.  No irritation at all.  My lashes are dark anyway but what I have seen is a darker appearance along the lash line so it looks like I have liner on :-).  My eye brows are quite thick so no need there but I have lightly put some on lower eye lids as well. Since the price has come down on this, I think it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and did get eyelash growth after at least four weeks, but it was growning toward my nose. Mascara would coax it out, but an hour later it would be going the wrong way again. Obviously I do not recommend this product. I gave the 2nd tube to a friend, but do not know if she used it.  My brows may have gotten fuller, but then I had to pluck them for they were under and over my brows and also too dark and some were too long.  I also got dark circle under my right eye.  My crooked lashes are still there after stopping the product a month ago. I assume they will eventully grow in the correct way.  I say, \\&quot;Stay Away.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I abosolutely love this stuff. My lashes are much better. I brush on a few strokes of mascara now and voilà, lots of lashes.  I used to dread the eye makeup routine because of the lash thing. Before it would take me 15 minutes just to do the mascara. Now I&#x27;m in and out in a minute! I&#x27;m using it on my over-plucked brows too. So far it&#x27;s filling in but very light however, I&#x27;ve been doing the brows for a shorter period of time. It took about 3 weeks to see some lash results, just FYI.</li>
    <li> I have always had short thin lashes. I have been using this for 2 months and the difference is significant-more so in length than thickness but both are noticeable. I can see my lashes without a mirror! I will be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian, and so naturally I have very short and thin eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve always wanted longer and thicker lashes and have even contemplated the idea of getting them individually glued on.  I did my research and tried Ardell first, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I&#x27;ve been using 2 1/2 months and my lashes are noticeably longer.  When I first bought the product, I told myself I wouldn&#x27;t write a review unless my husband noticed, because he hardly notices things like when I get a hair cut.  One day he looked at me and asked me if I was wearing fake lashes.  I was sooooo ecstatic!  It has lengthened my lashes noticeably.  The thickness isn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d hoped for, but I am very happy with the end results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading all the great reviews. I have been using this product for 5 weeks and I have not had even the slightest results.  Sooooo disappointed!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes have been growing like weeds!  I use it every night, only on the top lashes. It&#x27;s been almost 2 months and I feel like they are still getting longer by the day. I no longer need to use a curler - they curl by themselves now and they NEVER did that. They were short/medium length and now they are without a doubt long. And also darker and fuller. It makes such a difference. I&#x27;m hooked and for fear of losing these new lashes, which honestly feel like someone else&#x27;s lashes, I plan to continue to use the product nightly. It&#x27;s become part of my routine and is just too easy not to - takes only a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t burn at all. I started noticing the change after about a week and a half. My sister started it at the same time as me and has also had the exact same effects. It&#x27;s a must try.</li>
    <li> I didnt know that my lashes would grow as I am such a skeptic...but this stuff really works as long as you use it EVERY night. Just a few more weeks and I will be on the maintenance use. This product lasts 3+ months when used daily on upper lash line only.Expect to last less if you line both lashlines and brows.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to notice a tiny difference within 4 weeks(new lash growth), but now @ 10 weeks, I am astonished! I dont wear makeup everyday, so I havent been really paying too much attention to my lashes as I expected this product to be a complete FAIL. But I bought some new mascara the other day and curled my lashes...wow! The tips of my lashes now reach the end of the lash curler.(That is the best way I can measure their growth)&lt;br /&gt;When I put on the mascara I was not sure I was believing what i saw.But they are longer and thicker. My lashes are naturally blond and this has also made them darker.Still have to wear mascara to see them though.That is just me.&lt;br /&gt;Getting ready to order my second tube for maintenance after a few more weeks of regular use. Remember to use this daily if you want to see results. I would even say be patient and wait for the 8 week mark to notice a real difference.This is a great alternative to the expensive Latisse and LiLash.Give it a try...it seems to work for alot of people.</li>
    <li> I had a major allergic reaction. I used the product about 20 hours ago before bed. My eyes were bloodshot in the am. I washed off the stuff and used eye drops.     My eyelids have been getting more and more red all day. Now the redness (verging on purple) is going more than half way up toward my brows and is getting progressively worse.    I&#x27;m very disappointed. But, I do have reactions to products. This is just more extreme than I thought might happen.     It did arrive very quickly and in perfect conditon.     I think I&#x27;ll go light a candle for peace now.</li>
    <li> Thanks to all of the previous reviewers. I&#x27;ll add my two cents  enthusiastically: it works, it really works! Longer, thicker, more  feminine lashes for my beautiful brown eyes!</li>
    <li> Almost 300 positive reviews... surely it works, right? Yes, it did for me &amp; I saw results within 3 weeks, although only it made my lashes long, not thick. Don&#x27;t put too much or it will sting your eyes some. My lashes are straight as a pin, &amp; after RapidLash making it longer, I still have to use curlers to shape it up. I use Stiletto to give it a more dramatic effect... I get lots of compliments. Best of all, it feels natural &amp; I don&#x27;t have to worry about \\&quot;false lashes\\&quot; falling off one eye on occasion like when you&#x27;re in the water, etc.</li>
    <li> I have blue eyes and was afraid to use any of the serums for fear it would change my eyes brown. But I have a hypo-thyroid and have gone thru menopause early, both leaving me with thin, short lashes.  I had heard RapidLash did not contain the Rx ingredient that some of the others did. I used it for about 4 weeks and noticed a significant change in the thickness of my eyelashes.  After 7 weeks they were noticably longer. I&#x27;ve been using it for around 9-10 weeks now and people are actually asking me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes! I have not noticed any change in my lash color, darker.  I&#x27;m very blonde and my eyelashes are also. Maybe I&#x27;ll see that change in the next few weeks. I love it!!  And I love the fact that I can find it on Amazon.com for far less than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an almost 60 year old who had to stop wearing mascara and powdered shadow after a serious eye infection. Eventually I was able to find a cream shadow but was unable to find a mascara that I could tolerate. After 2 years of this, I decided to try this product. I was skeptical since my eyes are so sensitive. The first week the product burned a little but not as much as I expected, especially as I became more adept at applying the serum.     After a month, I could tell a difference in the length of my upper lashes. Not that anyone would mistake them for false eyelashes. Then I started using the serum on both the upper and lower lashes. After almost 3 months of nightly use, I can tell a definite difference in the length of my lashes, again not like false eyelashes but very nice eyelashes. My lower lashes are longer than my upper lashes were for years. I had almost no side effects other than initial minor burning and cannot see any discoloring on the eyelids or under the eyes.     I cannot tell much difference in the fullness of the lashes, just the length, but I&#x27;ll take whatever I can get.I&#x27;ve recently discovered a natural mascara that does not bother my eyes. So now when I curl my lashes and use the mascara, my eyes really pop like they never have. When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I just apply shadow and bottom liner and curl the upper lashes, for a really nice look too.    I&#x27;m still on my first tube after 3 months and it seems to be pretty full. While it seems expensive at first, if a tube lasts 3 to 5 months you&#x27;re not spending that much each month on the serum. I&#x27;ve already ordered another tube and will always keep it on hand in the future.</li>
