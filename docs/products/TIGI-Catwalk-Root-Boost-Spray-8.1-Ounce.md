      <li>Really bumps up my roots, no other product that I have tried has been able to do that!</li>
      <li>To get the best effect you should blow dry and style, but even if you don&#x27;t and just air dry, you still get added volume using this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Poor instant fluff I will be back</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this helps look like I have lots more hair than I actually have. I spray it on the roots in the key areas, massage into the scalp area and blow dry. Hair appears thicker and has more body. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Its not doing what it suppose to do. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> My go to product to create volume</li>
    <li> does exactly what it is to do! Great product</li>
    <li> Gel leaves my hair too &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, so to hold it in place I use hair spray. And my stylist uses this, good enough for me. Nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
    <li> I like this on days where I feel a little hair-flat.  Its not super effective, just like a sprayable mousse.  but in general it gets the job done.  I just wouldnt really prioritize this over say a normal mousse.  Its average.</li>
    <li> If you have thin fine hair like myself this is the trick for you.  I spray it when my hair is wet and blowdry and brush straight.  I love how  my hair sits and I get compliments all the time.  It also helps with my roots that are a tad grown out.</li>
    <li> I really like this...gives my hair body and a nice shine.</li>
    <li> TIGI Catwalk &amp;#34;Your Highness&amp;#34; Root Boost Spray is the best of the best.  Goes in easy, dries without clumping, holds for hours.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. Lifts roots without any gunky or sticky feeling. And keeps working throughout the day. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Awesome, would buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60+ and have tried many, many hair products that allege to add thickness &amp; volume to thin hair.  Most of them produced no discernible  results.&lt;br /&gt;This product actually works!  It makes my hair look full, bouncy &amp; slightly thicker.  That&#x27;s all I could reasonably expect. I would definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> This product was reasonably priced and works great! With only 3-4 squirts around the crown, it gives my fine hair lots of body at the roots.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my GF and her hair doesn&#x27;t look any different, so I guess this product works fine. I will say that it is cheaper here then you can find at any local retailer.</li>
    <li> For me, one of the better root boosters and certainly a better price than others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it would work even better if I actually used it with the blow dryer, but I only partially dry my hair before I walk the dog, so I put it on before I use the flat iron and it still works pretty good.</li>
    <li> This product will keep your hair voluminized for days!  Just a few spritzes into your roots and volume, volume, volume.  You will not have to reapply until your wash your hair again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it really does what it says and will last a long time as you need very little f or lots of volume and it washes out easily!!! I love it as well as many salons do and use it!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at TJ Maxx about 4 months ago and was surprisingly pleased with the results after the first use. I&#x27;m a hair product junkie and have tried everything in all price ranges on my colored, very fine hair that tends to not hold volume no matter what I try. I will continue to use this product daily on my damp hair. Not sure if I will purchase it through Amazon or get it the next time I find it at TJ Maxx (which is always a hit or miss with hair products, but I know their product shipment arrival days and plan accordingly). As always, Amazon&#x27;s price is very comparable, but I&#x27;ve noticed some differences in the content quality of SOME of Amazon&#x27;s other hair products(also noticed the same with their perfume/fragrances)that I&#x27;ve purchased that do not appear to work or smell the same as the salon/beauty store (or department store perfume) that I had originally purchased. It concerns me that some of the products are not as expected, which could be due to a number of things such as product age, or product ingredient change (or defect?) by the manufacturer. None the less, I really like this TIGI Catwalk root spray and will purchase it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I think this product works well..I only want a little height/ boost &amp; this does that job...I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works wonders - I could not believe the difference this product made in my hair. Definitely added much more volume than I have had with any other root lifter...this would get 10 stars from me if it could.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of great reviews about this product before purchasing, and unfortunately was even more greatly disappointed with the results (or lack thereof). I used this &#x27;root boosting&#x27; spray on wet hair, parting off sections and spraying it on my roots, followed by blow drying, as directed, but saw no difference in volume whatsoever. Other reviewers rave that this product doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or gross feeling to the touch, or even weigh down fine hair (like my own). This is true, because this product does nothing! It doesn&#x27;t even leave a scent! I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use many Catwalk products and have never been disappointed with any of them.</li>
    <li> Dont use too much, little bit does best.</li>
    <li> This is now and has been a repeat buy. Great product.Wife&amp;#34;s hairdresser asked her what she was doing and said &amp;#34;who cares keep doing it!&#x27; Now she hears others in the salon talking about it over the big brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my super silky hair. I don&#x27;t necessarily have fine hair but once it&#x27;s straightened, it lies flat and this adds just the right amount of boost that is noticeable. It won&#x27;t make it giant like you teased it or anything but will add a little oomph!</li>
    <li> Best lift ever....you can not go wrong</li>
    <li> The product works but not as well as the old formula of TIGI Catwalk Root Boost. Still it works and holds.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price. Helps get hair at the roots lifted and adds a just the right amount of body.</li>
    <li> I normally have flat hair it doesn&#x27;t matter if I try to wear my hair straight or curly it pretty much sticks to my head. If I use this spray I actually have lift, volume and texture. It really works well.</li>
    <li> Boosts the roots!  But it can be a little drying, so try to stay ONLY on the roots.</li>
    <li> I love big, poofy hair. I love products that help me achieve that! I love products that are fast, efficient. I like products that allow me to do my hair and make it look good even while I have kids tugging at each pant leg while the dog is trying to run out the front door and the stove is boiling over. This is NOT that product. I was highly disappointed. I love TIGI and thought this would be amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer sprays too much product even when you try really hard to do a light spray. This gets your hair totally wet and soaked in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volume this creates? Pretty much none in my hair. A hair thickening powder works much better. Heck, their dry spay shampoo works way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray does smell decent, though not nearly as good as TIGI&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a brighter note, this product will last forever because you&#x27;ll never want to bother with it again.</li>
    <li> my second order to obviously I&#x27;m satisfied. My hair has become limp and thinner due to aging. This stuff really works</li>
    <li> Did not receive this item was replaced with Big Sexy Hair.  Didn&#x27;t return it to busy. Product is ok but would of preferred with what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product,it does give you a lift even when you don&#x27;t blow dry your hair after application. I used it on wet hair. I squirted a little just at my hairline, and at my crown, and let it air dry. The nozzle is perfect for targeted application. It boosts your hair as it dries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few root lifters over the years and this one, by far, is the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, thin hair with zero body.&lt;br /&gt;This not only does the job, but has a very pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with this for the price !</li>
    <li> Very good item just as advertised quick delivery</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, does not go well with fine hair.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite root boosts! Works great and really does give my hair a good lift. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is ok but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Bought this as good reviews. I think I like treseme better but still use this on occasion. The spray can is nice as you can put it where you want it!</li>
    <li> Love this to add volume without weight.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very fine hair and it really gives my hair volume for the whole day.</li>
    <li> works well to give volume to fine, thin hair without weighing it down or making it crunchy. i&#x27;ve been a tigi fan for years and this is yet another reason why they&#x27;re one of the best in their field.</li>
    <li> This is asbsolutely the best root booster I have found. There is no stickiness at all! It just gives my fine straight hair the appearance of volume. You have to try this item.....</li>
    <li> Love how this lifts my &amp;#34;coarse,heavy hair&amp;#34;.  The smell is just a little funky but the product does what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair, with not much body at all. I definitely notice the difference when I use the root booster vs. when I don&#x27;t. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have horribly fine, thin, straight hair. Catwalk Your Highness Root Boost Spray is the ONLY thing that has ever worked. I&#x27;m addicted to this product! It makes me look like I actually have thick hair! It is a HUGE help in styling. I live in Louisiana, so humidity is a real problem for me. However, when I use the Root Boost Spray, it&#x27;s not even an issue. My hair stays full-looking all day. I have tried many, MANY products to help my \\&quot;frog hair\\&quot; but this spray is the only thing that has ever worked without weighing my hair down and making it flat in an hour. TRY IT! You won&#x27;t be sorry!! The bonus is that you can buy it here at Amazon for a good bit less than you can in a salon.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I found that it smelled different than my previous can.  I also noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t respond well to it.  I looked it up and found that the can Tigi sells is 8.1 oz.  The can I received is actually 8.5 oz. even though the description says 8.1 oz.  Tigi does not make an 8.5 oz. can.  I&#x27;m quite sure this is a knock-off Tigi product.  Amazon did refund my money when I contacted them.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This item do not boost my hair, it looks good for the first hour but then it&#x27;s flat and seems weighted down.</li>
    <li> I used this and went out into the rain and humidity and my hair remained full. I teased slightly at the crown and that stayed as well. It does not feel like you have anything in your hair but it works. My hair felt and looked fuller and thicker at the scalp then with any root booster I have tried.  Good product so far.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine &amp; a bit stringy. Just cut it very short. This product gives my hair perfect long lasting body without buildup. Hair still looks good day 2. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works well in fine hair. I received the product before expected. It was packaged well. I will order from same company again.</li>
    <li> I have fine and thin hair and have tried every root boost product sold. This is by far my favorite. It adds volume without gummy or stickiness. It leaves your hair lightweight and bouncy.</li>
    <li> Does not smell good at all</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser for my thin, fine hair. Regular mousse was weighing it down, so I was having to use lots of hairspray to give it any kind of lift. I am now having good hair days and receiving compliments on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this product but every time I use it my hair looks flatter than with no product and gets really greasy.  I have fairly thick, course hair and often use these types of products with varying degrees of success, but this one does the OPPOSITE of what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Loved this product~ Works well with longer hair. I&#x27;ve found this product is complimented with additional hair styling products and a good quality blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Great product, horrible packing</li>
    <li> Not a spray like I thought. Dont really like it.  Not a true root booster more like a mouse. Grrr</li>
    <li> Really bumps up my roots, no other product that I have tried has been able to do that!</li>
    <li> I have used this hair product for 20+ yrs and love it! TIGI is my favorite hair product that I will always use!</li>
    <li> I have very short fine hair and when I spray this in my damp hair and blow dry, it is like my hair doubled in volume. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair. I have tried others but came back to this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product, helps boost those roots and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is great! If your flat hair needs a lift, it&#x27;s worth buying! It actually works!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of this product because not only does it boost your roots, it gives your hair texture throughout.  I have fine, limp hair and this is the one product that works for me.  To get the best effect you should blow dry and style, but even if you don&#x27;t and just air dry, you still get added volume using this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite boost.  For an old lady with thinning hair this is a real good thing</li>
    <li> does not really work as well as i had hoped on my fine and thin hair, does smell good though</li>
