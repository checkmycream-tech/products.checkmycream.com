      <li>(Kiss My Face Fragrance-Free Olive &amp; Aloe Moisturizer, also sold on Amazon), and my face has felt nice and moisturized all day (without any greasiness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice consistency and fragrance.</li>
      <li>The price is great, I got in on the special.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best skin care I have used.</li>
      <li>Then I couldn&#x27;t believe the reviews, because it WAS so inexpensive they seemed too good to be true.</li>
      <li>And I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>but then it might cost more</li>
      <li>These products are great and they really do make a difference in my skin.</li>

      <li>I LOVE these creams.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>My skin is smoother and has more even skin tone.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m sure you will love the product.</li>
      <li>My skin has a more radiant glow and healthier look.</li>
      <li>At this time I will not purchase again, because I found something I like better for my skin..</li>
      <li>Of the three, I especially like the Best Wrinkle Cream.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>They are okay.</li>
      <li>I have been using the products for about 10 days and my skin looks so much better</li>
      <li>I am so glad I happened upon this site.  </li>
      <li>It is okay</li>
      <li>cuz it&#x27;s nice to be able to actually afford nice, organic and functional product without going broke!</li>
      <li>There were some other products that seemed good with great reviews</li>
      <li>this is the best skin care I have tried yet, iam 64 and have been careful with my skin always.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is great for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I followed the directions, using a warm washcloth to wipe off the cleanser (which was pretty sticky but effective and moisturizing), and then applied the moisture lock (I seem to need more than it says to use to get my whole face</li>
      <li>so this is fine.</li>
      <li>I can see the difference on the texture and fine lines.</li>
      <li>off.&lt;br /&gt;regardless awaiting for them to be available again.</li>
      <li>Customer service is also fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I received the product very promptly and even received a follow up email to make sure I was satisfied with the product.  </li>
      <li>Wrinkles are significantly minimized.</li>
      <li>Even though they say so and to wash it off with a cloth, my skin never feels clean afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I just try to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>I love a company that is so responsive to their clients and puts so much pride into their product and company.  </li>
      <li>But I wrote to the company, and received very prompt, sincere feedback,</li>
      <li>Overall a good moisturizer and cleanser for your face.</li>
      <li>My skin looks so good after using this trio, I wish I had this when I was in my twenties, I could have gone without foundation, but now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I need a little more help with my pores.</li>
      <li>because I am certain of the ingredient I have allergy to because of my skin&#x27;s reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Update...the owner of the company emailed and phoned with apology and refunded my purchase price without any contact from me requesting it!!</li>
      <li>The products have a very minimal, pleasant odor, and that is a huge plus in my book, and I find the packaging to be aesthetically</li>
      <li>Love the light, natural scent, although I don&#x27;t think these are scented, I believe it is the aroma of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>Obviously a very conscientious business owner!!</li>
      <li>And the  most important aspect was obviously the price.</li>
      <li>Love that this product has no harsh scents (the Quench has a faint hint of rose, one of my favorite scents), it cleans well and my skin always feels nice after each step.</li>
      <li>and I used it pretty much right away.</li>
      <li>This is a very gentle product.</li>
      <li>I am 62 years old and have very fair, very dry, sensitive skin</li>
      <li>, my e-mail was personally responded to and a more then generous solution was made.  </li>
      <li>I have issues with dryness on areas on my face this time of year and my face is consistently smooth, hydrated, and soft.</li>
      <li>and I just saw wrinkles for the first time</li>
      <li>No more dry spots, age spots from too much sun disappearing, my skin feels wonderful.  </li>
      <li>The skin on my neck was becoming embarrassing to me, but in only a few days it is so much better!  </li>
      <li>You can tell that they really care about their product.  </li>
      <li>I use it at night only and in the morning my face looks and feels smooth and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Downside is the packaging leaves much to be desired.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really care for the product.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is really, really like wax.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products!</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that they use truly natural ingredients which was an essential part of my search.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something I could use on a daily basis to clean my face without drying it or making it oily.  </li>
      <li>The cleanser is probably not something you would use if you have been playing around in the mud but is good if you have sensitive skin, especially in the winter as it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
      <li>The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are decreased, my skin looks brighter and more luminous, and the splotches on my forehead that I have had for years are almost gone.</li>
      <li>The fine lines and dry patches/flaky spots are gone!</li>
      <li>When you use it less is better.</li>
      <li>in fact I think it is much better, much less oily.</li>
      <li>My skin looked better and overall appearance was definitely improved.  </li>
      <li>used this product last night for the first time and have already seen a difference TODAY!</li>
      <li>(those angry 11&#x27;s) Great product.</li>
      <li>When I wrote to them they got back to me that day and said they were sending a new bottle right away.</li>
      <li>I look 50 according to my new doctor.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and hydrated from using this product, and I do believe it is making a difference on my deep wrinkles and definitely is on the fine lines.  </li>
      <li>With the exemplary customer service they display, I am confident that if you were not happy with the product, they would make it right.  </li>
      <li>I am a 44 yr old women and wish I would have found these products 20 yrs ago!</li>
      <li>I have only been using this product for a little over a week, but I must say I love what it&#x27;s doing.</li>
      <li>I have used these products for only 5 days and my skin is so soft, wrinkles much reduced.  </li>
      <li>and I have been looking for a natural product that I could trust.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these products! My skin looks younger and smoother. These products are great and they really do make a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I am also wary of chemical laden products. These products work beautifully. My skin looks and feels great! It takes very little product and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews. This product is amazing. I am 58 and was having all of the skin issues to go along with my age. I have been using the 3 products for 10 days. My skin is clear and the uneven color is gone. It has literally taken years off my appearance in just 10days. I ordered an extra supply. When you use it less is better. I have only been using the process at night.</li>
    <li> The cleanser is really, really like wax.  Even though they say so and to wash it off with a cloth, my skin never feels clean afterwards.  The serum isn&#x27;t too bad, but I&#x27;ve had better.  Try Avia&#x27;s instead.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is great for my skin.  The cleanse removes my eye makeup very well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. I love how my skin feels afterwards!!</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle product. Wrinkles are significantly minimized. I have rosacea and blepharitis. Both&lt;br /&gt;have not flared up since I&#x27;ve been using these products. I LOVE these creams.  The creams are odorless and so&lt;br /&gt;gentle! I&#x27;ve doubled my reorder!</li>
    <li> Love that this product has no harsh scents (the Quench has a faint hint of rose, one of my favorite scents), it cleans well and my skin always feels nice after each step. I use it at night only and in the morning my face looks and feels smooth and refreshed. The nights I skip washing my face, I always regret it in the morning. I tend to have oily t-zone area, but the Erase moisturizer doesn&#x27;t make it worse, in fact I think it is much better, much less oily. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Customer service is great.  You can tell that they really care about their product.  The products themselves are quite good.  The cleanser is probably not something you would use if you have been playing around in the mud but is good if you have sensitive skin, especially in the winter as it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.  The serum and cream moisturize well.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for only 5 days and my skin is so soft, wrinkles much reduced.  The skin on my neck was becoming embarrassing to me, but in only a few days it is so much better!  Customer service is also fantastic.  I had a packaging issue.  When I wrote to them they got back to me that day and said they were sending a new bottle right away. I already know I will be using these products for a long time.  What more could you ask for? Organic, great ingredients (and nothing toxic), incredible price and wonderful customer service, and they work.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something I could use on a daily basis to clean my face without drying it or making it oily.  These products used together are very effective for good cleansing and for anti-aging.  I can tell a difference overall, and was really amazed when I saw some pics from before I started using it and after I did.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my appearance after using the products.  My skin looked better and overall appearance was definitely improved.  The price was excellent and it was all easy to use and effective.  I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed, the serum is thick and too gooey, and none of the products smell nice. I used it anyway, hoping to see  some improvements in my skin, did not jappen</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price definitely worth trying. I would give it five stars but I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month and I am not sure of the long term results. Overall a good moisturizer and cleanser for your face.</li>
    <li> I Loved the lotion and the aloe vera moisturizer. used them everyday until gone.&lt;br /&gt;I only used the cleanser once - it felt unnatural and as if I had a thick layer of wax all over my face that was clogging my pores and i couldn&#x27;t get it off.&lt;br /&gt;regardless awaiting for them to be available again.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to this, but that is not why I give it low stars. If it had an ingredient list I probably would have known I was allergic and wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it...because I am certain of the ingredient I have allergy to because of my skin&#x27;s reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Update...the owner of the company emailed and phoned with apology and refunded my purchase price without any contact from me requesting it!! Obviously a very conscientious business owner!! There are ingredient lists for the serum and the toner, but I did not see it for Erase, the one I had reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;So I have increased star rating for customer service, et. al.</li>
    <li> very good, love it! I reordered</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really care for the product.</li>
    <li> I used the products for a month . They are okay. Of the three, I especially like the Best Wrinkle Cream. At this time I will not purchase again, because I found something I like better for my skin..</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for about ten days now. My skin looks so good after using this trio, I wish I had this when I was in my twenties, I could have gone without foundation, but now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I need a little more help with my pores. A younger person could definitely find themselves not needing makeup when using these. Love the light, natural scent, although I don&#x27;t think these are scented, I believe it is the aroma of the ingredients. A little bit goes a long way with these as well. Very happy with my results, and love the price point. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding vegan (it does have beeswax in it, so some vegans might not consider it \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;), natural skincare products free of parabens and all of that nasty stuff. I also like that the company is cruelty-free, and uses sustainable practices. The products have a very minimal, pleasant odor, and that is a huge plus in my book, and I find the packaging to be aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product last night for the first time and have already seen a difference TODAY! I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible!! I have issues with dryness on areas on my face this time of year and my face is consistently smooth, hydrated, and soft. The fine lines and dry patches/flaky spots are gone! I followed the directions, using a warm washcloth to wipe off the cleanser (which was pretty sticky but effective and moisturizing), and then applied the moisture lock (I seem to need more than it says to use to get my whole face and it&#x27;s probably the smallest of the containers so we&#x27;ll see how that works out...) and then the erase cream. This morning I only wiped my face with water, then applied the moisture lock, followed by my lotion (Kiss My Face Fragrance-Free Olive &amp; Aloe Moisturizer, also sold on Amazon), and my face has felt nice and moisturized all day (without any greasiness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product, especially at the current price - it seems like a steal! I am going to order more (lest the price go up before I do so) and will update with my observations over a longer span of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also listed on Amazon here, with additional reviews: [[ASIN:B00DQBYLEQ Moisturizing Wrinkle Cleanser anti aging sensitive]]</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago. I have tried everything with just about the same old results.  This is much different!  My face immediately felt quenched and with each day I noticed a difference. No more dry spots, age spots from too much sun disappearing, my skin feels wonderful.  I highly recommend these products!</li>
    <li> I ordered these products because, after 4 months of the most brutal winter in 30 years, my skin was a mess. I am 62 years old and have very fair, very dry, sensitive skin and I have been looking for a natural product that I could trust. I admit that I was attracted to this item initially because of the price. Then I couldn&#x27;t believe the reviews, because it WAS so inexpensive they seemed too good to be true. But I wrote to the company, and received very prompt, sincere feedback, so I gave it a try. And I am so glad I did. I have been using the products for about 10 days and my skin looks so much better I cannot believe it myself. The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are decreased, my skin looks brighter and more luminous, and the splotches on my forehead that I have had for years are almost gone. I am REALLY impressed.  I will definitely be ordering these three products again and anything else Quench Organics makes that might work for me as well.</li>
    <li> I literally just got this yesterday but it feels so amazing on my skin that I felt I had to write a review. I also feel like I need to buy another set before the price goes back up as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27 and I just saw wrinkles for the first time so I figured it&#x27;s time to join the beauty rat race. After a few days of what seemed like endless research, I happened upon Quench. What really made me buy were the reviews, despite how few, were mostly positive and that the company took time to respond to each review. That made it seem like they care about their image and how their products represent them. So it made me think that they put that same effort into their products. And the  most important aspect was obviously the price. There were some other products that seemed good with great reviews but it&#x27;s hard to justify $40 for 2 ounces of cream that you&#x27;re not sure is going to work anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I got it and I used it pretty much right away. The way it feels on your face is just amazing. After just a day I can see my skin just feels healthier. I&#x27;m not sure how else to put it. I have very dry skin and I don&#x27;t have a beauty regiment, before this. I just try to keep it clean. Before there weren&#x27;t many problems but since the weather has been terrible and cold and dry, I&#x27;ve been developing dry patches and irritation on certain sensitive areas of my skin. I&#x27;ve been covering it up with bb cream and makeup but that hasn&#x27;t helped. After one application of the Quench system my face feels so moisturized and the dry patches of skin, I can&#x27;t even tell there was an issue. And it was pretty bad, I was asked if I had gotten burned. For that alone it deserves 5 stars. So that&#x27;s why I felt I had to write a review after only a day. I only wish they had a day cream to go with. I also love the fact that they use truly natural ingredients which was an essential part of my search.</li>
    <li> There is no info on the packaging. I am slightly suspicious that this product actually contains all the ingredients listed on the packaging. I feel duped into buying a product that claims to be organic but does not list manufacturer information.</li>
    <li> I would consider myself a facial  products junkie! I decided to try something different without the pricey namebrands. I have only been using these products for about a week and have noticed a difference already.My skin is smoother and has more even skin tone.My pores appear smaller to already! I am very happy with these products and the price is great! I am a 44 yr old women and wish I would have found these products 20 yrs ago! I just ordered another set. You will not be dissapointed with these products!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 yrs young and have used this product for only a week. I can see the difference on the texture and fine lines. My skin has a more radiant glow and healthier look. I&#x27;m ordering a set for my sister in law and another for myself. The price is great, I got in on the special. All 3 products for only $24. Get them while they last.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I love it. I have dry spots on my skin where it flakes and peels. Quench totally relieved the dryness and keeps my skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a week, but I must say I love what it&#x27;s doing. My face is ALWAYS so dry and flaky in the winter (we live in WI, so it&#x27;s been SO cold) I normally have to apply my face lotion a couple times in the morning to get that dry tight feeling to let up. Since I&#x27;ve been using this I have not had to do that at all and there have been some days that I haven&#x27;t had to put any on at all. I use the wash and serium in the mornings ( I have L&#x27;Bri products I use at night) and then I use the AWESOME creamy wrinkle cream at night after I shower. My face feels smoother and I can already see a reduction in some of the really deep set wrinkles I have on my forehead, around my mouth and above my nose (those angry 11&#x27;s) Great product. Hope that this price is a long standing one cuz it&#x27;s nice to be able to actually afford nice, organic and functional product without going broke!</li>
    <li> this is the best skin care I have tried yet, iam 64 and have been careful with my skin always. this is by far the best skin care I have used. wish the packaging was as wow as the product but then it might cost more so this is fine. I look 50 according to my new doctor. i&#x27;ll take that!!</li>
    <li> I am still in the first few weeks of using these products and I like them. Nice consistency and fragrance. One bottle is a bit hard to squeeze out, but I understand the company is going to remedy that in the next production.</li>
    <li> It is okay I have a hard time getting the cleanser out of the bottle, but the rest works fine. Now I am waiting for wrinkles to disappear.</li>
    <li> Just received that product opened up the erase wrinkle jar found out it wasn&#x27;t a full one but between a quarter to a third of the cream was missing . Not sure if it was resold after being used and returned or somebody just took some of it.I definitely purchased it as new but obviously something is wrong. I gave it five stars for now although I haven&#x27;t used it yet but will change the rate if I had to .</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin (Rosatia &amp; other issues) and there are very few products out there that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  After years of paying 100s of dollars for Lancome face products (the only brand I could find that didn&#x27;t bother my skin), I decided to do some research to try to find a product that was less expensive, but that would still be sensitive enough for my skin and have effective hydration and wrinkle reduction qualities.  My keyword search brought Quench Organics products up and when I saw the price I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I received the product very promptly and even received a follow up email to make sure I was satisfied with the product.  I used it for a couple of months and absolutely loved it!  It did not irritate my skin at all, and in fact, calmed my skin.  My skin feels so soft and hydrated from using this product, and I do believe it is making a difference on my deep wrinkles and definitely is on the fine lines.  A promotion was offered when the time came for me to order another set of Quench and I had issues with the promotion code.  I e-mailed the company and within the same hour, my e-mail was personally responded to and a more then generous solution was made.  I love a company that is so responsive to their clients and puts so much pride into their product and company.  I am so glad I happened upon this site.  I am a customer for life!  You really can&#x27;t go wrong by giving these products a try.  With the exemplary customer service they display, I am confident that if you were not happy with the product, they would make it right.  However, I&#x27;m sure you will love the product.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a good value. My wrinkles did improve a tiny bit after four weeks. All three formulas were soothing and non-irritating to my skin. Good that it contains no parabens (linked to causing cancer). Downside is the packaging leaves much to be desired. Since Erase and Quench contain antioxidants, they should be in a tube, to keep air away from product. The Cleanse and Quench bottles were so thick, I had a hard time squeezing &#x27;to dispense the product (and I have strong hands). Hope QuenchOrganics will rethink the packaging.</li>
