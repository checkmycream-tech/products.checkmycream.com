      <li>Easy to use and isn&#x27;t too greasy!</li>
      <li>It has a cooling sensation which is great when you are feeling hot from working out.</li>
      <li>AND IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE U PUT ON</li>
      <li>Im satisfied.</li>
      <li>A MUST HAVE AND SAFE TO PUT ON EVERYWHERE...</li>
      <li>I also make sure to rub the application spot for 60-90 seconds when I put it on.</li>
      <li>all i know is that i noticed a wonderful improvement almost immediately to those love handles after starting this cream.  </li>
      <li>Go to that website it will work better then this ever will.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and didn&#x27;t get results.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more</li>
      <li>The areas you apply it to sweat more.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>And my arms where jiggly more than before...</li>
      <li>Well I have used this for about a week now and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>This product was OK</li>
      <li>This product seems to do the trick for me, Ive been using it for close to six weeks and am satisfied.</li>
      <li>The smell is OK</li>
      <li>I personally love this product and have recommended it to others.</li>
      <li>but I was looking for something more affordable.</li>
      <li>great item fast shipping</li>
      <li>I have tried three or four of these cellulite creams, none magically take the cellulite away</li>
      <li>anyway i see a difference in my legs but the biggest change is the love handles around my waist</li>
      <li>There is a warming and cooling sensation that this lotion gives off and that made me feel like something was happening :) My opinion is that my belly looked firmer within days, but I was using a lot of the lotion.</li>
      <li>IAM NOW SEEING DEFINITION (MORE THAN</li>
      <li>Never twice a day (I forget about it in the morning, but haven&#x27;t missed many evenings.</li>
      <li>Its ok.</li>
      <li>cause i love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It worked just like I had hoped, and when we arrived at the lake I was able to take off my shirt with pride.</li>
      <li>so I make sure I do not run out.</li>
      <li>that said, it&#x27;s still a great product even if you don&#x27;t use it on a regimented schedule - \\&quot;slap it on\\&quot; before cardio or an intense weight lifting session, and you will SWEAT.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product a month back after using , i must say, i am thoroughly impressed by this lotion.</li>
      <li>In fact that&#x27;s probably my favorite aspect of the product.</li>
      <li>just so there would not be more people buying it... leave more for me</li>

      <li>but so far so good!</li>
      <li>The big thing I have noticed is that if you put this on your face it works amazingly!!</li>
      <li>VERY QUICK</li>
      <li>Murad&#x27;s own cellulite serum, which is generously sized and priced just higher than this one, rendered lots of complements from my husband</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a fine lotion.</li>
      <li>Super stoked!</li>
      <li>Didn’t see a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the tingling sensation.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I am fairly fit but have some light cellulite on my thighs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad to say that i will buy more soon,cause it really helps me.</li>
      <li>It does feel and smell great but feels like any regular rich moisturizing lotion UNLESS you exfoliate before applying it.</li>
      <li>Well, this is a first!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worthless product that doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular...but does help a little bit.</li>
    <li> I bought based on the reviews and when arrived timely I used the entire tube and did not see any difference at all.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I don&#x27;t know if it firmed anything, but at least in my mind I felt like it did! There is a warming and cooling sensation that this lotion gives off and that made me feel like something was happening :) My opinion is that my belly looked firmer within days, but I was using a lot of the lotion. I went through 1 tube in less than two weeks. I didn&#x27;t noticed a difference in my thighs at all. I would continue to order, but I can&#x27;t afford $80 a month just for firming lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of creams.  I tried one popular competitor&#x27;s cream ONCE but stopped because it was chock full of parabens and other questionable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fat Fader is one product that I use daily and recommend to clients and friends.  I&#x27;ve competed in 4 NPC Bikini competitions.  The last show I used Fat Fader for one month and I earned my IFBB Pro card.  I can&#x27;t say it was completely due to Fat Fader but I know that it definitely helped.  I noticed a difference in girths/circumferences after the first week of using it.  I slimmed down considerably faster than previously.  THAT I attribute to FF.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on other products.  This is the one that works.</li>
    <li> It gave my thighs bad reaction, broke out in rashes, I don&#x27;t see anything good about it. It works for others not me.</li>
    <li> My skin looks better but not sure if it works on the fat layer. Been using it for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This thing actually works if you follow the instructions to a tee. I don&#x27;t know if it has any side effects or gonna hurt one way or another later, but I know it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I&#x27;m bad at using it as directed. Never twice a day (I forget about it in the morning, but haven&#x27;t missed many evenings. I&#x27;m 47, and recently lost 16 pounds from 156. I had remaining cellulite and fat pockets in my abdomen. I can see noticeable changes, primarily in my stomach!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a VERY active individual with around 16% bodyfat and bought this in hopes of eliminating a bit of cellulite.  It didn&#x27;t do a thing!! i&#x27;m thinking most of these review&#x27;s are complete BS.... SAVE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome. Along with proper and strict diet and exercise I saw drastic results to help me during my contest prep. It minimizes cellulite, tightens the skin, and helps pull out extra water weight. It also leaves skin smooth and hydrated. Love this product and will continue to use during my offseason to keep my skin look glowing and hydrated! :)</li>
    <li> Fat-Fader lotion is one of the best lotions for losing your fat.I&#x27;ve bought a lot of lotions and ampules but only Fat-Fader has helped me to lose my weight.I&#x27;m really glad to say that i will buy more soon,cause it really helps me.My skin has changed a lot since i started using Fat-Fader and im very happy with that.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of weeks back, after using this seller for another item. I must say, i am thoroughly impressed by this lotion. It  leaves the skin feeling moisterised and soft, without leaving a nasty, greasy residue like so many other lotions do. I noticed a marked difference in the appearance of my skin in just a matter of 7-10 days, skin feels and looks tighter, blotches/red marks are less prominent and my stretch marks from three pregnancies are finally starting to disappear. A little goes a long way with this lotion, unlike other products, you do not need to lather this on, but just massage a small amount into the problem areas. If you think you have tried them all, think again, this will be the one lotion you will return to time and again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Lasts a while and does what it says. My thighs and arms are slowly reducing (in conjunction with diet and exercise) and they appear smoother and more reduced. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a little pricey, but not as much as most of the stuff at Sephora that are supposed to do the same thing, and it really does work. I like using it as a wrap for extra quick effects.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product with some hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never took a topical fat burner that really worked. Well, this is a first!! I have applied this on my sides and stomach, and with a proper workout, definitely see a better result! Definitely losing more pounds, and fat in selected areas. The big thing I have noticed is that if you put this on your face it works amazingly!! It definitely works to break down fat, and define your facial features, mostly cheekbones and jawline!! It has given me the square jawline I haven&#x27;t had since I was in college!!!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product, especially for spot fat reduction, it really works!!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks, not sure if it worked as fat fader, cos I didn&#x27;t see any changes at my waist, even I worked out 3 times a week. But it&#x27;s a fine lotion.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed and didn&#x27;t see any difference in my legs. I am fairly fit but have some light cellulite on my thighs. The cellulite was lessened for only a few minutes after rubbing it on. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> We shall see how this works. I have been using it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much. However I am still keeping with my new diet and exercise program. Hopefully this also helps.</li>
    <li> Lotion completely absorbs, no greasy, sticky feeling, and absolutely no scent.</li>
    <li> Preparing for my bodybuilding competition and started using this for a month, this might have helped a little but diet is the real key. I still have another tube and will use but won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> So this cream,  does work in a way,  it did tone my arms and it did help slim my stomach plus doing zumba classes. In a time period of 2 wks but i stop applying for 7 days and my result where not good my belly wad bigger than before. And my arms where jiggly more than before... Over all it does work but id you stop using it you might get worst results ...</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It not only helps in a way I can&#x27;t explain for helping me tone and tighten. But it got rid of my psoriasis. And I tried everything to get rid of it. And the only thing that worked was fat fader. It also helps ease the aches of a day of working out too hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it as directed and I see now improvement. It does have a smell to it and I just wasn&#x27;t impressed. I know there isn&#x27;t a quick fix to cellulite but this came across that you would see result and I have not.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my personal trainer.  I have not noticed a difference yet but I am not giving up on the product.  Will continue to use it for now.</li>
    <li> I got this to help with my stomach and the more toned look! It burns in a tingly way but I love it! Don&#x27;t take it at night bc there is caffeine in it!</li>
    <li> Since this product is not available in Germany an american friend of mine ordered it in the US for me. I used the lotion for more than six weeks applying it on hips and stomach in the morning and early evening as indicated. Although I followed a strict weekly sports routine before and during treatment (2 runs between 10km and 13km each, 2 swims 2000 meters each, 2 bodyweight workouts 30 to 40 minutes each) it had absolutely no effect on the remains of my stubborn subcutaneous fat on hips and waist. After this experience I find it really hard to believe those enthusiastic reviews I&#x27;ve read here are not fake.</li>
    <li> Absolutely zero difference after using all of the product.  A complete waste of money.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t do s***!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t work at all just a waist of money. The only way to loose that fat is to work it off. I know that sucks to hear but it&#x27;s too. I have been doing DDP yoga and I am loving it. Go to that website it will work better then this ever will.</li>
    <li> This helped me in getting the stubborn cellulite off of my thighs and arms! Easy to use and isn&#x27;t too greasy!</li>
    <li> This product works great for a temporary fix. It lasts about 8 hours</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  There is no such thing as miracle drugs so without proper workout, this like anything else won&#x27;t work.  Used in conjunction with a diet and exercise, this product is by far the best!</li>
    <li> This cream does what I had hoped it would, it warms up really good during workouts. I don&#x27;t have cellulite really, but I like buying the lotions and creams for prevention, tightness and smoothness. This cream seems to allow you to bring blood to the surface which means increased circulation.</li>
    <li> This product was OK but I really did not see much change or weight loss.  The smell is OK but I just did not see any weight loss. To be fair, I only exercise 2-3 times per week but did use it before exercising.</li>
    <li> Simple truth is,you can&#x27;t lose fat in one area,so I bought this product,hoping to get the lower abs more toned,i used the whole tube,i train 4 time a week,run twice,follow a healthy diet,i&#x27;m at 16% body fat.&lt;br /&gt;the only way I can get those hard rocking abs on the lower part is to go down to at least 10% body fat,wich requires strict severe diet,along with oral fat burners ( wich might not be healthy for your heart ).&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line,you&#x27;ll be wasting your money buying this product hoping to lose fat in certain areas.</li>
    <li> I have very stubborn cellulite and have even seen a plastic surgeon.  He recommended I try this.  I have notice improvement.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says. Me and my wife, sister in law, brother we all usedit!! Will be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> The only thing I lost was my money... do not recommend this product. sorry I am just be truthful.  I appreciate reading others feedback before purchasing items on Amazon and I find comments helpful.</li>
    <li> Had to stop using it because of the side-effects.</li>
    <li> Hey everyone !!! If you are planning to get this product go for it. It really does work. :)</li>
    <li> This hasn&#x27;t worked as well as I had hoped. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks with diet, exercise, skin brushing, &amp; applying this lotion twice daily. I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement. It does have a nice tingling feeling which I do like. If things improve when I finish the bottle I will repost.</li>
    <li> I am a believer after using it two times.  I am using it along with working out, counting calories, etc.  The scale would not budge before, now it is moving -- the only thing I changed was adding this.  I use it before working out along with compression pants during workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out Aminophylline and it really has been proven to help weight/inches loss in studies.  I will update if it stops working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and cannot tell a difference.  I like the consistency, and a little goes a long way with this product.  It leaves a cooling sensation on your skin after you apply it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 4/2014: I wanted to give an update on my experience using this product. It is going on 1 year since I&#x27;ve used this product. I am now 50 pounds lighter. I run 3 days a week anywhere from 3-13 miles (I do 2 half marathons a year) and weight training the other 3 days. I work extremely hard. This product works. I&#x27;ve done tests. I&#x27;ve forgotten to put it on during runs and weights before. Both times I barely sweat. When I do put it on my energy (from the caffeine) increases and it gets me through my long runs and makes me sweat way more during my weight training than when I forgot to use it. This product also has Vitamin C which is great for your skin. Also, I want to make a comment regarding these \\&quot;fake\\&quot; reviews. Why do people assume that if positive reviews are made they are fake? Should I assume these negative reviews are made by competitors that want to make Fat Fader look bad? Not everyone is going to get results. I&#x27;ve tried many products and didn&#x27;t get results. But I don&#x27;t go bashing the company I move on and try something else. I personally love this product and have recommended it to others. So far I&#x27;ve had 5 people buy it and love it. So try it. It&#x27;s totally worth it, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend this product to anyone and everyone who is looking for something to help with their weightloss goals. It truly is amazing and it works!!!!! You can&#x27;t say that about a lot of products. I use it every day I work out (which is 7 days a week, not kidding). I love it!! I&#x27;d totally buy it if I were you!</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there!!!  We use it every time we do our cardio session!</li>
    <li> Tried product and noticed a slight difference, but haven&#x27;t been able to use it daily do to personal circumstances. My arms look the same, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I purchased it when it was sold in $45-55 range seeing SO many high praises and thinking it MUST BE worth the price. Now it is down to about $30 and I feel it is not even worth that unless it really works with your body chemistry, which I am not convinced is my case based on just one tube. It did not live up to its name for me and I am not obese by any means&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous cellulite lotions and usually are motivated by both researched ingredients (read Murad&#x27;s book about cellulite) and price. Murad&#x27;s own cellulite serum, which is generously sized and priced just higher than this one, rendered lots of complements from my husband but I was looking for something more affordable. This is the second most expensive fat/cellulite remedy I ever purchased after Murad and I do not plan to purchase it unless price drops further.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I was buying with full awareness that there is no topical product on the market to make you &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34; fat that constitutes cellulite. My experience is that lotions help me to maintain skin tone, firmness and general appearance of cellulite. I notice the difference when I stop using something topical for cellulite or try a different cellulite topical remedy. But nothing budges my cellulite unless I am also watching my diet and do toning exercises regularly. Topical cellulite remedies effective ingredients do improve appearance of cellulite for many people but nothing really can totally reverse the process once it starts, especially when genetic predisposition is involved. While I am quite slender by build I have a strong genetic predisposition and even few pounds of weight gained translate into bumpy thighs so I figured I will need to be on regular cellulite maintanance as long as I still care about how my body looks. As a result I am always open to testing a new cellulite &amp;#34;remedy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Topical cellulite treatments are basically somewhat improving trapped fat of &amp;#34;cellulite&amp;#34; as well as skin tone, circulation, elasticity and smoothness of the skin. I went for this particular cream because of Aminophylline is a key marketed ingredient. A couple of years ago I believe when Finulite was launched their original formula contained it and I found Finulite the most effective for my body chemistry. I noticed it was no longer listed on Finulite ingredient list (even though their lotion still is one of the most effective for me and best priced per oz. on the market). I searched for cellulite remedies with Aminophylline specifically. I had high hopes for this lotion based on reviews and seeing other excellent ingredients on its list. It does feel and smell great but feels like any regular rich moisturizing lotion UNLESS you exfoliate before applying it. It is only when applied after exfoliation that I can feel something between warming and tingling sensation which made me finally believe it is doing something that a regular moisturizing lotion cannot do. There is nothing in directions about exfoliation, just &amp;#34;after bath or shower&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Did it significantly reduce appearance of my cellulite? Not really. I want to believe it improved my circulation via warming sensation. Did it give me slimmer thighs by fading the fat as its names claims ? I am not sure it did and I would have loved to try it for another month or so (that&#x27;s how long this seemingly generous container lasts) to figure out. However it is priced so highly compared to competitor lotions that I do not feel it is an experiment worth extra $$. It certainly was not miracle for my fat/cellulite and did not surpass performance of other much less expensive cellulite lotions/serums/creams I had tried.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing virtually nor result and that I could have &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; it for $20 less if purchased later makes me really regret this purchase. Maybe sellers reaped lots of earning with high intro price but at the end they lost lots of potential long-term customers. Maybe their product really kicks in after a 2 month use as opposed one but do they really think their first wave of customers will want to give it another try after they see a $20 price drop? To me it says the product was intentionally overpriced - not a good way to earn people&#x27;s trust in your company and your products.se as opposed one but do they really think their first wave of customers will want to give it another try after they see a $20 price drop? To me it says the product was intentionally overpriced - not a good way to earn people&#x27;s trust in your company and your products.</li>
    <li> I do think it made my thighs look smoother.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery service!</li>
    <li> I Have been using this cream for 2 weeks and have not seen any change at all!!! I will not be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re the kind of person that can do something twice a day, every single day, don&#x27;t buy this. The thing is, i&#x27;m sure it evetually can work because when you put it on your skin you feel the cool and tingly sensation, the only issue i had was i didn&#x27;t see results quickly enough so i started slacking with putting it on. I just feel that for a price that high, it should either wor faster, or they should give you more of the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a month back after using , i must say, i am thoroughly impressed by this lotion. It leaves the skin feeling moisterised and soft, without leaving a nasty, greasy residue like so many other lotions do. I noticed a marked difference in the appearance of my skin in just a matter of 5-10 days skin feels and looks tighter, blotches/red marks are less prominent and my stretch marks from three pregnancies are finally starting to disappear. I really happy after using it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product nor ordered it just a hint for everyone buying on amazon. If the reviews are all positive and posted pretty much on the same date or close to one date you can pretty much tell that they are fake. For this product several reviews were posted on the same date. I doubt that a product that had 15 reviews was rated by 5 people on the same day.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should really find a way to stop the scam reviews from the sellers of a product.&lt;br /&gt;Just pay attention to the dates, amazon buyers</li>
    <li> Just received.  Fast shipping.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times.  I enjoy the tingling sensation.  In my head I think it&#x27;s the fat melting lol.  I&#x27;ll update my post after using the whole tube.  I like how a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Before workout put the lotion on my trouble spots. During workout I can feel the lotion working and can see the results.</li>
    <li> My second time ordering this works but I apply it when I go to the gym. The people who gives this 1 star n complain it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s because most likely they&#x27;re lazy and don&#x27;t eat right and think applying a cream is going to magically take away their fat and dimples. I been using this once a day I eat right n go to the gym in a week n 5 days I went from 156 lbs to 148. If you use cream stay away from sweets pasta n rice n try to exercise a little you&#x27;ll see a dramatic difference (and drink plenty water).</li>
    <li> Seems to aid greatly with cellulite reduction and really helped my curves, awesome product and totally worth the money. MOney well spent!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I like this product and will continue to use it! It leaves the skin feeling moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and overall Im satisfied. Yes i do  recommend trying it  for yourself.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell like some other products I&#x27;ve tried. I can already tell changes since I&#x27;ve been using it. Of course I am a clean eater and workout daily but I had some stubborn fat on the outer thighs that are nearly gone now. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It worked a little...but not as good as some other products I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out anywhere I put it.</li>
    <li> Well I have used this for about a week now and LOVE it. It actually &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like it is working. I will be ordering more so I make sure I do not run out. I put this on Before I workout and Love it!</li>
    <li> Its ok. Didn’t see a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I have been dieting and wouking out for over a year now with one goal... I&#x27;m trying to get rid of my spare tire... I started using the Fat Fader 5 weeks ago on the advice from a friend at the gym and I think I am finally seeing progress!!! Super stoked! This stuff gave me the boost I needed, there is only so far that diet and exercise can take you.</li>
    <li> This product seems to do the trick for me, Ive been using it for close to six weeks and am satisfied. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go to the swimming often, but about a month ago some friends invited me on a trip to a popular lake with only 1 week of advance notice. I&#x27;m not fat by any means, but I do have some jelly in the belly. I decided to give Fat-Fader a try, using it for 5 days before the trip. It worked just like I had hoped, and when we arrived at the lake I was able to take off my shirt with pride. Now I keep this product handy for any similar \\&quot;emergencies\\&quot; that might arise. It deinitely works for me!</li>
    <li> Lotion s thick, tingles for a looooong time, &amp; your skin feels great! Used in combination w good diet &amp; exercise, it helps skin look tighter!</li>
    <li> Incredibly hydrating, makes my skin soft!!! The areas you apply it to sweat more. It has a cooling sensation which is great when you are feeling hot from working out. My cellulite has definitely lessened. I would suggest this product to anyone curious about it. Totally worth the money. Keep in mind you need to actually work out and consume a healthy diet- don&#x27;t eat fried foods and expect to see results.</li>
    <li> luv luv luv this product...use it every day&lt;br /&gt;i eat clean train daily live a healthy lifestyle and slap it on everyday.&lt;br /&gt;lisa mc govern&lt;br /&gt;reehold nj</li>
    <li> I workout six days a week and always am looking for new ways to improve my overall physical appearance in a natural way. I used this product and I saw a difference around my core. This product has to be used with a healthy diet and consistently maintaining active. It can not be used alone thinking your going to burn all existing fat. It is an assistant to everything else you must do. Again this is a great product if used appropriately.</li>
    <li> BUT DEFINITELY tightens skin and reduces appearance of cellulite. I am not sure about long term usage as i have only been using it for 2 days.. but so far so good!</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT WORK! I did what it said and it didn&#x27;t do any good at all!!! Was really hopeful but no luck..</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice. Not sure if it helps with toning but it certainly makes me sweat like crazy! I use every where.</li>
    <li> I have tried three or four of these cellulite creams, none magically take the cellulite away but I did like this one the best. It has a tingling feeling and I like the way my skin felt. My skin looked smoother but there was still cellulite. I have sinced tried two other ones but I am going to buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a Female Body Builder but she was adamant about 2 things: use it religiously and for several weeks/months, and use in conjunction with your workout (and obviously it&#x27;s not a magic cream - you can&#x27;t eat gallons of ice cream while using it or let up on your normal healthy diet). I&#x27;ve used it both following her advice and not following her advice, and what she said makes a world of a difference in terms of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it&#x27;s still a great product even if you don&#x27;t use it on a regimented schedule - \\&quot;slap it on\\&quot; before cardio or an intense weight lifting session, and you will SWEAT. In fact that&#x27;s probably my favorite aspect of the product. I&#x27;ve taken thermogenic supplements designed to raise your core temperature, induce sweat, calorie burn, etc. But I prefer Fat Fader lotion to those supplements - it allows for a more natural feeling thermogenic effect than an internal supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> Maybe a little improvement? Can&#x27;t totally tell, but I like that it makes my thighs sweat when I work out!! (gross, hu).  It makes me think something is happening!! I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day before working out or running and after a shower and I&#x27;ve noticed inches lost and tighter skin awesome product if i can use it over sea&#x27;s then anyone can.</li>
    <li> When I go to the beach, I put this product all over my entire body ;) this stuff kicks ass!!  shredded abs!!</li>
    <li> I understand the previous posters concern about &amp;#34;fake reviews&amp;#34; and agree that checking date range of reviews is a good way of keeping things legitimate.  That said, i don&#x27;t agree with giving a product 1 star that by your own admission you haven&#x27;t tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought a tube of this stuff and it works.  True, I diet and excercise, but have been doing so for two years without really getting rid of the stubbon subcetaneous fat on my abdomen.  Within a week both my wife and i noticed a difference.  Hope it keeps up!</li>
    <li> I eat a balanced diet and I exercise three times a week. I bought this product that it would help to diminsh the cellulite on my inner thighs. It&#x27;s a rich cream that moisturizes but it doesn&#x27;t do much else.  I used the entire tube on my inner thigh and did not see any results whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone seeking to rid themselves of cellulite.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s totally working for me. I work out a lot and eat well, but there are just some dimples on my bum that never seem to go away no matter what. I honestly think that area is smoother now. I also make sure to rub the application spot for 60-90 seconds when I put it on. It adds ten minutes to my routine but it works. Totally makes my body tingle all day, that interesting at first but then you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I have tried it for a few weeks and hadn&#x27;t noticed much if a difference. I won&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
    <li> I LOVE FAT-FADER! THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! I USE IT EVERYDAY!ITS DEFINITELY A PRODUCT WORTH BUYING! ITS NOT GREASY AND GETS ABSORBED TO THE BODY VERY QUICK</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the instructions that are on the tube. (to put it on before and after exercise). I put it on before my workouts,  and noticed a huge change in how much I sweat. Then,  after taking a post-workout shower,  I&#x27;d put it on again. Doing this did make me feel a little tighter in the stomach area and my skin felt so nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like every other lotion or cream that is meant to burn fat,  it can&#x27;t do it all by itself.  If you really want to burn fat,  exercise regularly and eat healthy.  I would buy this again to help me out,  though!</li>
    <li> I feel it is a good product I don&#x27;t know if I would say you lose weight from this, but I would say it helps to soften any cellulite that you may have. Of course keep in mind working out also helps with any cellulite that might bother you. So between the 2 I&#x27;m getting a great result!! Oh by the way when you rub it in really good you feel a cooling/burning like sensation a few minutes later. Nothing that hurts by any means just feels like it is working.</li>
    <li> great item fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything, didn&#x27;t feel Like it gives that warm feeling it just feels like regular lotion</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> so far so good, ive only been using this product for a week</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Using this lotion while following a strict diet and workout program helps burn fat and keep your skin looking tight and firm. You can&#x27;t expect results if you are eating bad and not working out. I put this all over my legs and stomach before working out. I can actually feel it working and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in one week, so I am very happy with this product.  I will keep using it with the hope it will continue to work as promised!</li>
    <li> well i had no idea that i was going to love this product so much.  i have been using it for about 4 days now and it is almost hard to believe the difference i see in the mirror.  i almost did not want to share the news just so there would not be more people buying it... leave more for me ha ha ha.  anyway i see a difference in my legs but the biggest change is the love handles around my waist have shrunk amazingly.  now, i have been taking liver cleansing pills for a long while now. not sure if that is doing it or not.  all i know is that i noticed a wonderful improvement almost immediately to those love handles after starting this cream.  i am wishing i would have taken before and after photos.  i still have a way to go but am so very pleased at the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;if you do decide to buy it all i have to say is i hope you leave some for me....cause i love this stuff.  i am ordering my second  bottle as soon as i finish this review, just to be sure i never run out.  : )</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product really burns fat or very little if any. What I think it does is to tighten your skin and make your stomach looks flatter. I have some definition in my abs and I can definitely see even more definition after using this cream. The results don&#x27;t last long though.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  It doesn&#x27;t have any odor that I noticed, absorbes into skin well, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, and I did notice improvement in the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to warn others however, that this product does not get rid of fat- at least not with short-term use.  It helps get rid of that &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; looking skin where cellulite is.&lt;br /&gt;If I had the money, I would keep buying this product and use it daily to keep the cellulite away, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t drop $30 every month on vanity products.</li>
    <li> Sister got this for her post-pregnancy waist, didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> WOW... THIS STUFF IS A MIRACLE! CANNOT BELIEVE IT! I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN REALLY OBSESSED WITH MY BODY OVERALL ESPECIALLY WITH THE FACT THAT I WORKOUT AND USE WEIGHTS ECT... AS I GOT OLDER I SAW LITTLE TO NO MUSCLE DEFINITION AND INCHES LOST! STARTED USING FATFADER IN MAY 2012 AND OMG... IAM NOW SEEING DEFINITION (MORE THAN I DID WHEN I WAS YOUNGER) MY WAIST IS DOWN TO 20 1/2 INCHES (WASN&#x27;T EVEN THAT WHEN I MARRIED 16 YRS AGO..!!!) MY BODY LOOKS, FEELS TIGHTER I LOST INCHES EVERYWHERE AND MORE SO GIVES ME A BOOST TO WANT TO EXERCISE EVERYDAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS!! U HAVE TO GET THIS LOTION!! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY... A MUST HAVE AND SAFE TO PUT ON EVERYWHERE... (ABS, ARMS, CHEST, THIGHS, NECK YES...NECK NO MORE TURKEY NECK...EVEN FACE BOTTOM OF FACE FOR JAWLINE) THIS IS COMPLETELY ODERLESS AND IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE U PUT ON AT LEAST 15-20 MIN ON THE PARTS OF THE BODY YOU ARE LOOKING TO IMPROVE PRIOR TO YOUR WORKOUT... AND USE MORNING AND BEFORE BED, THAT IS WHAT I DO AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I have used other products like this in the past and find that this product is by far superior. When I apply the cream before I do my cardio I feel it heat up and making me sweat. I love it. The tingle which tells me it is working continues even after cardio.</li>
    <li> old wrinkled cellulite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to buy more,it seams to help  my old lines and wrinkles and&lt;br /&gt;smoothes out old lines</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never believed In te hype of products like this, however, it came highly recommended and I must say it works like a charm! Literally feel it working within an hour of use!</li>
    <li> I wish I could say this was miraculous but.....I can&#x27;t!  I&#x27;m just a sucker for these products so if I ever find a miracle I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
</ol>
