I also loved the brush at the end of it to comb your brows.. cute touch to a great product.</li>
    <li> Every girl deserves a good pair of tweezers. They come in handy in an array of situations. With that being said- there are A LOT of CHEAP tweezers out there. You have no idea how many cheap pairs of tweezers I have laying around my house with their inability to tweeze or pluck or grip anything. So I went searching; searching for the best dang tweezers money could buy. And I think I just found them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s weird- writing a raving review about tweezers. But I&#x27;m excited about these things. I really am. And I have a good reason to be. First of all, the second these 24 Bees tweezers arrived I knew there was something great about them. They were durable, sturdy, hefty little tweezers that I was sure would grip and tear out any dang thing I needed them to. But I had to put them to the test- could they tweeze as good as I assumed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows needed a plucking and what better way to review a pair of tweezers than to try them out on the most tweezed body part ever- eyebrows? My immediate amusement came in the fact that these tweezers have very precise metal ends to them that grip onto hairs really easily. I&#x27;m used to the old, vintage-style tweezers that aren&#x27;t so specifically oriented and you kind of get blindly grab onto a bunch of hairs and just pull. They have the curved edge. The edge that doesn&#x27;t allow you to see what exactly you&#x27;re plucking as you&#x27;re looking into the mirror. These tweezers are different. They have a concaved end to them, allowing you to actually see the exact hairs you&#x27;re gripping onto. And their pointed metal grips are so precise that I could easily grab pretty much any random hair I wanted to, with precision, and pluck it in one pull (not multiple frustrating tries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say, eyebrows shaped and my life fulfilled- I was just getting ready to sit down and write up my magnificent review of these tweezers when a second job came up. A kid- a kid with a splinter. How is it that I, as an adult, almost never get splinters- but all kids within 100 feet of me can manage to get a piece of wood stuck in their finger every 2 minutes. It hurts and it sucks and I always have to get it out. With vintage tweezers in the past this was a hassle and a fight and a lot of crying and tears. With these specific on-point tweezers I easily reached in, grabbed the sliver, and pulled it out in about 2 seconds flat. Needless to say that&#x27;s when I decided I&#x27;d write a long raving review on a product as small and miniscule as tweezers. I&#x27;m a fan 42 Bees. Dare I say these are the best tweezers on the market? It&#x27;d probably sound ridiculous- but I will. I love em&#x27;. They&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve tried. And I suggest every lady, man, grandparent, and teen get a pair.splinters- but all kids within 100 feet of me can manage to get a piece of wood stuck in their finger every 2 minutes.

    <li> I really like this tweezer.it has a slanting tip which is great for ingrown hair. i have couple on my upperlip and they look  really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this tweezer has a strong grip and is very precise.&lt;br /&gt;No missing any hair.&lt;br /&gt;The one end has slanting tip tweezers and the other has a tiny comb.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a big comb which is not the best for my eye brow.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this slanting tip tweezer by 42Bees at a discounted price in return for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> But what makes the 42 Bees Tweezers I received different is that it has a mini comb on the end.....and hunneeee it may not seem like a lot but if you are doing touch ups that comb comes in handy, just comb the brows up or down out of your way pluck the strays and comb back into place. I love easy to use products and these tweezers are just that! It&#x27;s just like tweeze...flip....comb.....flip! (I know, I know it sounds lazy as hell but I like it!). Its other things I loved about these tweezers as well like the packaging....I also like how these tweezers come in its own carrying tube, that definitely keeps germs off when you have them in your purse or bag and saves your skin from getting attacked when you are searching for them, and the tip is just right for grabbing those strays and not nicking your skin as well. Overall a professional well put together pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> I got these in just in time to test out as my eye brows needed done! I got them in and opened them and loved them from the start! They come in blast container to hold them witch will be nice when im throwing them in the bottom of my purse i want get poked when digging in my purse! The grip on them is nice the slat of the tip is nice..they do a wonderful job are not cheaply made so will hold up and the comb on the in is a nice added bonus!  Disclaimer: I did get this item in order to do a review but that has not influenced my option of these amazing tweezers</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! They grab hairs with ease and are very precise</li>
    <li> I love these, they get in to the hard to reach spots and even pull the smallest of hairs. and the comb is a great added feature. I did receive this for free to review. and Its like no other I&#x27;ve tried before!!! Well worth it.</li>
    <li> OMG finally its almost an all in one tool lol.. I love it and the tweesers work great for everything.</li>
    <li> Plucks with ease. Built in comb feature nicer then anticipated.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of these tweezers with the eyebrow comb. That&#x27;s very unique and I like that. These tweezers are stainless steel so they are strong and durable. They should last a long time, which is great since I go through them fast. The only thing I did not like was the slanted part of the tweezers did not seem to be able to get very short and fine hairs. It was not able to grab them. They worked great for shaping my eyebrows and plucking longer hairs though so I can still use them. However, I cannot use them for those hard to grab fine little hairs. If the tweezers were able to grab onto the fine little hair it would always break. I had to go to my other tweezers to get the difficult hairs. The tweezers are slanted and angled well but I think the slanted part should be a little longer. That might be why it had trouble grabbing those fine hairs. Anyways, I still like it for the comb and the shaping of my eyebrows. The tweezers are strong and durable. I received a sample for testing and quality purposes. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows that eyebrows frame your face. This is why I take mines so seriously. And when my favorite eyebrow threader went MIA, I&lt;br /&gt;had to do something. Not that I didn&#x27;t try to wait (I&#x27;m very selective about who grooms my brows), I did, for over 2 months before making the decision to tweeze them on my own. Usually, I&#x27;d use my old reliable Tweezerman, but I wanted to see if there was something else on the market that was updated; something that could possibly do more. The Bees Slant tip Tweezer was a great pick for me. It shipped out fast, it&#x27;s easy to grip, it&#x27;s got razor sharp precision, and as an added bonus there&#x27;s even an eyebrow comb to groom your brows as you go along.This is a great selection for anyone concerned with getting their brows right the first time.</li>
    <li> After all these years of buying tweezers.. I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect one!!  They are wide enough to get a perfect grip.  They are so perfect that I can grab just about any eyebrow hair and not try to grab it over and over as with other tweezers.  I won&#x27;t buy another brand from here on out!</li>
    <li> I like grooming my own brows because I&#x27;ve been burned by my experiences with getting it done through salons or through threading. The key to perfectly groomed brows is the quality of the tweezers that you are using. This slant tip tweezer has been working perfectly well for me and I love the fact that it has a built in comb with it - as I prefer brushing my brows before proceeding to pluck the strays. This pair is perfectly aligned and ultra sharp. Needless to say, it gets the job done very well. It&#x27;s well made and well priced - check it out &#x27;coz it&#x27;s worth purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

    <li> Ok so I am going to be absolutely honest here, the name scared the heck out of me when I opened this package. Luckily no bees or Jen’s were hurt during the process of this review. So having said that, let’s just jump right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the clear cylinder that comes with the Slant Tip Tweezers. There is even a plastic band to help keep them shut. The cylinder holds everything together and protects your hands when you are digging in the bottom of your purse for them. The other thing I really like about the design is that it features a comb on the backside. Allowing you to comb out your eyebrows and then pluck any stragglers or reshape your eyebrows as you see fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very impressed with this product. My only negative is that it seems to be a little hit and miss on the grip of the hair. Another product I recently reviewed had a great tight grip that you knew that hair had no choice but to communicate. 42 Bees wins that back with the creation of their tube that makes it portable but not dangerous and with the amazing new comb design.

I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers-a beauty necessity but nightmare. I tweeze my eyebrows and wax them and I must say that without a nice pair of tweezers this can quickly become a painful experience. Most of the time with cheap tweezers you will find they are flimsy and do not grab the hair causing an unnecessary poke and being dull leave you with hairs unwanted. These tweezers I tried by 42 BEES was nice because they were professional style like used by my salon and they were easy to use and grab the hairs needed. They are sharpened to .4mm in thickness and grab hold without as much pain as some of the cheaper tweezers I have used that leave the hair still intact and me just with pain and redness. These tweezers could also be great for sliver removal and for removing ticks due to their great hold. The tweezers came in a nice tube for storage which also was nice in preventing them from just laying around on counter tops etc. At under $10 this is a real bargain and as an added feature these tweezers feature an eyebrow comb as well to make sure you don’t miss any random hairs.</li>
    <li> Practical tweezers with an attached comb is absolutely genius! These super sharp tweezers have been very helpful in helping me shape my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> These were great, just a little thick</li>
    <li> How much more perfect could tweezers be?! First off, these grip like a vice, even on the smallest hairs. They don&#x27;t chop hairs, though, like some tweezers do, if they are really sharp. Second, I get an eyebrow comb, attached to the tweezers?! Yes, please! I am so pleased that I was offered a pair of these to test out! I can tweeze, comb a different direction, and tweeze again, to clean up the edges! As a girl with naturally super thick eyebrows, this makes me VERY happy!</li>
    <li> I was having hard times finding an efficient tweezer - the ones I had were cutting the hair rather than taking it out. I decided to purchase new tweezers and of course, my search started in Amazon. After an extensive review, I decided to buy this model, which is rated highly. As soon as they were delivered, my dad and I tried them. I couldn&#x27;t be happier by the quality and the functionality of the comb. Be careful to not grab a bit of skin while you try to pull the hair out; the tweezers are sharp.I initially bought two tweezers and after trying it, I immediately ordered a third one to give as gift to my sister. Finally, a tweezer that works as expected!!</li>
    <li> I really like these tweezers. I wish they were a little easier to squeeze but I love the addition of the comb on the other end! Makes it much more convenient to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> SINCE I WAS IN NEED OF AN EYEBROW FIX, THIS CAME IN HANDY AND ON TIME. IT IS IN ITS OWN CASE AND IT IS SHARP AND EASY TO USE. I GOT THIS AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FROM HONEST FEW AND AM GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR THIS LITTLE MUST HAVE. I WOULD PAY THE ORIGINAL PRICE FOR THESE TWEEZERS, THEY TRAVEL WELL IN MY PURSE W/O TAKING UP ANY SPACE AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same tweezers from Revlon that I&#x27;ve had for probably 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried many other tweezers and they never seem to be able to grip the hairs enough to pull them out! Finally, I found tweezers that not only match up but are better! These tweezers pull out every single hair! It&#x27;s so easy to groom my eyebrows! You can feel the quality in these tweezers. Just holding them, they feel very strong and well made. The comb isn&#x27;t that great, I prefer a comb that&#x27;s a little bit more flexible and one where the bristles are closer together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have definitely because a staple in my eyebrow routine! The price is a little high but compared to other high quality tweezers the price is right.</li>
    <li> These 42 BEES tweezers are very sturdy, made of stainless steel and grab the finest of hairs. I&#x27;ve had the same tweezerman tweezers for years so I was excited to get a new set. These have an added eyebrow comb on top which is a great bonus. I&#x27;m sure these tweezers would pull out tiny little splinters if you had any because they easily grab on to very thin and fine hairs of mine, I have very thin eyebrow hairs that are hard to grab onto with most tweezers, I usually have to get my brows waxed to take them off but these tweezers grab and pull them without any effort, I&#x27;m impressed! I bought a second set so my husband can store his in his grooming bag and not have to use mine. I could see these tweezers lasting a long time they&#x27;re great quality.I would definetly reccommend them to anyone and everyone who needs a new or better set of tweezers. You will not be dissapointed with 42 BEES slant tip tweezers. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  If you feel like my review was helpful to you at all will you please take a second and hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button. It would be greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> I received these tweezer just two weeks ago and love how easy they are to get my eye brows closer to where I want them to be. The comb is a wonderful addition and having it at the end of your tweezer makes total sense. Why have a separate comb? I can never find it when I want to tweeze anyway. This way it is always with you. With the comb you can perfectly shape your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slant on these make for great precision without the risk of injuring yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 42 Bees tweezer has an ultra sharp 0.4mm thin tip so no hair will ever escape being tweezed. I get them every time.</li>
    <li> These are the absolute best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life! They are very high quality and the super sharp tip grabs hairs that are impossible to remove with any other tweezers. It&#x27;s great for your eyebrows, ingrown hairs, etc. I highly recommend them to everyone and I will continue to use these tweezers and spread the word about them. They are definitely a hidden gem on Amazon. :)</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great at getting rid of my eye brow hairs. I don&#x27;t get any breakage of my hairs because these tweezers take the hair and the root out. The tweezers are slanted to help with pulling out your eye brows hairs. It got rid of my thin, thick, and stubborn hairs. The comb part makes it easy stick up the hairs to trim them down. After using these tweezers my eye brows were very cleaned up. You will get a little workout for your thumb because when you push the handles together it takes some muscles. There is a silicone piece that goes around the tweezers to help keep them closed. Also it does comes in a tube which makes it easy to throw in your bag and not have to worry about poking your self with the tweezer. I received this slanted tweezer free to review and give my honest feedback about them.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a better quality. These tweezers get most of my unwanted eyebrow hairs out but not the small ones. Not as sharp and accurate as the high end tweezers from sephora.</li>
    <li> Love how this tweezer comes with a comb on the end.. super helpful instead of having to switch between two products while tweezing my eyebrows.  Able to tweeze my eyebrows with precision and the comfort of gripping my hair with ease.</li>
    <li> Like many women out there I have gone through many tweezers. Some don&#x27;t grip well enough, break hair when plucking, or get dull fast.&lt;br /&gt;These feel good in your hand, durable, easy to pluck &amp; grab even the small &amp; thin hair. For the most part when 2 things are combined it can be a good thing and this product is one of those things. For one i don&#x27;t have to search for the eyebrow comb and if I travel I don&#x27;t need to carry something else with me. Its very convenient to have a comb on the other side.  I usually get my eyebrows threaded but up keep them in between with stray hairs and these are perfect for that.  I really liked using these and I&#x27;m sure you will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the packaging its simple and cute, I like that its in the shape of a hexagon ( like a honey comb piece)It comes with a tube for safe keeping which is always good to have if you want to put them in your purse or just to keep sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these tweezers complimentary for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was so upset with my last pair of tweezers that when I received this is was a relief I used them every day no problem</li>
    <li> Good quality tweezers for a great price. I bought 2</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re way too heavy</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> These blunt tipped slanted tweezers with the built in comb are made for the eye &amp;#34;Overachiever&amp;#34;! These will give you the perfect eyebrow if you pay attention! I love these tweezers!! Everybody needs a good pair of tweezers in their life.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome pair of tweezers. They easily grip fine hairs and pluck them out. The brow brush is a nice added feature to ensure great shaping of eyebrowns. Works well on slivers too! This is a high quality pair of tweezers that I highly recommend. Sample received for review purposes.</li>
    <li> It is OK.  My slant tweezers work better.</li>
    <li> I received 42 BEES Slant Tip tweezers to review.  I like to make sure my eyebrows are in check all of the time and have many tweezers.  I have dark hair and don&#x27;t like stray eyebrow hairs.  These tweezers shipped quickly and arrived in a plastic tube.  They aren&#x27;t my sharpest or pointiest tweezers but are still able to do a great job of helping me keep my eyebrows neatly groomed each day.  The paint is black and they are not overly slippery which has been my experience with some other tweezers I have owned.  With  assistance from my magnifying mirror I am able to pluck the smallest stray hair. The blades are lined up evenly and there is no gap between them like I have found with some lower priced tweezers.  The best thing about these tweezers is that the end is also a brow comb.  I love that I can use just one tool to take care of my brows. This comes in handy especially while traveling because there isn&#x27;t a need to pack a brow comb.  My new 42 BEES Slant Tip Tweezers have become a great addition to my travel bag as I have been spending a lot of weekends away recently.  I think these tweezers are a fantastic value at $7.42 on Amazon.com right now.  You can find them here.  I received a complimentary pair of 42 BEES Slant Tip Tweezers to review; all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> One of the tweezers I own so far!!! I love that grab every single tiny hair from my eyebrows . The one I had before wich I still have wasnT that great since I couldn&#x27;t grab that well my hair . It would pinch my skin too , I love that Bees Tweezer didn&#x27;t pinch my skin, is very easy to use and it came with a nice contained to put it away. I highly recommend this Tweezer .&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I am not part or associated with the company and not paid to do this review.</li>
    <li> When I seen this product I just had to have it! How neat is it that not only is it a heavy duty pair of slant tweezers but on the opposite end it has a little comb to smooth your brows down so you can get an accurate vision of what your brows look like while you are tweezing them.I find this to be very useful since my brows usually grow a little wild.Using this pair of tweezers to comb them down helps guide me on where I last plucked a hair and allows me to get a well manicured brow. I love it and have no idea how I lived without it before! This is a great pair of tweezers and I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best! After one use I was ready to part with my old tweezers. These tweezers have a strong grip and make eyebrow grooming a breeze. I also love that it also has a built in eyebrow comb, It really is a all-in-one tool! This is an absolute must have for your make up case. I have been grooming my eyebrows for 10+ years and I wish I had found this product sooner, it is the most precise tool I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love the slant tip.  Makes tweezing my eyebrows so much easier!</li>
    <li> I have used so many tweezers ranging from low-end to high-end, and these are one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. They are able to grab the tiniest of hairs without pulling on the skin. Even stubborn, ingrown hairs are grabbed easily. I don&#x27;t have much use for the brow comb personally, but I&#x27;m sure it would be useful for others. I love these tweezers!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers on amazon, I love the comb at the top, makes for perfect brows. Very strong &amp; precise.</li>
    <li> Finally, tweezers I can love!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve used both low and high-end products. The brow comb is great, the tweezer itself is very sharp but doesn&#x27;t pull the skin. Gets out even the smallest, most stubborn hair with precision. I love these tweezers!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this tweezer. Easy to grip and it works!</li>
    <li> really enjoy the design of them. I like how there is a comb on the end so you can easily shape your brows. It really comes in handy- by combing your brows first you can really see what truly needs to know. That way you wont pluck anything that should still be there. Thats my favorite feature of these! I also think that the tip is really nice, it does its jobs. It gets rid of unwanted hair easily. Overall, i would recommend this product! My only complaint is that i think theyre a bit over priced!</li>
    <li> When I first thought about posting a review on tweezers, I thought to myself &amp;#34;how am I going to say anything about tweezer. How can they be different then others??&amp;#34; Well that was before I received these. They come in a neat little box with a bumble bee on it which my son fell in love with! I haven&#x27;t even opened the box and already my son was excited for them!! When I first got my hands on them they were very strong and sturdy. They had an excellent point which helped grab the smallest little hairs to pull! I do not have a beard, however it has a small brush on it which would be perfect for it. Ladies, I can see you using the brush on your eyebrows also. I am extremely happy with these tweezers and would recommend them to others. There can be a large difference between tweezers which I never thought, however these blow away the other junky ones we have!</li>
    <li> They are ok....better than ones from the supermarket, but not as precise as expected</li>
    <li> I love this tweezer gets the job done it&#x27;s very pointy.</li>
    <li> I love them, they work even on the little itty bitty hairs that I can never seem to pluck. Great tweezers!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m VERY particular with my tweezers and I just love this one!! It&#x27;s very sharp and will pick up the smallest hair. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, I love that they have a comb on one end, they are made with sturdy metal. Can pull out the smallest hair, easy to grip. I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite tweezers. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary (or at a discount) in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. These are just my own opinions and based on my personal experience</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love it! Truly works magic!</li>
    <li> These things are so great!!  The little comb at the end is absolutely helpful. Does not feel cheap. Doesnt pull my skin. Works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing slant with like zero space so that it gets every hair!</li>
    <li> Works wonderful. I love it</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great! I love the slanted tip, and they&#x27;re so easy to use. It has a nice, clean look to it as well. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I recieved these complimentary to review but my review is 100% my opinion. I liked these tweezers! Not cheap at all. My first pair of tweezers with a comb at the end so I was excited about that and it works great. The only problem is you have to use a lot of pressure to pinch the two ends together.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no reason a person need a pair of $20 ($25 list price) tweezers.  If there were, these tweezers are a far squeeze from being worth the cost.  Even at $9.42 (the &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; price at the time of writing this, it makes no sense to purchase them.  Now to be clear, I did receive this product at a discounted price of $1 in exchange for my honest review via the program at honestfew.com.  Also, I am a dude so I have limited need for tweezers and thusly was not in the market for the product prior to my purchase.  My wife so graciously tested it out during her morning routine and was immediately concerned with how stiff a feel it had.  It took considerably more pressure to tweeze and she was concerned that excessive use could cause fatigue, hand cramps.  I tried it myself and also did not like the stiffness.  My wife was also very confused about the point of the comb and felt it was a useless gimmick.  Overall the build quality is solid, but so is that of our sub $5 tweezers that happen to look pretty much identical to the 42 Bees Slant Tip Tweezers (except without the useless comb at the end).  Don&#x27;t get sucked into the brand&#x27;s fancy-talk mumbo-jumbo.  You don&#x27;t need these.</li>
    <li> I can always tell when I first encounter a package that the company has paid extra attention to detail on, that the product inside is going to have the same level of care taken. Such is the case with these 42 Bees Slant Tip Tweezers! The package is a boldly graphic honeycomb shape, while the tweezers thoughtfully come encased in their own PVC storage tube. Organizational clean-freaks like me will love this, and it also keeps them from getting knocked around in your beauty bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re used to drugstore tweezers that make you cringe with their ineffectiveness, be reassured, these are no mere drugstore tweezers. These are professional-quality stainless steel with heads sharpened to within .4mm, which means you will have precise control and gripping ability while plucking and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though clearly designed with eyebrow shaping in mind, these are also perfect for other tasks such as removing ingrown hairs, removing splinters and ticks, as well as other first-aid applications. You might want to get two pairs- one to keep in your makeup supplies and one to keep in your first-aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of these  tweezers is the gripping end, which doubles as a wide tooth comb for shaping and combing your brows. This is a genius-level move right up there with whoever started putting mirrors on lipstick tubes. It&#x27;s so nice not to have to dig through your bag looking for a brow brush, when you can just turn the tweezers around and have one handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and precision of these tweezers. they&#x27;re an indispensable tool that I would recommend having on hand at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tweezers. The comb on the end is so handy. Usually tweezing my eyebrows can be quite the challenge when I try to get every stray hair but these make it so easy.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying that these tweezers are a gift from the heavens!! I am being so serious about this. They are made from stainless steal so they are very heavy duty. They are kind of hard to squeeze together at first but I hope they get a little easier they more that you use them. They came in really cute packaging, which for me is all ways a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it came in a, what I would call, a travel case sort of thing so you can just grab and throw in your make up bag, purse, or what ever you are going to be using that day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are slanted a little bit at the tip and also have a mini comb at the end so you can brush your eye brow hairs anyway you want them to go.</li>
    <li> These are meant for eyebrows, I know. I got them specifically for my wife to use to that end and to occasionally sneak using myself since I sometimes get &amp;#34;old man brow&amp;#34; with that one long, stray, weird-colored hair. I&#x27;d appreciate if you&#x27;d keep that bit quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so far, these tweezers have been used by my wife as directed, by myself in secret, and to remove splinters from our kids&#x27; hands and feet. We also used them to pull a cat&#x27;s claw from my dog&#x27;s face. (Don&#x27;t ask)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great tweezers. They&#x27;re sharp, but not cutting-sharp, just sharp enough to make sure you can get a grip without trouble. They grip well and offer enough leverage to get the job done. The little eyebrow comb is a nice touch too. Not that I&#x27;ve, ahem, used it, ahem. (Remember our deal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received these at a deeply discounted price in return for a review. This review is my honest assessment.</li>
    <li> These tweezers have been the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever own. I absolutely love it! I definitely recommend to all my family and friends to buy it.</li>
    <li> Works great. It&#x27;s just a little hard to squeeze it together, that&#x27;s all. I would still buy it again and would definitely recommend to family and friends. Thanks.</li>
    <li> have to get use to them, but they are ok</li>
    <li> Plucks out on the first try and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the the metal/plastic handle ones! The comb is great to trim too!</li>
    <li> Love it!! tried it as soon as it arrived , I love that it&#x27;s very firm and love the little comb. I&#x27;ll definitely make sure this one doesn&#x27;t go MIA</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many tweezers from many different stores, mostly drugstores like CVS or Walgreens, but also from makeup stores like Sephora. I have not liked the quality of any of them like I like this one. The other tweezers I&#x27;ve had seem so flimsy and light and these are sturdy and I know will last a long time. I&#x27;ve used these a few times and they have worked so great. Can easily pluck eyebrows with no pinching like I&#x27;ve experienced with cheaper tweezers. I also love the little comb at the end of it. Makes tweezing so much easier. I&#x27;m very happy with these and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for good quality tweezers.</li>
