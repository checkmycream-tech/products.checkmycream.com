      <li>THIS OIL IS AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s kind of like warm vasolean.  </li>
      <li>Although - a bit on a the pricey if I am honest.</li>
      <li>I liked the packaging  </li>
      <li>Does have a nice feel after it absorbs.  </li>
      <li>I hope I never have to live without this wonderful oil, I am a lifer!</li>
      <li>It is by far the best product I have ever used on my face</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, it absorbs quickly and smells soooo good.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be more like a gel.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time I just wipe my skin with a towel after applying this lotion so I can avoid getting oil on my clothing.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely scent though.</li>
      <li>and I love putting this on my face.  </li>
      <li>do love it as a skin conditioner.</li>
      <li>Your skin will thank you.  :)</li>
      <li>it smells fantastic, too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and none work quite like this one.  </li>
      <li>Ended up leaving the store with a tube of this and also Jao&#x27;s lip balm (which I also love).</li>
      <li>I prefer the thicker consistency (compared to oils) as it gives me more control when I put it on.</li>
      <li>This replaces seabuckthorn oil as my favorite skin moisturizer.</li>
      <li>maybe but not keeping it in my rotation of products I love.  </li>
      <li>It immediately made my skin look more luminous, and my hand felt softer than I remember it ever feeling.</li>
      <li>This body oil smells wonderful and soaks in fast, leaving skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best products on the market- hands down.</li>
      <li>It is light and soaks in.</li>
      <li>Its a great all season staple body product for total body and hair.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s sticky to smooth on.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>So worth the money!</li>
      <li>Since I first purchased it a year ago I have ordered 2 more tubes.</li>
      <li>Great for dry, chapped hands.  </li>
      <li>Great product for dry skin.</li>
      <li>It felt really good; it instantly softened my hands and made them feel smooth.</li>
      <li>I use the oil at night before bed and wake up to super smooth and nourished hands.</li>
      <li>Yea, nothing special.  </li>
      <li>Found this product on vacation last year and loved it.  </li>
      <li>And is makes you feel so soft, moisturized and gives a nice glow/shine.</li>
      <li>not a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dry skin areas healed after just one use, my skin was significantly softer and it smells sooooo good.</li>
      <li>I usually prefer woody scents, like sandalwood, so I have to be in the right mood for this because it will linger for many hours (which could also be a great feature, but not if you wear another perfume with it).</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy at all and yet super moisturizing.</li>
      <li>When I finally got it, I realized that it has a very overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and unusual!</li>
      <li>Great product - really helps dry skin issues!  </li>
      <li>Love this for my super dry skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is so delicious and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I ordered on Amazon the next day and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It really is like combining all the scents in the Garden Of Eden!</li>
      <li>It is pricey but worth it because it does not take much to do the job--just a dab.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried Goe body oil was when I purchased it at the Moscow Co-op in Moscow, Idaho.</li>
      <li>Feels very luxurious and is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>- I can&#x27;t imagine why it never occurred to me that this would have such a strong scent, given that it&#x27;s filled to the brim with lucious natural flowers and oils.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to highly scented things (and tend to tune out fragrances that are overpowering) and this oil provides just the right amount of complexity without being cloyingly floral or sickly sweet.</li>
      <li>Hands down, an amazing product, like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
      <li>This is a great moisturizer for your skin - but use sparingly as you only need a small quantity to get smooth, soft skin!</li>
      <li>This took almost two weeks to arrive which I find interesting since it was shipped within the same state as where I live.  </li>
      <li>: I think it hydrates really well</li>
      <li>I really like this oil.</li>
      <li>The scent is absolutely heavenly.</li>
      <li>Really, it&#x27;s lucious.</li>
      <li>This product was better than I ever expected it to be!</li>
      <li>I have tried many products through the years, this is the only one that has made a lasting difference.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best massage oils I&#x27;ve ever found - it is slick while you&#x27;re working with it for several minutes, then just sinks into the skin without leaving a puddle of glop.</li>
      <li>All the reviews for the product have been glowing, so my expectations were high.</li>
      <li>which makes me feel a little better about putting it on my face or hair.</li>
      <li>I have natural, curly hair and found that this works really well to seal in my leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have super dry skin</li>
      <li>The scent is similar to Fresh&#x27;s- scent Brown Sugar products a little sweet for me.  </li>
      <li>Another wow for Jao.</li>
      <li>It works well as far as hydrating</li>
      <li>so you can only really use it on elbows, feet, hands</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use the oil at night before bed and wake up to super smooth and nourished hands. The scent is light and unusual!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Great on my hands, feet and in my hair. All the reviews for the product have been glowing, so my expectations were high. But I find the oil best for certain body parts and not others.</li>
    <li> Yea, nothing special.  I wasnt as impressed as I thought Id be.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive, but so worth it.  I have dry skin and I love putting this on my face.  It is thick and spreads slowly, and my skin stays fresh looking all day without being shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out and in the winter, it&#x27;s a nice layer to protect against the cold wind.  The smell is so delicious and a little goes a long way.  So worth the money!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling.  I rub a small dab in my hands before applying my hair styling mouse and rub it in with the mouse.  My hair shines with out looking greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product - really helps dry skin issues!  I love the scent too!  I just wish it came in a bigger tube!!!</li>
    <li> I came across this body oil in a small consignment store in Brooklyn. I liked the packaging  so me and my friend tried a little bit on our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving the store, we were walking down the street and I noticed that both of us were still rubbing our hands together! It felt really good; it instantly softened my hands and made them feel smooth. We turned around in our tracks and headed back to the store to purchase, but they were all out and only had the sample left. I ordered on Amazon the next day and absolutely love it. Instead of using it on my body, I actually use it in my hair as a moisturizer and to tame frizz. I have natural, curly hair and found that this works really well to seal in my leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love this for my super dry skin. Just a little goes a long way so it lasts as long as cheaper lotions.</li>
    <li> If you want to make your dry aging skin look younger, well this is the answer. This product was better than I ever expected it to be! And... it&#x27;s all natural</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! This is a high quality product with natural ingredients that won&#x27;t later give you cancer, alzheimer&#x27;s, reproductive or neurological issues, etc. It also works and keeps your skin heavenly soft. You can use it on your hair too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture of this, it&#x27;s kind of like warm vasolean.  I thought this would be more like a gel.  It works well as far as hydrating but it&#x27;s sticky to smooth on.</li>
    <li> This took almost two weeks to arrive which I find interesting since it was shipped within the same state as where I live.  Its very thick so you can only really use it on elbows, feet, hands maybe hair did not try that yet.  It smells ok not amazing like I expected.  The scent is similar to Fresh&#x27;s- scent Brown Sugar products a little sweet for me.  You need to wait a good bit for it to absorb before putting clothes on.  Does have a nice feel after it absorbs.  Would I buy it again?  maybe but not keeping it in my rotation of products I love.  Jojoba oil can do basically the same for a lot less and you can use on your face as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It is my travel oil: I think it hydrates really well when I am on planes. It smells good too. I use it on my hands and on the ends of my hair. It is pricey but worth it because it does not take much to do the job--just a dab.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  Great for dry, chapped hands.  I&#x27;ve been stingy with it by not sharing it with friends.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 4 years....cannot switch to anything else.  Amazing stuff</li>
    <li> The first time I tried Goe body oil was when I purchased it at the Moscow Co-op in Moscow, Idaho. I was instantly hooked! It is by far the best product I have ever used on my face (I only use it on my face because it is quite spendy). After just one use I could see and feel the difference. Dry skin areas healed after just one use, my skin was significantly softer and it smells sooooo good. My mother came to visit and was also hooked. She has very dry skin and has always suffered from it. Goe oil is the only product she has ever tried that actually gave her immediate results. Since I first purchased it a year ago I have ordered 2 more tubes. Unfortunately I have never seen it anywhere else but the Co-op in Moscow and then on-line since I have been in Alaska.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for your skin - but use sparingly as you only need a small quantity to get smooth, soft skin!</li>
    <li> I love this!! It is perfect for summer wear.  It absorbs rapidly and lasts me all day. Having said that, I wish I had ordered several tubes as mine is almost gone.</li>
    <li> THIS OIL IS AMAZING. I went to a local apothecary to buy lotion, and the girl who worked there recommended this, saying that people swear by this stuff. I was doubtful, but tried it and am so happy I did! It immediately made my skin look more luminous, and my hand felt softer than I remember it ever feeling. In addition, the smell is intoxicating. I&#x27;m not a scent person at all and generally avoid fragrances like the plague, but this smell is a lot more subtle and more of a base tone than an offensive scent. This replaces seabuckthorn oil as my favorite skin moisturizer. I prefer the thicker consistency (compared to oils) as it gives me more control when I put it on. I&#x27;ve used it on my arms and legs (in addition to hands, elbows, knees) and it absorbs fast enough for me. Ended up leaving the store with a tube of this and also Jao&#x27;s lip balm (which I also love). Cannot recommend this product or brand enough.</li>
    <li> I love this product!, great for face hands feet anywhere where you have try skin.. Works really good on your hair too!,</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite indulgences! I was introduced to it at a sugaring salon that I no longer go to, but I still buy it regularly on Amazon. Jao Goe Oil smells great and can be used anywhere on your body.  You only need a little, so the tube lasts a long time, and did I mention it smells amazing?  Would make a great gift--for yourself or someone else.</li>
    <li> This body oil smells wonderful and soaks in fast, leaving skin feeling soft and smooth. Although - a bit on a the pricey if I am honest.</li>
    <li> I tried this in the store and BEGGED for it as a gift. When I finally got it, I realized that it has a very overwhelming scent. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, it&#x27;s just very strongly scented of all the wonderful botanicals that go into it. I MUST have noticed it in the store - I can&#x27;t imagine why it never occurred to me that this would have such a strong scent, given that it&#x27;s filled to the brim with lucious natural flowers and oils. I usually prefer woody scents, like sandalwood, so I have to be in the right mood for this because it will linger for many hours (which could also be a great feature, but not if you wear another perfume with it). I think it smells like Hawaii.. not a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love it as a skin conditioner. It is light and soaks in. You can use one tube for everything - hair, lips, skin - geat for traveling. Really, it&#x27;s lucious. The only reason i&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because if you&#x27;ve never smelled it before, and order it by mail, you might be surprised at the heady aroma. It really is like combining all the scents in the Garden Of Eden!</li>
    <li> Another wow for Jao. The smell and absorbability combined with its nontoxic formula make this product a smash hit in my book. This company makes superb products.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin. Especially feet! I had surgery on my ankle and needed something that would  remedy this dryness! Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I suffer from psoriasis and this cleared my hands up and helped them heal.  I have tried many products through the years, this is the only one that has made a lasting difference.</li>
    <li> This is the best, most luxurious oil I have ever found. It is completely natural, not a nefarious ingredient in it and smells like heaven. I use it on my face, my hair and scalp, my hands and anywhere else where dryness is a problem. It is not too greasy and a little goes along way. I hope I never have to live without this wonderful oil, I am a lifer!</li>
    <li> Great product, shiny legs. After shaving you just need to apply a small amount of the Goe Oil and you are ready to go!</li>
    <li> I only use a small amount per the product directions, but it&#x27;s still takes forever to soak in. Most of the time I just wipe my skin with a towel after applying this lotion so I can avoid getting oil on my clothing. It has a lovely scent though. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best body product I&#x27;ve ever used!! It penetrates, never feels greasy, and lasts for hours!!! Hands down, an amazing product, like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all and yet super moisturizing. Feels very luxurious and is well worth the price. Your skin will thank you.  :)</li>
    <li> Found this product on vacation last year and loved it.  I was afraid I would never find it again but I found it here and it was cheaper!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with everyone else, this is an incredible product. 100% All natural ingredients, and I mean, really all natural...which makes me feel a little better about putting it on my face or hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, it absorbs quickly and smells soooo good. Its a little pricey but honestly, really worth it and a little goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> This oil works amazingly!  Its a very small container &amp; pricey, but it works.  I am outside in the winter a lot and I have very dry skin &amp; KP and it helped both in just two applications.  I tried it in my hair as well, but just on the ends as it would make the scalp area too greasy.  Very lovely fragrance as well. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This was an impulse purchase last summer at a little beauty/body shop in NYC. Its a great all season staple body product for total body and hair. It has a subtle scent that wont interfere w/ perfume. And is makes you feel so soft, moisturized and gives a nice glow/shine.</li>
    <li> incredible! one tube lasts me about two months and I use it everywhere! I have super dry skin and I swim daily so this is a lifesaver. it smells fantastic, too! no joke - it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market- hands down. I&#x27;ve tried many products and none work quite like this one.  It&#x27;s extremely long lasting as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best massage oils I&#x27;ve ever found - it is slick while you&#x27;re working with it for several minutes, then just sinks into the skin without leaving a puddle of glop. The scent is absolutely heavenly. I am very sensitive to highly scented things (and tend to tune out fragrances that are overpowering) and this oil provides just the right amount of complexity without being cloyingly floral or sickly sweet. I hope this product is never retired or I&#x27;ll have to become a crazy oil hoarder.</li>
