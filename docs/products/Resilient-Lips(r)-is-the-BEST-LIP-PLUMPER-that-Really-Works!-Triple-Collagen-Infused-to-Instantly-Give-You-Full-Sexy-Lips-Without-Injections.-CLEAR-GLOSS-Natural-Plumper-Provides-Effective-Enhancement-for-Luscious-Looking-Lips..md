      <li>I am so happy about this product.  </li>
      <li>Not too happy.</li>
      <li>LOOK AMAZING!</li>
      <li>love it best as a night moisturizing treatment before bed &amp; during chapped-dry winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even a good gloss</li>
      <li>I regret buying this honestly..</li>
      <li>I love this lip plump, it is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite high-shine glosses.</li>
      <li>More of a 3.5.</li>
      <li>I just put some lip gloss on top.</li>
      <li>Tried different brands, Reselient Lips the best.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s if I don&#x27;t find something better before I run out.</li>
      <li>Great product, highly recommended it.</li>
      <li>As a lip gloss it is fine but as a lip plumper it doesn&#x27;t work in the slightest.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product as a lip gloss and will probably purchase again to use as my primary lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>this lip plumper is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many that either really didn&#x27;t make a difference or stung.  </li>
      <li>It was bright pink in color</li>
      <li>So, for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m giving five stars to this product because it has a nice, consistent, visually obvious effect for me every time I use it.</li>
      <li>The sheer is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did, and this has become the one I go to on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>It tingled a lot when I first used it</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off doing the Kylie Jenner lip challenge by sucking your face off with a shot glass and living with the bruises because at least that is free</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>It really works and replaces lipstick all together.</li>
      <li>Very upset about this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t see a difference after using it.</li>
      <li>fast shipment</li>
      <li>I always ask myself, do I really need another one??</li>
      <li>But I love the pink color!</li>
      <li>Long lasting, not sticky,and such a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other (much more expensive) lip plumping glosses that received great reviews</li>
      <li>This is a decent lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>I saw no results and the gloss wears off rather quickly, needing constant reapplying.</li>
      <li>High probability of buying again.</li>
      <li>I bought it for its high rating and reviews</li>
      <li>Nice thick constancy, provides a high gloss.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
      <li>It is so natural and gradually you look in the mirror and your lips are fuller!   </li>
      <li>Taste and smells good,  have only seen a small increase in lips but the gloss makes them look bigger when shiny anyways.</li>
      <li>It last a little longer than most glosses but still needs to be reapplied throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>It tingles upon application &amp; flushes the lips temporarily, but the real plumping ingredient is palmitoyl oligopeptide which takes several weeks to see a difference, so patience is required with this for plumping effects.</li>
      <li>Very shiny and works instantly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s full of collagen that was previously dehydrahated so it pulls the moisture to the collagen and</li>
      <li>I have berry (sheer baby pink on lips), cranberry (sheer red), &amp; crystal (iridescent shimmer), but clear is my favorite &amp; I</li>
      <li>Very sticky, used for a week and no evident plumping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super shiny like vinyl &amp; just a little bit goes a long way - I wipe off as much excess from the brush as possible before applying, otherwise it&#x27;s just a waste of product.</li>
      <li>Shipping was delayed and when I finally received the product it was the pink one instead of clear.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product shown was not the product delivered. Does nothing!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work unfortunately...I was hopeful</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it advertised it would do.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working....fast shipment</li>
    <li> I regret buying this honestly.. It&#x27;s way too expensive and I really don&#x27;t see a difference after using it. It tingled a lot when I first used it then I didn&#x27;t use it for a while and it literally just felt like regular lip gloss (it didnt tingle at all like a week after I started using it again!?) You&#x27;re better off doing the Kylie Jenner lip challenge by sucking your face off with a shot glass and living with the bruises because at least that is free</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and haven&#x27;t had any result whatsoever.  I bought it for its high rating and reviews but I am very disappointed.  It&#x27;s not even a good gloss let alone having ANY plumping effects. NEVER again...</li>
    <li> Best lip plumper. I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It really works and replaces lipstick all together. The sheer is my favorite. It seems a bit lighter and doesn&#x27;t leave that lips scum line around the inside of your lips that the pink one can. But I love the pink color!</li>
    <li> Not too happy. Shipping was delayed and when I finally received the product it was the pink one instead of clear. Didn&#x27;t feel like bothering with returning it.</li>
    <li> I tried this lip plumper last week and I will never use another brand. It worked instantly!! It doesnt even sting when i put it on. My lips look and feel fuller when i wear it.</li>
    <li> This product is not as described.  It was bright pink in color and when I peeled the barcode sticker of the small pastic label wrap came of and I ended up with a tube of pink lube that did not do anything to my lips other than make them shine.  (with other words no printing on product, just wrapped in plastic )I think this product is a farce and someone is making a lot of money off of nothing.  Amazon please look into this, I have never had this with an Amazon product before and rely on your standard. I send product back and hope to get refunded. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product at all. I saw no results and the gloss wears off rather quickly, needing constant reapplying. It is sticky too. Wouldnt waste my money ladies.</li>
    <li> Actully it didn&#x27;t serve the porpose...i apply but it didn&#x27;t give me the plumping effect at all ...this is fake product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky. Don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this lip plump, it is amazing.  I have tried so many that either really didn&#x27;t make a difference or stung.  I am so happy about this product.  Try it and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  It is so natural and gradually you look in the mirror and your lips are fuller!   Give this a try and give it a couple of weeks and you will look in the mirror one morning and say, hey, I have lips!</li>
    <li> What I received looks nothing like what is advertised. As a lip gloss it is fine but as a lip plumper it doesn&#x27;t work in the slightest.  Don&#x27;t trust the 5 star reviews.  Several have been posted on the same day.</li>
    <li> Taste and smells good,  have only seen a small increase in lips but the gloss makes them look bigger when shiny anyways.</li>
    <li> This is not what I was sold AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;The product is sticky and doesnt work as a plumper, infact it&#x27;s rubbish and a waste of money&lt;br /&gt;DONT BOTHER BUYING THIS, IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY IT&#x27;S A STICKY OVERPRICED LIPGLOSS.</li>
    <li> If i can give no star, I would. Most of the reviews are fake. They are copied from other reviews from other brands. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Buy bigger brands at the same price. Seriously wasted money on a low grade quality. Very upset about this. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> More of a 3.5. I really enjoy this product as a lip gloss and will probably purchase again to use as my primary lip gloss.  It does not pump my lips at all though.</li>
    <li> Very sticky, used for a week and no evident plumping.</li>
    <li> this lip plumper is my new favorite! Very shiny and works instantly</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S BARELY MY SECOND DAY USING IT &amp; MY LIPS LOOK AMAZING! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This is a decent lip gloss.  Nice thick constancy, provides a high gloss.  It last a little longer than most glosses but still needs to be reapplied throughout the day.  But it did not plump my lips, at all...nothing.</li>
    <li> This plumping gloss is EXTREMELY sticky but that&#x27;s what I like about it. It&#x27;s super shiny like vinyl &amp; just a little bit goes a long way - I wipe off as much excess from the brush as possible before applying, otherwise it&#x27;s just a waste of product. This is one of my favorite high-shine glosses. I have berry (sheer baby pink on lips), cranberry (sheer red), &amp; crystal (iridescent shimmer), but clear is my favorite &amp; I love it best as a night moisturizing treatment before bed &amp; during chapped-dry winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who don&#x27;t like sticky gloss will not like this. It&#x27;s like wearing lip glue, it&#x27;s very difficult to remove. But that what I like about it, it sticks to my lips a long time &amp; keeps them moisturized. It tingles upon application &amp; flushes the lips temporarily, but the real plumping ingredient is palmitoyl oligopeptide which takes several weeks to see a difference, so patience is required with this for plumping effects.</li>
    <li> No positive effect. No &amp;#34;Plumping&amp;#34; at all.</li>
    <li> Moisturized my lips but no difference in size</li>
    <li> Put on at bedtime, stays on all night. Tried different brands, Reselient Lips the best.</li>
    <li> My lips are already plumper with just two days of use and they stay plump even after the gloss wears off. My only complaint is that the shine does not last at all, but know big deal I just put some lip gloss on top. Very pleased with the results!!!!!!</li>
    <li> No more shot it works</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! Long lasting, not sticky,and such a pleasant smell. High probability of buying again. That&#x27;s if I don&#x27;t find something better before I run out. Just wish I could get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> This plumper takes some time to work. It&#x27;s a bit sticky, however that makes it stay on for a long time. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing. It&#x27;s full of collagen that was previously dehydrahated so it pulls the moisture to the collagen and re plumps below the surface of the thin skin layer. I will buy it again and use it in conjunction with other plumpers.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you have about 50+ lipglosses and or plumpers but only wear 3 regularly. I always ask myself, do I really need another one?? But I was dying to try this, based on the reviews, so I went ahead. I&#x27;m really glad I did, and this has become the one I go to on a daily basis. Put it on bare lips or over a lip stain and it will tingle like crazy and pump up the volume. If you put it on over a matte lipstick or another gloss or barrier it will not hit your lip flesh and won&#x27;t do jack. Great product, highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> I like the gloss but I see no change in my lips.  In fairness, it&#x27;s been one week of using it and I believe the directions say to apply 3 times a day for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Bogus. There&#x27;s only one verified review the rest are all done on the same day march 10.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve found. I think there may be some individual response these kinds of glosses. I&#x27;ve tried other (much more expensive) lip plumping glosses that received great reviews but, alas, had no effect on me whatsoever. So, for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m giving five stars to this product because it has a nice, consistent, visually obvious effect for me every time I use it.</li>
