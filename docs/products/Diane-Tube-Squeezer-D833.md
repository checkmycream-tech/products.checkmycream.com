<li> It has proven durable enough for everyday use.</li>

<li> of the toothpaste rollers are too narrow, but this Tube Squeezer fits with room to spare.  </li>

    <li> This this has been invaluable to me, for my favorite hand cream.  I&#x27;m addicted to The Body Shop&#x27;s hemp hand cream, but it comes in an aluminum-type tube that crinkles (rather than cleanly rolling or spreading) and causes me to waste a lot of product in the little bends - that never smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the toothpaste rollers are too narrow, but this Tube Squeezer fits with room to spare.  Since I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve flattened those little tubes into giving up every bit of the product within!</li>
    <li> It works very well for tubes that you use in the bathroom. It has proven durable enough for everyday use.</li>
    <li> works great.  good quality</li>
    <li> If there was an option to rate &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; stars I would. Bought this item and it broke after two usage of color tubes.</li>
    <li> Plastic does not hold up to larger tubes of paint. I would not buy if you are a avid painter.</li>
    <li> Love it, work like a charm!</li>
    <li> Sold these when I worked at an art store.  Tubes of paint can be very expensive.  Get that last bit of toothpaste out of the tube.</li>
    <li> This piece of garbage doesn&#x27;t even close completely. Under waste of time, money, &amp; plastic. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to receive my tube squeezer.  But after a few uses it&#x27;s very hard to use. I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I need this for color. Not happy I will order another kind and hope that it works.</li>
    <li> This product met all of my expectations at a very good price, I would gladly purchase this again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I wish it would squeeze a bit tighter but after a couple of passes it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> Terrible. It won&#x27;t roll a tube through at all. I&#x27;m not sure if this one is defective or they are all this terrible. I swear I used one before and it worked amazingly... The one I got is JUNK!</li>
    <li> Great for 3&amp;#34; wide tubes.  I actually prefer the simple slotted type tube squeezers, but they are only available for tubes 2 1/2&amp;#34; or less wide.  This Diane Tube Squeezer works well, and serves my need, even though it is larger and bulkier than I would like.  At $6, it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This device is by far the best of many I have tried to salvage the last bit of toothpaste, shampoo, etc. Unfortunately, I forgot to tell my husband that I had ordered it. He woke up this morning and saw it sitting in the dressing area, and was quite concerned that I had purchased some sort of medieval body part torture device.</li>
    <li> Quite simply:  it doesn&#x27;t work.  Squeezing the last drop out of a tube is tough for arthritic hands.  I had high hopes for this product but was thouroughly disappointed.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful until it broke! And I only use it occasionally. I guess metal would be better?</li>
    <li> Love it for sqeezing hair dye and also for toothpaste to get the tube clean &amp; limited waste.  It works with such ease, love it!</li>
