      <li>Surprising look, great value.</li>
      <li>Good smell, great feel.</li>
      <li>(California is in a drought) and I read that this good</li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as good as if it had just been washed, bit</li>
      <li>I wouldn’t call this a juicy fruity smell that you sometimes get from good shampoos.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re hair looking good.</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t as good as this product as I have to wait two minutes before brushing it through</li>
      <li>Maybe the Bastiste bottle will promise me ease with my education, career, friendship and happiness.</li>
      <li>I bought this at Walmart for 4.77 because it had good reviews</li>
      <li>It did a good job of controlling the oil</li>
      <li>Then I brush and it looks and smells good.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go all day</li>
      <li>I use this on hair day 3 or 4 and spray it a fair distance away from my roots and then immediately brush it out.</li>
      <li>It does take away the oils, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it works well and has lasted me a while! and smells good too</li>
      <li>I came across lots of good reviews for this product here and on Walmart.com</li>
      <li>It is a good price for the volume, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved to dye my hair bright and unnatural colors.</li>
      <li>I have a fairly oily skin and hair.</li>
      <li>What I like the best is putting it in before bed and my tossing and turning distributes it perfectly and gets rid of any white-</li>
      <li>this product does a great job absorbing oil, and has a great scent!</li>
      <li>Super awesome!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is so conveinant for mornings when I&#x27;m running late or when I need to get fresh in the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> Now I used to like humble and humbled dry shampoo and I still do, I also like the stuff from lush...but for this price this stuff is great. Even my husband&#x27;s grandmother who is in a nursing home has a can now. This stuff refreshes your hair well it soaks up grease adds body and has worked on my hair color when it was ombre, highlighted, blonde and dark brown without the tell tale powdery look. Now I don&#x27;t use this days running or heavily but on second day hair I can spray this in rub my roots and brush through. I don&#x27;t spray my part I normally use this as a refresh to help hide unwashed hair before I pull it up on errand days. It also helps before bed if my hair has been in a smelly environment (I.e. bowling alley hair). My only wish was that it smelled as good as the 4xs the money versions but hey for the price it&#x27;s my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> When I spray this, mostly wetness comes out. Eventually a little powder comes out, and I&#x27;m able to brush that through and it works well. But I feel like I&#x27;m using way more product than I need to because it&#x27;s mostly just liquid that&#x27;s coming out. I shake it well before spraying, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to help. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Helpful and does what it is supposed to do as stated.  I will purchase again.  I just wish that it would hold for 2 days!!  :)</li>
    <li> Leaves a heavy white residue. Many other dry shampoos do not leave visible residue.</li>
    <li> Have not used it yet as the sweet smell is rather strong.</li>
    <li> This stuff works awesome. I have long hair, medium thick and wavy.  I can go 3-4 days without washing in the shower using this stuff. I spray it on before I jump in the shower, then I comb through and do a quick blow dry to smooth it out.  I do think you can find it cheaper at your local drugstore. I think I&#x27;ve seen it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond too.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, oily hair that needs to be washed everyday or it looks dirty. Having two little ones washing everyday isn&#x27;t always possible and I found that this product works great. I tried the Treseme brand for the oil in my hair and it isn&#x27;t as good as this product as I have to wait two minutes before brushing it through and even then I don&#x27;t feel like it really absorbed the oil. Not Your Mother&#x27;s is sprayed on and I can brush right after and my hair looks clean, and even fuller. Pony tails look great after spraying this in my hair and I have even used it a couple of times to add some volume to my hair when I am in ponytail mode. Love this product and I look forward to trying there other products soon.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I have long, thick hair that gets oily at the roots after one day. This stuff really does keep unwashed hair look fresh, and my hair healthy because I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day.</li>
    <li> First time trying a dry shampoo, and I have fine hair so I wanted to refuse split ends with les washing. Anyway it really did make my hair look great the next day with greasy bangs and all. It still felt greasy, but looked great and lasted all day. Surprising look, great value.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this product again since it left my hair too oily. Even my grown son had&lt;br /&gt;asked me what happened to my hair after using &#x27;Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry&#x27; on&lt;br /&gt;my hair. He had said, &amp;#34;What happened to your hair? Your head looks like a basted turkey&lt;br /&gt;with so much oil on it.&amp;#34;  LOL Unless you like greasy hair then don&#x27;t buy it. I had to use&lt;br /&gt;Prell Shampoo to get the oil out of my hair.</li>
    <li> It works well, but I prefer the powder products.</li>
    <li> My hair is short, fine and I keep it straightened. I dont like damaging it by washing and re-straightening it every day, so I only wash every few days and use dry shampoo in the mean time. I&#x27;ve been using Got2B&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; It dry shampoo, which I love but just doesn&#x27;t have enough uses in each can to be worth the price. Not Your Mother&#x27;s had good reviews and was cheap so I picked up a can at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed honestly. It didn&#x27;t work terribly well, left dandruff-like flakes in my hair and on my clothes, and left my hair feeling like it was full of hairspray: dull, sticky and not soft at all. Despite this, it really only marginally reduced the oily appearance of my hair. Disappointed, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Smells great and I only wash my hair once a week so this is my in between method. I have medium brown hair and find that the white residue brushes out easily. Perfect product but it&#x27;s $5 @Walmart for the same size, j/s.</li>
    <li> ive been in need of a dry shampoo. I looked all over amazon for the cheapest with the most in it. this was it! it works well and has lasted me a while! and smells good too</li>
    <li> I have a fairly oily skin and hair. And I work out 4-5 days a week. I prefer to wash my hair only once or twice a week, therefore I rely on dry shampoo to keep my hair smelling nice and looking semi-clean. I thought I&#x27;d try this after I ran out of Batiste dry shampoo (they have it on amazon check it out it&#x27;s amazing &amp; cheaper). Anyway this dry shampoo smells clean but didn&#x27;t get rid of my grease. So I&#x27;ll be sticking with Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good quality dry shampoo that brushes through without leaving powdery marks. Quickly refreshes your hair and makes it smell nice too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried dry shampoo before. I was amazed when I used this. I pulled my hair out of a ponytail, turned my head upside down, sprayed a bit through the roots and then brushed. In about 8 seconds I looked like I had freshly washed and blow-dried hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying a large variety of dry shampoo products to use on my very oily hair. After using Pssssssst! for a long time, I found a can of this at a local store that sells damaged shelf pulls. I love the product, it works great and has a better smell than some of the others. However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in any of my local stores.  I recommend this product for oily hair. I used to have to wash every day, without fail, and now I can go three days if I choose to!</li>
    <li> I have heard nothing but amazing things about the Not Your Mother&#x27;s brand of products, mainly the sea salt spray. In the past week I just had human hair extensions sewn in and was told to only wash my hair once or twice a week and use a dry shampoo between the washes, but no specific dry shampoo was recommended. I Googled to find out the best ones and on the one site I found Dove was third best and only about $5 and I went to my local CVS which seemed to carry every Dove product except for the dry shampoo and then I spotted the Not Your Mother&#x27;s for about the same price and figured if their styling products were awesome then this would work great as well. I went home and started spraying it on my roots to start. At first the can only made a hissing noise and nothing was coming out so I kept spraying and spraying and then it looked like I had gray hair. I brushed it like the can said and it still wasn&#x27;t fully absorbing all the grease and oil so eventually I wet my hands and smoothed my roots so I didn&#x27;t look like I had gray roots at 20 years old. Today when I woke up my hair still feels nasty and my ends now feel super greasy as well and they were fine until I sprayed them last night. I&#x27;m using tonight as my one was per week and definitely looking into getting the Dove dry shampoo for this coming week. I&#x27;m also going to see if they have a \\&quot;satisfaction guarenteed or your money back\\&quot; thing because I&#x27;d definitely like my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to the other low ratings that said it smells funny but they don&#x27;t know what it smells like, my honest and probably a little gross, opinion is that it smells like the tampons and pads that are scented. I hate that smell and as soon as I sprayed the dry shampoo that is what I instantly compared the smell too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this without having very high hopes due the price. Wow am I glad that I did!! It works very well and very quickly! I think it somewhat wears by the end of the day, but if I were to use it twice a day I think it would be completely fine. It sprays out white which on my black hair I was nervous about, but it did a good job without leaving white residue all over. Some minor white flaking, but not to the the point where it is noticeable to anyone else. Will continue to purchase and glad I took the risk!</li>
    <li> I love Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo!!  It&#x27;s the best for brown hair or any dark hair colors because there is no white residue.</li>
    <li> Every dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used in the past did not blend well and left a white residue that wouldn&#x27;t come out despite brushing and finger-combing. After a search online, I decided to try this. It&#x27;s great and the spray powder blends easily into the hair, so no more grayish hue. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I can go a whole week without actually washing my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST! I have thick, dark, curly hair and this product has never let me down. The smell is a little bit strong, but goes away after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I have tried two types of Batiste, one of the tropical smelling ones as well as the one for blonde hair specifically. I&#x27;ve also tried the Amika perk up dry shampoo as well as the Klorane dry shampoo with Nettles. I liked the blonde one from Batiste, but you really have to brush your hair through to get all the gold colored residue out. I also liked the Klorane because it is more natural but it&#x27;s pretty expensive. And I felt like the Amika one just wasn&#x27;t quite doing it for me. I still felt like I had some oily looking hair after using. For reference, I have long, dirty blonde hair. I have to wash every day, and it has to be in the morning because if I shower at night, my hair is already oily around the roots by morning. And when I shower, I don&#x27;t feel like going out after work unless I put my hair up because ugh it will look oily by the end of the night. I know you&#x27;re not supposed to wash your hair every day but with hair this oily, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to wait a day to wash. So, my cousin who is a stylist bought me the Batiste dry shampoo while we were on vacation together and I&#x27;ve been experimenting since! Between them all, I love the Klorane, but this one is much more reasonably priced and it gets the job done very well. I will usually spray around the roots and move my hair around to get good coverage on all the hair. Then I fluff my hair up and go about getting ready for the day while it soaks in for a bit. Then I brush and style! I actually like my hair better now on the days when I use dry shampoo because it gives my very fine hair some volume. Your hair will feel kind of thick and textured but it doesn&#x27;t look it at all. You do have to brush well to get the white/gray look away. And if you have dark hair, my cousin who has dark brown hair got the Batiste for brown hair and she loves it. It really does work. Just make sure to brush well or you&#x27;ll get colored residue just like I had with the golden stuff in my hair.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. And that is enough for me. I have super oliy prone hair and live in a high humidity area, so even after showering i look like i did not shower and i cant stand that, nor will i wash my hair every single day (its bad for your hair), so i use this in between showers and when im going out. before trying this brand i was using pantene dry shampoo (which i love, but it feels super dry and scratchy to the touch sadly), so i tried this for 5 bucks from walmart and it works a bit better then pantene, and im enjoying it so far, the only thing i really dislike is the smell, to Me the smell reminds me of home flea spray (i have 4 dogs, i know that smell well), and i dont like that smell at all. only bothers me when freshly sprayed tho.&lt;br /&gt;i want this same dry shampoo, just in a different smell...lol</li>
    <li> I was using Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo (it&#x27;s fairly cheap and works pretty well) but I ran out and CVS did not carry it. I ended up trying this one by Not Your Mother&#x27;s and was very impressed. It&#x27;s a few dollars more than the Suave and the scent is not as strong (but I do like the scent of both). If I do a light mist then I do not see any white residue (I have black hair so I can definitely tell). And if I think my hair is especially oily, I spray a bit more on but the white powder residue goes away on its own within a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as nice as other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It also looked like I had dandruff no matter how much I brushed it</li>
    <li> I have fine hair which looks greasy very quickly but I don&#x27;t want to have to wash it every day. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully! It does have a baby powdery smell to it, which doesnt bother me, but it might for some. I saw some reviewers said that it doesnt work... Be sure to leave it in for 30-60 seconds BEFORE brushing or combing through your hair. I know it doesnt say that on the can and it should. But still, I love the NYM brands and will actually buy from their website.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail rather quickly since amazon didn&#x27;t ship it. I was kind of weird about it because I&#x27;ve tried so many duds and 9 bucks is 9 bucks. It said on the bottle that a mist of talc would come out so here I was in front of the mirror ready for defcon 5 spray and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed because no talc came out! Just a nice refreshing albeit fast nozzle and all. Brushed my hair and voila I was done! Can&#x27;t beat that! So it&#x27;s my new best friend. And you get a lot for the price which is rare nowadays. A WINNER!</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I used this. I normally swear by Bumble &amp; Bumble dry shampoo and I can usually never afford to buy it since it is about $40 for 1 bottle. I have tried all the other brands (Treseme, Bedhead, Catwalk, ect) and they were all laughably bad. I saw this at Wal-Mart and figured at about $5 it was worth a try. I was really amazed! It soaked up the oil and added volume. Also, I could brush it right away instead of having to wait for 2 minutes first. I would definitely reccomend this and I am anxious to try the other product by this company. I will add this note, since this is not a Prime eligible product as of yet, I will still be buying this at Wal-Mart and not on Amazon (I will save about $6 in shipping a $5 product).</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it, and I use dry shampoo occasionally if I have to leave the house without a shower.  This stuff was recommended by my hairstylist, and it does give texture and volume. However, it makes my hair feel dirty.  It’s like spraying powdered clay or something in the hair.  And then it is hard to wash out – I can feel it in my hair when I shampoo, and even after lathering my hair twice, it still feels gross.  Granted, I rarely use hair products, so I am sensitive to anything that feels heavy or chunky in my hair. I have used Garnier Fructis dry shampoo, which is much lighter and cleaner feeling, while still giving volume and eliminating greasiness. It also has a nicer scent.  I would recommend that product over this one, especially if you’re used to having your hair feel soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I was using TIGI brand rockaholic dry shampoo for years, but its $20/bottle so as much as I liked it, I needed a cheaper alternative. This NYM dry shampoo has a great price, a very mild, innocuous, baby powder like smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave dandruff like residue in your scalp like the TIGI brand did. Ive also tried the Aveeno brand but it left my hair kind of crunchy and gross, and couldn&#x27;t be used for multiple days in a row. This NYM I use for 2-3 days after washing my hair and it looks great. Highly recommend, can&#x27;t beat this price and quality combo!</li>
    <li> I have used a number of dry shampoos on my very fine, slightly oily hair. This one works better than the rest, even tho some of the others were much more expensive . It also adds a ton of volume. For value and performance, I would definitely say do with this product.</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair and my bangs get really greasy by the 2nd day so that&#x27;s my main reason for buying dry shampoo.  I tried about 8 different brands from super cheap to expensive, this has been my favorite by far. Some problems I had with other brands were: too strong of a scent, just not working well overall (hair will become greasy again shortly after applying), leaving too much residue, and clogging of the nozzle.  This brand is NONE of those things so it is a great bang for your buck!  It also works great for giving your hair volume.  I have zero complaints.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite dry shampoo. The smell is kind of like pine, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. I apply this VERY generously and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel tacky</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair super soft and less oily like i had just taken a shower. Perfect for when you are running late or just want to look amazing. It even makes my hair look blonder. What a great hair product!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo smells great and I want to love it but... Something about this shampoo makes my super straight hair matted and sticky. The powder ratio isn&#x27;t high enough to remove oils without repeated use throughout the day. Maybe this would work for someone with a different texture to their hair, but for my pin straight hair, this dry shampoo isn&#x27;t my first choice.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for mornings that i don&#x27;t have time to shampoo!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart for 4.77 because it had good reviews and I was on the search for a dry shampoo that actually worked. I love this stuff! If I use too much it does leave a white residue but it always brushes out for me. I have dark brown hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews on this before buying! Apparently this company is supposed to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but it the complete opposite. It literally smells like sunscreen with chemicals which makes it 100x worse. As soon as I smelled this I got light-headed and felt like throwing up because the scent was THAT bad. I then called the company for a refund and have no heard back yet. It also does a horrible job at cleaning my oily hair. Please please please do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Made my hair look even greasier, plus left a white residue.</li>
    <li> i tried to like but no... it just cant work for me. it so heavy it leaves my hair dry and only with volume. it dosent ceans it that makes them worse</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Tried another products, but this leaves my hair looking clean and feel product-free. I apply it to my dark hair before bed and don&#x27;t have any residue viable in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great quality, one of my favorite cheap dry shampoos along with Batiste and Tresemme. Dries out hair really well but it can feel a bit starchy.</li>
    <li> Probably not my final pick, as I prefer more organic options- but for the price, best I&#x27;ve found. Mixes into your hair really well without leaving a powdery look and color. Also, doesn&#x27;t make your scalp itch.</li>
    <li> Having tried almost every dry shampoo available, I really, REALLY wanted to love this product.  I am extremely hard to please when it comes to dry shampoo and I have high expectations, lol with that being said I rated this one just ok.  In a pinch it will do and I am not sure if I will buy it again.  The pros are it&#x27;s available at CVS around here so I won&#x27;t have to purchase online, it doesn&#x27;t leave that trademark white residue and it doesn&#x27;t stink to high heaven or leave your hair sticky, stiff or unmanageable.  The cons are it doesn&#x27;t quite absorb oil the way some others so, so if your hair isn&#x27;t oily it may work well for you.  It also doesn&#x27;t add volume and leaves your hair kind of dull in appearance.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I ran out of my regular dry shampoo and thought I would try this brand.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well to get the oil out of my hair but there is a downside. The smell is kind of overpowering. It smells pretty much just like baby powder. I don&#x27;t mind that smell but I wouldn&#x27;t really like my hair to smell that way.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. My sister turned my on to it, and it works pretty well to get through an extra day before you wash your hair. It gives it a lot of texture, so it&#x27;s better for styling hair than just wearing it down, for me. I have fine hair, so it changes the texture a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and honestly this is by far the best and cheapest. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, soaks up all the oil for multiple days in a row, isn&#x27;t sticky, combs in well, basically does EVERYTHING a dry shampoo should, much cheaper than pro brands. I love this product and I will probably use it until the day I die.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair AND live in an area of high humidity.  I can no longer make it one full day after showering without minimal sweat fully saturating my head and making me look like I haven&#x27;t bathed in a week.  As a professional, I need to look sharp.  I have tried some of the other &#x27;cheaper&#x27; brands and was disappointed by the &#x27;clumping&#x27; or white build up that looked like I had horrible dandruff AND oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;It was months before I tried another dry shampoo since I had little faith in them.&lt;br /&gt;At CVS this product was on sale so I grabbed a can out of desperation one afternoon before a meeting.&lt;br /&gt;It was the BEST thing I have come across.  I consider it a miracle for my situation.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am addicted.  I use it nearly every morning and go two days if I need to without a full shower (necessary as the mom of a two year old).&lt;br /&gt;After using, my hair was DRY and CLEAN without removing the shine from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;As far as this &#x27;mystery smell&#x27; some of the reviews comment on? I have zero idea.  To me the neutrality of the product scent is a welcome condition compared to some of those over-flowery, heavily perfumed sprays.&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommended it to MANY people who have thanked me for pointing them this direction.</li>
    <li> I loooove this product. I use it a few times a week, and it buys me time in the  morning, and keeps from overwashing the hair.</li>
    <li> My bangs get oily and limp WAY before it&#x27;s time to wash my hair, and this spray does a nice job of reviving them.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it - I just wish Amazon would carry the travel size, too.</li>
    <li> I tried this product this morning while on a dash to the bank.  What struck me was the smell.  It smells like a scented tampon.  I&#x27;m not kidding, and I wish I was.  I ran around doing errands this morning, thinking in the back of my mind \\&quot;I smell like a scented tampon.\\&quot;  It did nothing for my confidence, and my hair still felt oily.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I live on dry shampoo. I use it every day (don&#x27;t worry, I use it on days I&#x27;ve washed my hair too!)...and NYM&#x27;s Clean Freak is hands down my favorite. (Aveeno would be next, followed by Treseme and finally Victoria&#x27;s Secret.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know. I have an addiction to dry shampoos. No need to tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product isn&#x27;t the best smelling dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used (that would be Aveeno), it&#x27;s absolutely the best at its job. And for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this, along with NYM&#x27;s beach waves, after my shower for days that I want to curl my hair and for my curls to stay. I have dark brown hair and the powder absorbs into my hair with one brush stroke without a trace of it ever being there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have found yet. It keeps my hair from getting oily and adds volume as well. It also has a great smell!</li>
    <li> this product does a great job absorbing oil, and has a great scent! It&#x27;s not overwhelming, but gives you a clean fresh feel, It blends in very well once you brush your hair after the product has been sprayed in. I will continue to purchase this product in the future! Perfect for days when you don&#x27;t have time or motivation to wash your locks! ;)</li>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars I would. Doesn&#x27;t work half as good as other cheap products I&#x27;ve tried, plus, it left me smelling like 409 cleaner. BTW.. this is less than $5 at Walmart!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of dry shampoos and this is the best one! This doesn&#x27;t leave you with that gross white residue. In a matter of seconds it makes your hair feel light and refreshed. I wish I found this sooner it&#x27;s a total life changer!</li>
    <li> This was awesome. I use it the days i don&#x27;t take a shower. Although i do not like it when it makes my hair feel thick.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a terrible smell. I would recommend this to friends/family. It does take away the oils, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product and would love to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am use to using Treseme&#x27;s Dry shampoo, and I love it. It makes my hair feel clean and smells amazing.  The store I recently went to did not have the Treseme one, so I decided to try this one. It does not make my hair feel clean and it smell awfulllllllll.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! Doesn&#x27;t leave the white powdery residue other products leave! Smells fresh too! It gives me 24 more hours of styled hair since my hair is so oilyyyy, now instead of washing it every other day, with this product I get an extra day with pretty hair!!!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I sweat in my sleep and my hair gets oily at times. My answer to this has been to put a bit of baby powder in my hair and then go to sleep. The baby powder does leave white residue, but it evens out while I sleep. Then I brush and it looks and smells good. On the rare occasion that a little white is left over, I just use a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to spray liberally. I didn&#x27;t, but even the small amount I did use (as far away from my head as I could get with my arms) was still so heavy it left gray/white streaks. My baby powder does this, but costs WAY less. If I am going to spend extra moolah on a specialized product, I want it to be better than baby powder. The spray DID NOT even out as I slept and I had to wet my head to make the streaks go away. Brushing did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although the scent is not unpleasant, it isn&#x27;t really pleasant either. Kind of like a bar of soap smell. Geared towards being gender neutral, so it would be good for light haired guys, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because it did soak up the oil and did not make my hair feel too weird - although there was a noticeable difference in texture, it just wasn&#x27;t a bad difference.</li>
    <li> Always makes your hair white powdery.  (Ie, if you are brunette you look like you have grey hair).</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair that tends to be oily on the second day of no washing I just got this at wm and was surprisingly impressed I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they would leave my hair with a white tint I have jet blk hair. And they wouldn&#x27;t really take away the oily appareance my only complaint about this product is it makes my hair feel a lil tacky or rough n stiff slightly but its def not that big of an issue that I wouldn&#x27;t buy again I would def recommend</li>
    <li> I tried this and the Batiste. This works fine as a dry shampoo, but doesn&#x27;t give the same volume and has a strange smell. It is a good price for the volume, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my desk at work. When my hair feels sweaty or oily, I can spray this and it does  a nice volume job.</li>
    <li> I did not try this product, so I do not know if it works.&lt;br /&gt;I read the ingredients and am returning it.&lt;br /&gt;The first two ingredients are alcohol (not a huge biggie in hair products I guess), but the second is Butane.&lt;br /&gt;No thanks. It might work awesome, but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely one of the best dry shampoos for your money.  Never tried before but will be one of the staples in my dressing room now.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo ever. It works well and definitely lengthens the time i need between showers.</li>
    <li> You may need a lot depending on how oily your hair is. You can even take a shower and use no shampoo, and apply the dry shampoo afterwards. The smell is very refreshing. It does not stay with you the entire time.</li>
    <li> This is the best of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. It smells great and does the job.</li>
    <li> Minimizing how often you wash your hair is beneficial to your scalp and hair.  To avoid looking like a greasy slob, this product absorbs all of your excess oils.  It is simple to use and works quickly.  It&#x27;s a lifesaver for second day hair!</li>
    <li> This product works really well to get the grease out of your hair. The only problem is that it can sometimes leave a whit powder in your hair that is almost impossible to get rid of. It also leaves your hair super crunchy if you don&#x27;t brush it in time because it dries very quickly. The benefits outweigh the faults though because as long as you spray it at a distance and immediately brush it it will get the grease out and make your hair look fantastic.</li>
    <li> the smell... it&#x27;s gross. I know this is a personal preference so some people might like it, but it&#x27;s definitely not for me. Honestly, it smells like dollar store perfume. I also found it a bit chalky in my hair (which is dark blonde). Give the Dove dry shampoo a try instead, I find it does a much better job and smells much nicer :)</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this dry shampoo. I much prefer Dove&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you spray this on your hair, you have to spray and spray until the white powder comes out. It is not effective with out it. However, the white powder itself is difficult to comb through your hair.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair so knotty and full of static. It is definitely not worth the try, save your money.</li>
    <li> Delivers results, smells good, and it&#x27;s cheap! I have dark hair and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair too dry</li>
    <li> Came on time but the cap came in pieces</li>
    <li> It came with out a lid. The problem with that is that the lid is what protected it, with out the protection the spray button broke off and all the product inside spilled out all of the packaging and the box. It was a total waste of money and the only refund I got was 7$ out of 18$. THANKS OBAMA.</li>
    <li> I adore every &amp;#34;Not your mothers&amp;#34; products! They all are affordable, yet great quality! This dry shampoo is so much better than the department store one I was using! Must Have!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, great product</li>
    <li> My roots get oily and I hate to wash my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. Pssssst only provided a minor touch-up and was extremely stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with this dry shampoo. It&#x27;s a reasonable price and it dried up the oil on my roots as well as regular shampoo. It sprays on white, and then you just brush it through your hair. No lasting, stinky smell. I will definitely keep this on hand because it allows me to skip a wash.</li>
    <li> Great product! I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo in a long time, and it seems to work great!</li>
    <li> Only in the past 6 months have I started using dry shampoo. I looked on Amazon for product reviews, and initially went with [[ASIN:B005EQIESU Batiste Dry Shampoo, Original 6.73 fl oz (120 g)]]. I couldn&#x27;t believe how long I had gone without using these types of products! My hair felt clean, even on hot summer days, and I didn&#x27;t feel any product build up or have to deal with harsh smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Batiste was unavailable on Prime, I went to check out the local CVS and Walgreens for another bottle. To my surprise, neither of them carried the brand! I figured, hey the different brands can&#x27;t be that different, especially if they&#x27;re similar in price. So I picked up a bottle of Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot express how much I dislike this product. To start, the can seems to either spray a LOT at a time, or nothing (it&#x27;ll just hiss). I&#x27;ll keep spraying in an attempt to get it out (after a good shake) and it&#x27;ll go from spraying almost nothing to a whole lot in just a couple seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon spraying it on my roots, they felt cool and clean. It was a really nice feeling. But after a week of using the product, my head was getting really itchy (ugh, it&#x27;s getting itchy just thinking about it!). I started to notice these weird flaky patches on my scalp wherever I used the product. Only when I would stop using it would they go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since gone back to Batiste and have not looked back. That brand seems to be a better quality in my opinion. No more itchy scalp, no more Clean Freak!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Will use fora bit longer. Can&#x27;t tell if I like this better than or even as much as Batiste. Will update after more regular use</li>
    <li> This stuff was awful. It did dry out my greasy unwashed hair - in a &amp;#34;covered with baby powder&amp;#34; kind of way, but I had to use a ton of it, and the smell was HORRIBLE....so strong that my husband could still smell it in our bathroom 10 minutes later, and I had to hold my breath while I used it. The worst part though, was it felt like my scalp was burning! Had to almost immediately go take a shower and shampoo my hair afterwards. The ingredients are ridiculous, so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning this product to the store.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. I can use it after a light workout and my hair won&#x27;t look greasy at all. However, I just recently brought it on a camping trip and it didn&#x27;t do much after the first day of not showering, other than maybe making it smell a bit better for a few hours. Overall, it&#x27;s good for day to day use, though.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff better than Rockstar&#x27;s Dirty Secret dry shampoo but still not as much as Lush&#x27;s dry shampoo. It&#x27;s good in a fix and a decent price however it&#x27;s really only good for one day in between washing as it doesn&#x27;t work to get the greasy look out of your hair as well as others. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, but not as much as a waste of money as Dirty Secret was.</li>
    <li> Absolutely THE BEST!!!! Sups excited to find an affordable dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I just sprayed my roots gray/white. It leaves my hair light and manageable! I so love being able to let my hair go 4-5 days between Washings. So much healthier. I just spray it at the oily roots at kinda massage it around, brush out my hair and boom, done! Brand new! WoW!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the one hair product I could not live without! I have fine, slightly wavy, slightly oily hair. With this product I can go a day or two without washing &amp; I would have never thought that would be possible. With this product, my hair looks better on the days I haven&#x27;t washed it. I just spray my roots first to absorb any oils, then tousle or brush to distribute towards the ends. There is absolutely no cakey white buildup as with most other dry shampoos. It leaves my hair bouncy &amp; full of volume. It really helps with flat, limp hair so I use it any time my hair just needs a boost. I love the light, fresh scent because it&#x27;s not overpowering. I normally purchase this from Walgreen&#x27;s for around $6, but I would gladly pay more for this miracle product! It is a generous size &amp; lasts for quite some time. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for the BEST dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is as good as any other I have tried.  Initially I didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t seem to work as instantly as the last brand I tried, but I quickly learned to like it.  If I spray it on by the time I get to work my hair seems perfectly normal.  (It probably doesn&#x27;t take that long, it just takes that long for me to be able to see it again).  Days I feel that I&#x27;m going to need it, like if I&#x27;m trying to stretch another day without washing, I&#x27;ll put it on the night before.  I also felt that it left less residue on my hair than the last brand.  But all things considered they both did the job.  I would buy this again.  I have light brown hair so the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; effect doesn&#x27;t affect me as much.</li>
    <li> I honestly wonder if the negative reviewers fail to really understand what dry shampoo IS and how to use it. If you read them, many point out that they are new to using dry shampoo. Yes, it smells like baby powder or talcum powder. That&#x27;s what it is. Yes there are alcohols and some scary sounding ingredients. Those would be the propellants than make the can SPRAY. I don&#x27;t use dry shampoo all the time. I have dry hair that isn&#x27;t prone to being oily or greasy. However, I live in a very high humidity area. This stuff helps to prolong a blow out. It takes care of moisture and additional oils from perspiration, which ruins a blow out faster than anything.</li>
    <li> I have to say that these &amp;#34;Not Your Mother&#x27;s&amp;#34; products were a big disappointment for me. Non of them worked as promised. This product has nothing to do with a dry shampoo. It does nothing to make hair looks fresh. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The product itself works quite well. My only hesitation in using it as often as I would like is the smell. It smells like straight-up chemical hair product and the smell definitely sticks around for a while.</li>
    <li> This is all a matter of opinion, remember! Everyone smells differently and has different preferences. I personally think this product has a very chemical smell that wants to be herbal like Aveda but instead smells like adhesive mixed with pine sol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it much because of the smell. When I do, it does the job alright. But it may be a bit more powdery than other products out there, so the matte on your hair may be too dulling and you may see that your color is a bit lightened. I&#x27;ll probably try pairing it with my shine sprays (since they smell like coconut) and my shine-boosting hairspray.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try another dry shampoo after using a Garnier one that just never really did it for me, but this product came recommended by a stylist friend (who reps Bumble &amp; Bumble, so that must tell you something) so I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did! This stuff revives my fine, limp hair and gives it a little volume boost, soaks up oil, and adds texture with ease. I use it pretty generously (I concentrate it at my roots but then give a light spray to the rest of my hair if I&#x27;m styling it) and it&#x27;s lasted me a really long time. The white powdery look fades quickly with a few comb-throughs and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like I poured baby powder over my head. The smell is a little chemical-y for my taste but it&#x27;s not bad and it doesn&#x27;t linger on my hair so I can deal. This stuff is great for styling a topknot, a sock bun, or just for making my hair look WAY thicker than it is! I love this product and will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  It is not better than any other dry shampoo.  It just has a catchy name.  It is also $5.99 on drugstore.com.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used a different brand of dry shampoo (more popular and varied in its available scents), and the other was a lot more effective.  You have to use a lot more of this to get it to work as well.  The scent is OK, but a little strong.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a CVS on a trip  because I couldn&#x27;t bring my large can of Batiste on the plane. It&#x27;s nice that this worked for some people, but I thought it absolutely sucked. I have thicker, Asian hair and I spritzed some of this on 2 day old hair, and it really just made everything feel greasier/dirtier. I feel like it&#x27;s just hairspray in a can. I would not recommend this to anyone. I have tried Herbal Essences Naked dry shampoo and I thought it was way better than this.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as advertised and smells horrible.  But all in all, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER oily hair, like if I don&#x27;t shower for one day it looks like I put oil in my hair. But I don&#x27;t want to shower everyday (California is in a drought) and I read that this good so I got it, but it did nothing. I did what it said to do but my hair still looked super oily, I then sprayed a lot in and it did nothing but add a little white to my oily hair. I have light brown, thickish straight hair.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair everyday it gets oily. This product works really well...but I don&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I dare say, this is the stickiest, nastiest dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. I gave it to my mom, and she hated it too. It was put to the curb after two undesirable outcomes with two generations of unlike hair. Do yourself a favor. Skip it.</li>
    <li> My favorite dry shampoo - doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent (and what scent it does have disappears within a few hours) and doesn&#x27;t require all the weird steps other dry shampoos do. The trick is to put this on at night and brush it out in the morning - it absorbs all the oils your scalp makes during the night and leaves it fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> So great. The only dry shampoo I&#x27;ll use!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo out there, hands down.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom and she loves it.  So different from the old dry shampoos where there was a white deposit on the hair.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong fragrance.  It works but you have to deal with that fragrance all day.</li>
    <li> Love this dry shampoo. Does not have weird baby powder smell as others do, and really works well. Lasts a very long time even with frequent use!</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue which is very noticeable because I have dark hair.</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo compared to some others I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I have blonde fine hair &amp; this goes in well &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a visible residue.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic for greasy hair (and I have a lot of experience with dry shampoos). The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and it doesn&#x27;t linger long though it does take away that unclean hair smell. Most importantly though, it makes your hair both look AND feel clean! If you spray it a little too close to the roots it&#x27;ll make your hair look white but it&#x27;s super easy to brush out. This stuff is fantastic and if you can find it on sale at your local drugstore you should totally stock up. What I like the best is putting it in before bed and my tossing and turning distributes it perfectly and gets rid of any white- then you wake up with perfect hair!</li>
    <li> Works great :)&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t recommend is that it can make your hair appear lighter/whiter. With my blonde hair that&#x27;s not a problem, but someone with darker hair should keep that it mind.</li>
    <li> And, I have light strawberry blond hair. So, I was certain I wouldn&#x27;t run into the issues others had with the spray leaving white residue in my hair. I looked like I was coloring my hair to play someone old on Broadway or something. And it was stiff, and icky feeling and honestly, I had to go wash my hair..which...kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Every girl needs dry shampoo, its such a crucial product! This was my first time ever trying a dry shampoo, I was VERY apprehensive, it seemed too good to be true and since I have really oily hair (I used to wash my hair every single day) I didn&#x27;t believe a product could take away all the excess oils, but I was wrong. This product takes away the oil and acts as a root booster, giving my hair volume which is great. However, after trying other products, I realized there&#x27;s other dry shampoos with better scents (which is important for me) and some products that leave less gray residue because you don&#x27;t want anyone to know you have dry shampoo on! I&#x27;m still looking for  dry shampoo that I&#x27;ll love, maybe I need to try some high end products in order to find it.</li>
    <li> This product has great results for making your hair look like it was just washed.  But I found the smell to be unbearable and won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> I use this dry shampoo the night before a day where I know I won&#x27;t be washing my hair--I find that spraying it in at night helps it distribute through my hair and absorb any oil by morning. It works a little less well if I use it the morning of styling my hair, but still helps cut down on any oil or greasiness. It looks a little white on my dark hair after spraying, but is easily blended into my hair without any residue or chalkiness. The smell is a little strong, but it is definitely a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell--nothing too offensive or irritating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a dry shampoo that really works and since I love NYM&#x27;s other products I decided to try this one out. I&#x27;ve found that it seems to work at first - when I spray it on (from about a foot away, don&#x27;t do it too close or you&#x27;ll get white buildup) my hair is much less oily, and it has more volume - but it seems to end up getting greasy by the end of the day, and I feel like the product residue makes it worse. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it only works if I just roll out of bed and use it. If I wet and blow-dry my hair, then use this product instead of actual shampoo in the shower, it actually makes my hair much more greasy right away. It seems that it has a strange reaction to the heat, or something. Overall, it does the job when I have to get up early and get to class without looking like a mess, but it&#x27;s not perfect. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands,  all of them under $10. I tried this one after I went to the store and found they didn&#x27;t have my usual herbal essence color me happy dry shampoo.  The only reason I gave this a 4 and not 5 is because it smells terrible.  Thankfully the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  Other than that,  this day shampoo absorbs the most oil out of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried,  it gives me hair volume,  doesn&#x27;t leave behind a lot of residue,  and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling as dry as and sticky as other brands.  If they change the scent I would happily buy it again!  Meanwhile I will be testing a few other brands.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a cheaper alternative to the Oribe products I prefer, at the suggestion of some random magazine. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, and I do not use it ever... It is greasy. After an hour or two my hair looks SO MUCH WORSE than if I had just left it unwashed :) I would not recommend at all. If you&#x27;re looking for a great alternative to a product like this, I would TOTALLY recommend the Oribe Dry Texturizing spray. It&#x27;s worth the $20-40 for it, and you will never go back to greasy, cheap products like this...</li>
    <li> Works okay, doesn&#x27;t have the white cast like other dry shampoos</li>
    <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used - I would definitely recommend spending more money for a better product. This spray &amp;#34;thickened&amp;#34; my hair to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even get a brush through it, and I have very fine hair -it turned it into an unstylable bumpy mess. It smells awful and did very little to soak up oil. Would definitely not buy again.</li>
    <li> I urge consumers to read the bottle and decide if they stand behind the company on a moral level. Whoever within this company is allowing such sexist, derogatory copy to be printed, should be fired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go use another dry shampoo. Who knows... Maybe the Bastiste bottle will promise me ease with my education, career, friendship and happiness. That might be more helpful in the 21st century!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue other dry shampoos do, and feels lighter .</li>
    <li> I have used a couple other dry shampoo products that I liked, but this one is the best so far. It smells great, and my hair feels cleaner after I use it.</li>
    <li> I love not your mothers dry shampoo! I bought mine in store. It really works! Smells light, fresh, and not over powering. I spray on my hair front, sides and back . Plus my roots, I brush it out and it looks like cleaned hair! It&#x27;s not white, chalky looking, doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes, and I would buy more of it too. I recommend it. It&#x27;s simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Honestly, dry shampoo is basically a miracle product and Not Your Mother&#x27;s dry shampoo is fantastic!  Actually, all of their products are fantastic.  I also use their clean freak shampoo, their kinky moves styling gel, and their something something something hair spray, all of which do a fabulous job of making me look amazing even when I&#x27;m too lazy to put anything that even resembles &#x27;effort&#x27; into how I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve used this dry shampoo for up to a solid five days without my hair getting greasy and oily and frizzy, which is great because my hair is super frizzy and curly so I like to get it wet as little as possible.  Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Works as promised and as you would want it to. No buildup, just a nice clean feel and smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely awful.  It leaves your hair feeling like HAY, not that clean feeling like others.  This is a bad brand with too many chemicals, try something else!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to feel about this product but I actually really like it! It smells nice, goes on easy, and leaves your hair looking fresh and clean. I have very fine hair and it works well!</li>
    <li> I have dark, thin, and greasy hair. I&#x27;m also new to using dry shampoo, so I have been trying all different brands. So far, this is the best I have come across and I have tried Tresemme and Pssst. Out of the three, this is the one that works the best. I can visibly see the difference AS I&#x27;m working it into my hair. It adds volume in addition to making it look less dirty which is great because thin, greasy hair also means flat hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints about this product, however, are that it leaves my hair looking dull and adds a rough texture. I have very shiny, smooth hair and while this makes my hair look CLEANER, it completely changes the way it looks and feels. The smell is just fine - I have no problem with the scent, just the lack-luster roughness.</li>
    <li> I have medium/dark brown hair and I use this about once a week. I love that the smell is not offensive and that it soaks up the oil in my hair nicely. I have hair that cannot go more than a day without washing, so when I discovered this I was very excited to be able to save time in the mornings! When I do use it, I spray enough so there is a slight white color that is left behind, give my hair a once over with a brush, and by the time I&#x27;ve finished breakfast, it has done its thing and there is no residue. If you do use a lot, you will have to brush through it more and maybe shake your hair out to get rid of the residue, since it is white and not tinted to your hair color.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bothers me, is that the can runs out fairly quickly, which is probably standard for this type of product. With the travel size ones, I probably get 3-5 uses out of it. I haven&#x27;t gotten through the large one yet, but I just started using it.</li>
    <li> Not only does this get rid of oil, it makes your hair fuller with lots of volume.  I can wash my hair every 4 days now, and it looks better on the days I use this than the days when I wash it.</li>
    <li> I think the Suave dry shampoo worked better than this one. Not to mention the smell is horrid. Never repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER OILY HAIR!  The kind you have to wash twice a day. I have tried countless other dry shampoos with disappointing results. This brand has two other great products that I use (the volumizing hair powder and the sea salt spray) so I thought I would give dry shampoo one more try (I have a toddler and don&#x27;t always have time to shampoo twice a day). This products works like no other! Instant oil absorption! I do have to use quit a lot of it because of my extreme oil production, but it does everything it promises. It does leave a LITE matte finish, but it says it does on the front of the bottle. I have no complaints, and I WILL continue to use it FOREVER! Now, if I could only buy it in bulk......</li>
    <li> This is the first dry shampoo I have ever purchased and performed as I expected. As always, some of the bad reviews worried me before use, but the product &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34; the excess oils from my hair and made it look pretty clean again. However, I have very thick hair that is oily to begin with so that may effect he performance of this product. I use this on hair day 3 or 4 and spray it a fair distance away from my roots and then immediately brush it out. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as good as if it had just been washed, bit it is well worth the 2 and a half hours I save not washing it. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> It works, but the product is like white spray powder so if you have brown hair it makes your hair look mousey/grayish.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t feel like it does a great job with my hair either...I have bangs that get greasy after one day and I typically wash my hair every other day. This doesn&#x27;t leave as much of an obvious residue as another kind I have tried, but I have to use a lot of it to feel like it&#x27;s doing anything, so it does end up leaving some white. And it could be because of my area&#x27;s weather at the moment, but my hair gets static-y after I use this and try to brush it through. Other reviews have said it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell, but I disagree. I have to hold my breath and go out of the bathroom to breathe so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to choke. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff literally leaves your hair squeaky clean. It literally squeaks. It is very annoying and unpleasant to feel when you run your hands through your hair. It almost feels waxy because your hand kind of skids on it. It also smells really strongly and it isn&#x27;t a particularly pleasant smell either.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo works better than the Fructis Volume Extend that I&#x27;ve been using for a few months.  Clean Freak is definitely easier to brush through and leaves less residue.  The white powder soaks in faster too.  It gives me an extra day to wear my hair down before I have to wash it.  My hair is color treated so I try to wash it as little as possible and I&#x27;m grateful every time I can go a little longer between shampoos. I spray Clean Freak on the roots in 1 inch partings, trying to cover as much of my scalp (from my ears up) as I can.  I don&#x27;t spray it directly on my part, however.  After spraying it on, I put my makeup on and after about 15 minutes, I brush it through.  The thing I like about it that it doesn&#x27;t dim the shine on the rest of my hair.  It simply soaks up the oil on the roots.  Be sure and shake the can up vigorously before spraying it on so you will get the benefit of the oil-absorbing powder and not just spray the propellant.  It smells fresh and clean and after I brush it through, I&#x27;ll run the curling iron over my strands and, importantly, the dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t affect my hair&#x27;s ability to curl.  It&#x27;s also great for adding texture when you do an updo.  I purchased it at Walgreens for $5 and I figured I had nothing to lose.  Plus, there&#x27;s much more product in the container of Clean Freak than there is in Fructis Volume Extend.  I definitely like Clean Freak better all around and will make it my regular dry shampoo.  Now I just have to think of something to do with the two cans of Volume Extend that are sitting in my hall closet, lol!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I liked it but I still like Dove Dry Shampoo better. Plus Dove is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few drugstore dry shampoos that were terrible, so I was little skeptical about this one. This dry shampoo works wonderfully! I have very short hair and an oily scalp, so I have to wash my hair everyday although sometimes it starts getting oily towards the end of the day. I use this if I&#x27;m going out at night and need to refresh my hair. It&#x27;s awesome. My favorite thing about it is that it&#x27;s instant. I will say it makes me hair a little stiff, kinda like hairspray but without the sticky-ness. I have a feeling that&#x27;s just because my hair is so short and doesn&#x27;t have the weight that long hair does... if that makes sense. Anyway, great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using this every other day for two months and the can is still practically full. It smells great and is one of the better dry shampoos I have used.</li>
    <li> It smells great but it really doesn&#x27;t leave you&#x27;re hair looking good. Soaks up the shine but really doesn&#x27;t leave your hair in a way you want to leave it.... Easier just to wash it. There other products are great but this isn&#x27;t a winner.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it. But it didn&#x27;t work for me. Yes it helps dry out the oil but for me (someone with very oily hair) it made it dry in a way that made it feel gross and tangly. Personally not for me and the smell was a little funky. I have love batiste in the past and will go back to it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of dry shampoo and they all somewhat work.  NYM Dry Shampoo seems to leave the LEAST amount of whitish residue.  The scent is lightly lemony when it is sprayed on, but the smell quickly dissipates and I&#x27;m left with odor free, clean hair. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Grabbed randomly at Walgreens because they didn&#x27;t have my usual brand. The product doesn&#x27;t work well enough to make the smell worth it. Seriously, it smells like lemon-lime moonshine. Just awful. I threw it away after one use. Wasn&#x27;t going to even pretend like I would use it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved to dye my hair bright and unnatural colors. One of my biggest woes with the upkeep of this is the shower washing out the dye and making my hair look gross and uneven. For that, this stuff is a lifesaver. I picked it up at a local CVS after my most recent dye job so I could shower daily without washing my hair the first couple of days after I dyed my hair to help the color &amp;#34;lock in.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s perfect. My hair color is still nice and vivid and my hair isn&#x27;t greasy or unwashed looking.  I also haven&#x27;t experienced the problem of it making my hair look &amp;#34;greyed out.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some facts to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;-My hair is pretty short, just barely shoulder length, and not too thin or thick. Some people have said you need to use a lot to get it to work, I use maybe 3-4 quick/small sprays around the head and comb it and it seems to cover everything from root to ends. This probably has a lot to do with the type of hair I have.&lt;br /&gt;-My hair naturally is pretty greasy and I typically would be wet shampooing it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone! I just want to put out there that it&#x27;s working great on my heavily dyed hair B^)</li>
    <li> I usually hate giving one star reviews, but this product is just so bad! I put this in one day after I washed my hair and the first thing I noticed was the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the usual \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell most dry shampoos have. I can&#x27;t quite explain the smell, but I did not enjoy it at all. The last thing I noticed was how terrible my hair looked. It did not remove any oil, but instead made my hair clump together making it look even oilier! I literally had to wash my hair right after I put this stuff in because it made my hair looks so gross! Try Batiste, it is my favorite dry shampoo brand.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product and came really quickly before its ship date.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST dry shampoo I have ever tried. Quite simply...do not bother. You know what works better than this stuff? Plain old baby powder! My favorite dry shampoo is the BATISTE brand which works quite well for the price. But honestly if you are broke just buy some baby powder..(just be sure to hold your breath while you apply it, as talc isn&#x27;t good for the lungs if you inhale a lot of it).</li>
    <li> Before I got this, I had no idea what dry shampoo was. I usually skip days while washing my hair and it gets greasy, but now I have found a solution! This was more simple to use than I thought, at first when I shook the bottle it felt like liquid although I read it was sort of a power that absorbs. I sprayed it in my hair and I couldn&#x27;t see the powder and it didn&#x27;t feel wet! I was amazed, my hair smelled lemony for a couple of minutes then it became fresh and odorless. Definitely will get more and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Cheap but completely does the job it is suppose to do. Will be purchasing more soon. Z</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.  It soaks up the oil, but leaves a bit of a crunchy residue on my hair. I use it in a pinch when I am too lazy to wash my hair but don&#x27;t want to go to work with oily hair.</li>
    <li> I have an oily scalp, and if I run my fingers through my hair too much it looks bad, and you can see my scalp. I also play in a rock and roll band, and when I get off the stage, my scalp is sweaty. Well, this product refreshes my hair, and makes it look fantastic! Follow the directions, and brush it through your hair. Like magic! Much better and less messy than using baby powder. Nice scent!</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this product. It&#x27;s much better than the horrible Treseme dry shampoo, but not as good as Big Sexy Hair dry shampoo, which adds great volume to the hair!  This product does not add the volume and it gives hair a bit of a heavy feeling. It does work, there is no white residue, and the bonus I have found is that it seems to last through to the next day! Also, my husband hates (!) the smell of most dry shampoos, but with this one, he sniffed my head once and just as I expected him to berate me for using chemicals on my head again, he surprised me by commenting on how nicely my head smelled! I recommend it for the price and the convenient availability in the drug stores.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo! Not only does it absorb the oil and give my hair a fresh look for days, but it also gives it volume and a great texture.  The smell is subtle, which is also nice (some dry shampoos can be overwhelming).</li>
    <li> Buying a dry shampoo can be a daunting task since it requires your going out and buying (and buying and buying and buying…) many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one. I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: My hair is dark, thick, extremely long, and wavy with oily roots and dry ends. So please keep in mind the results may not be the same for you if your hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like nondescript citrus, unisex fragrance, similar to generic hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Cherry: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like red fruits but somewhat synthetic. I wouldn’t call this a juicy fruity smell that you sometimes get from good shampoos. The fragrance is on the feminine side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Volume Extend dry shampoo: Leaves white residue but goes away as you massage you scalp clean. It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair. Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus. Lovely &amp; refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences Color Me Happy dry shampoo: Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair. The unfortunate consequence of this “dumping” however, thickens and volumizes the hair to a point where it hurts to comb fingers through. Hair becomes hard and tough to style. Some folks with fine/limp hair may actually appreciate this. Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo. The fragrance is that of sweet roses. It is on the perfume-y and feminine side. Very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind. Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through. Truly a “just washed and done” effect. Smells like nondescript powdery citrus. Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo: Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind. Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair. Smells like bright, sweet citrus. The price point and availability at every corner makes this an attractive choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Matte dry shampoo: Cleans with low-to-mediocre effectiveness. Leaves behind quite a bit of white powdery streaks that can be eliminated by thorough brushing. Though, if you have wavy hair like me, you may not appreciate having to brush your dry, powdery roots. I always end up looking like part-broccoli / part-hedgehog after that is done. The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction. It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned. :) The inexplicably high price makes it this a bad purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SheaMoisture Peace Rose Oil dry shampoo: Cleans with effectively. Doesn’t leave a residue behind, even on my pitch black hair. Because it is a powder you squeeze out of a bottle (non-aerosol), it didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;choking feeling&amp;#34; I get from spraying dry shampoo all over my head. The smell was a true rose oil scent. It is on the feminine side, so those who prefer a neutral or masculine fragrance might not like it. It is long lasting but stays close so that you don’t “advertise” your hair fragrance throughout the day, so to speak. Lasted a long time as well. Has a volumizing effect too, in case that&#x27;s also important to you. It looks small but it lasted longer than its spray counterparts. One drawback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too. Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head. I suppose thick hair is doomed to be rigid if you dump powder all over it. All in all, I’d rather deal with this problem than the rest. Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc. It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far. (I might just keep buying this until the inevitable discontinuation happens. Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc. ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly? Does that happen to you too? :-] )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this comparison helped you. Look out for updates as I continue to search for a great dry shampoo that doesn’t leave residue, cleans effectively, doesn’t make the hair rigid, smells awesome and, most important, one that is affordable.awback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too. Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head. I suppose thick hair is doomed to be rigid if you dump powder all over it. All in all, I’d rather deal with this problem than the rest. Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc. It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far. (I might just keep buying this until the inevitable discontinuation happens. Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc. ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly? Does that happen to you too? :-] )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this comparison helped you. Look out for updates as I continue to search for a great dry shampoo that doesn’t leave residue, cleans effectively, doesn’t make the hair rigid, smells awesome and, most important, one that is affordable.</li>
    <li> Not Good. Made my hair dry and dull looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other brands of dry shampoo that did not work as well as this brand. I find it has a more pleasant smell, and (as long as you don&#x27;t spray too too much) it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that white residue (I&#x27;m a blonde). I keep coming back to this brand.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair feeling dry and even when it&#x27;s rubbed in there still remains a white powdery residue, which looks gross on dark hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best dry shampoos I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of inexpensive ones!)</li>
    <li> Ok, not what I was expecting.  I could use hair spray for for the same affect or old fashion baby powder.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo makes my hair look clean instantly, smells fresh and crisp (no heavy perfumes or chemicals), and lasts all day. I can now shampoo my hair in the evening without worrying about greasy looking hair the next morning-- just a simple spray of this dry shampoo and I&#x27;m good to go all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does leave a white residue on scalp, but it&#x27;s easily removed with a rub of a towel. Great product! This is my new go-to dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> Bought this product at my local CVS because I&#x27;ve been washing my hair every day and it&#x27;s really drying out my hair. I have long wavy hair and I didn&#x27;t have to use much spray. My hair feels lighter and looks like as if I had just blow dried my hair out of the shower. Price was $5.99 for a rather large can.</li>
    <li> This is the first dry shampoo product that I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  It&#x27;s not often that I will go without washing my hair every day...but sometimes, I do my hair so well, that I hate to wash it out the next day. So, I decided to try this based on the other reviews.  I really like it.  It actually gives my hair a bit more body, which is a bonus.  I do find that I have to use it a couple of times during the day to keep my hair looking fresh, but it smells nice, so I don&#x27;t mind.  :o)</li>
    <li> I ran out of dry shampoo so I thought I would give this a try. Worst money spent. It smells like bug spray or some other atrocious smelling chemical spray and after 5 mins my hair feels more greasy then before I used it. I dry towel my hair and brush to make sure I get any white residue out, but I noticed with this product I get little white clumps in my hair. Another review mentioned a talcum powder feel to your hair and I completely agree. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought various Dry Shampoos, Oscar Blandi, Got2b and I must say this one for the price doesn&#x27;t leave my hair especially flakey, I use it before bed though as opposed to after, while getting ready in the morning, nothing worse than getting your pillowcase oily only to put your face in it later, so no white in the hair in the morning, if I use it at night, also, it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle that goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Its a prettygoo dry shampoo will buy again</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is disgusting and overpowering. I can&#x27;t even tell if it works or not because the smell is so strong. The few times I tried to use it I was self-concious about people smelling it and thinking I was wearing a cheap bad-smelling perfume or something so I had to wash my hair soon after I used it. I wonder if there was an unscented one I could try instead.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every dry shampoo imaginable. For the price, it really delivers. As a redhead, I cannot wash my hair on a regular basis. Being that my texture is fine, my hair can look super greasy within a day. Most other brands leave my hair with a white cast, heavy residue, ITCHY scalp the next day, cans continue to spray all the product out after 1 use, some of the chemicals of some cause my hair to become brittle and I would get breakage. I&#x27;m happy to say this 1 does none of the above to my hair! It leaves it like I have just shampooed. There is no real smell to it. The only tiny downside I&#x27;ve noticed that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me is that it won&#x27;t get the crazy volume that others may give.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this very much. First of all, it smells terrible! The cap was broken off too.  I was expecting something way better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several dry shampoos and prefer the spray/aerosols over powders, so I decided to give Not Your Mother&#x27;s a try. Overall, I was very disappointed by it. I have thick, fine, smooth hair so usually these products work wonders since my hair tends to lose volume and get oily quickly. Typically I can wash my hair every other day, using a dry shampoo on the off days. This dry shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to do anything positive for my hair and weighed it down quite a bit so it almost looked worse than before. At first it looked like it had absorbed oil but by the time I was done getting ready my hair looked stringy and flat and I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. Salon brands tend to work well, Dove and Got2b also make dry shampoos that are inexpensive, work well, and can be picked up at the drug store or stores like Target or Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No white residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smell&lt;br /&gt;Did not add volume&lt;br /&gt;Appeared to absorb oil at first, a few minutes later my hair looked worse than it was before I used the product</li>
    <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. The scent is a little strong right when you spray it but it fades quickly. I let it sit in my hair while I get ready and when I&#x27;m ready to do my hair I massage it then brush my hair without any powder or residue left. If I do spray a bunch my hair will feel a little funky but will be oil free!</li>
    <li> This product will take the oiliness from your hair, but don&#x27;t overdo it.  The first time I used it, I sprayed it throughout my hair, as the directions said.  It was just too much and my hair felt awful.  Hit the roots a few times and brush through well.  That does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo does what it&#x27;s supposed to do... it absorbs oil, and absorbs it well.  However, it leaves my hair feeling coarse and tangled.  It&#x27;s not the worst, but definitely not the best.</li>
    <li> This made my hair look and feel heavy, not clean.  I know some people like the smell, but I did not, it just stinks to me. I tried Dove today and like it better, my hair is lighter, more flowing like when it is clean and smell better.</li>
    <li> This has a very clean scent and will leave your hair oil free.  Spray this directly into the roots and brush thru.  No white residue!  I love this product and it provides a little added volume to my hair between washes.</li>
    <li> As far as dry shampoos go, this not only absorbs oils and adds volume, but it doesn&#x27;t feel gross afterward!! I&#x27;ve found with most other products that you can barely run your hands through your hair, and if you can, it feels so grimy that you immediately go wash your hands afterward. This product left my hair still manageable and touchable. The only downside is the smell. Mind you, i have a very sensitive nose [I&#x27;m the person that opens bottles to take a whiff before I buy something new].&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews and the scent was described as lemony. It is, which I thought would be refreshing, but really it smells more like Pledge-but instead of the slightly sweet overtone-you get a hint of bug spray instead. Really really disappointed by that since I love everything else about it. The semi-toxic smell does seem to fade after a few hours though-I just have to put my hair up until then so the smell doesn&#x27;t drive me nuts. Hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> it works ok, but the smell reminds me of Scrubbing Bubbles, which is a big turn off.</li>
    <li> a LIFESAVER in a jiffy, but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Loving this dry shampoo!! I have tried several other brands and this works the best. Suave Professionals was the absolute worst as it left a heavy white residue and had an extremely overpowering citrus like scent. I have noticed NONE of those things with this brand. I like that the scent is very subtle. This is especially important to me because I am a healthcare professional and have to avoid any strong smelling scents around my patients due to possible allergies/sensitivities. This product also did not leave my hair feeling stiff like some others I&#x27;ve experienced. For me, this is well worth the money. Use sparingly at first to avoid any white residue and be sure to comb/brush through within about 1 min for best results. I have very dark brown hair and have found this to be the best method for keeping it from looking dull after applying. It is only about $5 at Wal-Mart and I&#x27;m hoping it will become a prime eligible product soon.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product. It&#x27;s wonderful. Now I can wash my hair only every other day and it still looks great, not greasy. I&#x27;ll never be without this product ever again.</li>
    <li> This product works well at removing excess oils from my hair, but drys to fast and becomes crunchy and when sprayed to close causes white, powdery stains on my hair which lasts all day. Be sure to have a brush on hand when applying and spray from at least a foot back.</li>
    <li> I work retail, so occassionally, I am scheduled to work at 8:00 a.m. When that happens, I usually take my shower the night before.  My hair is normally pretty oily, so it looks greasy and limp if I don&#x27;t shampoo it every day. I bought this dry shampoo on a whim. It&#x27;s relatively cheap, and a fairly big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using it, I loved the results. It did a good job of controlling the oil and you couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d washed my hair the night before. I also liked that you got the desired effect using very little product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then in March, I was scheduled for 8:00 a.m. shifts 5 days in a row. I washed my hair the night before, and then used this dry shampoo before work in the morning. The following week, I noticed a major change in my hair. It became very dry, brittle, and started falling out. When I blow dry my hair, I run my fingers through it as I&#x27;m drying it, just to fluff it out a little more. When I would do this, I would find numerous strands between my fingers.  I also started noticing more hair falling out in the shower. Not enough to really freak me out,  but definitely more than normal. My hair started looking like straw, which has NEVER been a problem for me before. I realized it had to be from this dry shampoo. So I stopped using it and threw it in the trash. But the damage was already done to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several deep conditioners, but couldn&#x27;t find one that repaired the damage and made my hair healthy again.  But then I found Neutrogenia Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditoner. I had to use about a palmful of product and leave it on for 5 minutes (as opposed to the 1 minute it says on the tube) but the Neutrogenia Deep Conditioner has done a good job of repairing the damage. My hair is soft and looks more healthy than it has in months. It&#x27;s not 100% restored, but it is very close. I suspect that it will only be a few more days before my hair is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note: A couple days ago, I was on the Ulta website and saw this product there. There is a link where you can view the ingredients. When I saw the ingredients for this dry shampoo, I was absolutely floored. The first 3 ingredients are isobutane, propane, and alcohol. No wonder it fried my hair! Needless to say, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, and will definintely NOT repurchase. If you are looking for a GOOD dry shampoo, I suggest the one by Suave Professionals. It comes in a silver bottle with a yellow cap. It&#x27;s affordable, it works great, and it&#x27;s gentle. It won&#x27;t wreck your hair the way this one does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dry shampoo based on reviews and the low price but it is not what I would consider a good dry shampoo. I have auburn-colored hair and this sprays out really white which does not completely go away when you brush it out as instructed. It also leaves a residue on your hands every time you touch your hair. And last but not least, the smell of baby powder is overwhelming. I would prefer a dry shampoo with little to no color left on my hair and either scentless or something more current and pleasant than baby powder, since I&#x27;m not a baby.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s used to be my favorite, but I ran out too fast.  Tresemme didn&#x27;t do anything for me, this one is perfect!  The only complaint I have is the smell- it&#x27;s kind of like bug spray when you&#x27;re putting it on.  I don&#x27;t notice it when I&#x27;m out and about though and it works wonders.  Seems to last longer/ use less than other brands.</li>
    <li> Ingredient # 1 &#x3D; Isobutane. Ingredient # 2 &#x3D; Propane and Ingredient # 3 &#x3D; SD Alcohol.  Do you want these dangerous ingredients in your hair and lungs? After reading the ingredients, I didn&#x27;t even want to try it. They have a &#x27;flammable warning&amp;#34; on the can. Amazon.com should let people know about the dangerous nature of this product.</li>
    <li> Ok I have tried this stuff more than once so I feel like I can review it completely now. I don&#x27;tike this at all! I have long dark hair(almost black) it does leave white in my hair. Even when completed rubbed in and brushed out I can still see it in my hair. Also leaves a heavy grayish color in my hair. This does not go away! It leaves my hair very very stiff!!!! It&#x27;s awful! So stiff!  I would never recommend this! This is nothing like batise. Batise is my favorite dry shampoo! Nothing beats it! It leaves no white residue or gray on my hair at all!! Save your money and go buy batise.</li>
    <li> The product did not work and in fact, using it was worse than using nothing. The worst attempt at dry shampoo I have ever tried. It left my hair just as oily, but also think and gritty and sticky. Horrid. Thinking I had purchased this product from Amazon I contacted the seller after one use and advised them I was unhappy with the product and would like to return it. They responded to both my emails with a very flip, discourteous &amp;#34;sorry we don&#x27;t issue refunds.&amp;#34; DO NOT PURCHASE from SUNDANCE BEAUTY</li>
    <li> I tried Batiste, Oscar Blandi, Suave, and this. It is by far the worst one for me. While I love using my Batiste even on washed hair because it gives my hair an amazing volume without weighting it down and keeps it looking great all day. I only need few sprays of Batiste on dirty hair to get the job done. The bottle of Not Your Mothers shampoo is huge but I have to pray so much in order to see a little difference. I feel that it only leaves residue on hair and doesn&#x27;t make them look much cleaner. My hair is super flat when I&#x27;m using it. I&#x27;m trying to finish the bottle and only use it the days when I&#x27;m staying home. Even Suave in my opinion works better.</li>
    <li> I never write bad reviews like this but my reaction to this was so dramatic I wanted to share just in case someone else could benefit.  I purchased this at a local store because people kept telling me to try a dry shampoo. The reason is because I&#x27;m blonde and I lift weights and do hot yoga alternating every day. Now anyone who is blonde can tell you it&#x27;s not good to wash our hair everyday. Mine is pretty thin anyway. So I was looking for something to use after my weight lifting days so that I could use between the shampooing after hot yoga. Well what I didn&#x27;t think about was the sweat in my headband (which I wear every yoga class for the last year) would have dry shampoo sweat sticking to my forehead.  I had the WORST break out all over my forehead, behind my ears and at the bottom of my hairline at my neck...everywhere the headband held it in.  I can&#x27;t even say it was a breakout, they were raised pustule looking things.  I used this product once and this was such a reaction I took it straight back to the store.  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and just now am I able to look like I haven&#x27;t been cheese grated on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I can say the product did work, it did make my hair not look greasy, just don&#x27;t sweat with something keeping skin contact with it.</li>
    <li> Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo is very helpful to new parents everywhere. This product is possibly a overlooked gem. It should be included in all new parent /or &amp;#34;get well soon&amp;#34; gift baskets. I love clean freak shampoo and conditioner also. The Dry shampoo feels light and silky. I like being able to spray and style right away. It smells fresh and clean. I recommend Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing Dry Shampoo. Its nice to have in the cupboard for one of those mornings you just don&#x27;t have time to shower.</li>
    <li> I only recently got involvement the world of dry shampoos, but after a few months of trial and error with various brands, I am a true convert. What did I do before this stuff?! i have tried some of the most popular brands, and I have to say, this one is my absolute favorite!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of dry shampoo is prolong your blowdry by absorbing excess oils and adding volume. Just spray this, add a little extra product if necessary, and touch up your style and it completely brings your hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little strong at first. But by the time you&#x27;re done restyling your hair, the smell has subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem with white residue/powder being left behind, but I do have blonde hair, so I imagine people with dark hair could very well have a very different experience. My experience, however, has been great. I go about 7-10 days now between standard shampooing and my hair never looks or feels oily or limp. It&#x27;s been a huge time saver in the mornings while trying to get myself ready for work and two kids ready for school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Highly recommended to anyone using or thinking about using dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> Ive been using the Got2B Rockin It dry shampoo, and after running out, decided to try something cheaper. I came across lots of good reviews for this product here and on Walmart.com so I decided to try it. So sorry that I did. This stuff made my hair look and feel even dirtier than it was before using it. It also left my hair with ZERO body and the smell is beyond terrible. Just say no to this product unless you like pissing money away.</li>
    <li> Good smell, great feel. Highly recommend to people with light-colored hair. Dark hair beware: it leaves a white-ish matte finish. Even after I run my fingers and water through it, it still makes my hair look really dull. Takes a long time to make it look like there isn&#x27;t white product in my hair. But it functions wonderfully, so I would definitely recommend it to blonde folks!</li>
    <li> As long as you know how to use dry shampoo this works great! Has a nice smell also</li>
    <li> Dry shampoo has never worked for me until I tried this. I have thin blonde hair and I used to wash my hair everyday because if I didn&#x27;t, it would honestly look wet from all of the grease. But with a few sprays of this beautiful stuff, it cleans it right up! It gives your hair plenty of volume (which I never have had before because of my thin hair) and it works with your hairs natural oils to make it shiny and thick. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I ordered this product because the price was right for the volume and I was trying a handful of dry shampoo products. It smells okay (a little old ladyish, but not too bad) and works okay (dries up most of the oil, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.) I do like that it doesn&#x27;t change the texture of my hair that much. A lot of the other products make my hair feel dry, brittle, and chalky. This one doesn&#x27;t. No residue, no funky texture, but mediocre effectiveness. Overall, a fair product for the price. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> product works as I expected</li>
    <li> Okay so im always in a rush for school in the morning and my hair is always greasy even if I wash it the day before.. so I bought this from my drugstore for only $5 and I just spray it in my roots before I leave and it looks like I just washed and styled my hair. Definitely going to stick to this!!!</li>
    <li> It works great I like it because I dye my hair and washing my hair everyday was washing the dye out faster so instead I would use the dry shampoo and it work wonderfully! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo. If you use it correctly it doesn&#x27;t show the white residue in your hair. I have used many and this is by far the best I have found!</li>
    <li> Although it is not humid where I live, it does get hot...very hot. When you go for a hike or do anything strenuous outside, or even in the summers, when the humidity rises and you just sweat when thinking about going for a hike, this item is a big help. That is because your hair starts getting greasy because your scalp starts sweating...yucky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This item is the solution, if you don&#x27;t want to feel greasy...or, you could wash you hair twice a day. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Your Mothers Clean Dry Shampoo really does a great job absorbing oil, and it&#x27;s scent is decent and not overwhelming. Once I use a little of it, my hair feels and looks fresh. It is sort of a power that you spray on and blend in, by brushing your hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how well it works and I can recommend.</li>
    <li> Where was this when I needed it.... My sister had some while visiting and she didn&#x27;t have time&lt;br /&gt;to shampoo before leaving (we are in drought) so used it and perked up hair style.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed enough to go and buy some for me... works great</li>
    <li> This is one of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a huge can and I love that the nozzle never clogs. That being said, you can get this cheaper in your local supermarket.</li>
    <li> so inexpensive for a very effective dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried other types. I have thick, curly and it works pretty well. Might not be right for all hair types. Smells is yummy!</li>
    <li> Works well...for about two full uses, then it just sprays out air. First time I used it, I got great results. Fluffy, clean looking hair. It just didn&#x27;t last very long. Also be careful to spray from far away or the white will leave a film. And little tip, turns out this is five dollars at Target. Peace.</li>
    <li> Best smelling dry shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t make my black hair white.</li>
    <li> You have to spray way too much for it to work... Smells like bug spray too. I&#x27;m going back to batiste, which is the only brand I found that works.</li>
    <li> Can I tell you that I just love this product???  Well, I do...and I just left a mediocre review for the Tresemme product that I&#x27;m currently using...and I&#x27;ll go right back to NYM as soon as I&#x27;m done or maybe even before I am with that product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to preface, I&#x27;m one of those that does not wash my hair every day.  I prefer to go 2-3 days and just do a &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; each morning with dry shampoo.  I have dark straight fine and slightly oily hair.  This product gives a great boost of freshness, light scent, and a little fluff to my hair that just gets flatter as the days wear on.  Just make sure to use it as instructed, and you&#x27;ll just love this product as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I really like this dry shampoo!  I color my hair a very dark brown, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it making my hair look gray.  I think folks who have that problem are either using too much or leaving it in too long.  I only have to leave it in for about 2 minutes or so, and then I work it into my scalp and roots with my fingertips.  It gives my roots a little lift and takes care of the &amp;#34;I-haven&#x27;t-washed-my-hair-stinkies.&amp;#34;  Now, it will leave a slight matte finish on your hair, but not enough to really notice.  I like the scent.  It&#x27;s clean, but not strong--much better than smelling like a baby&#x27;s bottom from baby powder!  I use this about two or three times a week in between washes, and I have not noticed any problems with a build up or residue.</li>
    <li> I have used every brand of dry shampoo and this is the best. I have fine hair and an oily scalp, and when I use this I can go 4 days between washes. I have dark hair and this doesn&#x27;t leave nearly as much of a powdery finish as other dry shampoos. It&#x27;s the best for the price and the quality.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything, regret buying.</li>
    <li> Super awesome! Doesn&#x27;t leave TOO much residue (there is a little), and it takes that grease away just like it says it will!</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product has impressed me enough that I wanted to advise everyone to try it. I was very weary to try it out because it was only $4.45 at target. As the old saying goes you typically get what you pay for. But not in this case. I am very pleased with this dry shampoo and the fact that i didn&#x27;t have  to saturate the hair to get it to work!</li>
    <li> I have a ton of very fine, straight hair that gets greasy very quickly, sometimes within 12 hours.  It&#x27;s the curse of having fine hair.  Anyway, this stuff is great.  The only other dry shampoos I have tried are the Suave and Tresseme, and they are both failures.  They just make my dark brown hair look dusty because the white powder sticks to it, but it still looks greasy because they don&#x27;t absorb the oil.  This, on the other hand, absorbs the oil and doesn&#x27;t stick to my hair, so it just looks like it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. My hair absorbs odors very easily. This dry shampoo eliminates that, and does a great job on controlling oils as well. It has a very mild, lemony scent that dissipates soon after spraying and doesn&#x27;t leave any residual odors. Like any dry shampoo, it can leave a white area if sprayed on too thick, but this can easily be combed or fluffed out. My fave of the ones I have tried!</li>
    <li> Seriously changed my life, I no longer have to wash my hair every day.  My hair gets oily super fast and this stuff saves the day every time!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but for this, I must. I&#x27;ve tried everything for my fine, oily hair but have always just given up and resorted to daily washing and styling. Not anymore! This stuff really works. Just make sure to constantly be shaking the can so you don&#x27;t spray ten pounds of liquid on your hair before powder finally comes out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going through a few different dry shampoo products over the past couple of years. This is my least favorite - even below Suave&#x27;s version. I&#x27;m not giving it one star because it *does* work... just not very well. My frustrations with it are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have to spray a TON of to get anything out&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is very, very strong and unpleasant (to me)&lt;br /&gt;3. It gives my hair that dusty/gray/blond look&lt;br /&gt;4. My hair feels greasy after applying. Not like my usual dirty greasy, but a different greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The can seems to last for a while, which is good for the money&lt;br /&gt;2. It mostly makes my hair not look as greasy... but it doesn&#x27;t make it look completely clean of oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had one can of it and could have bought a lemon can. So, take that into consideration while reading my review. If I do decide to purchase another can, and if it better meets my expectations, I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried Suave, as stated (and would give it three stars). Suave doesn&#x27;t smell too bad and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after. I like the extra texture. (But I don&#x27;t like the look it gives my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product I&#x27;ve used is Batiste dark and deep brown. I would give it 4.5 stars. I love the extra brown it adds to my hair and it gets rid of the grease better than any other dry shampoo. Plus it feels good once it&#x27;s in - as good as a powder can feel in hair, anyway. The only thing that bothers me about it is it&#x27;s expensive and the can doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> best dry shampoo ive ever used!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative ratings but again every hair is different. I tried lots lots of dry shampoo and I feel like they just don&#x27;t last and there is very little product in them. This one has a lot of product! It works for my fine hair (fine hair but lots of hair) and it just works for  me. Compared to the others this one does not leave that heavy white residue it leaves a bit of a dark gray residue but will fade when you brush your hair. I really like this product  I use it every second day after wash and it does give me some volume.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite dry shampoos, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  The price is great, and the can is bigger than most, so more bang for your buck.  The scent is light and clean, and the product doesn&#x27;t create a lot of unnecessary build up like other dry shampoos.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> The second ingredient listed is &amp;#34;propane&amp;#34;. Even Hank Hill wouldn&#x27;t put this in his hair.</li>
