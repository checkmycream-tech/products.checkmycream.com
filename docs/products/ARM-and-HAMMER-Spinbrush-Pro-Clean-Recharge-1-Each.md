<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> use them all the time, works great</li>
    <li> my teeth just love it.  they are smiling now ;)..........  great tooth brush and they last a long time</li>
    <li> Have used this type spinbrush for years and really like them.  When  I stopped using them for a few months because my old broke, I got complaints from my dentist about the condition of my teeth.</li>
    <li> It is not real powerful, and it is stopped easily while I am brushing my teeth.  It does a decent job though... I got what I  paid for.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It easily cleans up, recharges quickly and leaves my teeth and mouth feeling as clean as can be. Brush for 2 minutes and you are good.</li>
    <li> The fact that it has a charging stand is what I most like about it. It holds a charge for a long time too. Really good toothbrush for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when travelling.  I use a spinbrush sonic and thought that is what I was buying.  There is nothing wrong with the toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t read carefully and bought something that was not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is the third spin brush I&#x27;ve owned.  Two battery powered and one rechargable .  I won&#x27;t get in to the battery powered ones here.  The rechargable one lasted only seven months.  The switch stopped working and I can no longer turn it on.  Don&#x27;t know why.  I know its the switch because it started acting up a week ago.  The battery and charger appear to be fine.  I&#x27;ve had it with crest.  No product should break this soon.  Crest needs to spend a few more bucks and make a reliable product.  I dI&#x27;mm&#x27;t know what im buying next, but it went be from crest.</li>
    <li> just bought to refill head it last a few days after charging for a few hours of strong charge just incase you forget to charge it does its job i was hoping of</li>
    <li> Toothbrush does a great job cleaning your teeth much better than a regular (non-powered) brush. The battery lasted about 18 months for me and I kept it plugged in on the charger base.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that I used for several years. It didn&#x27;t stop working, I broke the plastic body changing the brush head. The new one works great just like the one I broke.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. Wife didn&#x27;t believe me until she went and bought her own. Now, she won&#x27;t go near a standard toothbrush. Best of all is the price. I do not have $100 to throw out on a toothbrush, but I can spear $20.</li>
    <li> Fantastic value. I was expecting much less than what was delivered. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and holds a charge pretty well and is well designed and manufactured.</li>
    <li> This brush has a long 30-hour initial charge but can be left in the charger full time if desired so that it remains fully charged. It is very powerful. The brush head has two sets of bristles: one set spins and one set moves back and forth. I have trouble using it without drooling toothpaste, but this is okay.</li>
    <li> Excelente y barato. Le doy 4 porque obvio un cepillo eléctrico seria mucho mejor. Pero por el precio creo q la calidad es muy buena</li>
    <li> I have been using one of these for several years and it works perfectly, ordered another one as the original is beginning to show signs of battery failure and I am not sure if the batteries can be replaced or not.</li>
    <li> Charger: I bought the spinbrush in August &#x27;07 and its charger just stopped working today (July &#x27;09). At first I thought something had malfunctioned, but after reading some other reviews, I found that this is to be expected after over a year of use. The stand is wired and does require a nearby outlet for nightly charging, but I have taken the spinbrush on 2-3 day trips without the charger stand, and it has retained enough of a charge to work throughout the trip. One thing to note is to dry your brush handle with a towel after each use as the charger stand can get kind of yucky inside if you don&#x27;t.    Brush: The dual-brush head provides both circular and back-and-forth strokes which provides a larger surface area than alternative brushes that only have the circular head. While being a fine product considering its value, don&#x27;t expect this model to last more than a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a week.  My teeth feel smooth like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office, especially behind my bottom front teeth. And then being 10 times cheaper than several spin toothbrush just makes it great.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work from the moment I opened the box. Charged it for 24+ hours but didn&#x27;t matter. Typical made in china crap. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I started with the spin brush when it was a toy, not Crest nor Arm and Hammer.  I stayed with it through Crest, its market pull in 2008, and now Arm and Hammer.    I love it. I will recommend it to all. My dental check ups are very clean and great, thanks to my Spin Brush.    Doesn&#x27;t Crest also own one of the more costly brands of powered brushes? Hmm!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Perfect!</li>
    <li> The first one lasted maybe over a year, this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought.  Considering my wife has an oral B electric toothbrush that&#x27;s lasted for around 5 years now and still doesn&#x27;t have any issues I feel like this brush isn&#x27;t worth it overall, as if I need to buy 1 a year it&#x27;ll be more expensive then my wife&#x27;s nice oralB brush.  But they are cheap and I don&#x27;t feel like spending a lot on a bursh right now ... maybe later though ...</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great. I had one that ran on double a batteries and couldn&#x27;t keep the batteries going. This one doesn&#x27;t have to be charged but once a week (or less) and works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for several years. This is actually the second one I have bought as my toddler broke my last one by throwing it on the tile floor. It keeps a charge nicely, I can take it on vacation without the base and have it work for several days. The replacement heads are easy to buy, and I don&#x27;t find that I need to replace them very often. Great product, and so affordable!</li>
    <li> I have had a Crest Rechargable Spinbrush for several years.  Unfortunately, I somehow managed to break it, which is not easy to do.  I instantly had to have a new one.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased two thinking I had a bad one.  One craped out in a month, and another in three.  It worked well when it worked, but ultimately I believe its not worth it.</li>
    <li> Great deal comparison shopped almost half price to Walmart been using these for years !! My last one lasted 3 years with heavy use just make sure u keep base clean and it will last forever !!</li>
    <li> Much better than the regular spinbrush with 2aa batteries that you need a pair of pliers to remove. The spinbrush pro has a permanent rechargeable battery and twice the power of the removable battery type.It also has replaceable heads when the brush wears out. An excellent product in this price range.</li>
    <li> This brush works well but feels as though I have a jackhammer in my mouth when I use it! Really vibrates, but cleans well.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these toothbrushes for almost a year now, and it has worked flawlessly.  I have taken very good care of it, however.  After each use, I rinse it off and dry it so that no drips will get into the base.  My husband, in the same time I&#x27;ve had mine, has had two die on him.  He doesn&#x27;t dry it off as completely as I do, which may be why his die... I&#x27;m not sure.  So, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a trustworthy product or not...  Would I buy another if mine dies?  Probably.  My husband?  Definitely not.</li>
    <li> The Spinbrush Sonic is in my opinion the greatest toothbrush for the money and would be competitive with more expensive units. I enjoy brushing with this toothbrush. It both cleans and stimulates the gums. The charge lasts for days of brushing and it charges overnight. I liked it so much, I bought my wife one.</li>
    <li> I bought this rechargeable toothbrush because I previously purchased a Crest Spinbrush Pro.  I assume that Arm and Hammer now makes it.  When I received it, I charged it up over night.  It barely make it through one use when I could tell it was slowing down  One more use and it was dead and had to be recharged since I don&#x27;t always leave it plugged in.  My Crest one was much better since I could use it for several days without charging it.  It might just be that I got a bad brush and charger, but then again maybe they got cheap on materials.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with it and also have to tell you this is my second one I have bought</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush b/c of the cost and the good reviews. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months and love it! If you love the fresh from the dentist clean feeling, this is a great brush for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it charging or dying before it should. Knock on wood.</li>
    <li> Like many of you, I checked the review session before purchasing the product. I figure the product has a 4 stars, how bad could it be. Well I order two brushs for my kid. The first one stop working with in 30 days, well within the Amazon easy return policy. The second one stop after about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have took care my oral-b for years. As I know you can&#x27;t continue charging the battery. I figure should not be miss handle from my part. Just a word of caution if you are still consider it.</li>
    <li> I use this toothbrush everyday.  It was given to me for Christmas, 2007.  It&#x27;s now approaching Christmas,2008 and appears to be holding its charge as well as the Energizer Bunny.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it and the results I get with it.</li>
    <li> I assumed that this rechargeable toothbrush might be rechargeable for 18 months to 2 years, which makes it a fine value at the roughly $15 price. However, over the past 3 days, the unit has started to slow and stop after about 90 seconds of brushing -- and NOT because I am applying any unusual pressure. It just slows in the last 5 seconds and quits. Pressing the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button again results in another 15 seconds of SLOW brushing and quitting again. I have handled the unit properly, rinsing and drying with a hand towel before placing it back in the charger base. Unless I hear differently, I&#x27;m reverting to the Oral-B equivalent.</li>
    <li> This is the third of these toothbrushes that I have bought.  The 1st one lasted about a year before the charging unit died.  The 2nd and 3rd ones lasted about 3 months before the charging unit failed.  So now I&#x27;m left with 2 toothbrushes (and extra heads) with nothing to charge them.  Don&#x27;t think I will buy any more of these.  Will try another brand.</li>
    <li> Works well, especially for arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  there might be better quality out there...but not for under 39$,  I have tried several.  this one still works and holds a charge for like 3 days.</li>
    <li> Good brush but doesn&#x27;t have the power that my previous Spinbrush had.</li>
    <li> This brush gets the job done and for a great price. I&#x27;m on my second one. The first lasted me a solid three years before failing to charge.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as a Sonicare but it&#x27;s OK</li>
    <li> I bought the spinbrush and never got to use it once! I charged it the first time for 24hrs thinking it&#x27;s fully charged and press the power and it never turned on! In the trash it goes! What a waste of time n money! Or I&#x27;m just the unlucky one!</li>
    <li> I have the battery replacement model also, but this was my favorite until after about 3 months of use it fell apart.  Possible cause was the way I handled it, but my replacement battery model is still holding up, so I think I&#x27;ll stick with that model.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush; wish I had gotten it sooner.  It does a great job, especially for the price. I&#x27;d like it better if the on/off switch slid up and down instead of having 2 different buttons to push.</li>
    <li> Love it my teeth feel amazing after the first use. Great for the price. Unbeatable deal and i recomend you try it out</li>
    <li> So I really like everything about this except that after a year my first one died and won&#x27;t recharge. This one was my second one and only lasted about 3 months. I feel these things give me a much better clean than traditional toothbrushes, but It sure is pricey for something that may last only a few months.</li>
    <li> Electric toothbrushing is addictive. Once you go electric you never go back. I have been using the Crest brand of this toothbrush (identical) since 2007 (5 years). I brush 2-3 times a day, and probably for too long each time. It still looks good as new and is just now starting to die, but it does still work. If you ask me, that&#x27;s pretty incredible. I&#x27;m buying another one now for the next five years.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I bought a variant of this (they share the same replacement head). It lost charge after about half a year. So I turned to the battery operated version of it. Well, the battery cap on that one was super hard to remove and it was a pain to change the batteries. Then I went back to this one because it can at least last me half a year...so I thought. But you know what? After three use of it, I could not turn it off on my fourth use! It&#x27;s not a typo, I could not turn it off! It&#x27;s ridiculous. I used a pair of pliers to remove the battery cap (because I gave it up...) and did not figure out how to pull the battery out...so I just left it running and running until it&#x27;s tired...Lesson learned? Cheap stuff, especially electronic stuff, just not worth it. I just ordered the Oral-B professional 3000 and will see if it brings me any luck...</li>
    <li> I instantly felt the difference when I used the brush.  It felt like a dental visit!I was worried about recharging batteries but stands fir nicely and I can hide the cord.  It makes me feel a bit more environmentally friendly!</li>
    <li> Awful - had to recharge every 2 days, and felt like a jack-hammer on my teeth. I&#x27;m surprised my fillings didn&#x27;t all fall out.  :-|</li>
    <li> I use braun normally but thought that all you guys must have hit on something better. I would use this to clean my teeth but only if I didn&#x27;t need to have clean teeth and only if I liked wasting money on machines that looked a bit like the real item.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought the spin brush then received it  about 5 days later. The spin brush doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;ll work for about 30 seconds then quit.</li>
    <li> I previously had a battery operated Spinbrush ... that ate through batteries. The power level did not stay strong in it either. I decided to give the rechargeable one a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. With a nice full charge at each brushing, it does a great job. I&#x27;ve had it for two months now, and it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without my spinbrush toothbrush!  I had my first one for over a year and when it stopped working I tried another brand.  I threw it away and came back to this one because it works.  I will never change again.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush after my Sonicare died (lasted 11 years), and I&#x27;ve been happy with this toothbrush so far, especially for the cost.  I brush my teeth a couple times a day and it takes me about 2 minutes each time.  The charge lasts for about a week. I only charge it when it runs out of juice, and when it does run out, it&#x27;s still usable as a toothbrush.  My only warning on this is not to put your teeth together and brush up and down because there is enough of a gap between the bristles and the holder that it will surely catch your lips and give them a good pinch!  I also agree that it is a little awkward hitting that off button because it does feel just like the on button.  I don&#x27;t expect total perfection for a toothbrush like this in this price range.  When it no longer works I won&#x27;t consider it a great loss, and just buy another one.</li>
    <li> I like the Spinbrush and do believe, after using a Sonicare for 15 years, that it does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth. This rechargeable version was purchased after using a battery operated Spinbrush for a few months. I don&#x27;t like using batteries at all unless they&#x27;re rechargeable so went for this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two nitpicky things I have are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The brushheads only seem to come in one size which is a bit too large for my mouth. It&#x27;s not bad enough to keep me from using it, but I would be much more comfortable if there were a smaller brushhead I could buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There are two separate buttons, one for on and one for off. They are the same material and feel as the brush handle and are situated one below the other. The trouble is, when you have the toothbrush in your mouth, it is hard to find the buttons because they barely protrude above the handle and feel exactly the same. It seems they would be easier to find if they made the material on the buttons bumpy or put a small bead there so you could immediately find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush appears to clean my teeth and massage my gums very well and the price is definitely right. I&#x27;ll stay with it.</li>
    <li> Manual toothbrushes hurt my gum line and I dont have the cash to spend on high end electric toothbrushes. The Spinbrush pro is the best bargain! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and glad Amazon.com came thru with the quick shipment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new electric toothbrush as the ones I&#x27;ve been using before were getting harder to change batteries due to difficulties with my hands.  This rechargeable toothbrush is THE BEST!  I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to use an electric toothbrush but is physically unable to easily change batteries.</li>
    <li> First one stopped recharging after 3 years of use, so I decided to purchase another. Best brush I have owned.</li>
    <li> This is a great convenience. The brush works well and automatically recharges each day when you return it to the base. My wife and I both have arthritis and this is very lightweight so it is easy to brush longer. Plus being rechargeable it will save on batteries over the battery model so the difference is worth it. No doubt it has a fixed number of charge cycles so eventually it will go bad but for the cost it should be reasonable. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> worked as expected,  worth more than it costs for your dental health. It is  the rechargeable type, so you don&#x27;t have the hassle of changing batteries</li>
    <li> I am now buying my second one after 2 and a half years. It&#x27;s used 3 times a day and it&#x27;s finally not holding a charge. It&#x27;s very light and easy to hold. I have a very weak grip and am able to hold it easily. Cleans my teeth very well which has saved on my dental bills :)</li>
    <li> I bought 3 for my kids.  They all love it</li>
    <li> Works great had a great price</li>
    <li> I have had expensive models of toothbrush, but this is by far the best!  Both the top AND bottom bristles move.  You can buy attachment heads that have tooth whitening bristles.  It has AMAZING power!  I have used this brand for over 7 years and would never ever buy anything else.  Trust me....you will LOVE this toothbrush and wonder how you got by without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with it; my old oral B powered toothbrush had a lot more oomph to it and felt more solidly made. However, I got this toothbrush for less than half of what it costs for a replacement head on my old brush, and it seems to be doing the job just fine!</li>
    <li> If I can rate 0 stars I would, battery life sucks, you&#x27;re better off buying the cheaper version that requires batteries and buying rechargeable batteries</li>
    <li> The charger draws 2 Watts of power continuously (not just when charging), which equals 17.5 kW-hours/year.  Most of that energy is just dissipated as waste heat in the base charger.  The rechargeable battery is not replaceable.  The spin portion of the brush never worked for me; the slightest pressure on the spin part of the brush would stop it from spinning.  When the brush was away from the base for more that 5 hours, the battery would lose its charge.  The rechargeable battery failed after 3 years.</li>
    <li> We purchased two of these rechargeable Spinbrishes, neither of them held a charge.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon a few weeks ago.  I bought it to replace my first one that died after one year.  This one lasted less than two weeks.  In both cases the brush worked fine until it&#x27;s untimely death.  It just will not hold a charge.  I give up!!!!</li>
    <li> The rechareable battery powered brush is more powerful then the brush you have to replace batteries in. We couldn&#x27;t find this type in stores and thought we would try the one you have to replace batteries. It was ok but had to replace batteries every 4 to 6 weeks. This is the second rechareable brush I have used. Love it.</li>
    <li> Wow what a bang for the buck!  I expected something cheap but this spinbrush works great and for a rechargable toothbrush you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> I had one of these rechargeable brushes for many years.&lt;br /&gt;The charger stopped working several weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;I looked in several stores to replace it with our success.&lt;br /&gt;Found it on Amazon and had it within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried by some of the reviews, but we have not had any problems with the Spinbrush.  Teeth have actually felt cleaner since using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these that lasted almost two years and was very happy with them. So I purchased two new ones. One holds a charge for over a week, the other needs to be recharged every three days. I&#x27;m disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> Good product. So that the battery can last longer, I only charge it once a month since the charge lasts that long. Pretty surprising. I usually go until the brush stops working altogether, and at the end it&#x27;s a little slow but does the job. No real issue there. It stays strong for at least a week before I notice any change in performance. Cleans my teeth excellently. Noisy, but that&#x27;s not an issue considering the price. Very thankful to have it.</li>
    <li> I have one already for over 2 years and the battery still holds good. I think for the money is the best product you can get. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Note:Bought this in store, not on Amazon, but wanted to provide a review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Sonicare for many years (who knows how old that brush was...don&#x27;t worry, I changed the head.) until its wiring went berserk. When purchasing a new one, I went with the cheapest option I saw: this one. It did a fine job. I never felt that the brushing was as strong/intense as with the Sonicare, but figured it was doing the job. However, after roughly 6-8 months of use, it stopped working. It was fully charged but would repeatedly turn off and have to be turned back on, and this increased in frequency VERY quickly as to render it unusable about a day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably spend more money to get another Sonicare next time for longer reliability.</li>
    <li> I have this toothbrush for more than 2 years, and today it is still working as well as when I first bought it.  I put it on the charger for 24 hours about once in 5 days or once a week.  No need to keep it on the charger all the time. I don&#x27;t think it is good for the battery.  I have seen some negative reviews about this product, but for me, I have no problem at all in the last 2 years.  Maybe sometimes you get unlucky and buy a defective product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my rechargeable Spin Brush.  This little brush is way better than the ones the dentist sold me for over $100.00  I have had three of them and they seem to last just short of two years.  And you always get a good brush because the batteries never run down</li>
    <li> this is a great power brush and I have used it for almost a year. it seems to be long lasting.</li>
    <li> The other Sonic brush by Arm and Hammer is so much better. My previous Sonic brush, the one i had before this one, lasted 8 years!!! Attached below is the jpeg image of the one I had before, of which I&#x27;m going to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my spin brush tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel cleaner and smoother than&lt;br /&gt;when I used a hand brush.</li>
    <li> Works great.  No more changing batteries.</li>
    <li> The instructions suggest charging the toothbrush for 30 hours before you use it, so I charged the battery for over 36 hours before the first attempted use.  And then... it barely ran.  The thing barely had any juice at all.  I had the exact same toothbrush once before, and it lasted about a year before the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  So I figured for around $17 I would have been happy to get another year, but it did not work out that way.  I think Arm and Hammer has some serious quality control issues.</li>
    <li> Seems to be very well made (only had it two months). Very compact charging base that takes up very little room on the vanity. Significantly lower priced than the Brauns and others brands.  Wish the replacement heads were more readily available, but I just have to remember to order some ahead of time.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush absolutely rocks, it is a first affordable rechargeable toothbrush that I&#x27;ve ever truly liked. First it arrived on time and the price was good, it lasted longer than ones I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores but I found it on Amazon. The key to this toothbrush is to charge it for 30 hours before you use it and it will last you about 2 years based on the last three that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> So I started using this and I LOVE IT! My teeth are so clean I went for a deep cleaning at my dental office and they said that now I just can get a regular cleaning, this pretty much did the deep cleaning for them lol! Amazing! I would HIGHLY recommended. Also it is a true space saver, that tiny little charger is powerful and tiny! AWESOME PRODUCT, arrived on time! Just over all awesome!</li>
    <li> Very good power toothbrush that you can replace the heads. We received 2 of the same color... wish they wouldn&#x27;t sent 2 different colors. My older son has a spin brush but it has a whirl with 4 light up sections that show how long you should brush. This brush doesn&#x27;t have it. Still a good value. Hard to find these in stores.</li>
    <li> very pleased with product</li>
    <li> Love this! I would go through dozens of batteries a year with my old Spin Pro, now it stays charged on the base.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THESE FOR YEARS AND REMAIN IN WORKING CONDITION FOR YEARS. I GOT THIS ONE TO REPLACE ONE I BROKE.</li>
    <li> This brush is bargain priced, but performs well. Not as good as some of my older and much more expensive Braun brushes, but this does a respectable job. Hope it lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> It is a good brush .had one before so I knew what it was.  would buy another one for sure.</li>
    <li> The product worked as expected.  Glad I purchased and look forward to the continued use of it.  Worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> Why use batteries when you can have the rechargeable at a reasonable price?  Love this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
    <li> It is a little too gentle for me but I still use it daily. It is very dependable . Not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have owned this tooth brush for so long I dont recall the year I was gifted the terrific brush. It was when the price was $34.00 which was long ago. I am happy with the brush and the brush heads are easy to replace. The price here is great.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and arrived on time.  Good value.  I would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, don&#x27;t buy! Full charge doesn&#x27;t last 5 seconds or doesn&#x27;t fully charge one or the other.</li>
    <li> The brush cleaned my teeth so much better than I ever thought it would - I would highly recommend this procduct to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I replaced my expensive electric toothbrush for this. It seems to do a better job on my teeth. Somewhat larger in diameter and noisier, but beats the H-E double hockey sticks out of a $70 or $80 electric toothbrush. Don&#x27;t know if I recommend dumping your expensive brush like I did but if you want to change over to an electric this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> than the traditional battery operated model. I&#x27;ve been using Spinbrush since 2009, I started with the traditional battery operated model and would find that after a while the batteries would were down, and corrode the interior compartment where the batteries go, water would leak in and you would go through batteries a lot quicker than expected. No worried here with the rechargeable one - you also don&#x27;t have to brush as long because there is so much power it gets it done in half the time. For an affordable powered tooth brush you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> This is not the original Crest Spin Brush pro from back in the bay, but a modern day re-hash of it.&lt;br /&gt;The original was a very rough scrub and that is what I liked about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think this brush works better than a Sonic Care toothbrush due to the fact that the Sonic Care, while the frequency is significantly higher, has a very soft brush and it does not seem strong enough to really clean the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way you will need a water pic as well to clean between teeth,&lt;br /&gt;Or you could use floss, but who really does that?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this flimsy brush. It&#x27;s moving 2 part brush looks and feels like it will fall apart without notice.  I went cheap when I bought this brush and should have re-bought the SONIC Spinbrush by the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charge lasts about two brushes before a significant decline in power.  The SONIC will go several days without charging and fewer moving parts.</li>
    <li> When it worked, it worked as well as my other one that requires batteries, and it was slightly more convenient since I didn&#x27;t have to swap the batteries every couple weeks, but the problem is it stopped working after five months. I disassembled it, and as it turns out, the three 1.2V 100ah batteries were all in need of charging. The charger must have died somehow, which drops this from five stars to one star in my book. Even though it&#x27;s less convenient (A minute less every two weeks specifically), the other spinbrush I have works great with my AA NiMH rechargeable batteries, and those batteries are over five years old.    My advice to to buy a model that requires batteries and spend another ten bucks on a four pack of NiMH AA batteries and a charger, maybe even some of those low self discharge NiMH batteries (Eneloop, CycleEnergy, etc) if you don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra. It may be less convenient, but at least it&#x27;ll still be working a few years later.</li>
    <li> Great Product. As someone who is concerned about our environment, not having to dispose of batteries frequently is a feature I was looking for. It would be nice to have this product available in various colors.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for about 8 years and only need to purchase a new one when it stops working. It iscomfortable to hold and easy to use, so our grandchildren can also use it by interchanging the heads.</li>
    <li> Works as well as more expensive types of electric toothbrush.  Old one was seven years old before it started slowing down. Easy to replace the brush attachment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the battery version of this item and liked it, but figured the convenience of a rechargeable one would be a big improvement.  I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a defective one, but it does not hold any sort of substantial charge, even brand new and after 3-4 days of charging with no use.  It will turn on just fine, but within 5 seconds of rigorous brushing it stops.  It can be turned on again, but it just repeatedly turns off as soon as any pressure is applied to the teeth - same thing happened with the battery version when the batteries needed to be changed, so I&#x27;m fairly certain it just won&#x27;t charge effectively.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the exact same item that died after a year of use.  After 3mos the on button became faulty so that I had to press all around the area of the button for a while to get it to turn on.  I have been using it like that for almost a year and now it will no longer hold a charge for more than 3-4 tooth brushing episodes lasting 2-3 minutes per episode, after being charged for 24hrs. I paid less than $20 for it and likely would have spent that much on ordinary toothbrushes in 18mos time.  When the brush does hold a charge and I can finally get it turned on it does a good job, much better than a manual toothbrush.  I probably will not buy another one of these when this one does totally die.  If anyone can recommend a different brand/model I would appreciate it, thanx.</li>
    <li> I got this because it was cheap and better then the battery one from my previous use. Had to charge this for almost 24 hrs to retain a decent charge. Now i only have to charge it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush so this one seems pretty good to me. I have to recharge it every third or fourth time I use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for the one that I left at my friends house down in Richmond. I love that this is rechargeable. I had My other one fore about 8 months and it worked great. kept the teeth nice and shiny and cleans much better than your standard tooth brush. I feel like I&#x27;m leaving the dentist office after every brush.</li>
    <li> Bought for my nephew, and he really loves it.  Says  you definitely can feel the difference than with a manual toothbrush.  Company sent it out really quick.</li>
    <li> I had one of the first of these made and it lasted three years.  This one held a charge for three months and then worked best in the trash can.  This was a great idea that some marketer decided lasted too long because it was well made.  So they engineered in obsolesce.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from amazon and used it for 2 years, 5 months, before it stopped recharging. The directions said it would eventually do this and it said that it contains no user replaceable parts, so I bought another one. The price has gone up about $3 since the last time I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This Spinbrush is really a great toothbrush. I doubt i will ever use a regular toothbrush ever again. I also purchased the &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; tips sold in 2 PKs at Walmart for $8. They made this rechargeable toothbrush into a household name in are house.It feels great &amp; its cleaning so much more area effectively. It can&#x27;t be beat for under $20. It says to charge for 30 hours before the 1st use. I did this because i realize its always important to follow battery directions as to condition them to have a longer life of use.I would say everyone should have a Spinbrush of thier own.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a year or so.  This was a gift to a family member.  Works great and we really like the no contacts charging stand.</li>
    <li> strong motor and gets the job done. makes my lips numb after long uses.</li>
    <li> what a great toothbrush.. this is my second one in 3 years.  last a long time if you take care of it</li>
    <li> The brush is fine the recharge is terrible The brush freezes up in the charger and you cannot get it out and when you do the brush base and charger are full of grains !</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush but prefer the oral b.  The smaller brush is easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> Although it does run for about 5 days on a single charge, the power of the spin is noticeably less powerful after the second day.  So I feel I need to charge this every 2 days.</li>
    <li> I love this spinbrush because it charges itself, no batteries that have to be installed and then worried about later. With time I realized that the unit can no longer take a charge but I am happy to say that it lasted almost a year. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Very quick shipping. Overall happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using one of these for years. The charger died so I needed a replacement (the toothbrush still works). I do like this system a lot. The brushes are replaceable and operate by the tip brush spinning and the other brush going back and forth. It is rechargeable so no replacing batteries. It does take overnight to recharge but that is OK because the company says to leave it plugged into the stand when not in use. When traveling I get as much as a week between charges. The brushes themselves last about two months.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I had a name brand brush that didn&#x27;t do any better a job and costs two to three times as much. For this price you can&#x27;t go wron.</li>
    <li> This is a really good brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and compared to other electric spin brushes (more expensive, more recognizable brands) this does a very good job of getting your teeth as squeaky clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first week of use, it got rid of some plaque that my other electric brushes had never been able to remove and I could only get rid of from a professional cleaning at the dentist. Everytime I use it, I really feel like I&#x27;ve had a very good cleaning experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somethings I like about it are, that the changeable heads are attached more firmly to the toothbrush base , unlike most other models, and it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or like it&#x27;ll come off so easily. Also the brush heads are color coded and the colored parts (green) wear out when it&#x27;s time to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A difference from some other brushes of this type is that it doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off at the 2 minute mark , so if you like to be reminded when to stop brushing, then you&#x27;ll have to set your own timer. personally, I don&#x27;t mind this...I like to brush a little longer anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the price front , this is the best value compared to other brands and models. I definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t hold for as long as the manual said it would.  If I recall correctly it was 2 min, 2x/per would last about a week on a single charge.  I find it needs to be charged every couple of days.  Otherwise, great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my spinbrush sonic toothbrush stopped charging. Generally speaking, i&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I am able to use my existing spinbrush attachments from my old brush with is great. The product holds a good charge for many days which is good. I do however, notice a decrease in &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; vs the spinbrush sonic. My previous brush really did a great job, this one seems a little under powered in comparison.</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH. DOES THE PURPOSE. REALLY HOLDS AN EXCELLENT CHARGE. I RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH TO ANYONE IN THE MARKET FOR A GOOD TOOTHBRUSH...</li>
    <li> Used it for many years. Faster than the battery model. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my Oral B was ready for a new head and thought that I&#x27;d try the A&amp;H as it came with an extra head.  The toothbrush will hold a charge for approx 2 uses.  Don&#x27;t bother to complain to Arm &amp; Hammer as you will get no response.  I went back to my rechargeable Oral B which is still working fine after better than 2 years.</li>
    <li> I had been buying the battery operated spinbrush toothbrushes, which I loved except that somehow when I had to replace the batteries, the battery compartment wouldn&#x27;t close all the way... so I had replaced the whole toothbrush a couple of times, until I found this rechargeable one.  It operates well and hopefully will last - so time will tell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an electric toothbrush that sits in its stand all day. It keeps a good charge for 5-10 days depending on use and it DOES WORK. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Replacement brushes are expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for so long I can&#x27;t even remember when I bought it. It&#x27;s at least five years old. I finally am ordering a replacement because it no longer appears to be charging - not sure if it&#x27;s the base or the batteries in the unit. I guess nothing lasts forever, but it sure did last a long time.  I&#x27;ve travelled with it many times and it holds a charge for 2-3 days on trips so I don&#x27;t have to always take the base along. A great brush and much more convenient than similar models where you have to replace batteries - those seemed to run out rather quickly and the base was very hard to open to replace the batteries. I have absolutely no complaints about it - a great brush and does a good job.</li>
    <li> Seems to discharge rapidly...... after an all night charge, it only went for less than one minute!!!</li>
    <li> Would not hold charge</li>
    <li> It was my second electric toothbrush. I chose this one for its dual move. First time I used it really didn&#x27;t like it. The move was so brutal and rough it felt like my all brain was shacking. Also I had to recharge it much more often than the other one. But then I got used to it and was globally satisfied until it stopped completely working after only 6 months. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush. Just buy another brand.</li>
    <li> HAD TROUBLE FINDING THIS ITEM, WAS DIRECTED TO AMAZON BY THE MANUFACTURER.</li>
    <li> Product looks nice and good price, but it&#x27;s terrible quality. It was death after less than 2 months. When I first used, I already had a problem with it, it stopped during my brushing couple times, even I just charged it full a day ago. In last few days, it turned on by itself when I did not use, even at night during sleeping time (made my kids scary !!!!). After that, it was totally death, it was unable to recharge or turn on.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!  Cleans your teeth like a dentist!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone!!  Enjoy the thougthts&lt;br /&gt;of no more batteries!!</li>
    <li> I recent bought this toothbrush yesterday and on my first use, I found the off button useless because the tootbrush will not \\&quot;spin\\&quot; unless the one button is held down. Therefore, in order to use the \\&quot;spin\\&quot; feature, the one button must me held down at all times. EPIC FAIL in my opinion. I should&#x27;ve have just stuck with Oral B instead...</li>
    <li> I felt the newer Spinbrush Pro would be a more convenient product since it has built-in batteries and a charger. My old Spinbrush, which I had for many years, finally had a power switch failure and since it is not really made to disassemble, was rendered useless. It took AA batteries and I used rechargeables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Spinbrush works well, is slimmer and takes the same brush heads as the original. The power buttons are now push buttons and are totally sealed, unlike the original Spinbrush. The charger is an induction charger so you do not have to get any metal contact areas mated together. It does need to be recharged more often that I anticipated. I can go about 4 days before recharging and I had read it would go longer. Maybe I brush too long at each session!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, especially for the price, I feel this was a good investment. I have only had it for a month so far, so I am not sure of its longevity. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second one as the other I thought would have worn out long ago but it lasted much longer than I thought it would. I recommend this highly</li>
    <li> I have had several different rechargable toothbrushes. I love love love this one the most. It is less expensive and has more power than some way more expensive ones. It also holds it charge exceptionally well. When this one wears out, I will buy one just like it. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rattles the head a little...it&#x27;s definitely rigorous in its cleaning.</li>
    <li> I find Spinbrush Pro to be extremely valuable in keeping my teeth clean—and my gums in good shape. Having used it for years now, I recently found myself challenges on a couple of occasions when I had to use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush. I particularly find the large brush area of Spinbrush to be far better than the smaller circles of the other, more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> Battery plug is not last long</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this brush, as a cheap replacement for a Sonicare rechargeable brushes.  It definitely gets your teeth clean, however, it has little pockets of air in the brush head that trap bacteria, and over time, it starts stinking like high heaven in a way that brushes that lack these empty spaces don&#x27;t.  There was a report recently that brushes with these empty pockets have almost 3000x the amount of bacteria, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here.  The Sonicare Philips Sonicare Hx3631/03  is only a couple of dollars more expensive, and even though it doesn&#x27;t have a rechargeable base, it gets my teeth just as clean without the smelly bacteria accumulating brush head.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this.  My wife has owned this plug-in Spinbrush for about 2 years.  And I&#x27;ve been wasting my time with the non-plug-in types.  The biggest issue with the ones with removable batteries? Water gets in and ultimately drains battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is great.  I&#x27;ve used it for several months now with no issues at all. Charges fully every time. It will pay for itself in a year with the saved batteries.</li>
    <li> I like how the brush works and I was glad to find a Spinbrush that is rechargeable, but after 3 days it smells moldy and my hand smells moldy after holding it.  There appears to be no way to open it and let it dry.  I do not see other people mentioning this but the smell is quite strong.  I do not have this problem with my battery operated SpinBrush.</li>
    <li> I was quite happy with my purchase, I have not used it as yet, but am sure it will please me will buy again because my family is big and have already promised one to my daughter, then the kids will come next.</li>
    <li> We have had spin brushes for about 2 years and one of ours was slowed down, so we liked them so much we bought 2 of them , one to replace the one that was worn down and one for the future.</li>
    <li> The spinbrush Pro is great, never have to be changing batteries.  Always fully charged and keeps teeth extra clean.  I bought everyone in my family one.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The first one I had for a few years. It kept getting knocked off the sink by our crazy cats. One day it finally broke. I finally decided to get another one. It makes my teeth feel really clean.  I also like it better than the ones with batteries. I constantly change the batteries because I when they start to weaken I didn&#x27;t feel like my teeth were clean. This one is nice cause it stays charged up every day.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush. It stays charged for days. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. The refill heads are inexpensive, so your teeth always feel clean and plaque free.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt my favorite tootbrush. Does an excellent job or cleaning. Never runs low on juice even if you accidently forgrt to put it back on charger for a few nights. If it ever takes a crap i would reorder in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and I love it.  This spinbrush pro is more powerful than the basic battery powered one.  The rechargeable unit keeps it at top power and it cleans well.</li>
    <li> This is the Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used!  The only problem is that I should have bought more of them.</li>
    <li> Before replacing my electric toothbrush, I read Consumer Reports ratings and based my purchase of this brush on those ratings.  I refuse to spend $100+ on a toothbrush, whether pushed by my dentist or from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this toothbrush, with it&#x27;s dual action heads, does the job for me.  It seems like the motor is slower than my previous (Oral B) electric toothbrush in terms of the vibration rate for each action (ala RPM).  But it&#x27;s still faster than what my wrist can do so I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the self-charging base although I wish the stiff electric cord to the base was a little more pliable.</li>
    <li> I liked my brush very much and am still using it, but my wife&#x27;s brush stopped staying on three weeks after she started using it and she has to force hold it on if it even stays on then. When working it does a great job, but it should last more than three weeks before becomning defective</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and does a nice job.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if converting from manual to mechanical was for me, but it seems to be doing the job.</li>
    <li> I like it better than the two AA battery powered version it replaced. Hope rechargeable batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> I was concerned the first time I used the toothbrush that the motor was not as strong as my old Crest Spinbrush but that improved with charging time on the cradle. What&#x27;s nice about this model is that the entire brush is one piece, meaning that no water can get inside to damage the motor or battery. This was an issue with my old Crest brand spinbrush. Like most rechargeable batteries, this one improved with subsequent charges and now the motor is quite a bit stronger than it was out of the box. Now I just need to see if my old spinbrush&#x27;s replacement heads will fit!</li>
    <li> It works great so far i hope it last a long time !!</li>
    <li> Loved my old Spinbrush, but this rechargeable one does not seem to have as much power or speed.</li>
    <li> Had to get a replacement recharger. Husband (and other friends I have) swears by this thing. I&#x27;m old-fashioned and use the regular &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; toothbrush.  Haven&#x27;t tried this yet.  It&#x27;s a good product, though.  His lasted him forever before we had to order a new charger.</li>
    <li> I had to recently get a new one because the first one I purchased died. It lasted about three years which is awesome. Really gets my teeth clean and fast too. Much much better than a regular toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one that I have had for years. Has great powerful motion to really clean between my teeth. Being rechargeable makes it a great battery powered brush to use when I am RV&#x27;ing. Holds a charge for several days and applications. I have owned many Spinbrush products and I am totally hooked on this product. Even my dentist notice a significant clean teeth.</li>
    <li> My old one just ran out of minutes and it lasted me about 6 years, if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it</li>
    <li> Works great!  Stand is very secure.  Wireless charging is an awesome feature!  Blue rubber is a great non-slip add-on.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush was great till it stopped working. really liked the item, the feeling and how it cleaned. then it stopped charging till it wouldn&#x27;t hold a solid charge. this was a great alternative to all the expensive motorized brushes on the market while it lasted.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my original which lasted for 3years plus. It works great and I wish that I had had one when I was younger.</li>
    <li> Not sure why people complain about this, I just love it. You MUST plug it in and charge it solidly on its base for at least 36 hours before you even think of using it! Otherwise, works just fine. I store it on the charger after every use, then once or twice a year, I run it ALL the way down until it&#x27;s complete dead and recharge again without use for 36 hours. I coincide this with daylight savings time, along with changing my smoke alarm batteries.</li>
    <li> my 1st brush lasted at least 3 years.  recharable seems best vs dealing with batteries.  so glad to find it here</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t want to turn on. I have to hit the back and/or adjust the way I&#x27;m tilting it before I push the on switch. Rather annoying.</li>
    <li> better keep it charged. Loses power rather quickly. If i had to do it all over again, i would buy something which i hope had a little more JUICE.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was okay. What I did not like was the strength of the head spinning. It was often times weak and required recharging too often. It claims to sustain charge for 20 minutes but the reality is that it was too weak that I could not tell when recharging was needed to increase the spinning strength. I would not recommend. I would recommend that you spend a little more money to purchase a Sonic Care as you will get quality and a time tested brand.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> It turns on by itself.  After a few days, the battery cannot be charged.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these rechargable Spinbrushes for half a decade before it finally died on me (as all battery-powered devices eventually do), but I saw a severe drop in cavities after purchase.  Upon searching for another one, I found the drugstores no longer carry them, and I bought the replaceable battery one since it was all they had.  Very wasteful on AAs and only lasted maybe a year.  If you&#x27;re looking for a nice non-aggressive electric toothbrush that will last awhile (take care of it by periodically pulling the brush head off and letting the pieces dry separately), this is the brush for you.  DO NOT buy the AA-powered ones.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great... for the first three months. Previously, I had to charge it once in 5-6 days and it would run beautifully for that week. Earlier this week, after under three months of using it, it won&#x27;t recharge, even when I have charged it for over 24 hours. So, basically, if you are looking for longevity, this brush isn&#x27;t for you. What did I expect for under $20?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as I already had one. She loves it and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;It was less expensive than buying one at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought mine in about 2003 and to this day it still works like a charm.  I love how the brush rotates in different directions which feels so good on my gums that I tend to brush longer and with having arthritis the light weight brush makes this more enjoyable than a normal electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problem with the charging base.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love mine, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for the price.  Mine finally died on me after about 4 years.  It cleans very nicely and the charger is quite convenient.  The brush heads are also very easy to find.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...&lt;br /&gt;1. its very loud&lt;br /&gt;2. does not stay charged very long - max 2-3 days&lt;br /&gt;3. does not brush soft - feels like a jack hammer&lt;br /&gt;4. I only bought this brush because the replacement heads can be bought at local store.</li>
    <li> I have been using this kind of tooth brush for the last couple years. Never had a problem with it. Cleans well. This model is a new version of spinbrush. It is a little noisier than the older versions, but not bad. There are 2 buttons instead of one (one turns on brush, other turns it off). Previous versions had 1 button (turns on and off with same button).</li>
    <li> I noticed a number of reviews complaining that it &amp;#34;couldn&#x27;t hold a charge&amp;#34; or ran down too fast. Such reviews are from people who DID NOT follow the simple instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Let it charge for 24 HOURS the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are not brushing your teeth, it sits in its recharging stand. IT LIVES THERE, okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You can toss the toothbrush itself in a bag for a weekend trip, but for anything longer it needs to have its house. The charging stand is very small. Bring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all there is to it. I&#x27;ve had it over a year, and prior to that I&#x27;d had the Spinbrush you put batteries in. I used rechargeables so that part was okay, but getting the compartment open required pliers and upper body strength and drove me nuts. This is a massive upgrade, and my dental team is thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of toothbrush for many years and it finally gave out. I looked all over for it and Amazon is the only place that I could purchase a replacement. It&#x27;s great because you don&#x27;t need to worry about battery replacement. It keeps a charge for 12 hours or so without being plugged in. It works great and my dentist likes that I use it along with a Water Pik.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price.&lt;br /&gt;built well .. keeps on working day after day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush and two weeks later it stopped charging, I then had it replaced with a new one and it also stopped holding a charge within a couple of weeks.  Amazon charged me for a re-stocking fee, I can&#x27;t imagine they are truly re-stocking a defective personal hygiene product, i would hope not anyway.</li>
    <li> talk about snail mail this came after the estimated date love the product but not the wait</li>
    <li> I have been using a spin brush for years. I stopped for a few months about two year ago and my dentist could tell. When my old one wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore I went to wal mart to get a new one but they don&#x27;t carry them any more. I fond this one on amazon and jumped on it. It arrived quickly and I know I paid close to $30 for my last one. Just an fyi the last one I had lasted me about four years.</li>
    <li> The battery lasted less than a month.  This is obviously old stuff.  Not up to Amazon standards.  Trash.</li>
    <li> I think this Spinbrush Toothbrush work just as well as the one that cost 100.00 It has pretty much the same result as the overpriced electric toothbrushes out on the market.</li>
    <li> It worked well for a few days.  Less than 30 days of the purchase I have already problem to turn it on. I´ve to try many times until it works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a rechargable spin brush anymore. I had one that wore out and was able to replace it with one I got from Amazon. I liked the old one to death. This one is just like the old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second Spinbrush after four great years of use with the first one. The first one quit from the expired rechargeable battery. I only replaced the brush itself several times. I thought about replacing the battery, but decided for the pirce, just buy a new one. Although Arm &amp; Hammer bought the Spinbrush from Crest, It hasn&#x27;t changed any to my knowledge. I&#x27;ve been happy with my second unit after several months of use. I&#x27;ve tried SonicCare electric toothbrushes without much success in the past.</li>
    <li> I ordered it on sale during Christmas, fast delivery. Ready to use out of the package. Charge lasts relatively long like 2 - 3 weeks if you brush twice a day. After charge was finished, I only charged it few hours. The cleanliness &amp; fresh feeling after brushing is just amazing. Be sure to use a really good toothpaste as well. SMILE :-D</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Been using for a few weeks now and everything works well. The reason I purchases this was because it came with a base to easily store the toothbrush. An additional bonus is that the base charges the toothbrush as well. NO NEED FOR REPLACING BATTERIES EVERY MONTH!! All around a good purchase, although nothing more than my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It does a much better job than a manual brush and it&#x27;s much better than the battery version which goes through a set of batteries about once every two weeks (used twice per day.)</li>
    <li> This was a replacement because I really loved&lt;br /&gt;the Spinbrush.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find these refills anywhere else.  It is good to know that I have a source.</li>
    <li> Very good cleaning results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush back in September, and it was just great until it stopped working two months later.  My future toothbrushes will be battery operated - my daughter&#x27;s lasted for a couple years.  I&#x27;ll never buy another rechargeable one.</li>
    <li> I have used Spinbrush toothbrushes for a long time, but have never purchased a rechargeable one.  I was not disappointed!  The buttons are a little different than the manual ones (with batteries) but did not take long to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; and learn where they were.  It is so wonderful to have a fully operational toothbrush each time I use it and now I won&#x27;t be faced with buying batteries every so often.  I cannot say enough about how the Spinbrush works.  I have more plaque buildup than most people and actually visit my dentist and hygienist every three months for a cleaning and check.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the Spinbrush I have been complimented on the cleanliness of my teeth and how much better they are.  That should say it all!</li>
    <li> My 90 year old mother loves it!</li>
    <li> I had my old Spinbrush Pro for four years before it died.  I couldn&#x27;t find another one at Walgreens where I&#x27;d gotten the last one.  Found it on Amazon at a good price and it was delivered quickly. Love this toothbrush and the fact that I can keep it plugged in so it&#x27;s always charged and ready!</li>
    <li> Use it all the time. Like it very much.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for years.  Tried the other top brands, but went back to spin brush.  I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite toothbrush. I had one I used for two years and it wore out and needed to find another. The price was perfect and I am still in love!</li>
    <li> This is my second rechargeable Spinbrush and I am very satisfied with it.  I still use the induction charger from the previous one that I had used for about two years.  It is easier to handle and more powerful than the Spinbrush with replaceable batteries.</li>
    <li> Works great as advertised.  I would have liked if it came with a replacement brush but the price was good so I am happy.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a gift and whether it was a personal opinion or not they said they felt the battery toothbrush version had more of a kick and they went back to it after a short time frame. At least the heads are compatible so they have some extra toothbrush heads for their battery version toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The brush is pretty powerful on a full charge. I hated replacing batteries on my old one. The charger doubles as a stand. The brush heads are replaceable and you can find them at any store. And the price is pretty good.</li>
    <li> As a lazy person. Actually make that VERY lazy, this was purrfect. Meow, so the pros - this brush works wonders. After a looong cat ...day of licking myself I tend to have a lot of fur in my teeth. Since I lack opposable thumbs, I usually just leave it somewhere and use my mittens to turn it on and just move my head and mouth on it.&lt;br /&gt;My master bought this for himself, but I puurfer that I have this since I am so lazy. Hopefully he doesn&#x27;t read this and figure out that I am the reason that his toothbrush has so much hair on it.&lt;br /&gt;Heck, you could take this review seriously - but what do I know, I am a cat.</li>
    <li> excellent product. It brushes my teeth with this unique style brush that spins around.This powered tooth brush is the only design that the brush spins just like the dentist has when you get your teeth cleaned. It is the best design. It is also affordable thats what really helps out . You can clean your teeth and afford it also.</li>
    <li> It appears to me that what was delivered was not a genuine product. It also shuts off sporadically.</li>
    <li> I bot one back in 2008 oct and last to feb 2015 ... the start on and of buton broke finaly after 7 years ... for the many omg goood product ( hope to last half like the old one )</li>
    <li> Why pay 70 - 80 dollars for a spinbrush when you can buy this one for under 20. dollars.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> it cleans good  your mouth feels nice and flash  after bushing  with it love it a lot  easy to use</li>
    <li> So far so good--hope it holds it&#x27;s charge or will be a different story. Does a nice job brushing.</li>
    <li> Great purchase- my old rechargeable wore out after many, many years of use. Eco friendlier than replacing batteries every few months. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> Love it... this one replaces one that I had for......years... but it finally gave out.</li>
    <li> This is the best $18 tooth brush ever.  It was so good I bought a second one for my wife.</li>
    <li> The spinbrush was what I expected, as I had one previously.  I was disappointed the plastic cover for the brush head was missing.</li>
    <li> I opened up the Spinbrush and placed it to charge for the recommended time (30 hours). 24 hours later, in an attempt to turn it on just to check if it was charging, nothing happened. The base of the spinbrush feels warm, but other than that, I can&#x27;t tell whether or not it is successfully charging. I will be asking for a replacement unit ASAP, but so far, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed it didn&#x27;t work right out of the box (after the initial charge, of course).</li>
    <li> Very happy with it.  It is so hard to find locally anymore.</li>
    <li> good price.&lt;br /&gt;and works very well,&lt;br /&gt;as good a the high prices ones.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this one, holds the battery for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good product; timely shipping.</li>
    <li> Arrived very promptly brand new as noted.  This brush noted that had 2 minute response notification and it does not!</li>
    <li> Charged it for 8 hours, and have been using it for a week. It&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> My wife had one first, now I have one too</li>
    <li> This is a stocking stuffer so no idea what it&#x27;s like but I&#x27;m sure it is fine.</li>
    <li> Works great, makes my teeth feel clean.  You might want to consider the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; version of this product also.</li>
    <li> Works great, better than a normal tooth brush and gentle on the gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the AA battery version of the Spinbrush pro for several years.  My dentist thinks I floss but I don&#x27;t.  This rechargeable version is likely to save on AA battery purchases over the life of the toothbrush.  The AA version requires that you frequently change the batteries or the performance drops quickly. (You&#x27;re supposed to brush 2 minutes per day minimum)  I get AA batteries cheaply (18 to 22 cents) and the rechargeable costs about $7 to $7.50 more than the AA version.  Since you need 2 batteries and replace about once per week or ten days, the rechargeable starts saving you money after about 6 months for a 20 cent battery price.  Not a great savings but the convenience alone of not having to change batteries is good enough for me.  Buy this if you like the Spinbrush pro.  Having the brush at high speed and fully charged every time is also a major plus over the AA version. Since I&#x27;ve never owned one of these, I don&#x27;t know how long they last.  One woman reported that if you dry it off before returning to the base, it lasts a very long time.  We&#x27;ll see.  Side note:  I prefer the medium brush version over the soft version.  Mediums are harder to find than the soft version but there out there (Meijer in the Midwest has them)</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush, holds charge along time.</li>
    <li> Finding a replacement head for this product is too difficult. Replacements should be sold with the products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three of these over the last 8 years. I bought the first one in a box store, and the last two on Amazon. I love the brush, which is obviously why I&#x27;ve purchased them so often. But both times that I purchased this brush on Amazon, the charging base refused to work properly. Both times, the bases simply would not charge my brush up to full power (I even left my brush in the new base for 48 hours). I tried the old base (the one from the box store) and the brushes worked like a charm. Not sure what the problem is, but I basically now have two useless bases.</li>
    <li> I have worn out 2 of these units.  I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I looked at several competing products. Spinbrush does the job at a reasonable price. The replacement are equally well priced.</li>
    <li> I have had a battery-powered toothbrush before, and really liked the ease of doing a non-abrasive cleaning of my teeth which I was doing with a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; one.  I&#x27;m sure eventually this battery will give out and not recharge any longer, but if it lasts as long as my last one...I have over a year of happy brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the varied length of the bristles for getting better between the teeth.  Plus this brush has 2 moving sets of bristles and I feel it&#x27;s giving better coverage in cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive but effective!</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush for the price. It works great and is rechargeable. The only issue is the 30 hour initial charge needed.</li>
</ol>
