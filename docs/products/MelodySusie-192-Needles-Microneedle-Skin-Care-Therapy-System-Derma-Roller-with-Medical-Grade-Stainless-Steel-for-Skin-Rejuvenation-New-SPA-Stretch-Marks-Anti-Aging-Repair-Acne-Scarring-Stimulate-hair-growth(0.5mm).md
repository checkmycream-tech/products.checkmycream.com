      <li>I wish the handle was a bit sturdier and of better quality.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased..</li>
      <li>I bought the .5 and 1.0 and mostly use the .5.  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>and I won&#x27;t return it because it seems like it does an okay job for micro needling</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m hoping for even better results with continued use but so far so good.</li>
      <li>It is helping to reduce my fine lines and the parentheses lines on either side of my mouth.</li>
      <li>and i havent noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>If you do get a proper derma roller the results are amazing!</li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>No matter how many positive reviews, I was still hesitant.</li>
      <li>Okay, you get excited when you read all the reviews, but faced with the product in your hand, can you really roll all those needles over your face?</li>
      <li>I use this once a week on my whole face and then halfway through the week I use it lightly on just my problem areas.</li>
      <li>I also used a &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; moisturizing cream after (more natural ingredient product) eventually the redness went away.</li>
      <li>So, I rarely need the soothing cream now.</li>
      <li>the price is also right.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size for the face.</li>
      <li>It hurt, so I stopped doing it almost right away.</li>
      <li>After 2 months using this derma roller, I found my large pores being smaller than before, now I totally love this product!</li>
      <li>This is my first dermaroller.</li>
      <li>and I just rolled today for the first time.</li>
      <li>When I first saw this needle roller</li>
      <li>The only difference I am seeing in my skin is more acne.  </li>
      <li>This was my first roller.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll see from the first time of using.</li>
      <li>I sterilized it with boiling water and rubbing alcohol before and after my first use.</li>
      <li>540 microneedle&#x27;s density is higher than 192 mirconeedle&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>My face is smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I use it first</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>First time using this item.</li>
      <li>I have noticed an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;After my first use of he Derma Roller</li>
      <li>I was a bit startled by the sensation at first but was only in pain for maybe 30 seconds (and that very mild pain) before I adjusted to the feeling.</li>
      <li>Then I saw hundreds of positive reviews and started to research it.</li>
      <li>Roll responsibly ;)</li>
      <li>but I certainly won&#x27;t purchase from this brand of micro needler again.</li>
      <li>It works great, although it could be a little bigger.</li>
      <li>Face looks much brighter and smoother.</li>
      <li>I received this item extremely fast using Amazon Prime 30 day trial</li>
      <li>but it really makes a difference.  </li>
      <li>I brought it 2 month ago and it really worked for my skins.</li>
      <li>and so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s really doing anything.</li>
      <li>thanks a lot</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is as wide as most of the others &amp; just doesn&#x27;t get the job done, by comparison.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>your skin really absorbs it.</li>
      <li>The needles don&#x27;t seem to penetrate the skin very well.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I really believe my skin has improved.</li>
      <li>My&lt;br /&gt;face feels like it&#x27;s a little sunburnt, but looks good next day.  </li>
      <li>Some needles are longer than others and when I roll it it makes such a loud squeaking sound.</li>
      <li>Luckily I went to bed shortly after using the device</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I have a notably high pain tolerance.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Okay, you get excited when you read all the reviews, but faced with the product in your hand, can you really roll all those needles over your face? It hurt, so I stopped doing it almost right away. Now it&#x27;s rusting in my cupboard. It might be great for people who are into tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the length of the roller makes it difficult to get around the contours of your face. This product would be easier to use on a scar someplace relatively flat and not so sensitive, like on your thigh. As it is, I didnt use it long enough to know if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was well made, well packaged and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This microneedling is just not for me.  Too painful and uncomfortable.  I probably have 4 rollers now but never use them, everybody raves about it.  Sorry I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Very impressed with the prompt delivery and quality of the product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, just little nips to the skin.  Very similar to laser treatments.  My&lt;br /&gt;face feels like it&#x27;s a little sunburnt, but looks good next day.  Use at night, not&lt;br /&gt;in the morning.</li>
    <li> Right out of the package this roller had at least two bent needles and the needles are rather dull.  Other than that the construction is pretty solid but of course it&#x27;s not meant to last forever.  The needles don&#x27;t seem to penetrate the skin very well.  I&#x27;ve used it once to roll my face and I won&#x27;t return it because it seems like it does an okay job for micro needling but I certainly won&#x27;t purchase from this brand of micro needler again.</li>
    <li> This was my first roller. It works pretty well. I think the needles seemed to dull after a couple of uses, but these were made to be replaceable. I plan on getting the .25 for nightly use. I noticed that when I use this before bed and apply retin a, my face is very dry in the morning. The retin a gets absorbed so much better! I also plan on getting a larger one for body.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times but I do notice a little difference in my skin already. I&#x27;m hoping for even better results with continued use but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I have only used it once, but I was very impressed with the packaging and the item itself. VERY sharp little needles and comes with information on how to use it.</li>
    <li> It is helping to reduce my fine lines and the parentheses lines on either side of my mouth. I use the derma roller then apply Hyaluronic acid to my face. I have noticed an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;After my first use of he Derma Roller my face looked sunburned, and felt tight and then very itchy. It also does hurt a bit to use it, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable. Luckily I went to bed shortly after using the device so I didn&#x27;t notice the itching once I was asleep. But before that the itching was quite bad. Also, my face was too red to go in public so I recommend using it at night. By morning my face was only slightly red and the itching was gone. I use this once a week on my whole face and then halfway through the week I use it lightly on just my problem areas. My skin isn&#x27;t as itchy now that it is used to the derma roller.</li>
    <li> I do see a difference in stretch marks and age marks on my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my chest and breasts for stretch marks and age marks.  I use in conjunction with Bio Oil.  I am noticing a difference, albeit a slow one.  I use it every other week since I don&#x27;t want to do any damage.  I&#x27;ve done it 3x (6weeks) and I will continue!  Recently upgraded to the 1.5 size and I like it better for this purpose.  DO NOT use this size on your face!  I bought a .5 to use on my forehead for lines/melasma.</li>
    <li> I have acne scar on my face and at first I was a little afraid to apply on my face, after all it is NEEDLE. I asked the customer service on line for how to correctly use, customer service replied me very quickly and advise me to review teaching videos on website. Moreover, they contact me to get my usage feedback later. This is a good buying experience, and I would like to use consistently.</li>
    <li> I brought it 2 month ago and it really worked for my skins. After 2 months using this derma roller, I found my large pores being smaller than before, now I totally love this product! I am 35 and I used to worry about my large pores, especially the large pores in my cheek area, and at the beginning when I received this derma roller, I was a little scared of using those needles to cure your skin, I couldn&#x27;t believe that anyone would want to use this on their face,  thinking it was going to be painful. But after two months&#x27; attempt, I found this is really a good way to take care of my skin. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> worked really great! you&#x27;ll see from the first time of using.</li>
    <li> I tested this on my chin, and was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis on the chin a few days later.... I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a direct causation..or just simply coincident, has this happened to anyone? Thanks</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t start using right away, so I just tried this little beauty tool on yesterday and so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s really doing anything. I will say that using this tool wasn&#x27;t as scary as I had imagined. Once I got over my initial fear it was really okay. It appears to be pretty good quality and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it, so I do highly recommend this one. I received this item extremely fast using Amazon Prime 30 day trial and I like that, so I am thinking about trying it for at least one year. Thank you MelodySusie and Amazon.</li>
    <li> the roller leaves red little pin holes and squeeks when I use it, so I only use it on places where it wont show till it heels.</li>
    <li> The product works just as described. It is slightly uncomfortable to use but I will continue to use it to see if I see any results. I have only used it a few times and have not seen results yet.</li>
    <li> Great derma rollers, no bend needles and LOVE that it is surgical stainless steel! I would recommend these for sure!</li>
    <li> I have used this solidly for a month now along with a vitamin c serum (the same I&#x27;ve used for years, Mychelle).  The only difference I am seeing in my skin is more acne.  A LOT more acne :(  And clearly concentrated in the areas I&#x27;m focusing on when derma rolling - my lip area and cheekbones.  Suddenly I am getting big angry red zits - something I&#x27;ve never really had.  The only thing I&#x27;ve changed is adding this derma roller to my skin care routine.  And yes, I am sanitizing it each time I use it by dipping in alcohol and I do keep it in it&#x27;s case and no, no one else has used it.  I do not use it on my break outs, so I am not spreading oil.  I wash my face prior to using it and wash it again after before applying the serum.  I have used it by the book and now have about 5-7 big red zits on my cheeks, above my lip, and on my chin.  I personally do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Upon inspection of the derma roller I noticed that the needles are not even. Also the derma roller I received is not the roller that&#x27;s pictured. I received my roller today and the needles are bent and they are scratching my skin as I roll and I just rolled today for the first time. I am totally disappointed with this vendor. I would not recommend this roller from this vendor, as I believe derma rollers work over time, Derma rollers that are of great quality that is.</li>
    <li> I have bought both 540 and 192 microneedle. 540 microneedle&#x27;s density is higher than 192 mirconeedle&#x27;s. Both 540 and 192 has different needle length. The longer the needle, the deeper it penetrates. Personally, I highly prefer 540 microneedle with 0.5mm and I have used it for more than 3 months, it has some change now, hope can see big change with long time usage. Suggest: on sensitive area, like eyes, suggest you can use smallest needle. Remember use it gently and carefully.</li>
    <li> This is my first dermaroller. I got the 0.5mm one and it isn&#x27;t particularly painful. The derma roller is most effective when applying your strongest night creams (retinol, Retin A, salicylic acid, etc.). You can feel a stronger peel the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The needles and case are very good quality. I wish the handle was a bit sturdier and of better quality. If you roll it in a funny direction, it squeaks in a way that is hard to bear after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, this isn&#x27;t rocket science. If you rub your skin a lot, it puffs up. You&#x27;re essentially trying to puff up your skin so that it looks smoother. Whether this has negative long-term effects, no one really knows. Don&#x27;t let them fool you with all the &amp;#34;research&amp;#34;. From my dermatologist&#x27;s perspective, this is something that should be used sparingly to help remove the top layer of skin, along with peel products. Otherwise, you would be peeling and rubbing your skin every day.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just the right size for the face. Arrived quickly and a good price. It has a clear case to keep it in.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and this does work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok and i havent noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Is a good experience when you use this product</li>
    <li> It seems cruel to roll your face with small needles but it really makes a difference.  I bought the .5 and 1.0 and mostly use the .5.  It does hurt a little and leaves your skin feeling like a light sunburn, but it works.  I use a 20% C-serum after.  I like this product beacyse the price is also right.  I have seen companies trying to sell something similar with a night treatment for $200 and can use this and my serum for $32.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  I&#x27;m still a newbie to derma-rolling.</li>
    <li> 2/25/14&lt;br /&gt;This arrived exactly as pictured and in perfect condition. I sterilized it with boiling water and rubbing alcohol before and after my first use. So far I have only used it once. I have the 0.5 mm, which I&#x27;ve heard is the minimum you need to make an impact on your skin. I was a bit startled by the sensation at first but was only in pain for maybe 30 seconds (and that very mild pain) before I adjusted to the feeling. It just feels a bit uncomfortable after that but nothing too horrible, and I wouldn&#x27;t say I have a notably high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see some results (probably will use it 4-5x weekly) and will update as time goes on. Just some caution--make sure you sterilize the roller carefully, and if you put anything on your face after make sure it is mostly natural or at least unscented because otherwise you could really irritate your skin!</li>
    <li> It works great, although it could be a little bigger. After one try, my stretchmarks lightened and my pores cleared.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2OCTP32DZ9F4J]]This product is excellent. The reason for my high rating is that it WORKS. I have been used this for couple weeks and I already noticing a difference which is amazing! See my video for details.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this needle roller I thought it was one of the craziest things I ever saw to use on your skin! I couldn&#x27;t believe that anyone would want to use this on their face and that it would do anything! Then I saw hundreds of positive reviews and started to research it. I decided to try it and I am convinced! It works! I&#x27;ve used it a couple weeks, every other day and I already see an improvement in my skin! I have oily, acne prone skin and at 48, I feel like things are starting to droop. The first thing I noticed was that my skin looked more lifted! Love it! It is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like I thought it would. I was scared to use it the first time, thinking it was going to be painful. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it doesn&#x27;t feel good, but its not painful. Some areas are worse than others of course. I would start with a short needle, and I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday, your skin needs time to heal. I think its a good idea to use a good serum after your done needling. your skin really absorbs it. I use an organic vitamin C serum. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice, perfect for my skin...,on time, and everything perfect,I would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;I was what I spect...thanks a lot</li>
    <li> It arrived on time,  and in a neatly fashion.  The dermaroller came in a convenient plastic case.  It is easy to use. I use it 2 times a week.  I use it with another much larger dermarolling needle.  My frown lines are almost completely gone.  My face is smooth and soft. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have only been using off and on for about a month, but already one big expression line on my forehead is nearly gone. I&#x27;m using it with retinal and collagen creams. I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Please be careful with these! One I received was in ok shape but the next was terrible! Bent and uneven needles apon opening! You can really do a lot of damage to your face if the needles aren&#x27;t at an equal height and bent needles will scratch and gouge you! Inspect carefully. If you do get a proper derma roller the results are amazing! Roll responsibly ;)</li>
    <li> No, this is James&#x27;s wife...Ha Ha  Yes, it does hurt.  You can use over the counter topical numbing cream.  Just wash your face before you use the roller.  I have used acne prescriptions for years.  I use them now when I am using the roller; the roller allows the meds and the creams to go into the skin.  DO NOT USE IT MORE THAN ONCE A MOTH OR SO. YOU WILL DO MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD.  I put it on my calendar to remind me once a month.  It has significantly reduced my acne scars and has made my deep wrinkles not so deep!  I have used it for 3 months now and I already have that type of result.  Glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I used it for about 10 days my friend notices small bumps all over my face and I stop using it have .but hey not gone away</li>
    <li> I watch the video on you tube before buying and I saw the great reviews so I decided to buy one and see if I could get any results and to my amazement I love it!! I use it first then I use my derma wand  and I see wonderful results in my face and neck.my wrinkles are disappearing in front of my eyes!!</li>
    <li> Needles are too sharp. Hurts me when I Pass through my face... I def see the difference. I haven&#x27;t used it much since the needles are too sharp</li>
    <li> Felt a bit flimsy.  I thought it&#x27;d be less wide due to less needles &amp; being 0.5---( a good option to use around my eyes, I thought)&lt;br /&gt;It is as wide as most of the others &amp; just doesn&#x27;t get the job done, by comparison.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased..No matter how many positive reviews, I was still hesitant. The idea of needles rolling across my face was off putting. However, I went ahead &amp; purchased this MS/ .5 model &amp; used as directed. Youtubed video of others who use it..&lt;br /&gt;1st time, it felt funny &amp; my face was a bit red for 20min.. I didn&#x27;t think the needles were painful. I also used a &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; moisturizing cream after (more natural ingredient product) eventually the redness went away. But after a 2nd, 3rd time &amp; so on.. a couple days a week for a month, I noticed a change &amp; I really believe my skin has improved. I love anti aging serums, collagen elastin, and hyaluronic acid- stuff that is unlikely to burn, sting or irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt; After a while, the needles actually become therapeutic once you adapt &amp; the redness quickly goes away after using it a few times. So, I rarely need the soothing cream now. But sticking with serums, collagen, etc...I like MelodySusie. Maybe it&#x27;s not for all, maybe it takes time to see results. Still, I like it. I see purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Have had it for a month ..Used it on stretch marks, face, arms ( where i have some discoloration). nothing yet, but no damage either. Which is important!!!  I figure in a few months ill know if its working or not.  It needs time to make changes to damaged skin.  I&#x27;m hoping!!!!</li>
    <li> Some needles are longer than others and when I roll it it makes such a loud squeaking sound. I had high hope for this ):</li>
    <li> Just purchased it an i&#x27;ve used it three times so far. A i derma-roll my skin, i apply a 20% vitamin C serum and it helps a lot for my acne and acne scars. Face looks much brighter and smoother. I also apply argon oil the next day, makes my skin feel smoother. The acne marks seems to have subsided but let&#x27;s see how it works in the long run. Would recommend this to people who suffer from scars, acne and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased another one for my scalp too. Heard that it rejuvenates falling hair.</li>
    <li> This hurts to do but it also works. Follow instruction use the smaller needle on the face. Finer is better on the face.</li>
    <li> This derma roller does not hurt; it only tingles a bit. I have also had a little burning sensation after use on my legs (not face) that lasts a few minutes.  I bought the 1.5mm for my legs and the 0.5mm for my face. I use them most nights before I go to bed. The cellulite on my legs has deminished some after several uses. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference on my face, but I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with. I do feel refreshed after using it on my face.</li>
    <li> First time using this item. A good quality product followed as instructed. Too early to see results. Will experience some discomfort if used properly.</li>
