I&#x27;m not sure what to say I expected more of a nicer smell!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this about an hour ago and when I opened it the packaging seemed a bit suspect. I sprayed it and let me just say DAMN! It&#x27;s not that it a strong fragrance, but one or two shots is all I needed! I&#x27;ll write another review later after I&#x27;ve seen how long the scent lasts. But all in all I&#x27;m completely loving the smell.</li>
    <li> This smells good and last for a good while (not all day). If you are curious, for the price you could try it. I could recommend it. It&#x27;s a cheap alternative to perfume. The scent is not overpowering and it can get you some compliments</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift for my daughter that was out of stock in stores, she will love it!</li>
    <li> The body spray is subtle and nice. The smell is lasting for the entire day. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> had a strong alcohol like smell.  It smelled really cheaply made.  Very very dissapointed the other review made me excited to try it and wish I hadn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Excellent service, good product.</li>
    <li> Smells like a public restroom!  Gross... Don&#x27;t buy this I bought it for my sister and it was very cheap the kim kardashian scratches off the plastic bottle!</li>
    <li> Lasts for no more than 10 minutes</li>
    <li> I LOVED this body mist. When I opened it I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the scent. My friend and I both loved it so I just ended up giving her the one I had just bought and went bought one from here because it was sold out in stores. The smells does not last all day but it does last for a long time. I would really recommend. Planning on buying it for a present for someone else.</li>
    <li> Lovely body spray. .. would recommend to anyone.</li>
