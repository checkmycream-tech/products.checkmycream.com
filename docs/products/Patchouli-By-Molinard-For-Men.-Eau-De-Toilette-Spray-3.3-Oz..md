      <li>I love the smell of sandalwood and dirt.</li>
      <li>As others have indicated, it gets better the longer</li>

      <li>A favorite If you like Patchouli.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a scent that gets better the longer you wear it.  </li>
      <li>My favorite scent for my boyfriend.</li>

      <li>; wanted to wear the scent I find most appealing s</li>
      <li>My sons favorite cologne - asked for it every Christmas</li>
      <li>I love Patchoulie-</li>
      <li>Old hippy that smells good!</li>
      <li>Exactly as expected ... Great!</li>
      <li>It is way too strong.</li>
      <li>Light fragrance with a hint of patchouli.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the gifter!!!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I love Patchouli and have never found anything comparable to Evelyn &amp; Crabtree (they stopped making it) and this certainly doesn&#x27;t either.  </li>
      <li>Great scent - everything I expected from Molinard</li>
      <li>I ordered this thinking it would be JUST patchouli, but it is not, it is a blend with sweet, but not overpowering overtones.</li>
      <li>Back in the day, I loved a Patchouli fragrance.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick.</li>
      <li>Nice, clean scent of traditional patchouli--enough but not overpowering</li>
      <li>I realize this liking of certain scents is purely subjective, but this sure does it for me.  </li>
      <li>Like all patchouli, you can overdo it, so start with a little and work up to the perfect amount for you so that you only get an occasional whiff and everyone else is complementing you on how good you smell.</li>
      <li>fades pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Smells very good and is long lasting.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something that smelled more youthful, such as Jovan Fresh Patchouli did...</li>
      <li>I do like very much the way it smells on my husband, but if you want just the scent of patchouli, then this is not that.</li>
      <li>Does not have patchouli smell, is very strong and smells like cheap old ladies toilet water, Lingering - Over Powering</li>
      <li>My dad loves the smell of patchouli and this was the first time trying this product</li>
      <li>Will certainly shop here again.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a certain aroma</li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>I have had it on for a couple hours now and it smells too much like Tabu...</li>
      <li>the only place fit for it was my trash can.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely will not buy again.</li>
      <li>Not made for a man.&lt;br /&gt;Smells to much like Baby Powder and something Old.</li>
      <li>A classic, that doesn&#x27;t smell like turpentine like so many other patchouli products.</li>
      <li>this is not it-smells Nothing like it-the good news is the odor (smells like mashed pinto beans and onions which have been left in a pan for a few days)</li>
      <li>This is a decent substitute.</li>
      <li>I was excited to read the positive reviews here (and other sites too)</li>
      <li>But next time I might try the intense version.</li>
      <li>Wouldnt Buy Again Smells Like Old Grannys Perfume</li>
      <li>Reminds me of how old ladies smell in church.</li>
      <li>Reconnected me with my youth of the early 70s</li>
      <li>It is by far one of the cheapest smelling colognes I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Little too sweet of a fragrance</li>
      <li>I thought this would smell a little like Jovan Patchouli,this is too strong,  save your money and buy Esteban Patchouli or L&#x27;Artisan Patchouli, these are more like Jovan&#x27;s but expensive, its all what you like and what you want to pay for.</li>

<li> WHAT A HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY !!!</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> this stuff is terrible....</li>
<li> This smells horrible.  </li>
<li> Awful scent &amp; cannot tell there is any Patchouli in it!</li>
<li> It is horrible.</li>

    <li> While it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it definitely does not smell like patchouli, so I am very disappointed. My son liked it, so I gave it to him. I absolutely will not buy again. A rip-off is a rip-off!</li>
    <li> ..and smells nothing like patchouli. I would have gave it zero stars actually. Reminds me of how old ladies smell in church. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s a scent that gets better the longer you wear it.  Even my husband, who doesn&#x27;t like perfume or cologne, likes this when I wear it.  Like all patchouli, you can overdo it, so start with a little and work up to the perfect amount for you so that you only get an occasional whiff and everyone else is complementing you on how good you smell.</li>
    <li> I love Patchoulie-this is not it-smells Nothing like it-the good news is the odor (smells like mashed pinto beans and onions which have been left in a pan for a few days) fades pretty quickly.  Stuck with two bottles I have to dispose of (1 star is way, way too generous a rating)</li>
    <li> I will never buy a scent online again! Awful scent &amp; cannot tell there is any Patchouli in it! Save your money!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son for Christmas, and he was VERY pleased.  I was so glad it met my expectations.  Will certainly shop here again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great scent - everything I expected from Molinard</li>
    <li> A favorite If you like Patchouli. Great value</li>
    <li> I was hoping for something that smelled more youthful, such as Jovan Fresh Patchouli did...I say did because they don&#x27;t make it anymore!!!  I have had it on for a couple hours now and it smells too much like Tabu...and we all know the stigma that goes with that scent!  I may be in my mid-forties, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like I am in my mid-seventies!    If you like Tabu, you will love this.  Me?  Not so much.  I wish I could send it back but, unfortunately, the return policy doesn&#x27;t agree!</li>
    <li> My favorite. Sorry all you who don&#x27;t like Patchouli!</li>
    <li> this stuff is terrible....I actually tried it once and found it horrible.  I wanted to wait a couple of days, and I tried it again.  My gosh....the only place fit for it was my trash can.  I am sorry I wasted my money</li>
    <li> People like giving me hugs now. Old hippy that smells good!</li>
    <li> Love it on the hubby!</li>
    <li> This product does not smell like Patchouli, its smells like lysol aerosol spray. It is by far one of the cheapest smelling colognes I have ever had. I would not recommend this, and it is definitely not worth the cost. It does not like last a quality cologne does, and wears off within an hour or two. This is something that you would expect to find at an outlet, or dollar store.</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell a little like Jovan Patchouli,this is too strong,  save your money and buy Esteban Patchouli or L&#x27;Artisan Patchouli, these are more like Jovan&#x27;s but expensive, its all what you like and what you want to pay for.</li>
    <li> Back in the day, I loved a Patchouli fragrance. I was excited to read the positive reviews here (and other sites too) so I order this. Great move on my part! As others have indicated, it gets better the longer you have it on. Changes from the initial smell to a subtle alluring fragrance after a while. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> Nice, clean scent of traditional patchouli--enough but not overpowering</li>
    <li> What a wonderful smell!</li>
    <li> Not So Whatever Smells Like Patchouli...Very Dissappointed :( Wouldnt Buy Again Smells Like Old Grannys Perfume And Cant Get The Smell Gone!!!</li>
    <li> Light fragrance with a hint of patchouli. Nice blend.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli at all. It smells like what my nanny wore back in the 60&#x27;s. When I smell Patchouli I want to smell the woodstock scent. Hippy like scent. Not Nanny smell.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This did NOT smell like how I believe Patchouli should smell. Disappointed. I would not recommend it. Invest your money in something else.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful warm patchouli fragrance created and on the market now.  It lasts amd lasts, I receive compliments all the time, I&#x27;ve been stopped while out and about and people will ask \\&quot;What fragrance are you wearing\\&quot;?</li>
    <li> very solid product- happy with item would recommend product , have like product and happy it matches. would order again</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would be a lasting / holding scent for daytime use. I have found it quite satisfactory and lasting to me it has a nice patchouli scent,and have received compliments while wearing it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re seeking the one and only scent of Patchouli, keep looking. This is NOT it. I would describe this ill-named cologne as such: they took some grandma&#x27;s Avon surplus from 1972 and stirred in some thrift store incense. It is horrible. Period.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Shipped quick. Wife loves the scent on me. Hippie but manly. Def reccomend to someone a either a gift or for themselves</li>
    <li> Not overwhelming. I loved Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s Patchouli fragrance- which is not available anymore&lt;br /&gt;. This is a decent substitute.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a certain aroma and I think it comes in an oil. This product is still a good&lt;br /&gt;aroma I like it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected ... Great!</li>
    <li> Continue to buy and have sold others to buy it.</li>
    <li> Real happy with it it smells great and then backs off  A bit as not to overpower the room.  Reconnected me with my youth of the early 70s</li>
    <li> I love Patchouli and have never found anything comparable to Evelyn &amp; Crabtree (they stopped making it) and this certainly doesn&#x27;t either.  This smells horrible.  It is way too strong.</li>
    <li> Smells very good and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> My son has used this product for years.  So of course, when he received a bottle from me for Christmas, he was thrilled.  Also, I gave one to my husband who had never used it and he is really really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like patchouli, smelled like my grandma&#x27;s purse.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent for my boyfriend. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great sprayable Patchouli</li>
    <li> Little too sweet of a fragrance but I recommend.</li>
    <li> It is too concentrated, the dilution of smell proceeds longer than it should, this suggests reduction of the patchouli flowers to be used at the beginning...</li>
    <li> I like the smell of Patchouli, but this one is differently! Not made for a man.&lt;br /&gt;Smells to much like Baby Powder and something Old.</li>
    <li> Love it!  But next time I might try the intense version.</li>
    <li> Does not have patchouli smell, is very strong and smells like cheap old ladies toilet water, Lingering - Over Powering -Obnoxiuos</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!  It has just a hint of patchouli mixed into a lasting, musky scent.  I realize this liking of certain scents is purely subjective, but this sure does it for me.  Thanks to the gifter!!!</li>
    <li> My dad loved it! My dad loves the smell of patchouli and this was the first time trying this product and he loved it!</li>
    <li> A classic, that doesn&#x27;t smell like turpentine like so many other patchouli products. Thx I will order again.</li>
    <li> It was just what I expected and I am totally satisfied,I even bought another bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife for her Birthday.  She has been a Patchouli wearer for over 20 years.  THIS DOES NOT SMELL LIKE PATCHOULI.  In fact, once you spray it on, wait 5 minutes, THERE IS NO SMELL AT ALL !!!  WHAT A HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY !!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of sandalwood and dirt. Though I know this isn&#x27;t either, truly, it smells close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fianc&amp;eacute; wanted to wear the scent I find most appealing s</li>
    <li> Very little, if any, smell of patchouli.</li>
    <li> My sons favorite cologne - asked for it every Christmas</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Patchouli</li>
</ol>
