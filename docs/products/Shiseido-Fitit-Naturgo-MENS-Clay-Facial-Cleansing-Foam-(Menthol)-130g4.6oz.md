<li> Very concentrated, you need very little.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t care for all the feminine face cleaner stuff that tries to not dry out your face.</li>
<li> found it weired that sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look for the whole line of a specific Shiseido product from one single seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Does leave face feeling a bit dry, but putting lotion on afterward helps.  </li>
<li> This leaves my forehead a bit dry.</li>
<li> My boyfriend got this from a visit to japan and it actually cleared his face in just a few uses.</li>
<li> Like other reviews suggests, you should use this every other day or so as it is an exfoliate wash.  </li>
<li> but I will be looking at other products from this company.</li>
<li> You should use it like once every other day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit drying, so you&#x27;ll want to take a &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; at least once or twice a week if your skin is naturally dry.</li>
<li> Works extremely well, i usually lather my face and let it sit on for about 10-15 mins.</li>
<li> There was a cooling sensation after I took a towel and dried it off with small dabs.</li>
<li> you hardly need to use any.</li>
<li> It will Dry out your lips and hands, almost painfully.</li>

    <li> fantastic product, deeply cleans.</li>

    <li> I like this product!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff vs what I typically bought at the store (nivea, suace, etc). Leave it on long enough and you can feel it &#x27;working&#x27; deep down, which always leaves my face feeling fresh. It doesn&#x27;t fry out my skin either, but I use an aftershave lotion anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for the ladies**My girlfriend used it recently and loved it! It took off all of her makeup which she is always using different products.</li>
    <li> Im hooked! Leaves my face so clean and dirt free. I used with my claraSonic</li>
    <li> The face wash is definitely refreshing and I have seen a big difference even after using it daily for just one week. It is not expensive like many other brands, and most importantly, it works! I love it!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years.  Was excited to find it on Amazon. Excellent product, leaves face feeling clean, cool, and fresh.  Smells great. It doesn&#x27;t take much of it to lather up to cover face (maybe dime size).  Would suggest wetting face, working product in hands to lather up a bit then apply to face.  Like other reviews suggests, you should use this every other day or so as it is an exfoliate wash.  Does leave face feeling a bit dry, but putting lotion on afterward helps.  Overall it is one of the best face wash I have used.</li>

    <li> If you are not sure about your skin type or what kind of products can change your skin a little bit, choose Shiseido is always a good idea. I am a big fan of Shiseido product, from shampoo to facial masks, from pore minimizing cream to moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it weired that sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look for the whole line of a specific Shiseido product from one single seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash mud is quite nice to men. I feel very much clean after wash and it feels all the oily stuff is gone from skin. I am using it repeatedly, although you should aware that it has exfoliating scrub. You should use it like once every other day. I would suggest to have another milky face wash on the side and use them interchangeably.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, thanks a lot!</li>

    <li> Next to using African Black Soap, I enjoy using the Naturgo Clay Wash because after washing my face with it (wetting face, applying face wash, letting it sit for a bit and then rinsing) made my face feel cool and as if it were &amp;#34;breathing&amp;#34;! There was a cooling sensation after I took a towel and dried it off with small dabs. I felt as if this face wash opened up my pores to let it breath. It has a nice fragrance and unique look, sort of feels like a scrub, but it feels really good! Will be buying more often!</li>
    <li> Like othet reviews, this product works great. I use this twice a day and feel clean after using it.</li>
    <li> loving the texture of this face wash! will buy again/</li>
